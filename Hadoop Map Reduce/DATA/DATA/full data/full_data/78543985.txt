advisable to announce that the present edition of the biglow papers is issued with the express sanction of the author granted by letter from which the following is an extract                                  cambridge massachusetts                                            14th september 1859      i think it would be well for you to announce that you are to     publish an authorized edition of the biglow papers for i have     just received a letter from mr  who tells me that a mr      was thinking of an edition and wished him to edit it any such     undertaking will be entirely against my will and i take it for     granted that mr  only formed the plan in ignorance of your     intention                             with many thanks very truly yours                                                     j r lowell     english editors preface   i can safely say that few things in my life have pleased me more than the request of messrs trübner backed by the expressed wish of the author that i would see the first english edition of the biglow papers through the press i fell in with the papers about ten years ago soon after their publication and the impression they then made on me has been deepening and becoming more lively ever since in fact i do not think that even in his own new england mr lowell can have a more constant or more grateful reader though i cannot say that i go much beyond most of my own intimate friends over here in my love for his works i may remark in passing that the impossibility of keeping a copy of the biglow papers for more than a few weeks of which many of us have had repeated and sorrowful proof1 shows how much an english edition is needed  perhaps strictly speaking i should say a reprint and not an edition in fact i am not clear in spite of the wishes of author and publishers that i have any right to call myself editor for the book is as thoroughly edited already as a book need be what between dear old parson wilburwith his little vanities and pedantries his infinite faculty of sermonizing his simplicity and humour and his deep and righteous views of life and power of hard hitting when he has anything to say which needs driving homeand father ezekiel the brown parchmenthided old man of the geoponic or bucolic species 76 year old cum next tater diggin and thair aint nowheres a kitting we readily believe spryer n he be and that judicious and lazy subeditor columbus nye pastor of a church in bungtown corner whose acquaintance we make so thoroughly in the ten lines which he contributeswhatever of setting or framing was needed or indeed possible for the nine gems in verse of mr hosea biglow has been so well done already in america by the hand best fitted for the task that he must be a bold man who would meddle with the book now in the editing way even the humble satisfaction of adding a glossary and index has been denied to me as there are already very good ones i have merely added some halfdozen words to the glossary at which i thought that english readers might perhaps stumble when the proposal was first made to me indeed i thought of trying my hand at a sketch of american politics of thirteen years ago the date of the mexican war and of the first appearance of the biglow papers but i soon found out first that i was not and had no ready means of making myself competent for such a task secondly that the book did not need it the very slight knowledge which every educated englishman has of transatlantic politics will be quite enough to make him enjoy the racy smack of the american soil which is one of their great charms and as to the particular characters they are most truly citizens of the world as well as americans if an englishman cannot find birdofreedom sawins john p robinsons pious editors and candidates facin southbynorth at homeay and if he is not conscious of his own individual propensity to the meannesses and duplicities of such which come under the lash of hoseahe knows little of the land we live in or of his own heart and is not worthy to read the biglow papers  instead therefore of any attempt of my own i will give mr lowells own account of how and why he came to write this book all i can say is he writes the book was thar how it came is more than i can tell i cannot like the great göthe deliberately imagine what would have been a proper entstehungsweise for my book and then assume it as fact i only know that i believed our war with mexico though we had as just ground for it as a strong nation ever had against a weak one to be essentially a war of false pretences and that it would result in widening the boundaries and so prolonging the life of slavery believing that it is the manifest destiny of the english race to occupy this whole continent and to display there that practical understanding in matters of government and colonization which no other race has given such proofs of possessing since the romans i hated to see a noble hope evaporated into a lying phrase to sweeten the foul breath of demagogues leaving the sin of it to god i believed and still believe that slavery is the achillesheel of our own polity that it is a temporary and false supremacy of the white races sure to destroy that supremacy at last because an enslaved people always prove themselves of more enduring fibre than their enslavers as not suffering from the social vices sure to be engendered by oppression in the governing class against these and many other things i thought all honest men should protest i was born and bred in the country and the dialect was homely to me i tried my first biglow paper in a newspaper and found that it had a great run so i wrote the others from time to time during the year which followed always very rapidly and sometimes as with what mr robinson thinks at one sitting when i came to collect them and publish them in a volume i conceived my parsoneditor with his pedantry and verbosity his amiable vanity and superiority to the verses he was editing as a fitting artistic background and foil he gave me the chance too of glancing obliquely at many things which were beyond the horizon of my other characters  there are two american books elder brethren of the biglow papers which it would be unjust in an englishman not to mention while introducing their big younger brother to his own countrymeni mean of course major downings letters and sam slick both of which are full of rare humour and treat of the most exciting political questions of their day in a method and from points of view of which we are often reminded while reading the biglow papers in fact mr lowell borrows his name from the majors letterszekel bigelow broker and banker of wall street new york is the friend who corrects the spelling and certifies to the genuineness of the honest majors effusions2 and is one of the raciest characters in the book no one i am sure would be so ready as mr lowell to acknowledge whatever obligations he may have to other men and no one can do it more safely for though he may owe a name or an idea to others he seems to me to stand quite alone amongst americans and to be the only one who is beyond question entitled to take his place in the first rank by the side of the great political satirists of ancient and modern europe  greece had her aristophanes rome her juvenal spain has had her cervantes france her rabelais her molière her voltaire germany her jean paul her heine england her swift her thackeray and america has her lowell by the side of all those great masters of satire though kept somewhat in the rear by provincialism of style and subject the author of the biglow papers holds his own place distinct from each and all the man who reads the book for the first time and is capable of understanding it has received a new sensation in lowell the american mind has for the first time flowered out into thoroughly original genius  there is an airy grace about the best pieces of washington irving which has no parallel amongst english writers however closely modelled may be his style upon that of the addisonian age there is much original power which will perhaps be better appreciated at a future day about fenimore coopers delineations of the physical and spiritual borderland between white and red between civilization and savagery there is dramatic power of a high order about mr hawthorne though mixed with a certain morbidness and bad taste which debar him from ever attaining to the first rank there is an originality of position about mr emerson in his resolute setting up of king self against king mob which coupled with a singular metallic glitter of style and plenty of shrewd new england motherwit have made up together one of the best counterfeits of genius that has been seen for many a day so good indeed that most men are taken by it for the first quarter of an hour at the least but for real unmistakable geniusfor that glorious fulness of power which knocks a man down at a blow for sheer admiration and then makes him rush into the arms of the knockerdown and swear eternal friendship with him for sheer delight the biglow papers stand alone  if i sought to describe their characteristics i should say the most exuberant and extravagant humour coupled with strong noble christian purposea thorough scorn for all that is false and base all the more withering because of the thorough geniality of the writer perhaps jean paul is of all the satirists i have named the one who at bottom presents most affinity with lowell but the differences are marked the intellectual sphere of the german is vaster but though with certain aims before him he rather floats and tumbles about like a porpoise at play than follows any direct perceptible course with lowell on the contrary every word tells every laugh is a blow as if the god momus had turned out as mars and were hard at work fighting every inch of him grinning his broadest all the while  will some english readers be shocked by this combination of broad and keen humour with high christian purposethe association of humour and christianity i hope not at any rate i would remind any such of luther and of our own latimer and rowland hill are they prepared to condemn them and many more like them nay though it is a question which can only be hinted at here does not the bible itself sanction the combination by its own example is there not humour mixed with the tremendous sarcasm of the old prophetsdread humour no doubt but humour unmistakablywherever they speak of the helplessness of idols as in the fortyfourth and fortysixth chapters of isaiah and in elijahs mockery of the priests of baalcry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is on a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awakened is not the book of proverbs full of grave dry pungent humour consider only the following passage out of many of the same spirit as the door turneth upon his hinges so doth the slothful upon his bed the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not to him is like one that taketh a dog by the earsprov xxvi 1417  or if it be objected that these things belong to an earlier covenant that laughter and jesting are not convenient under the gospel of him who came not to destroy the law but to fulfil it there is perhaps an answer to this also  for a specimen of subdued humour in narrative adhering in the most literal manner to facts and yet contriving to bring them out by that graphic literalness under their most ludicrous aspect what can equal st lukes description of the riot at ephesus the picture of the narrow trade selfishness of demetriusof polytheism reduced into a matter of businessof the inanity of a mob tumult in an enslaved countryof the mixed coaxing and bullying of its officials was surely never brought out with a more latter vice indeed includes both the others or rather uses them as its instruments thus the pious editor proclaims as his creed      i du believe in freedoms cause       ez fur away ez paris is     i love to see her stick her claws       in them infarnal pharisees      its wal enough agin a king       to dror resolves and triggers     but libbatys a kind o thing       thet dont agree with niggers  no doubt they go further than this i am quite aware that mr lowell will be claimed as a champion by the peace party in this country and certainly no keener things have been said against war in general than are to be found in this book  with our own peaceatanyprice party no one has less sympathy than i and this leads me to urge on all english readers to bear in mind that the biglow papers were written for a new england audience by a new englander and must be judged from a new england point of view the citizen of a huge young mammoth country divided by a whole ocean from the nearest enemy that it could fear assailable only on the vivid sense of the absurdity of the whole and gallio cared for none of these things is another touch of quiet humour which at once brings out the ludicrous aspect of the punishment of the jewish agitators by means of the very tumults which they raised  i take it therefore that the exhibition of humour in the pursuit and as an aid for the attainment of a noble christian purpose is a means of action not only sanctioned by the very constitution of our natures in which god has implanted so deeply the sense of the ludicrous surely not that we might root it out but by the very example of holy writ the humour exhibited may be different in degree and in quality the skies of syria are not those of germany or of spain of england whether old or new but the gift in itself is a pure and precious one if lawfully and rightfully used  military braggadocio political and literary humbug and slaveholding are the three great butts at which hosea biglow and parson wilbur shoot at pointblank range and with shafts drawn well to the ear the fringe of its seaboard itself consisting chiefly of unapproachable swamp or barren sand wastes surrounded by weak neighbours or thin wandering hordes only too easy to bully to subdue to eat up from which bands of pirates under the name of liberators swarm forth year after year almost unchecked to neighbouring lands and to which if defeated they only return to be caressed and applauded by their congeners where the getting up of warfevers forms part of the stock in trade of too many of the leading politicians where in particular the grasping at new territories for slave labour by means however foul has become the special and avowed policy of the slavery party the citizen of such a country has a right to tell his countrymen that      taint your eppyletts an feathers       make the thing a grain more right     taint afollerin your bellwethers       will excuse ye in his sight      ef you take a sword an dror it       an go stick a feller thru     guvment aint to answer for it       god ll send the bill to you  and the bravest officer in her majestys service will laugh as heartily as you will i take it my dear reader if you have never heard it before over a picture and a contrast such as the following      parson wilbur sez he never heerd in his life       thet th apostles rigged out in their swallertail coats     an marched round in front of a drum and a fife       to git some on em office an some on em votes                     but john p                     robinson he       sez they didnt know everythin down in juddee  but england is a small and wealthy country whose best defence against a neighbour always likely to become a foe consists in a mere ocean canal where the question i will not say of war but of readiness for war is one of life or deathin which the temptation always so strong to subordinate national honour to what is supposed to be policy is in our day for most statesmen almost irresistible because political influence is so evenly balanced that a peace party of perhaps twenty votes has often the destinies of a ministry in its hands had mr lowell been an englishman no one who knows his writings can believe for a moment that he would have swelled the cry or strengthened the hands of the vain and mischievous clique who amongst us have of late years raised the cry of peace when there is no peace  the same caution will apply to our marked peculiarity of style in the book which may offend at first many persons otherwise most capable of entering into its spirit i mean the constant and so to speak pervading use of scripture language and incidents not only side by side with the most grotesque effusions of humour but as one main element of the ludicrous effects produced this undoubtedly would be as really offensive as it would be untrue from any other point of view perhaps than that of a new englander bred in the country the rural population of new england is still happily for itself tinctured in all its language habits modes of feeling and thought by a strict scriptural trainingout of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh look below the surface and you will see that there is no irreverence whatever beneath hosea biglows daring use of scripture only that perfect love which casteth out fear that the very purpose of the whole book is to set up christs gospel as the standard by which alone all men are to be judged in all their acts we may disagree from him in the conclusions which he draws from scripture of his earnest sincerity in enforcing those conclusions we cannot doubt  it is satisfactory indeed to think that mr lowells shafts have already in a great measure ceased to be required or would have to be aimed now at other bulls eyes the servility of the northern states to the south which twelve years ago so raised his indignation has well nigh ceased to be the vital importance of the slavery question is now thoroughly recognized by the great republican party which i trust is year by year advancing towards an assured victory  for that victory mr lowell has done knightsservice by his other works as well as by the biglow papers i need not do more than refer to these however as they have been published in a cheap form over here and i believe have circulated largely in his other poems he is by no means so equal as in the biglow papers but i cannot help thinking that leaving out of sight altogether his satirical works fifty years hence he will be recognized as the greatest american poet of our day notwithstanding the contemporary judgment which has in england and i believe in america assigned that proud place to his friend and predecessor at harvard college h w longfellow to any reader who has not met with lowells poems and who may be induced to read them after a perusal of the present volume i should recommend the vision of sir launfal a parable stanzas on freedom the present crisis and hunger and cold as specially fit to be read in connexion with the biglow papers it is only by looking at all sides of a man of this mould that you can get a notion of his size and power readers therefore should search out for themselves the exquisite little gems of a lighter kind which lie about in the other poems comprised in the volume i am only indicating those which as it seems to me when taken with the biglow papers give the best idea of the man and what his purpose in life has been and is  i will not think so badly of my countrymen as to suppose for a moment that the biglow papers will not become the intimate friends of all good fellows in england and when we have really made friends with a book we like to know something about our friends father so i shall add the little i know of the history of james russell lowell  he was born in 1819 at cambridge massachusetts so that he is some years younger than our own laureate and we may hope to get out of him many another noble work though we shall get no more biglow papersat least i fear not for the sort of inspiration which finds voice in this way comes i take it only once in a mans life and moreover this is his own conviction in a letter which i received from him as to the present publication he writes friendly people say to me sometimes write us more biglow papers and i have even been simple enough to try only to find that i could not this has helped to persuade me that the book was a genuine growth and not a manufacture and that therefore i had an honest right to be pleased without blushing if people liked it he was educated at harvard college cambridge and in fact has never lived away from his native place he read law but never practised and in 1855 was chosen to succeed longfellow as professor of modern literature in harvard college he has visited europe twice and i am sure that every one who knows his works must join with me in the hearty wish that he may come among us again as soon as possible   footnotes  1 should this meet the eye of any persons who may have forgotten to return american copies of the biglow papers to their respective owners they are requested to forward them to the publishers the strictest secrecy will be preserved and an acknowledgment given in the times if required  2 see the english edition of letters of major downing

                                          131     notices of an independent press   i have observed reader bene or malevolent as it may happen that it is customary to append to the second editions of books and to the second works of authors short sentences commendatory of the first under the title of notices of the press these i have been given to understand are procurable at certain established rates payment being made either in money or advertising patronage by the publisher or by an adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author considering these things with myself and also that such notices are neither intended nor generally believed to convey any real opinions being a purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature and resembling certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal panaceas i conceived that it would be not only more economical to prepare a sufficient number of such myself but also more immediately subservient to the end in view to prefix them to this our primary edition rather than await the contingency of a second when they would seem to be of small utility to delay attaching the bobs until the second attempt at flying the kite would indicate but a slender experience in that useful art neither has it escaped my notice nor failed to afford me matter of reflection that when a circus or a caravan is about to visit jaalam the initial step is to send forward large and highly ornamented bills of performance to be hung in the barroom and the postoffice these having been sufficiently gazed at and beginning to lose their attractiveness except for the flies and truly the boys also in whom i find it impossible to repress even during schoolhours certain oral and telegraphic correspondences concerning the expected show upon some fine morning the band enters in a gailypainted waggon or triumphal chariot and with noisy advertisement by means of brass wood and sheepskin makes the circuit of our startled villagestreets then as the exciting sounds draw nearer and nearer do i desiderate those eyes of aristarchus whose looks were as a breeching to a boy then do i perceive with vain regret of wasted opportunities the advantage of a pancratic or pantechnic education since he is most reverenced by my little subjects who can throw the cleanest summerset or walk most securely upon the revolving cask the story of the pied piper becomes for the first time credible to me albeit confirmed by the hameliners dating their legal instruments from the period of his exit as i behold how those strains without pretence of magical potency bewitch the pupillary legs nor leave to the pedagogic an entire selfcontrol for these reasons lest my kingly prerogative should suffer diminution i prorogue my restless commons whom i also follow into the street chiefly lest some mischief may chance befall them after the manner of such a band i send forward the following notices of domestic manufacture to make brazen proclamation not unconscious of the advantage which will accrue if our little craft cymbula sutilis shall seem to leave port with a clipping breeze and to carry in nautical phrase a bone in her mouth nevertheless i have chosen as being more equitable to prepare some also sufficiently objurgatory that readers of every taste may find a dish to their palate i have modelled them upon actually existing specimens preserved in my own cabinet of natural curiosities one in particular i had copied with tolerable exactness from a notice of one of my own discourses which from its superior tone and appearance of vast experience i concluded to have been written by a man at least three hundred years of age though i recollected no existing instance of such antediluvian longevity nevertheless i afterwards discovered the author to be a young gentleman preparing for the ministry under the direction of one of my brethren in a neighbouring town and whom i had once instinctively corrected in a latin quantity but this i have been forced to omit from its too great lengthh w                                           from the universal littery universe      full of passages which rivet the attention of the reader under a     rustic garb sentiments are conveyed which should be committed to     the memory and engraven on the heart of every moral and social     being we consider this a unique performance we hope to see     it soon introduced into our common schools mr wilbur has     performed his duties as editor with excellent taste and judgment     this is a vein which we hope to see successfully prosecuted we     hail the appearance of this work as a long stride toward the     formation of a purely aboriginal indigenous native and american     literature we rejoice to meet with an author national enough to     break away from the slavish deference too common among us to     english grammar and orthography where all is so good we are at     a loss how to make extracts on the whole we may call it a     volume which no library pretending to entire completeness should     fail to place upon its shelves                                           from the higginbottomopolis snappingturtle      a collection of the merest balderdash and doggerel that it was ever     our bad fortune to lay eyes on the author is a vulgar buffoon and     the editor a talkative tedious old fool we use strong language     but should any of our readers peruse the book from which calamity     heaven preserve them they will find reasons for it thick as the     leaves of vallumbrozer or to use a still more expressive     comparison as the combined heads of author and editor the work is     wretchedly got up we should like to know how much british gold     was pocketed by this libeller of our country and her purest     patriots                                           from the oldfogrumville mentor      we have not had time to do more than glance through this handsomely     printed volume but the name of its respectable editor the rev mr     wilbur of jaalam will afford a sufficient guaranty for the worth     of its contents the paper is white the type clear and the     volume of a convenient and attractive size in reading this     elegantly executed work it has seemed to us that a passage or two     might have been retrenched with advantage and that the general     style of diction was susceptible of a higher polish on the     whole we may safely leave the ungrateful task of criticism to the     reader we will barely suggest that in volumes intended as this     is for the illustration of a provincial dialect and turns of     expression a dash of humour or satire might be thrown in with     advantage the work is admirably got up this work will form     an appropriate ornament to the centretable it is beautifully     printed on paper of an excellent quality                                           from the dekay bulwark      we should be wanting in our duty as the conductor of that tremendous     engine a public press as an american and as a man did we allow     such an opportunity as is presented to us by the biglow papers to     pass by without entering our earnest protest against such attempts     now alas too common at demoralizing the public sentiment under     a wretched mask of stupid drollery slavery war the social glass     and in short all the valuable and timehonoured institutions     justly dear to our common humanity and especially to republicans     are made the butt of coarse and senseless ribaldry by this     lowminded scribbler it is time that the respectable and religious     portion of our community should be aroused to the alarming inroads     of foreign jacobinism sansculottism and infidelity it is a     fearful proof of the widespread nature of this contagion that     these secret stabs at religion and virtue are given from under the     cloak credite posteri of a clergyman it is a mournful     spectacle indeed to the patriot and christian to see liberality and     new ideas falsely so calledthey are as old as eden invading     the sacred precincts of the pulpit on the whole we consider     this volume as one of the first shocking results which we predicted     would spring out of the late french revolution                                           from the bungtown copper and comprehensive tocsin a tryweakly     family journal      altogether an admirable work full of humour boisterous but     delicateof wit withering and scorching yet combined with a     pathos cool as morning dewof satire ponderous as

  consider this as one of the most extraordinary volumes of this or     any age we know of no english author who could have written it it     is a work to which the proud genius of our country

titlepage omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name which not only add greatly to the value of every book but whet and exacerbate the appetite of the reader for not only does he surmise that an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a certain amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of such decorations but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the reputation of such bodies as the s archæol dahom or the acad lit et scient kamtschat i cannot but think that the early editions of shakspeare and milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance but for the barrenness of their respective titlepages and i believe that even now a publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the continenta proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment against socrates when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes and when his memory had acquired a deserved respectability i conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of this precaution which induced mr locke to style himself gent on the titlepage of his essay as who should say to his readers that they could receive his metaphysics on the honor of a gentleman  nevertheless finding that without descending to a smaller size of type than would have been compatible with the dignity of the several societies to be named i could not compress my intended list within the limits of a single page and thinking moreover that the act would carry with it an air of decorous modesty i have chosen to take the reader aside as it were into my private closet and there not only exhibit to him the diplomas which i already possess but also to furnish him with a prophetic vision of those which i may without undue presumption hope for as not beyond the reach of human ambition and attainment and i am the rather induced to this from the fact that my name has been unaccountably dropped from the last triennial catalogue of our beloved alma mater whether this is to be attributed to the difficulty of latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts with a complete list of which i took care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year beforehand or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives i forbear to consider in this place the matter being in course of painful investigation but however this may be i felt the omission the more keenly as i had in expectation of the new catalogue enriched the library of the jaalam athenæum with the old one then in my possession by which means it has come about that my children will be deprived of a neverwearying winterevenings amusement in looking out the name of their parent in that distinguished roll those harmless innocents had at least committed nobut i forbear having intrusted my reflections and animadversions on this painful topic to the safekeeping of my private diary intended for posthumous publication i state this fact here in order that certain nameless individuals who are perhaps overmuch congratulating themselves upon my silence may know that a rod is in pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed posterity will apply to their memories  the careful reader will note that in the list which i have prepared i have included the names of several cisatlantic societies to which a place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature i have ventured to do this not only to encourage native ambition and genius but also because i have never been able to perceive in what way distance unless we suppose them at the end of a lever could increase the weight of learned bodies as far as i have been able to extend my researches among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach america i have discovered no generic difference between the antipodal fogrum japonicum and the f americanum sufficiently common in our own immediate neighbourhood yet with a becoming deference to the popular belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every additional mile they travel i have intermixed the names of some tolerably distant literary and other associations with the rest  i add here also an advertisement which that it may be the more readily understood by those persons especially interested therein i have written in that curtailed and otherwise maltreated canine latin to the writing and reading of which they are accustomed   omnib per tot

animadversions the first of his poems which he intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a city newspaper it never so much as entered my imagination to conceive that his productions would ever be gathered into a fair volume and ushered into the august presence of the reading public by myself so little are we shortsighted mortals able to predict the event i confess that there is to me a quite new satisfaction in being associated though only as sleeping partner in a book which can stand by itself in an independent unity on the shelves of libraries for there is always this drawback from the pleasure of printing a sermon that whereas the queasy stomach of this generation will not bear a discourse long enough to make a separate volume those religious and godlyminded children those samuels if i may call them so of the brain must at first lie buried in an undistinguished heap and then get such resurrection as is vouchsafed to them mummywrapt with a score of others in a cheap binding with no other mark of distinction than the word miscellaneous printed upon the back far be it from me to claim any credit for the quite unexpected popularity which i am pleased to find these bucolic strains have attained unto if i know myself i am measurably free from the itch of vanity yet i may be allowed to say that i was not backward to recognize in them a certain wild puckery acidulous sometimes even verging toward that point which in our rustic phrase is termed shuteye flavour not wholly unpleasing nor unwholesome to palates cloyed with the sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit it may be also that some touches of my own here and there may have led to their wider acceptance albeit solely from my larger experience of literature and authorship3  i was at first inclined to discourage mr biglows attempts as knowing that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally incident to adolescence which if the fitting remedies be not at once and with a bold hand applied may become chronic and render one who might else have become in due time an ornament of the social circle a painful object even to nearest friends and relatives but thinking on a further experience that there was a germ of promise in him which required only culture and the pulling up of weeds from around it i thought it best to set before him the acknowledged examples of english compositions in verse and leave the rest to natural emulation with this view i accordingly lent him some volumes of pope and goldsmith to the assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings not long afterwards he brought me some verses written upon that model a specimen of which i subjoin having changed some phrases of less elegancy and a few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear the poem consisted of childish reminiscences and the sketches which follow will not seem destitute of truth to those whose fortunate education began in a country village and first let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the schooldame      propt on the marsh a dwelling now i see     the humble schoolhouse of my a b c     where welldrilled urchins each behind his tire     waited in ranks the wished command to fire     then all together when the signal came     discharged their ab abs against the dame     who mid the volleyed learning firm and calm     patted the furloughed ferule on her palm     and to our wonder could detect at once     who flashed the pan and who was downright dunce      there young devotion learned to climb with ease     the gnarly limbs of scripture familytrees     and he was most commended and admired     who soonest to the topmost twig perspired     each name was called as many various ways     as pleased the readers ear on different days     so that the weather or the ferules stings     colds in the head or fifty other things     transformed the helpless hebrew thrice a week     to guttural pequot or resounding greek     the vibrant accent skipping here and there     just as it pleased invention or despair     no controversial hebraist was the dame     with or without the points pleased her the same     if any tyro found a name too tough     and looked at her pride furnished skill enough     she nerved her larynx for the desperate thing     and cleared the fivebarred syllables at a spring      ah dear old times there once it

year     as every time he told it joe drew near     to the main fight till faded and grown gray     the original scene to bolder tints gave way     then joe had heard the foes scared doublequick

had squared more nearly to his sense of right     and vanquished percy to complete the tale     had hammered stone for life in concord jail  i do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not to be called my own rather than mr biglows as indeed he maintained stoutly that my file had left nothing of his in them i should not perhaps have felt entitled to take so great liberties with them had i not more than suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself a very near ancestor having written a latin poem in the harvard gratulatio on the accession of george the third suffice it to say that whether not satisfied with such limited approbation as i could conscientiously bestow or from a sense of natural inaptitude i know not certain it is that my young friend could never be induced to any further essays in this kind he affirmed that it was to him like writing in a foreign tonguethat mr popes versification was like the regular ticking of one of willards clocks in which one could fancy after long listening a certain kind of rhythm or tune but which yet was only a povertystricken tick tick after alland that he had never seen a sweetwater on a trellis growing so fairly or in forms so pleasing to his eye as a foxgrape over a scruboak in a swamp he added i know not what to the effect that the sweetwater would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves starched and ironed out and that pegāsus so he called him hardly looked right with his mane and tail in curlpapers these and other such opinions i did not long strive to eradicate attributing them rather to a defective education and senses untuned by too long familiarity with purely natural objects than to a perverted moral sense i was the more inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek that his verses as wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and point had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner so only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name pegasus i left him to follow the bent of his natural genius  there are two things upon which it would seem fitting to dilate somewhat more largely in this placethe yankee character and the yankee dialect and first of the yankee character which has wanted neither open maligners nor even more dangerous enemies in the persons of those unskilful painters who have given to it that hardness angularity and want of proper perspective which in truth belonged not to their subject but to their own niggard and unskilful pencil  new england was not so much the colony of a mother country as a hagar driven forth into the wilderness the little selfexiled band which came hither in 1620 came not to seek gold but to found a democracy they came that they might have the privilege to work and pray to sit upon hard benches and listen to painful preachers as long as they would yea even unto thirtyseventhly if the spirit so willed it and surely if the greek might boast his thermopylæ where three hundred men fell in resisting the persian we may well be proud of our plymouth rock where a handful of men women and children not merely faced but vanquished winter famine the wilderness and the yet more invincible storge that drew them back to the green island far away these found no lotus growing upon the surly shore the taste of which could make them forget their little native ithaca nor were they so wanting to themselves in faith as to burn their ship but could see the fair west wind belly the homeward sail and then turn unrepining to grapple with the terrible unknown  as want was the prime foe these hardy exodists had to fortress themselves against so it is little wonder if that traditional feud is long in wearing out of the stock the wounds of the old warfare were long ahealing and an east wind of hard times puts a new ache in every one of them thrift was the first lesson in their hornbook pointed out letter after letter by the lean finger of the hard schoolmaster necessity neither were those plump rosygilled englishmen that came hither but a hardfaced atrabilious earnesteyed race stiff from long wrestling with the lord in prayer and who had taught satan to dread the new puritan hug add two hundred years influence of soil climate and exposure with its necessary result of idiosyncrasies and we have the present yankee full of expedients halfmaster of all trades inventive in all but the beautiful full of shifts not yet capable of comfort armed at all points against the old enemy hunger longanimous good at patching not so careful for what is best as for what will do with a clasp to his purse and a button to his pocket not skilled to build against time as in old countries but against sorepressing need accustomed to move the world with no ποῦ στῶ but his

afterwards in cœlum jusseris ibitor the other way eitherit is all one so any thing is to be got by it yet after all thin speculative jonathan is more like the englishman of two centuries ago than john bull himself is he has lost somewhat in solidity has become fluent and adaptable but more of the original groundwork of character remains he feels more at home with fulke greville herbert of cherbury quarles george herbert and browne than with his modern english cousins he is nearer than john by at least a hundred years to naseby marston moor worcester and the time when if ever there were true englishmen john bull has suffered the idea of the invisible to be very much flattened out of him jonathan is conscious still that he lives in the world of the unseen as well as of the seen to move

seized with a dangerous fit of illness before this introduction had passed through the press and being incapacitated for all literary exertion sent to me his notes memoranda c and requested me to fashion them into some shape more fitting for the general eye this owing to the fragmentary and disjointed state of his manuscripts i have felt wholly unable to do yet being unwilling that the reader should be deprived of such parts of his lucubrations as seemed more finished and not well discerning how to segregate these from the rest i have concluded to send them all to the press precisely as they are  columbus nye pastor of a church in bungtown corner                                       it remains to speak of the yankee dialect and first it may be premised in a general way that any one much read in the writings of the early colonists need not be told that the far greater share of the words and phrases now esteemed peculiar to new england and local there were brought from the mothercountry a person familiar with the dialect of certain portions of massachusetts will not fail to recognize in ordinary discourse many words now noted in english vocabularies as archaic the greater part of which were in common use about the time of the king james translation of the bible shakspeare stands less in need of a glossary to most new englanders than to many a native of the old country the peculiarities of our speech however are rapidly wearing out as there is no country where reading is so universal and newspapers are so multitudinous so no phrase remains long local but is transplanted in the mailbags to every remotest corner of the land consequently our dialect approaches nearer to uniformity than that of any other nation  the english have complained of us for coining new words many of those so stigmatized were old ones by them forgotten and all make now an unquestioned part of the currency wherever english is spoken undoubtedly we have a right to make new words as they are needed by the fresh aspects under which life presents itself here in the new world and indeed wherever a language is alive it grows it might be questioned whether we could not establish a stronger title to the ownership of the english tongue than the motherislanders themselves here past all question is to be its great home and centre and not only is it already spoken here by greater numbers but with a far higher popular average of correctness than in britain the great writers of it too we might claim as ours were ownership to be settled by the number of readers and lovers  as regards the provincialisms to be met with in this volume i may say that the reader will not find one which is not as i believe either native or imported with the early settlers nor one which i have not with my own ears heard in familiar use in the metrical portion of the book i have endeavoured to adapt the spelling as nearly as possible to the ordinary mode of pronunciation let the reader who deems me overparticular remember this caution of martial      quem recitas meus est o fidentine libellus     sed male cum recitas incipit esse tuus  a few further explanatory remarks will not be impertinent  i shall barely lay down a few general rules for the readers guidance  1 the genuine yankee never gives the rough sound to the r when he can help it and often displays considerable ingenuity in avoiding it even before a vowel  2 he seldom sounds the final g a piece of selfdenial if we consider his partiality for nasals the same of the final d as han and stan for hand and stand  3 the h in such words as while when where he omits altogether  4 in regard to a he shows some inconsistency sometimes giving a close and obscure sound as hev for have hendy for handy ez for as thet for that and again giving it the broad sound it has in father as hânsome for handsome  5 to the sound ou he prefixes an e hard to exemplify otherwise than orally  the following passage in shakspeare

to procure a likeness of mr biglow i thought the curious reader might be gratified with a sight of the editorial effigies and here a choice between two was offeredthe one a profile entirely black cut by doyle the other a portrait painted by a native artist of much promise the first of these seemed wanting in expression and in the second a slight obliquity of the visual organs has been heightened perhaps from an overdesire of force on the part of the artist into too close an approach to actual strabismus this slight divergence in my optical apparatus from the ordinary modelhowever i may have been taught to regard it in the light of a mercy rather than a cross since it enabled me to give as much of directness and personal application to my discourses as met the wants of my congregation without risk of offending any by being supposed to have him or her in my eye as the saying isseemed yet to mrs wilbur a sufficient objection to the engraving of the aforesaid painting we read of many who either absolutely refused to allow the copying of their features as especially did plotinus and agesilaus among the ancients not to mention the more modern instances of scioppius palæottus pinellus velserus gataker and others or were indifferent thereto as cromwell  β yet was cæsar desirous of concealing his baldness per contra my lord protectors carefulness in the matter of his wart

δ concerning mr biglows pedigree tolerably certain that there was never a poet among his ancestors an ordination hymn attributed to a maternal uncle but perhaps a sort of production not demanding the creative faculty  his grandfather a painter of the grandiose or michael angelo school seldom painted objects smaller than houses or barns and these with uncommon expression

have died early for only three years after namely 1714 we have evidence that he married winifred daughter of lieutenant tipping  he seems to have been a man of substance for we find him in 1696

in the earth and walking up and down in it bishop latimer will have him to have been a bishop but to me that other calling would appear more congenial the sect of cainites is not yet extinct who esteemed the firstborn of adam to be the most worthy not only because of that privilege of primogeniture but inasmuch as he was able to overcome and slay his younger brother that was a wise saying of the famous marquis pescara to the papal legate that it was impossible for men to serve mars and christ at the same time yet in time past the profession of arms was judged to be κατ ἐξοχήν that of a gentleman nor does this opinion want for strenuous upholders even in our day must we suppose then that the profession of christianity was only intended for losels or at best to afford an opening for plebeian ambition or shall we hold with that nicely metaphysical pomeranian captain vratz who was count königsmarks chief instrument in the murder of mr thynne that the scheme of salvation has been arranged with an especial eye to the necessities of the upper classes and that god would consider a gentleman and deal with him suitably to the condition and profession he had placed him in it may be

covering a letter from    mr b sawin private in the massachusetts regiment   this letter of mr sawins was not originally written in verse mr biglow thinking it peculiarly susceptible of metrical adornment translated it so to speak into his own vernacular tongue this is not the time to consider the question whether rhyme be a mode of expression natural to the human race if leisure from other and more important avocations be granted i will handle the matter more at large in an appendix to the present volume in this place i will barely remark that i have sometimes noticed in the unlanguaged prattlings of infants a fondness for alliteration assonance and even rhyme in which natural predisposition we may trace the three degrees through which our anglosaxon verse rose to its culmination in the poetry of pope i would not be understood as questioning in these remarks that pious theory which supposes that children if left entirely to themselves would naturally discourse in hebrew for this the authority of one experiment is claimed and i could with sir thomas browne desire its establishment inasmuch as the acquirement of that sacred tongue would thereby be facilitated i am aware that herodotus states the conclusion of psammiticus to have been in favour of a dialect of the phrygian but beside the chance that a trial of this importance would hardly be blessed to a pagan monarch whose only motive was curiosity we have on the hebrew side the comparatively recent investigation of james the fourth of scotland i will add to this prefatory remark that mr sawin though a native of jaalam has never been a stated attendant on the religious exercises of my congregation i consider my humble efforts prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the wolfs clothing of war save for the comparatively innocent diversion of a militia training not that my flock are backward to undergo the hardships of defensive warfare they serve cheerfully in the great army which fights

late inroad upon mexico was undertaken not so much for the avenging of any national quarrel as for the spreading of free institutions and of protestantism capita vix duabus anticyris medenda verily i admire that no pious sergeant among these new crusaders beheld martin luther riding at the front of the host upon a tamed pontifical bull as in that former invasion of mexico the zealous diaz spawn though he were of the scarlet woman was favoured with a vision of st james of compostella skewering the infidels upon his apostolical lance we read also that richard of the lion heart having gone to

if other bait be wanting can by a bare bit of white rag at the end of a string captivate those foolish fishes such piscatorial oratory is satan cunning in before one he trails a hat and feather or a bare feather without a hat before another a presidential chair or a tidewaiters stool or a pulpit in the city no matter what to us dangling there over our heads they seem junkets dropped out of the

eyewitnesses have encouraged the arms of papists not to speak of those dioscuri whom we must conclude imps of the pit who sundry times captained the pagan roman soldiery it is strange that our first american crusade was not in some such wise also signalized yet it is said that the lord hath manifestly prospered our armies this opens the question whether when our hands are strengthened to make great slaughter of our enemies it be absolutely and demonstratively certain that this might is added to us from above or whether some potentate from an opposite quarter may not have a finger in it as there are few pies into which his meddling digits are not thrust would the sanctifier and setterapart of the seventh day have assisted in a victory gained on the sabbath as was one in the late war or has that day become less an object of his especial care since the year 1697 when so manifest a providence occurred to mr william trowbridge in answer to whose prayers when he and all on shipboard with him were starving a dolphin was sent daily which was enough to serve em only on saturdays they still catched a couple and on the lords days they could catch none at all haply they might have been permitted by way of mortification to take some few sculpins those banes of the saltwater angler which unseemly fish would moreover have conveyed to them a symbolical reproof for their breach of the day being known in the rude dialect of our mariners as cape cod clergymen  it has been a refreshment to many nice consciences to know that our chief magistrate would not regard with eyes of approval the by many esteemed sinful pastime of dancing and i own myself to be so far of that mind that i could not but set my face against this mexican polka though danced to the presidential piping with a gubernatorial second if ever the country should be seized with another such mania de propagandâ fide i think it would be wise to fill our bombshells with alternate copies of the cambridge platform and the thirtynine articles which would produce a mixture of the highest explosive power and to wrap every one of our cannonballs in a leaf of the new testament the reading of which is denied to those who sit in the darkness of popery those iron evangelists would thus be able to disseminate vital religion and gospel truth in quarters inaccessible to the ordinary missionary i have seen lads unimpregnate with the more sublimated punctiliousness of walton secure pickerel taking their unwary siesta beneath the lilypads too nigh the surface with a gun and small shot why not then since gunpowder was unknown to the apostles not to enter here upon the question whether it were discovered before that period by the chinese suit our metaphor to the age in which we live and say shooters as well as fishers of men  i do much fear that we shall be seized now and then with a protestant fervour as long as we have neighbour naboths whose wallowings in papistical mire excite our horror in exact proportion to the size and desirableness of their vineyards yet i rejoice that some earnest protestants have been made by this wari mean those who protested against it fewer they were than i could wish for one might imagine america to have been colonized by a tribe of those nondescript african animals the ayeayes so difficult a word is no to us all there is some malformation or defect of the

i gave a stab under the fifth rib to that pestilent fallacyour country right or wrongby tracing its original to a speech of ensign cilley at a dinner of the bungtown fenciblesh w   footnotes  5 in relation to this expression i cannot but think that mr biglow has been too hasty in attributing it to me though time be a comparatively innocent personage to swear by and though longinus in his discourse Περι Ὕψους has commended timely oaths as not only a useful but sublime figure of speech yet i have always kept my lips free from that abomination odi profanum vulgus i hate your swearing and

few remarks on the following verses will not be out of place the satire in them was not meant to have any personal but only a general application of the gentleman upon whose letter they were intended as a commentary mr biglow had never heard till he saw the letter itself the position of the satirist is oftentimes one which he would not have chosen had the election been left to himself in attacking bad principles he is obliged to select some individual who has made himself their exponent and in whom they are impersonate to the end that what he says may not through ambiguity be dissipated tenues in auras for what says seneca longum iter per præcepta breve et efficace per exempla a bad principle is comparatively harmless while it continues to be an abstraction nor can the general mind comprehend it fully till it is printed in that large type which all men can read at sight namely the life and character the sayings and doings of particular persons it is one of the cunningest fetches of satan that he never exposes himself directly to our arrows but still dodging behind this neighbour or that acquaintance compels us to wound him through them if at all he holds our affections as hostages the while he patches up a truce with our conscience  meanwhile let us not forget that the aim of the true satirist is not to be severe upon persons but only upon falsehood and as truth and falsehood start from the same point and sometimes even go along together for a little way his business is to follow the path of the latter after it diverges and to show her floundering in the bog at the end of it truth is quite beyond the reach of satire there is so brave a simplicity in her that she can no more be made ridiculous than an oak or a pine the danger of the satirist is that continual use may deaden his sensibility to the force of language he becomes more and more liable to strike harder than he knows or intends he may be careful to put on his boxinggloves and yet forget that the older they grow the more plainly may the knuckles inside be felt moreover in the heat of contest the eye is insensibly drawn to the crown of victory whose tawdry tinsel glitters through that dust of the ring which obscures truths wreath of simple leaves i have sometimes thought that my young friend mr biglow needed a monitory hand laid on his armaliquid sufflaminandus erat i have never thought it good husbandry to water the tender plants of reform with aqua fortis yet where so much is to do in the beds he were a sorry gardener who should wage a whole days war with an iron scuffle on those ill weeds that make the gardenwalks of life unsightly when a sprinkle of attic salt will wither them up est ars etiam maledicendi says scaliger and truly it is a hard thing to say where the graceful gentleness of the lamb merges in downright sheepishness we may conclude with worthy and wise dr fuller that one may be a lamb in private wrongs but in hearing general affronts to goodness they are

poem an allusion to that pernicious sentimentour country right or wrong it is an abuse of language to call a certain portion of land much more certain personages elevated for the time being to high station our country i would not sever nor loosen a single one of those ties by which we are united to the spot of our birth nor minish by a tittle the respect due to the magistrate i love our own bay state too well to do the one and as for the other i have myself for nigh forty years exercised however unworthily the function of justice of the peace having been called thereto by the unsolicited kindness of that most excellent man and upright patriot caleb strong patriæ fumus igne alieno luculentior is best qualified with thisubi libertas ibi patria we are inhabitants of two worlds and owe a double but not a divided allegiance in virtue of our clay this little ball of earth exacts a certain loyalty of us while in our capacity as spirits we are admitted citizens of an invisible and holier fatherland there is a patriotism of the soul whose claim absolves us from our other and terrene fealty our true country is that ideal realm which we represent to ourselves under the names of religion duty and the like our terrestrial organizations are but faroff approaches to so fair a model and all they are verily traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this their original intendment when therefore one would have us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitudeour country however bounded he demands of us that we sacrifice the larger to the less the higher to the lower and that we yield to the imaginary claims of a few acres of soil our duty and privilege as liegemen of truth our true country is bounded on the north and the south on the east and the west by justice and when she oversteps that invisible boundaryline by so much as a hairsbreadth she ceases to be our mother and chooses rather to be looked upon quasi noverca that is a hard choice when our earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one path and our duty points us to another we must make as noble and becoming an election as did penelope between icarius and ulysses veiling our faces we must take silently the hand of duty to follow her  shortly after the publication of the foregoing poem there appeared some comments upon it in one of the public prints which seemed to call for some animadversion i accordingly addressed to mr buckingham of the boston courier the following letter                                          jaalam november 4 1847  to the editor of the courier  respected sircalling at the postoffice this morning our worthy and efficient postmaster offered for my perusal a paragraph in the boston morning post of the 3d instant wherein certain effusions of the pastoral muse are attributed to the pen of mr james russell lowell for ought i know or can affirm to the contrary this mr lowell may be a very deserving person and a youth of parts though i have seen verses of his which i could never rightly understand and if he be such he i am certain as well as i would be free from any proclivity to appropriate to himself whatever of credit or discredit may honestly belong to another i am confident that in penning these few lines i am only forestalling a disclaimer from that young gentleman whose silence hitherto when rumour pointed to himward has excited in my bosom mingled emotions of sorrow and surprise well may my young parishioner mr biglow exclaim with the poet      sic vos non vobis c  though in saying this i would not convey the impression that he is a proficient in the latin tonguethe tongue i might add of a horace and a tully  mr b does not employ his pen i can safely say for any lucre of worldly gain or to be exalted by the carnal plaudits of men digito monstrari c he does not wait upon providence for mercies and in his heart mean merces but i should esteem myself as verily deficient in my duty who am his friend and in some unworthy sort his spiritual fidus achates c if i did not step forward to claim for him whatever measure of applause might be assigned to him by the judicious  if this were a fitting occasion i might venture here a brief dissertation touching the manner and kind of my young friends poetry but i dubitate whether this abstruser sort of speculation though enlivened by some apposite instances from aristophanes would sufficiently interest your oppidan readers as regards their satirical tone and their plainness of speech i will only say that in my pastoral experience i have found that the archenemy loves nothing better than to be treated as a religious moral and intellectual being and that there is no apage sathanas so potent as ridicule but it is a kind of weapon that must have a button of goodnature on the point of it  the productions of mr b have been stigmatized in some quarters as unpatriotic but i can vouch that he loves his native soil with that hearty though discriminating attachment which springs from an intimate social intercourse of many years standing in the ploughing season no one has a deeper share in the wellbeing of the country than he if dean swift were right in saying that he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before confers a greater benefit on the state than he who taketh a city mr b might exhibit a fairer claim to the presidency than general scott himself i think that some of those disinterested lovers of the hardhanded democracy whose fingers have never touched anything rougher than the dollars of our common country would hesitate to compare palms with him it would do your heart good respected sir to see that young man now he cuts a cleaner and wider swarth than any in this town  but it is time for me to be at my post it is very clear that my young friends shot has struck the lintel for the post is shaken amos ix 1 the editor of that paper is a strenuous advocate of the mexican war and a colonel as i am given to understand i presume that being necessarily absent in mexico he has left his journal in some less judicious hands at any rate the post has been too swift on this occasion it could hardly have cited a more incontrovertible line from any poem than that which it has selected for animadversion namely      we kind o thought christ went agin war an pillage  if the post maintains the converse of this proposition it can hardly be considered as a safe guidepost for the moral and religious portions of its party however many other excellent qualities of a post it may be blessed with there is a sign in london on which is paintedthe green man it would do very well as a portrait of any individual who would support so unscriptural a thesis as regards the language of the line in question i am bold to say that he who readeth the hearts of men will not account any dialect unseemly which conveys a sound and pious sentiment i could wish that such sentiments were more common however uncouthly expressed saint ambrose affirms that veritas a quocunque why not then quomodocunque dicatur a spiritu sancto est digest also this of baxterthe plainest words are the most profitable oratory in weightiest matters  when the paragraph in question was shown to mr biglow the only part of it which seemed to give him any dissatisfaction was that which classed him with the whig party he says that if resolutions are a nourishing kind of diet that party must be in a very hearty and flourishing condition for that they have quietly eaten more good ones of their own baking than he could have conceived to be possible without repletion he has been for some years past i regret to say an ardent opponent of those sound doctrines of protective policy which form so prominent a portion of the creed of that party i confess that in some discussions which i have had with him on this point in my study he has displayed a vein of obstinacy which i had not hitherto detected in his composition he is also horresco referens infected in no small measure with the peculiar notions of a print called the liberator whose heresies i take every proper opportunity of combating and of which i thank god i have never read a single line  i did not see mr bs verses until they appeared in print and there is certainly one thing in them which i consider highly improper i allude to the personal references to myself by name to confer notoriety on an humble individual who is labouring quietly in his vocation and who keeps his cloth as free as he can from the dust of the political arena though væ mihi si non evangelizavero is no doubt an indecorum the sentiments which he attributes to me i will not deny to be mine they were embodied though in a different form in a discourse preached upon the last day of public fasting and were acceptable to my entire people of whatever political views except the postmaster who dissented ex officio i observe that you sometimes devote a portion of your paper to a religious summary i should be well pleased to furnish a copy of my discourse for insertion in this department of your instructive journal by omitting the advertisements it might easily be got within the limits of a single number and i venture to insure you the sale of some scores of copies in this town i will cheerfully render myself responsible for ten it might possibly be advantageous to issue it as an extra but perhaps you will not esteem it an object and i will not press it my offer does not spring from any weak desire of seeing my name in print for i can enjoy this satisfaction at any time by turning to the triennial catalogue of the university where it also possesses that added emphasis of italics with which those of my calling are distinguished  i would simply add that i continue

gratuitously if it should appear to you in that light i desire that you would erase it or charge for it at the usual rates and deduct the amount from the proceeds in your hands from the sale of my discourse when it shall be printed my circular is much longer and more explicit and will be forwarded without charge to any who may desire it it has been very neatly executed on a letter sheet by a very deserving printer who attends upon my ministry and is a creditable specimen of the typographic art i have one hung over my mantelpiece in a neat frame where it makes a beautiful and appropriate ornament and balances the profile of mrs w cut with her toes by the young lady born without arms                               h w  i have in the foregoing letter mentioned general scott in connexion with the presidency because i have been given to understand that he has blown to pieces and otherwise caused to be destroyed more mexicans than any other commander his claim would therefore be deservedly considered the strongest until accurate returns of the mexican killed wounded and maimed be obtained it would be difficult to settle these nice points of precedence should it prove that any other officer has been more meritorious and destructive than general s and has thereby rendered himself more worthy of the confidence and support of the conservative portion of our community i shall cheerfully insert his name instead of that of general s in a future edition it may be thought likewise that general s has invalidated his claims by too much attention to the decencies of apparel and the habits belonging to a gentleman these abstruser points of statesmanship are beyond my scope i wonder not that successful military achievement should attract the admiration of the multitude rather do i rejoice with wonder to behold how rapidly this sentiment is losing its hold upon the popular mind it is related of thomas warton the second of that honoured name who held the office of poetry professor at oxford that when one wished to find him being absconded as was his wont in some obscure alehouse he was counselled to traverse the city with a drum and fife the sound of which inspiring music would be sure to draw the doctor from his retirement into the street we are all more or less bitten with this martial insanity nescio quâ dulcedine  cunctos ducit i confess to some infection of that itch myself when i see a brigadiergeneral maintaining his insecure elevation in the saddle under the severe fire of the trainingfield and when i remember that some military enthusiasts through haste inexperience or an overdesire to lend reality to those fictitious combats will sometimes discharge their ramrods i cannot but admire while i deplore the mistaken devotion of those heroic officers semel insanivimus omnes i was myself during the late war with great britain chaplain of a regiment which was fortunately never called to active military duty i mention this circumstance with regret rather than pride had i been summoned to actual warfare i trust that i might have been strengthened to bear myself after the manner of that reverend father in our new england israel dr benjamin colman who as we are told in turells life of him when the vessel in which he had taken passage for england was attacked by a french privateer fought like a philosopher and a christian  and prayed all the while he charged and fired as this note is already long i shall not here enter upon a discussion of the question whether christians may lawfully be soldiers i think it sufficiently evident that during the first two centuries of the christian era at least the two professions were esteemed incompatible consult jortin on this headh w     no iv   remarks of increase d ophace esquire at an extrumpery    caucus in state street reported by mr h biglow   the ingenious reader will at once understand that no such speech as the following was ever totidem verbis pronounced but there are simpler and less guarded wits for the satisfying of which such an explanation may be needful for there are certain invisible lines which as truth successively overpasses she becomes untruth to one and another of us as a large river flowing from one kingdom into another sometimes takes a new name albeit the waters undergo no change how small soever there is moreover a truth of fiction more veracious than the truth of fact as that of the poet which represents to us things and events as they ought to be rather than servilely copies them as they are imperfectly imaged in the crooked and smoky glass of our mundane affairs it is this which makes the speech of antonius though originally spoken in no wider a forum than the brain of shakspeare more historically valuable than that other which appian has reported by as much as the understanding of the englishman was more comprehensive than that of the alexandrian mr biglow in the present instance has only made use of a licence assumed by all the historians of antiquity who put into the mouths of various characters such words as seem to them most fitting to the occasion and to the speaker if it be objected that no such oration could ever have been delivered i answer that there are few assemblages for speechmaking which do not better deserve the title of parliamentum indoctorum than did the sixth parliament of henry the fourth and that men still continue to have as much faith in the oracle of fools as ever pantagruel had howell in his letters recounts a merry tale of a certain ambassador of queen elizabeth who having written two letters one to her majesty and the other to his wife directed them at crosspurposes so that the queen was beducked and bedeared and requested to send a change of hose and the wife was beprincessed and otherwise unwontedly besuperlatived till the one feared for the wits of her ambassador the other for those of her husband in like manner it may be presumed that our speaker has misdirected some of his thoughts and given to the whole theatre what he would have wished to confide only to a select auditory at the back of the curtain for it is seldom that we can get any frank utterance from men who address for the most part a buncombe either in this world or the next as for their audiences it may be truly said of our people that they enjoy one political institution in common with the ancient athenians i mean a certain profitless kind of ostracism wherewith nevertheless they seem hitherto well enough content for in presidential elections and other affairs of the sort whereas i observe that the oysters fall to the lot of comparatively few the shells such as the privileges of voting as they are told to do by the ostrivori aforesaid and of huzzaing at public meetings are very liberally distributed among the people as being their prescriptive and quite sufficient portion  the occasion of the speech is supposed to be mr palfreys refusal to vote for the whig candidate for the

my religion s too fervent     good mornin my friends i m your most humble servant   into the question whether the ability to express ourselves in articulate language has been productive of more good or evil i shall not here enter at large the two faculties of speech and of speechmaking are wholly diverse in their natures by the first we make ourselves intelligible by the last unintelligible to our fellows it has not seldom occurred to me noting how in our national legislature everything runs to talk as lettuces if the season or the soil be unpropitious shoot up lankly to seed instead of forming handsome heads that babel was the first congress the earliest mill erected for the manufacture of gabble in these days what with town meetings school committees boards lumber of one kind and another congresses parliaments diets indian councils palavers and the like there is scarce a village which has not its factories of this description driven by milkand water power i cannot conceive the confusion of tongues to have been the curse of babel since i esteem my ignorance of other languages as a kind of martellotower in which i am safe from the furious bombardments of foreign garrulity for this reason i have ever preferred the study of the dead languages those primitive formations being ararats upon whose silent peaks i sit secure and watch this new deluge without fear though it rain figures simulacra semblances of speech forty days and nights together as it not uncommonly happens thus is my coat as it were without buttons by which any but a vernacular wild bore can seize me is it not possible that the shakers may intend to convey a quiet reproof and hint in fastening their outer garments with hooks and eyes  this reflection concerning babel which i find in no commentary was first thrown upon my mind when an excellent deacon of my congregation being infected with the second advent delusion assured me that he had received a first instalment of the gift of tongues as a small earnest of larger possessions in the like kind to follow for of a truth i could not reconcile it with my ideas of the divine justice and mercy that the single wall which protected people of other languages from the incursions of this otherwise wellmeaning propagandist should be broken down  in reading congressional debates i have fancied that after the subsidence of those painful buzzings in the brain which result from such exercises i detected a slender residuum of valuable information i made the discovery that nothing takes longer in the saying than anything else for as ex nihilo nihil fit so from one polypus nothing any number of similar ones may be produced i would recommend to the attention of vivâ voce debaters and controversialists the admirable example of the monk copres who in the fourth century stood for half an hour in the midst of a great fire and thereby silenced a manichæan antagonist who had less of the salamander in him as for those who quarrel in print i have no concern with them here since the eyelids are a divinelygranted shield against all such moreover i have observed in many modern books that the printed portion is becoming gradually smaller and the number of blank or flyleaves as they are called greater should this fortunate tendency of literature continue books will grow more valuable from year to year and the whole serbonian bog yield to the advances of firm arable land  i have wondered in the representatives chamber of our own commonwealth to mark how little impression seemed to be produced by that emblematic fish suspended over the heads of the members our wiser ancestors no doubt hung it there as being the animal which the pythagoreans reverenced for its silence and which certainly in that particular does not so well merit

scare manifest and irretrievable destiny out of her path mr calhoun cannot let go the apronstring of the past the past is a good nurse but we must be weaned from her sooner or later even though like plotinus we should run home from school to ask the breast after we are tolerably wellgrown youths it will not do for us to hide our faces in her lap whenever the strange future holds out her arms and asks us to come to her  but we are all alike we have all heard it said often enough that little boys must not play with fire and yet if the matches be taken away from us and put out of reach upon the shelf we must needs get into our little corner and scowl and stamp and threaten the dire revenge of going to bed without our supper the world shall stop till we get our dangerous plaything again dame

he should remember the old scandinavian mythus thor was the strongest of gods but he could not wrestle with time nor so much as lift up a fold of the great snake which knit the universe together and when he smote the earth though with his terrible mallet it was but as if a leaf had fallen yet all the while it seemed to thor that he had only been wrestling with an old woman striving to lift a cat and striking a stupid giant on the head  and in old times doubtless the giants were stupid and there was no better sport for the sir launcelots and sir gawains than to go about cutting off their great blundering heads with enchanted swords but things have wonderfully changed it is the giants nowadays that have the science and the intelligence while the chivalrous don quixotes of conservatism still

wealth of our patriarchal brethren of the south yet it is clear that their possessions have legs and an unaccountable propensity for using them in a northerly direction i marvel that the grand jury of washington did not find a true bill against the north star for aiding and abetting drayton and sayres it would have been quite of a piece with the intelligence displayed by the south on other questions connected with slavery i think that no ship of state was ever freighted with a more veritable jonah than this same domestic institution of ours mephistopheles himself could not feign so bitterly so satirically sad a sight as this of three millions of human beings crushed beyond help or hope by this one mighty argumentour fathers knew no better nevertheless it is the unavoidable destiny of jonahs to be cast overboard sooner or later or shall we try the experiment of hiding our jonah in a safe place that none may lay hands on him to make jetsam of him let us then with equal forethought and wisdom lash ourselves to the anchor and await in pious confidence the certain result perhaps our suspicious passenger is no jonah after all being black for it is well known that a superintending providence made a kind of sandwich of ham and his descendants to be devoured by the caucasian race  in gods name let all who hear nearer and nearer the hungry moan of the storm and the growl of the breakers speak out but alas we have no right to interfere if a man pluck an apple of mine he shall be in danger of the justice but if he steal my brother i must be silent who says this our constitution consecrated by the callous suetude of sixty years and grasped in triumphant argument in the left hand of him whose right hand clutches the clotted slavewhip justice venerable with the undethronable majesty of countless æons saysspeak the past wise with the sorrows and desolations of ages from amid her shattered fanes and wolfhousing palaces echoesspeak nature through her thousand trumpets of freedom her stars her sunrises her seas her winds her cataracts her mountains blue with cloudy pines blows jubilant encouragement and criesspeak from the souls trembling abysses the still small voice not vaguely murmursspeak but alas the constitution and the honourable mr bagowind mc saybe dumb  it occurs to me to suggest as a topic of inquiry in this connexion whether on that momentous occasion when the goats and the sheep shall be parted the constitution and the honourable mr bagowind mc will be expected to take their places on the left as our hircine vicars      quia sum miser tunc dicturus     quem patronum rogaturus  there is a point where toleration sinks into sheer baseness and poltroonery the toleration of the worst leads us to look on what is barely better as good enough and to worship what is only moderately good woe to that man or that nation to whom mediocrity has become an ideal  has our experiment of selfgovernment succeeded if it barely manage to rub and go here now is a piece of barbarism which christ and the nineteenth century say shall cease and which messrs smith brown and others say shall not cease i would by no means deny the eminent respectability of these gentlemen but i confess that in such a wrestlingmatch i cannot help having my fears for them      discite justitiam moniti et non temnere divos                                                              h w     no vi  the pious editors creed   at the special instance of mr biglow i preface the following satire with an extract from a sermon preached during the past summer from ezekiel xxxiv 2son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel since the sabbath on which this discourse was delivered the editor of the jaalam independent blunderbuss has unaccountably absented himself from our house of worship  i know of no so responsible position as that of the public journalist the editor of our day bears the same relation to his time that the clerk bore to the age before the invention of printing indeed the position which he holds is that which the clergyman should hold even now but the clergyman chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world and to throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness which he calls the next life as if next did not mean nearest and as if any life were nearer than that immediately present one which boils and eddies all around him at the caucus the ratification meeting and the polls who taught him to exhort men to prepare for eternity as for some future era of which the present forms no integral part the furrow which time is even now turning runs through the everlasting and in that must he plant or nowhere yet he would fain believe and teach that we are going to have more of eternity than we have now this going of his is like that of the auctioneer on which gone follows before we have made up our minds to bidin which manner not three months back i lost an excellent copy of chappelow on job so it has come to pass that the preacher instead of being a living force has faded into an emblematic figure at christenings weddings and funerals or if he exercise any other function it is as keeper and feeder of certain theologic dogmas which when occasion offers he unkennels with a staboy to bark and bite as tis their nature to whence that reproach of odium theologicum has arisen  meanwhile see what a pulpit the editor mounts daily sometimes with a congregation of fifty thousand within reach of his voice and never so much as a nodder even among them and from what a bible can he choose his texta bible which needs no translation and which no priestcraft can shut and clasp from the laitythe open volume of the world upon which with a pen of sunshine or destroying fire the inspired present is even now writing the annals of god methinks the editor who should understand his calling and be equal thereto would truly deserve that title of ποιμην λαῶν which homer bestows upon princes he would be the moses of our nineteenth century and whereas the old sinai silent now is but a common mountain stared at by the elegant tourist and crawled over by the hammering geologist he must find his tables of the new law here among factories and cities in this wilderness of sin numbers xxxiii 12 called progress of civilization and be the captain of our exodus into the canaan of a truer social order  nevertheless our editor will not come so far within even the shadow of sinai as mahomet did but chooses rather to construe moses by joe smith he takes up the crook not that the sheep may be fed but that he may never want a warm woollen suit and a joint of mutton      immemor o fidei pecorumque oblite tuorum  for which reason i would derive the name editor not so much from edo to publish as from edo to eat that being the peculiar profession to which he esteems himself called he blows up the flames of political discord for no other occasion than that he may thereby handily boil his own pot i believe there are two thousand of these muttonloving shepherds in the united states and of these how many have even the dimmest perception of their immense power and the duties consequent thereon here and there haply one nine hundred and ninetynine labour to impress upon the people the great principles of tweedledum and other nine hundred and ninetynine preach with equal earnestness

subjoin here another passage from my beforementioned discourse  wonderful to him that has eyes to see it rightly is the newspaper to me for example sitting on the critical front bench of the pit in my study here in jaalam the advent of my weekly journal is as that of a strolling theatre or rather of a puppetshow on whose stage narrow as it is the tragedy comedy and farce of life are played in little behold the whole huge earth sent to me hebdomadally in a brownpaper wrapper  hither to my obscure corner by wind or steam on horseback or dromedaryback in the pouch of the indian runner or clicking over the magnetic wires troop all the famous performers from the four quarters of the globe looked at from a point of criticism tiny puppets they seem all as the editor sets up his booth upon my desk and officiates as showman now i can truly see how little and transitory is life the earth appears almost as a drop of vinegar on which the solar microscope of the imagination must be brought to bear in order to make out any thing distinctly that animalcule there in the peajacket is louis philippe just landed on the coast of england that other in the grey surtout and cocked hat is napoleon bonaparte smith assuring france that she need apprehend no interference from him in the present alarming juncture at that spot where you seem to see a speck of something in motion is an immense massmeeting look sharper and you will see a mite brandishing his mandibles in an excited manner that is the great mr soandso defining his position amid tumultuous and irrepressible cheers that infinitesimal creature upon whom some score of others as minute as he are gazing in openmouthed admiration is a famous philosopher expounding to a select audience their capacity for the infinite that scarce discernible pufflet of smoke and dust is a revolution that speck there is a reformer just arranging the lever with which he is to move the world and lo there creeps forward the shadow of a skeleton that blows one breath between its grinning teeth and all our distinguished actors are whisked off the slippery stage into the dark beyond  yes the little showbox has its solemner suggestions now and then we catch a glimpse of a grim old man who lays down a scythe and hourglass in the corner while he shifts the scenes there too in the dim background a weird shape is ever delving sometimes he leans upon his mattock and gazes as a coach whirls by bearing the newly married on their wedding jaunt or glances carelessly at a babe brought home from christening suddenly for the scene grows larger and larger as we look a bony hand snatches back a performer in the midst of his part and him whom yesterday two infinities past and future would not suffice a handful of dust is enough to cover and silence for ever nay we see the same fleshless fingers opening to clutch the showman himself and guess not without a shudder that they are lying in wait for spectator also  think of it for three dollars a year i buy a seasonticket to this great globe theatre for which god would write the dramas only that we like farces spectacles and the tragedies of apollyon better whose sceneshifter is time and whose curtain is rung down by death  such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as i am tearing off the wrapper of my newspaper then suddenly that otherwise too often vacant sheet becomes invested for me with a strange kind of awe look deaths and marriages notices of inventions discoveries and books lists of promotions of killed wounded and missing news of fires accidents of sudden wealth and as sudden povertyi hold in my hand the ends of myriad invisible electric conductors along which tremble the joys sorrows wrongs triumphs hopes and despairs of as many men and women everywhere so that upon that mood of mind which seems to isolate me from mankind as a spectator of their puppetpranks another supervenes in which i feel that i too unknown and unheard of am yet of some import to my fellows for through my newspaper here do not families take pains to send me an entire stranger news of a death among them are not here two who would have me know of their marriage and strangest of all is not this singular person anxious to have me informed that he has received a fresh supply of dimitry bruisgins but to none of us does the present even if for a moment discerned as such continue miraculous we glance carelessly at the sunrise and get used to orion and the pleiades the wonder wears off and tomorrow this sheet in which a vision was let down to me from heaven shall be the wrappage to a bar of soap or the platter for a beggars broken victualsh w     no vii  a letter   from a candidate for the presidency in answer to suttin    questions proposed by mr hosea biglow inclosed in    a note from mr biglow to s h gay esq editor of    the national antislavery standard   curiosity may be said to be the quality which preeminently distinguishes and segregates man from the lower animals as we trace the scale of animated nature downward we find this faculty of the mind as it may truly be called diminished in the savage and quite extinct in the brute the first object which civilized man proposes to himself i take to be the finding out whatsoever he can concerning his neighbours nihil humanum a me alienum puto i am curious about even john smith the desire next in strength to this an opposite pole indeed of the same magnet is that of communicating intelligence  men in general may be divided into the inquisitive and the communicative to the first class belong peeping toms eavesdroppers navelcontemplating brahmins metaphysicians travellers empedocleses spies the various societies for promoting rhinothism columbuses yankees discoverers and men of science who present themselves to the mind as so many marks of interrogation wandering up and down the world or sitting in studies and laboratories the second class i should again subdivide into four in the first subdivision i would rank those who have an itch to tell us about themselvesas keepers of diaries insignificant persons generally montaignes horace walpoles autobiographers poets the second includes those who are anxious to impart information concerning other peopleas historians barbers and such to the third belong those who labour to give us intelligence about nothing at allas novelists political orators the large majority of authors preachers lecturers and the like in the fourth come those who are communicative from motives of public benevolenceas finders of maresnests and bringers of ill news each of us twolegged fowls without feathers embraces all these subdivisions in himself to a greater or less degree for none of us so much as lays an egg or incubates a chalk one but straightway the whole barnyard shall know it by our cackle or our cluck omnibus hoc vitium est there are different grades in all these classes one will turn his telescope toward a backyard another toward uranus one will tell you that he dined with smith another that he supped with plato in one particular all men may be considered as belonging to the first grand division inasmuch as they all seem equally desirous of discovering the mote in their neighbours eye  to one or another of these species every human being may safely be referred i think it beyond a peradventure that jonah prosecuted some inquiries into the digestive apparatus of whales and that noah sealed up a letter in an empty bottle that news in regard to him might not be wanting in case of the worst they had else been super or subter human i conceive also that as there are certain persons who continually peep and pry at the keyhole of that mysterious door through which sooner or later we all make our exits so there are doubtless ghosts fidgeting and fretting on the other side of it because they have no means of conveying back to the world the scraps of news they have picked up for there is an answer ready somewhere to every question the great law of give and take runs through all nature and if we see a hook we may be sure that an eye is waiting for it i read in every face i meet a standing advertisement of information wanted in regard to a b or that the friends of c d can hear of him by application to such a one  it was to gratify the two great passions of asking and answering that epistolary correspondence was first invented letters for by this usurped title epistles are now commonly known are of several kinds first there are those which are not letters at allas letters patent letters dimissory letters inclosing bills letters of administration plinys letters letters of diplomacy of cato of mentor of lords lyttelton chesterfield and orrery of jacob behmen seneca whom st jerome includes in his list of sacred writers letters from abroad from sons in college to their fathers letters of marque and letters generally which are in no wise letters of mark second are real letters such as those of gray cowper walpole howel lamb the first letters from children printed in staggering capitals letters from new york letters of credit and others interesting for the sake of the writer or the thing written i have read also letters from europe by a gentleman named pinto containing some curious gossip and which i hope to see collected for the benefit of the curious there are besides letters addressed to posterityas epitaphs for example written for their own monuments by monarchs whereby we have lately become possessed of the names of several great conquerors and kings of kings hitherto unheard of and still unpronounceable but valuable to the student of the entirely dark ages the letter which st peter sent to king pepin in the year of grace 755 i would place in a class by itself as also the letters of candidates concerning which i shall dilate more fully in a note at the end of the following poem at present sat prata biberunt only concerning the shape of letters they are all either square or oblong to which general figures circular letters and roundrobins also conform themselvesh w   deer sir its gut to be the fashun now to rite letters to the candid

fowls about the premises were reduced to the condition of platos original man by these precautions the general was saved parva componere magnis i remember that when partyspirit once ran high among my people upon occasion of the choice of a new deacon i having my preferences yet not caring too openly to express them made use of an innocent fraud to bring about that result which i deemed most desirable my stratagem was no other than the throwing a copy of the complete letterwriter in the way of the candidate whom i wished to defeat he caught the infection and addressed a short note to his constituents in which the opposite party detected so many and so grave improprieties he had modeled it upon the letter of a young lady accepting a proposal of marriage that he not only lost his election but falling under a suspicion of sabellianism and i know not what the widow endive assured me that he was a paralipomenon to her certain knowledge was forced to leave the town thus it is that the letter killeth  the object which candidates propose to themselves in writing is to convey no meaning at all and here is a quite unsuspected pitfall into which they successively plunge headlong for it is precisely in such cryptographies that mankind are prone to seek for and find a wonderful amount and variety of significance omne ignotum pro mirifico how do we admire at the antique world striving to crack those oracular nuts from delphi ammon and elsewhere in only one of which can i so much as surmise that any kernel had ever lodged that namely wherein apollo confessed that he was mortal one didymus is moreover related to have written six thousand books on the single subject of grammar a topic rendered only more tenebrific by the labours of his successors and which seems still to possess an attraction for authors in proportion as they can make nothing of it a singular loadstone for theologians also is the beast in the apocalypse whereof in the course of my studies i have noted two hundred and three several interpretations each lethiferal to all the rest non nostrum est tantas componere lites yet i have myself ventured upon a two hundred and fourth which i embodied in a discourse preached on occasion of the demise of the late usurper napoleon bonaparte and which quieted in a large measure the minds of my people it is true that my views on this important point were ardently controverted by mr shearjashub holden the then preceptor of our academy and in other particulars a very deserving and sensible young man though possessing a somewhat limited knowledge of the greek tongue but his heresy struck down no deep root and he having been lately removed by the hand of providence i had the satisfaction of reaffirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached upon the lordsday immediately succeeding his funeral this might seem like taking an unfair advantage did i not add that he had made provision in his last will being celibate for the publication of a posthumous tractate in support of his own dangerous opinions  i know of nothing in our modern times which approaches so nearly to the ancient oracle as the letter of a presidential candidate now among the greeks the eating of beans was strictly forbidden to all such as had it in mind to consult those expert amphibologists and this same prohibition on the part of pythagoras to his disciples is understood to imply an abstinence from politics beans having been used as ballots that other explication quod videlicet sensus eo cibo obtundi existimaret though supported pugnis et calcibus by many of the learned and not wanting the countenance of cicero is confuted by the larger experience of new england on the whole i think it safer to apply here the rule of interpretation which now generally obtains in regard to antique cosmogonies myths fables proverbial expressions and knotty points generally which is to find a commonsense meaning and then select whatever can be imagined the most opposite thereto in this way we arrive at the conclusion that the greeks objected to the questioning of candidates and very properly if as i conceive the chief point be not to discover what a person in that position is or what he will do but whether he can be elected vos exemplaria græca nocturna versate manu versate diurna  but since an imitation of the greeks in this particular the asking of questions being one chief privilege of freemen is hardly to be hoped for and our candidates will answer whether they are questioned or not i would recommend that these anteelectionary dialogues should be carried on by symbols as were the diplomatic correspondences of the scythians and macrobii or confined to the language of signs like the famous interview of panurge and goatsnose a candidate might then convey a suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one eye or by presenting them with a phial of egyptian darkness to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies these answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective construction the exigencies of the political campaign might seem to demand and the candidate could take his position on either side of the fence with entire consistency or if letters must be written profitable use might be made of the dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script every fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different meaning whereby a sculptured stone or two supplies us and will probably continue to supply posterity with a very vast and various body of authentic history for even the briefest epistle in the ordinary chirography is dangerous there is scarce any style so compressed that superfluous words may not be detected in it a severe critic might curtail that famous brevity of cæsars by two thirds drawing his pen through the supererogatory veni and vidi perhaps after all the surest footing of hope is to be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of qualification in candidates already have statesmanship experience and the possession nay the profession even of principles been rejected as superfluous and may not the patriot reasonably hope that the ability to write will follow at present there may be death in pothooks as well as pots the loop of a letter may suffice for a bowstring and all the dreadful heresies of antislavery may lurk in a flourishh w     no

entrusted to the keeping of this child of his certain faculties of a constructive kind he had put in him a share of that vital force the nicest economy of every minute atom of which is necessary to

the hot blood pulsing along the iron arteries and its thews of steel and while i was admiring the adaptation of means to end the harmonious involutions of contrivance and the neverbewildered complexity i saw a grimed and greasy fellow the imperious engines lackey and drudge whose sole office was to let fall at intervals a drop or two of oil upon a certain joint then my soul said within me see there a piece of mechanism to which that other you marvel at is but as the rude first effort of a childa force which not merely suffices to set a few wheels in motion but which can send an impulse all through the infinite futurea contrivance not for turning out pins or stitching buttonholes but for making hamlets and lears and yet this thing of iron shall be housed waited on guarded from rust and dust and it shall be a crime but so much as to scratch it with a pin while the other with its fire of god in it shall be buffeted hither and thither and finally sent carefully a thousand miles to

crossed my mind in that dreary interval of drought which intervenes between quarterly stipendiary showers that providence by the creation of a moneytree might have simplified wonderfully the sometimes perplexing problem of human life we read of breadtrees the butter for which lies readychurned in irish bogs milktrees we are assured of in south america and stout sir john hawkins testifies to watertrees in the canaries boottrees bear abundantly in lynn and elsewhere and i have seen in the entries of the wealthy hattrees with a fair show of fruit a familytree i once cultivated myself and found therefrom but a scanty yield and that quite tasteless and innutritious of trees bearing men we are not without examples as those in the park of louis the eleventh of france who has forgotten moreover that olivetree growing in the athenians backgarden with its strange uxorious crop for the general propagation of which as of a new and precious variety the philosopher diogenes hitherto uninterested in arboriculture was so zealous in the sylva of our own southern states the females of my family have called my attention to the chinatree not to multiply examples i will barely add to my list the birchtree in the smaller branches of which has been implanted so miraculous a virtue for communicating the latin and greek languages and which may well therefore be classed among the trees producing necessaries of lifevenerabile donum fatalis virgæ that moneytrees existed in the golden age there want not prevalent reasons for our believing for does not the old proverb when it asserts that money does not grow on every bush imply à fortiori that there were certain bushes which did produce it again there is another ancient saw to the effect that money is the root of all evil from which two adages it may be safe to infer that the aforesaid species of tree first degenerated into a shrub then absconded underground and finally in our iron age vanished altogether in favourable exposures it may be conjectured that a specimen or two survived to a great age as in the garden of the hesperides and indeed what else could that tree in the sixth Æneid have been with a branch whereof the trojan hero procured admission to a territory for the entering of which money is a surer passport than to a certain other more profitable too foreign kingdom whether these speculations of mine have any force in them or whether they will not rather by most readers be deemed impertinent to the matter in hand is a question which i leave to the determination of an indulgent posterity that there were in more primitive and happier times shops where money was soldand that too on credit and at a bargaini take to be matter of demonstration for what but a dealer in this article was that Æolus who supplied ulysses with motive power for his fleet in bags what that ericus king of sweden who is said to have kept the winds in his cap what in more recent times those lapland nornas who traded in favourable breezes all which will appear the more clearly when we consider that even to this day raising the wind is proverbial for raising money and that brokers and banks were invented by the venetians at a later period  and now for the improvement of this digression i find a parallel to mr sawins fortune in an adventure of my own for shortly after i had first broached to myself the beforestated naturalhistorical and archæological theories as i was passing hæc negotia penitus mecum revolvens through one of the obscure suburbs of our new england metropolis my eye was attracted by these words upon a signboardcheap cashstore here was at once the confirmation of my speculations and the substance of my hopes here lingered the fragment of a happier past or stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more fortunate future thus glowed the distant mexico to the eyes of sawin as he looked through the dirty pane of the recruitingoffice window or speculated from the summit of that miragepisgah which the imps of the bottle are so cunning in raising up already had my alnascharfancy even during that first halfbelieving glance expended in various useful directions the funds to be obtained by pledging the manuscript of a proposed volume of discourses already did a clock ornament the tower of the jaalam meetinghousea gift appropriately but modestly commemorated in the parish and town records both for now many years kept by myself already had my son seneca completed his course at the university whether for the moment we may not be considered as actually lording it over those baratarias with the viceroyalty of which hope invests us and whether we are ever so warmly housed as in our spanish castles would afford matter of argument enough that i found that signboard to be no other than a bait to the trap of a decayed grocer nevertheless i bought a pound of dates getting short weight by reason of immense flights of harpy flies who pursued and lighted upon their prey even in the very scales which purchase i made not only with an eye to the little ones at home but also as a figurative reproof of that toofrequent habit of my mind which forgetting the due order of chronology will often persuade me that the happy sceptre of saturn is stretched over this astræaforsaken nineteenth century  having glanced at the ledger of glory under the title sawin b let us extend our investigations and discover if that instructive volume does not contain some charges more personally interesting to ourselves i think we should be more economical of our resources did we thoroughly appreciate the fact that whenever brother jonathan seems to be thrusting his hand into his own pocket he is in fact picking ours i confess that the late muck which the country has been running has materially changed my views as to the best method of raising revenue if by means of direct taxation the bills for every extraordinary outlay were brought under our immediate eye so that like thrifty housekeepers we could see where and how fast the money was going we should be less likely to commit extravagances at present these things are managed in such a huggermugger way that we know not what we pay for the poor man is charged as much as the rich and while we are saving and scrimping at the spigot the government is drawing off at the bung if we could know that a part of the money we expend for tea and coffee goes to buy powder and ball and that it is mexican blood which makes the clothes on our backs more costly it would set some of us athinking

understood that it was for it goes about obtaining money under the false pretence of being glory for me i have an imagination which plays me uncomfortable tricks it happens to me sometimes to see a slaughterer on his way home from his days work and forthwith my imagination puts a cockedhat upon his head and epaulettes upon his shoulders and sets him up as a candidate for the presidency so also on a recent public occasion as the place assigned to the reverend clergy is just behind that of officers of the army and navy in processions it was my fortune to be seated at the dinnertable over against one of these respectable persons he was arrayed as out of his own profession only kings courtofficers and footmen are in europe and indians in america now what does my overofficious imagination but set to work upon him strip him of his gay livery and present him to me coatless his trousers thrust into the tops of a pair of boots thick with clotted blood and a basket on his arm out of which lolled a goresmeared axe thereby destroying my relish for the temporal mercies upon the board before meh w     no ix  a third letter from b sawin esq   upon the following letter slender comment will be needful in what river selemnus has mr sawin bathed that he has become so swiftly oblivious of his former loves from an ardent and as befits a soldier confident wooer of that coy bride the popular favour we see him subside of a sudden into the i trust not jilted cincinnatus returning to his plough with a goodlysized branch of willow in his hand figuratively returning however to a figurative plough and from no profound affection for that honoured implement of husbandry for which indeed mr sawin never displayed any decided predilection but in order to be gracefully summoned therefrom to more congenial labours it would seem that the character of the ancient dictator had become part of the recognised stock of our modern political comedy though as our term of office extends to a quadrennial length the parallel is not so minutely exact as could be desired it is sufficiently so however for purposes of scenic representation an humble cottage if built of logs the better forms the arcadian background of the stage this rustic paradise is labeled ashland jaalam north bend marshfield kinderhook or bâton rouge as occasion demands before the door stands a something with one handle the other painted in proper perspective which represents in happy ideal vagueness the plough to this the defeated candidate rushes with delirious joy welcomed as a father by appropriate groups of happy labourers or from it the successful one is torn with difficulty sustained alone by a noble sense of public duty only i have observed that if the scene be laid at bâton rouge or ashland the labourers are kept carefully in the background and are heard to shout from behind the scenes in a singular tone resembling ululation and accompanied by a sound not unlike vigorous clapping this however may be artistically in keeping with the habits of the rustic population of those localities the precise connexion between agricultural pursuits and statesmanship i have not been able after diligent inquiry to discover but that my investigations may not be barren of all fruit i will mention one curious statistical fact which i consider thoroughly established namely that no real farmer ever attains practically beyond a seat in general court however theoretically qualified for more exalted station  it is probable that some other prospect has been opened to mr sawin and that he has not made this great sacrifice without some definite understanding in regard to a seat in the cabinet or a foreign mission it may be supposed that we of jaalam were not untouched by a feeling of villatic pride in beholding our townsman occupying so large a space in the public eye and to me deeply revolving the qualifications necessary to a candidate in these frugal times those of mr s seemed peculiarly adapted to a successful campaign the loss of a leg an arm an eye and four fingers reduced him so nearly to the condition of a vox et præterea nihil that i could think of nothing but the loss of his head by which his chance could have been bettered but since he has chosen to baulk our suffrages we must content ourselves with what we can get remembering lactucas non esse dandas dum

leave of each other i trust with some mutual satisfaction i say patient for i love not that kind which skims dippingly over the surface of the page as swallows over a pool before rain by such no pearls shall be gathered but if no pearls there be as indeed the world is not without example of books wherefrom the longestwinded diver shall bring up no more than his proper handful of mud yet let us hope that an oyster or two may reward adequate perseverance if neither pearls nor oysters yet is patience itself a gem worth diving deeply for  it may seem to some that too much space has been usurped by my own private lucubrations and some may be fain to bring against me that old jest of him who preached all his hearers out of the meetinghouse save only the sexton who remaining for yet a little space from a sense of official duty at last gave out also and presenting the keys humbly requested our preacher to lock the doors when he should have wholly relieved himself of his testimony i confess to a satisfaction in the self act of preaching nor do i esteem a discourse to be wholly thrown away even upon a sleeping or unintelligent auditory i cannot easily believe that the gospel of st john which jacques cartier ordered to be read in the latin tongue to the canadian savages upon his first meeting with them fell altogether upon stony ground for the earnestness of the preacher is a sermon appreciable by dullest intellects and most alien ears in this wise did episcopius convert many to his opinions who yet understood not the language in which he discoursed the chief thing is that the messenger believe that he has an authentic message to deliver for counterfeit messengers that mode of treatment which father john de plano carpini relates to have prevailed among the tartars would seem effectual and perhaps deserved enough for my own part i may lay claim to so much of the spirit of martyrdom as would have led me to go into banishment with those clergymen whom alphonso the sixth of portugal drave out of his kingdom for refusing to shorten their pulpit eloquence it is possible that having been invited into my brother biglows desk i may have been too little scrupulous in using it for the venting of my own peculiar doctrines to a congregation drawn together in the expectation and with the desire of hearing him  i am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental organization which impels me like the railroadengine with its train of cars to run backward for a short distance in order to obtain a fairer start i may compare myself to one fishing from the rocks when the sea runs high who misinterpreting the suction of the undertow for the biting of some larger fish jerks suddenly and finds that he has caught bottom hauling in upon the end of his line a trail of various algæ among which nevertheless the naturalist may haply find somewhat to repay the disappointment of the angler yet have i conscientiously endeavoured to adapt myself to the impatient temper of the age daily degenerating more and more from the high standard of our pristine new england to the catalogue of lost arts i would mournfully add also that of listening to twohour sermons surely we have been abridged into a race of pigmies for truly in those of the old discourses yet subsisting to us in print the endless spinal column of divisions and subdivisions can be likened to nothing so exactly as to the vertebræ of the saurians whence the theorist may conjecture a race of anakim proportionate to the withstanding of these other monsters i say anakim rather than nephelim because there seem reasons for supposing that the race of those whose heads though no giants are constantly enveloped in clouds which that name imports will never become extinct the attempt to vanquish the innumerable heads of one of those aforementioned discourses may supply us with a plausible interpretation of the second labour of hercules and his successful experiment with fire affords us a useful precedent  but while i lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard i cannot refuse to succumb to its influence looking out through my studywindow i see mr biglow at a distance busy in gathering his baldwins of which to judge by the number of barrels lying about under the trees his crop is more abundant than my ownby which sight i am admonished to turn to those orchards of the mind wherein my
