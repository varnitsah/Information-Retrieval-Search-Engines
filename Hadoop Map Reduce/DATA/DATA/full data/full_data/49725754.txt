49725754	the argonauts of north liberty   by bret harte     part i     chapter i   the bell of the north liberty second presbyterian church had just ceased ringing north liberty connecticut never on any day a cheerful town was always bleaker and more cheerless on the seventh when the sabbath sun after vainly trying to coax a smile of reciprocal kindliness from the drawn curtains and halfclosed shutters of the austere dwellings and the equally sealed and hardset churchgoing faces of the people at last settled down into a blank stare of stony astonishment on this chilly march evening of the year 1850 that stare had kindled into an offended sunset and an angry night that furiously spat sleet and hail in the faces of the worshippers and made them fight their way to the church step by step with bent heads and fiercely compressed lips until they seemed to be carrying its forbidding portals at the point of their umbrellas  within that sacred but graceless edifice the rigors of the hour and occasion reached their climax the shivering gasjets lit up the austere pallor of the bare walls and the hollow shelllike sweep of colorless vacuity behind the cold communion table the chill of despair and hopeless renunciation was in the air untempered by any glow from the sealed airtight stove that seemed only to bring out a lukewarm exhalation of wet clothes and cheaply dyed umbrellas nor did the presence of the worshippers themselves impart any life to the dreary apartment scattered throughout the white pews in dull shapeless neutral blotches rigidly separated from each other they seemed only to accent the colorless church and the emptiness of all things a few children who had huddled together for warmth in one of the back benches and who had became glutinous and adherent through moisture were laboriously drawn out and painfully picked apart by a watchful deacon  the dry monotonous disturbance of the bell had given way to the strain of a bass viol that had been apparently pitched to the key of the east wind without and the crude complaint of a new harmonium that seemed to bewail its limited prospect of ever becoming seasoned or mellowed in its earthly tabernacle and then the singing began here and there a human voice soared and struggled above the narrow text and the monotonous cadence with a cry of individual longing but was borne down by the dull trampling precision of the others formal chant this and a certain muffled raking of the stove by the sexton brought the temperature down still lower a sermon in keeping with the previous performance in which the chill east wind of doctrine was not tempered to any shorn lamb within that dreary fold followed a spark of human and vulgar interest was momentarily kindled by the collection and the simultaneous movement of reluctant hands towards their owners pockets but the coins fell on the baizecovered plates with a dull thud like clods on a coffin and the dreariness returned then there was another hymn and a prolonged moan from the harmonium to which mysterious suggestion the congregation rose and began slowly to file into the aisle for a moment they mingled there was the silent grasping of damp woollen mittens and cold black gloves and the whispered interchange of each others names with the prefix of brother or sister and an utter absence of fraternal geniality and then the meeting slowly dispersed  the few who had waited until the minister had resumed his hat overcoat and overshoes and accompanied him to the door had already passed out the sexton was turning out the flickering gas jets one by one when the cold and austere silence was broken by a soundthe unmistakable echo of a kiss of human passion  as the horrorstricken official turned angrily the figure of a man glided from the shadow of the stairs below the organ loft and vanished through the open door before the sexton could follow the figure of a woman slipped out of the same portal and with a hurried glance after the first retreating figure turned in the opposite direction and was lost in the darkness by the time the indignant and scandalized custodian had reached the portal they had both melted in the troubled sea of tossing umbrellas already to the right and left of him and pursuit and recognition were hopeless     chapter ii   the male figure however after mingling with his fellowworshippers to the corner of the block stopped a moment under the lamppost as if uncertain as to the turning but really to cast a long scrutinizing look towards the scattered umbrellas now almost lost in the opposite direction he was still gazing and apparently hesitating whether to retrace his steps when a horse and buggy rapidly driven down the side street passed him in a brief glance he evidently recognized the driver and stepping over the curbstone called in a brief authoritative voice  ned  the occupant of the vehicle pulled up suddenly leaned from the buggy and said in an astonished tone  dick demorest well i declare hold on and ill drive up to the curb  no stay where you are  the speaker approached the buggy jumped in beside the occupant refastened the apron and coolly taking the reins from his companions hand started the horse forward the action was that of an habitually imperious man and the only recognition he made of the others ownership was the question  where were you going  hometo see joan replied the other just drove over from warensboro station but what on earth are you doing here  without answering the question demorest turned to his companion with the same goodnatured half humorous authority let your wife wait take a drive with me i want to talk to you shell be just as glad to see you an hour later and its her fault if i cant come home with you now  i know it returned his companion in a tone of halfannoyed apology she still sticks to her old compact when we first married that she shouldnt be obliged to receive my old worldly friends and see here dick i thought id talked her out of it as regards you at least but parson thomas has been raking up all the old stories about youyou know that affair of the fall river widow and that breaking off of garry spofferths matchand about your horseracinguntilyou know shes more set than ever against knowing you  thats not a bad sort of horse youve got there interrupted demorest who usually conducted conversation without reference to alien topics suggested by others where did you get him hes good yet for a spin down the turnpike and over the bridge well do it and ill bring you home safely to mrs blandford inside the hour  blandford knew little of horseflesh but like all men he was not superior to this implied compliment to his knowledge he resigned himself to his companion as he had been in the habit of doing and demorest hurried the horse at a rapid gait down the street until they left the lamps behind and were fully on the dark turnpike the sleet rattled against the hood and leathern apron of the buggy gusts of fierce wind filled the vehicle and seemed to hold it back but demorest did not appear to mind it blandford thrust his hands deeply into his pockets for warmth and contracted his shoulders as if in dogged patience yet in spite of the fact that he was tired cold and anxious to see his wife he was conscious of a secret satisfaction in submitting to the caprices of this old friend of his boyhood after all dick demorest knew what he was about and had never led him astray by his autocratic will it was safe to let dick have his way it was true it was generally dicks own waybut he made others think it was theirs tooor would have been theirs had they had the will and the knowledge to project it he looked up comfortably at the handsome resolute profile of the man who had taken selfish possession of him many women had done the same  suppose if you were to tell your wife i was going to reform said demorest it might be different eh shed want to take me into the churchanother sinner saved and all that eh  no said blandford earnestly joan isnt as rigid as all that dick what shes got against you is the common report of your free way of living and thatcome now you know yourself dick that isnt exactly the thing a woman brought up in her style can stand why she thinks im unregenerate andwell a man cant carry on business always like a class meeting but are you thinking of reforming he continued trying to get a glimpse of his companions eyes  perhaps it depends nowtheres a woman i know  what another and you call this going to reform interrupted blandford yet not without a certain curiosity in his manner  yes thats just why i think of reforming for this one isnt exactly like any otherat least as far as i know  that means you dont know anything about her  wait and ill tell you he drew the reins tightly to accelerate the horses speed and half turning to his companion without however moving his eyes from the darkness before him spoke quickly between the blasts ive seen her only half a dozen times met her first in 640 train out from boston last fall she sat next to me covered up with wraps and veils never looked twice at her she spoke firstkind of half bold half frightened way then got more comfortable and unwound herself you know and i saw she was young and not badlooking thought she was some schoolgirl out for a larkbut rather new at it inexperienced you know but quite able to take care of herself by george and although she looked and acted as if shed never spoken to a stranger all her life didnt mind the kind of stuff i talked to her rather encouraged it and laughedsuch a pretty little odd laugh as if laughing wasnt in her usual line either and she didnt know how to manage it well it ended in her slipping out at one end of the car when we arrived while i was looking out for a cab for her at the other he stopped to recover from a stronger gust of wind ii thought it a good joke on me and let the thing drop out of my mind although mind you shed promised to meet me a month afterwards at the same time and place well when the day came i happened to be in boston and went to the station dont know why i went for i didnt for a moment think shed keep her appointment first i couldnt find her in the train but after wed started she came along out of some seat in the corner prettier than ever holding out her hand he drew a long inspiration you can bet your life ned i didnt let go that little hand the rest of the journey  his passion or what passed for it seemed to impart its warmth to the vehicle and even stirred the chilled pulses of the man beside him  well who and what was she  didnt find out dont know now for the first thing she made me promise was not to follow her nor to try to know her name in return she said she would meet me again on another train near hartford she didand again and againbut always on the train for about an hour going or coming then she missed an appointment i was regularly cut up i tell you and swore as she hadnt kept her word i wouldnt keep mine and began to hunt for her in the midst of it i saw her accidentally no matter where i followed her towell thats no matter to you either enough that i saw her againand well ned such is the influence of that girl over me that by george she made me make the same promise again  blandford a little disappointed at his friends dogmatic suppression of certain material facts shrugged his shoulders  if thats all your story he said i must say i see no prospect of your reforming its the old thing over again only this time you are evidently the victim shes some designing creature who will have you if she hasnt already got you completely in her power  you dont know what youre talking about ned and youd better quit returned demorest with cheerful authoritativeness i tell you that thats the sort of girl im going to marry if i can and settle down upon you can make a memorandum of that old man if you like  then i dont really see why you want to talk to me about it and if you are thinking that such a story would go down for a moment with joan as an evidence of your reformation youre completely out dick was that your idea  yesand i can tell you youre wrong again ned you dont know anything about women you do just as i saydo you understandand dont interfere with your own wrongheaded opinions of what other people will think and ill take the risks of mrs blandford giving me good advice your wife has got a heap more sense on these subjects than you have you bet you just tell her that i want to marry the girl and want her to help methat i mean business this timeand youll see how quick shell come down thats all i want of you will you or wont you  with an outward expression of sceptical consideration and an inward suspicion of the peculiar force of this mans dogmatic insight blandford assented with i fear the mental reservation of telling the story to his wife in his own way he was surprised when his friend suddenly drew the horse up sharply and after a moments pause began to back him cramp the wheels of the buggy and then skilfully in the almost profound darkness turn the vehicle and horse completely round to the opposite direction  then you are not going over the bridge said blandford  demorest made an imperative gesture of silence the tumultuous rush and roar of swollen and rapid water came from the darkness behind them theres been another breakout somewhere and i reckon the bridge has got all it can do tonight to keep itself out of water without taking us over at least as i promised to set you down at your wifes door inside of the hour i dont propose to try as the horse now travelled more easily with the wind behind him demorest dismissing abruptly all other subjects laid his hand with brusque familiarity on his companions knee and as if the hour for social and confidential greeting had only just then arrived said well neddy old boy how are you getting on  so so said blandford dubiously you see he began argumentatively in my business theres a good deal of competition and i was only saying this morning  but either demorest was already familiar with his friends arguments or had as usual exhausted his topic for without paying the slightest attention to him he again demanded abruptly why dont you go to california here everythings played out thats the country for a young man like youjust starting into life and without incumbrances if i was free and fixed in my family affairs like you id go tomorrow  there was such an occult positivism in demorests manner that for an instant blandford who had been married two years and was transacting a steady and fairly profitable manufacturing business in the adjacent town actually believed he was more fitted for adventurous speculation than the grimly erratic man of energetic impulses and pleasures beside him he managed to stammer hesitatingly  but theres joanshe  nonsense let her stay with her mother you sell out your interest in the business put the money into an assorted cargo and clap it and yourself into the first ship out of bostonand there you are youve been married going on two years now and a little separation until youve built up a business out there wont do either of you any harm  blandford who was very much in love with his wife was not however above putting the onus of embarrassing affection upon her you dont know joan dick he replied shed never consent to a separation even for a short time  try her shes a sensible womana deuced sight more than you are you dont understand women ned thats whats the matter with you  it required all of blandfords fond memories of his wifes conservative habits puritan practicality religious domesticity and strong family attachments to withstand demorests dogmatic convictions he smiled however with a certain complacency as he also recalled the previous autumn when the first news of the california gold discovery had penetrated north liberty and he had expressed to her his belief that it would offer an outlet to demorests adventurous energy she had received it with illdisguised satisfaction and the remark that if this exodus of mammon cleared the community of the godless and unregenerate it would only be another proof of gods mysterious providence  with the tumultuous wind at their backs it was not long before the buggy rattled once more over the cobblestones of the town under the direction of his friend demorest who still retained possession of the reins drove briskly down a side street of more pretentious dwellings where blandford lived one or two wayfarers looked up  not so fast dick  why i want to bring you up to your door in style  yesbutits sunday thats my house the corner one  they had stopped before a square twostoried brick house with an equally square wooden porch supported by two plain rigid wooden columns and a hollow sweep of dull concavity above the door evidently of the same architectural order as the church there was no corner or projection to break the force of the wind that swept its smooth glacial surface there was no indication of light or warmth behind its six closed windows  there seems to be nobody at home said demorest briefly come along with me to the hotel  joan sits in the back parlor sundays explained the husband  shall i drive round to the barn and leave the horse and buggy there while you go in continued demorest goodhumoredly pointing to the stable gate at the side  no thank you returned blandford its locked and ill have to open it from the other side after i go in the horse will stand until then i think ill have to say goodnight now he added with a sudden halfashamed consciousness of the forbidding aspect of the house and his own inhospitality im sorry i cant ask you inbut you understand why  all right returned demorest stoutly turning up his coatcollar and unfurling his umbrella the hotel is only four blocks awayyoull find me there tomorrow morning if you call but mind you tell your wife just what i told youand no meandering of your ownyou hear shell strike out some idea with her womans wits you bet goodnight old man he reached out his hand pressed blandfords strongly and potentially and strode down the street  blandford hitched his steaming horse to a sleetcovered horse block with a quick sigh of impatient sympathy over the animal and himself and after fumbling in his pocket for a latchkey opened the front door a vista of wellordered obscurity with shadowy trestlelike objects against the walls and an odor of chill decorum as if of a damp but respectable funeral greeted him on entering a faint light like a cold dawn broke through the glass pane of a door leading to the kitchen blandford paused in the middarkness and hesitated should he first go to his wife in the back parlor or pass silently through the kitchen open the back gate and mercifully bestow his sweating beast in the stable with the reflection that an immediate conjugal greeting while his horse was still exposed to the fury of the blast in the street would necessarily be curtailed and limited he compromised by quickly passing through the kitchen into the stable yard opening the gate and driving horse and vehicle under the shed to await later and more thorough ministration as he entered the back door a faint hope that his wife might have heard him and would be waiting for him in the hall for an instant thrilled him but he remembered it was sunday and that she was probably engaged in some devotional reading or exercise he hesitatingly opened the backparlor door with a consciousness of committing some unreasonable trespass and entered  she was there sitting quietly before a large round shining centretable whose sterile emptiness was relieved only by a shaded lamp and a large black and gilt open volume a single picture on the opposite wallthe portrait of an elderly gentleman stiffened over a corresponding volume which he held in invincible mortmain in his rigid hand and apparently defied posterity to take from himseemed to offer a not uncongenial companionship yet the greenish light of the shade fell upon a young and pretty face despite the color it extracted from it and the hand that supported her low white forehead over which her full hair was simply parted like a brown curtain was slim and gentlewomanly in spite of her plain lustreless silk dress in spite of the formal frame of sombre heavy horsehair and mahogany furniture that seemed to set her off she diffused an atmosphere of cleanly grace and prim refinement through the apartment the priestess of this ascetic temple the femininity of her closely covered arms her pink ears and a little serviceable morocco houseshoe that was visible lower down resting on the carved lions paw that upheld the centretable appeared to be only the more accented and the precisely rounded but softly heaving bosom that was pressed upon the edges of the open book of sermons before her seemed to assert itself triumphantly over the rigors of the volume  at least so her husband and lover thought as he moved tenderly towards her she met his first kiss on her forehead the second a supererogatory one based on some supposed inefficiency in the first fell upon a shining band of her hair beside her neck she reached up her slim hands caught his wrists firmly and slightly putting him aside said  there edward  i drove out from warensboro so as to get here tonight as i have to return to the city on tuesday i thought it would give me a little more time with you joan he said looking around him and at last hesitatingly drawing an apparently reluctant chair from its formal position at the window the remembrance that he had ever dared to occupy the same chair with her now seemed hardly possible of credence  if it was a question of your travelling on the lords day edward i would rather you should have waited until tomorrow she said with slow precision  butii thought id get here in time for the meeting he said weakly  and instead you have driven through the town i suppose where everybody will see you and talk about it but she added raising her dark eyes suddenly to his where else have you been the train gets into warensboro at six and its only half an hours drive from there what have you been doing edward  it was scarcely a felicitous moment for the introduction of demorests name and he would have avoided it but he reflected that he had been seen and he was naturally truthful i met dick demorest near the church and as he had something to tell me we drove down the turnpike a little wayso as to be out of the town you know joanandand  he stopped her face had taken upon itself that appalling and exasperating calmness of very good people who never get angry but drive others to frenzy by the simple occlusion of an adamantine veil between their own feelings and their opponents ill tell you all about it after ive put up the horse he said hurriedly glad to escape until the veil was lifted again i suppose the hired man is out  i should hope he was in church edward but i trust you wont delay taking care of that poor dumb brute who has been obliged to minister to your and mr demorests sabbath pleasures  blandford did not wait for a further suggestion when the door had closed behind him mrs blandford went to the mantelshelf where a grimly allegorical clock cut down the hours and minutes of men with a scythe and consulted it with a slight knitting of her pretty eyebrows then she fell into a vague abstraction standing before the open book on the centretable then she closed it with a snap and methodically putting it exactly in the middle of the top of a black cabinet in the corner lifted the shaded lamp in her hand and passed slowly with it up the stairs to her bedroom where her light steps were heard moving to and fro in a few moments she reappeared stopping for a moment in the hall with the lighted lamp as if to watch and listen for her husbands return seen in that favorable light her cheeks had caught a delicate color and her dark eyes shone softly putting the lamp down in exactly the same place as before she returned to the cabinet for the book brought it again to the table opened it at the page where she had placed her perforated cardboard bookmarker sat down beside it and with her hands in her lap and her eyes on the page began abstractedly to tear a small piece of paper into tiny fragments when she had reduced it to the smallest shreds she scraped the pieces out of her silk lap and again collected them in the pink hollow of her little hand kneeling down on the scrupulously wellswept carpet to peck up with a birdlike action of her thumb and forefinger an escaped atom here and there these and the contents of her hand she poured into the chilly cavity of a sepulchrallooking alabaster vase that stood on the etagere returning to her old seat and making a nest for her clasped fingers in the lap of her dress she remained in that attitude her shoulders a little narrowed and bent forward until her husband returned  ive lit the fire in the bedroom for you to change your clothes by she said as he entered then evading the caress which this wifely attention provoked by bending still more primly over her book she added go at once youre making everything quite damp here  he returned in a few moments in his slippers and jacket but evidently found the same difficulty in securing a conjugal and confidential contiguity to his wife there was no apparent social centre or nucleus of comfort in the apartment its fireplace sealed by an iron ornament like a monumental tablet over dead ashes had its functions superseded by an airtight drum in the corner warmed at secondhand from the diningroom below and offered no attractive seclusion the sofa against the wall was immovable and formally repellent he was obliged to draw a chair beside the table whose every curve seemed to facilitate his wifes easy withdrawal from sidebyside familiarity  demorest has been urging me very strongly to go to california but of course i spoke of you he said stealing his hand into his wifes lap and possessing himself of her fingers  mrs blandford slowly lifted her fingers enclosed in his clasping hand and placed them in shameless publicity on the volume before her this implied desecration was too much for blandford he withdrew his hand  does that man propose to go with you asked mrs blandford coldly  no hes preoccupied with other matters that he wanted me to talk to you about said her husband hesitatingly he is  becausecontinued mrs blandford in the same measured tone if he does not add his own evil company to his advice it is the best he has ever given yet i think he might have taken another day than the lords to talk about it but we must not despise the means nor the hour whence the truth comes father wanted me to take some reasonable moment to prepare you to consider it seriously and i thought of talking to you about it tomorrow he thinks it would be a very judicious plan even deacon truesdail  having sold his invoice of damaged sugar kettles for mining purposes is converted said blandford goaded into momentary testiness by his wifes unexpected acquiescence and a sudden recollection of demorests prophecy you have changed your opinion joan since last fall when you couldnt bear to think of my leaving you he added reproachfully  i couldnt bear to think of your joining the mob of lawless and sinful men who use that as an excuse for leaving their wives and families as for my own feelings edward i have never allowed them to stand between me and what i believed best for our home and your christian welfare though i have no cause to admire the influence that i find this man demorest still holds over you i am willing to acquiesce as you see in what he advises for your good you can hardly reproach me edward for worldly or selfish motives  blandford felt keenly the bitter truth of his wifes speech for the moment he would gladly have exchanged it for a more illogical and selfish affection but he reflected that he had married this religious girl for the security of an affection which he felt was not subject to the temptations of the worldor even its own weaknessas was too often the case with the giddy maidens whom he had known through demorests companionship it was therefore more with a sense of recalling this distinctive quality of his wife than any loyalty to demorest that he suddenly resolved to confide to her the latters fatuous folly  i know it dear he said apologetically and well talk it over tomorrow and it may be possible to arrange it so that you shall go with me but speaking of demorest i think you dont quite do him justice he really respects your feelings and your knowledge of right and wrong more than you imagine i actually believe he came here tonight merely to get me to interest you in an extraordinary love affair of his i mean joan he added hastily seeing the same look of dull repression come over her face i mean joanthat is you know from all i can judgeit is something really serious this time he intends to reform and this is because he has become violently smitten with a young woman whom he has only seen half a dozen times at long intervals whom he first met in a railway train and whose name and residence he dont even know  there was an ominous silenceso hushed that the ticking of the allegorical clock came like a grim monitor then said mrs blandford in a hard dry voice that her alarmed husband scarcely recognized he proposed to insult your wife by taking her into his shameful confidence  good heavens joan noyou dont understand at the worst this is some virtuous but silly schoolgirl who though she may be intending only an innocent flirtation with him has made this man actually and deeply in love with her yes it is a fact joan i know dick demorest and if ever there was a man honestly in love it is he  then you mean to say that this manan utter stranger to mea man whom ive never laid my eyes onwhom i wouldnt know if i met in the streetexpects me to advise himtoto she stopped blandford could scarcely believe his senses there were tears in her eyesthis woman who never cried her voice trembledshe who had always controlled her emotions  he took advantage of this odd but opportune melting he placed his arm around her shoulders she tried to escape it but with a coy shy movement half hysterical half girlish unlike her usual stony moral precision yes joan he repeated laughingly but whose fault is it not his remember and i firmly believe he thinks you can do him good  but he has never seen me she continued with a nervous little laugh and probably considers me some old gorgonlikelikesister jemima skerret  blandford smiled with the complacency of farreaching masculine intuition ah that shrewd fellow demorest was right joan dear joan was only a woman after all  then hell be the more agreeably astonished he returned gayly and i think you will too joan for dick isnt a badlooking fellow most women like him its true he continued much amused at the novelty of the perfectly natural toss and grimace with which mrs blandford received this statement  i think hes been pointed out to me somewhere she said thoughtfully hes a tall dark dissipatedlooking man  nothing of the kind laughed her husband hes middlesized and as blond as your cousin joe only hes got a long yellow moustache and has a quick abrupt way of talking he isnt at all fancylooking youd take him for an energetic business man or a doctor if you didnt know him so you see joan this correct little wife of mine has been a little just a little prejudiced  he drew her again gently backwards and nearer his seat but she caught his wrists in her slim hands and rising from the chair at the same moment dexterously slipped from his embrace with her back towards him i do not know why i should be unprejudiced by anything youve told me she said sharply closing the book of sermons and with her back still to her husband reinstating it formally in its place on the cabinet its probably one of his many scandalous pursuits of defenceless and believing women and he no doubt goes off to boston laughing at you for thinking him in earnest and as ready to tell his story to anybody else and boast of his double deceit her voice had a touch of human asperity in it now which he had never before noticed but recognizing as he thought the human cause it was far from exciting his displeasure  wrong again joan hes waiting here at the independence house for me to see him tomorrow he returned cheerfully and i believe him so much in earnest that i would be ready to swear that not another person will ever know the story but you and i and he no it is a real thing with him hes dead in love and its your duty as a christian to help him  there was a moment of silence mrs blandford remained by the cabinet methodically arranging some small articles displaced by the return of the book well she said suddenly you dont tell me what mother had to say of course as you came home earlier than you expected you had time to stop thereonly four doors from this house  well no joan replied blandford in awkward discomfiture you see i met dick first and thenthen i hurried here to youandandi clean forgot it im very sorry he added dejectedly  and i more deeply so she returned with her previous bloodless moral precision for she probably knows by this time edward why you have omitted your usual sabbath visit and with whom you were  but i can pull on my boots again and run in there for a moment he suggested dubiously if you think it necessary it wont take me a moment  no she said positively it is so late now that your visit would only show it to be a second thought i will go myselfit will be a call for us both  but shall i go with you to the door it is dark and sleeting suggested blandford eagerly  no she replied peremptorily stay where you are and when ezekiel and bridget come in send them to bed for i have made everything fast in the kitchen dont wait up for me  she left the room and in a few moments returned wrapped from head to foot in an enormous plaid shawl a white woollen scarf thrown over her bare brown head and twice rolled around her neck almost concealed her face from view when she had parted from her husband and reached the darkened hall below she drew from beneath the folds of her shawl a thick blue veil with which she completely enveloped her features as she opened the front door and peered out into the night her own husband would have scarcely recognized her  with her head lowered against the keen wind she walked rapidly down the street and stopped for an instant at the door of the fourth house glancing quickly back at the house she had left and then at the closed windows of the one she had halted before she gathered her skirts with one hand and sped away from both never stopping until she reached the door of the independence hotel     chapter iii   mrs blandford entered the side door boldly luckily for her the austerities of the sabbath were manifest even here the barroom was closed and the usual loungers in the passages were absent without risking the recognition of her voice in an inquiry to the clerk she slipped past the office still muffled in her veil and quickly mounted the narrow staircase for an instant she hesitated before the public parlor and glanced dubiously along the halflit corridor chance befriended her the door of a bedroom opened at that moment and richard demorest with his overcoat and hat on stepped out in the hall  with a quick and nervous gesture of her hand she beckoned him to approach he came towards her leisurely with an amused curiosity that suddenly changed to utter astonishment as she hurriedly lifted her veil dropped it turned and glided down the staircase into the street again he followed rapidly but did not overtake her until she had reached the corner when she slackened her pace an instant for him to join her  lulu he said eagerly is it you  not a word here she said breathlessly follow me at a distance  she started forward again in the direction of her own house he followed her at a sufficient interval to keep her faintly distinguishable figure in sight until she had crossed three streets and near the end of the next block glided up the steps of a house not far from the one where he remembered to have left blandford as he joined her she had just succeeded in opening the door with a passkey and was awaiting him with a gesture of silence she took his hand in her cold fingers and leading him softly through the dark hall and passage quickly entered the kitchen here she lit a candle turned and faced him he could see that the outside shutters were bolted and the kitchen evidently closed for the night  as she removed the veil from her face he made a movement as if to regain her hand again but she drew it away  you have forced this upon me she said hurriedly and it may be ruin to us both why have you betrayed me  betrayed you lulugood god what do you mean  she looked him full in the eye and then said slowly do you mean to say that you have told no one of our meetings  only onemy old friend blandford who livesah yes i see it now you are neighbors he has betrayed me this house is  my fathers she replied boldly  the momentary uneasiness passed from demorests resolute face his old selfsufficiency returned good he said with a frank laugh that will do for me open the door there lulu and take me to him im not ashamed of anything ive done my girl nor need you be ill tell him my real name is dick demorest as i ought to have told you before and that i want to marry you fairly and squarely and let him make the conditions im not a vagabond nor a thief lulu if i have met you on the sly come dear let us end this now come  but she had thrown herself before him and placed her hand upon his lips hush are you mad listen to me i tell youpleaseoh dono you must not he had covered her hand with kisses and was drawing her face towards his own nonot again it was wrong then it is monstrous now i implore you listen if you love me stop  he released her she sank into a chair by the kitchentable and buried her flushed face in her hands  he stood for a moment motionless before her lulu if that is your name he said slowly but gently tell me all now be frank with me and trust me if there is anything stands in the way let me know what it is and i can overcome it if it is my telling ned blandford dont let that worry you hes as loyal a fellow as ever breathed and im a dog to ever think he willingly betrayed us his wife well shes one of those pious saintsbut no she would not be such a cursed hypocrite and bigot as this  hush i tell you will you hush she said in a frantic whisper springing to her feet and grasping him convulsively by the lapels of his overcoat not a word more or ill kill myself listen do you know what i brought you here for why i left mythis house and dragged you out of your hotel well it was to tell you that you must leave me leave herego out of this house and out of this town at once tonight and never look on it or me again there you have said we must end this now it is ended as only it could and ever would end and if you open that door except to go or if you attempt toto touch me again ill do something desperate there  she threw him off again and stepped back strangely beautiful in the loosened shackles of her long repressed human emotion it was as if the passionrent robes of the priestess had laid bare the flesh of the woman dazzling and victorious demorest was fascinated and frightened  then you do not love me he said with a constrained smile and i am a fool  love you she repeated love you she continued bowing her brown head over her hanging arms and clasped hands what then has brought me to this oh she said suddenly again seizing him by his two arms and holding him from her with a halfprudish halfpassionate gesture why could you not have left things as they were why could we not have met in the same old way we used to meet when i was so foolish and so happy why could you spoil that one dream i have clung to why didnt you leave me those few days of my wretched life when i was weak silly vain but not the unhappy woman i am now you were satisfied to sit beside me and talk to me then you respected my secret my reserve my god i used to think you loved me as i loved youfor that why did you break your promise and follow me here i believed you the first day we met when you said there was no wrong in my listening to you that it should go no further that you would never seek to renew it without my consent you tell me i dont love you and i tell you now that we must part that frightened as i was foolish as i was that day was the first day i had ever lived and felt as other women live and feel if i ran away from you then it was because i was running away from my old self too dont you understand me could you not have trusted me as i trusted you  i broke my promise only when you broke yours when you would not meet me i followed you here because i loved you  and that is why you must leave me now she said starting from his outstretched arms again do not ask me why but go i implore you you must leave this town tonight tomorrow will be too late  he cast a hurried glance around him as if seeking to gather some reason for this mysterious haste or a clue for future identification he saw only the sabbathsealed cupboards the cold white china on the dresser and the flicker of the candle on the partlyopened glass transom above the door as you wish he said with quiet sadness i will go now and leave the town tonight buthis voice struck its old imperative notethis shall not end here lulu there will be a next time and i am bound to win you yet in spite of all and everything  she looked at him with a halffrightened halfhysterical light in her eyes god knows  and you will be frank with me then and tell me all  yes yes another time but go now she had extinguished the candle turned the handle of the door noiselessly and was holding it open a faint light stole through the dark passage she drew back hastily you have left the front door open she said in a frightened voice i thought you had shut it behind me he returned quickly good night he drew her towards him she resisted slightly they were for an instant clasped in a passionate embrace then there was a sudden collapse of the light and a dull jar the front door had swung to  with a desperate bound she darted into the passage and through the hall dragging him by the hand and threw the front door open without the street was silent and empty  go she whispered frantically  demorest passed quickly down the steps and disappeared at the same moment a voice came from the banisters of the landing above whos there  its i mother  i thought so and its like edward to bring you and sneak off in that fashion  mrs blandford gave a quick sigh of relief demorests flight had been mistaken for her husbands habitual evasion knowing that her mother would not refer to the subject again she did not reply but slowly mounted the dark staircase with an assumption of more than usual hesitating precaution in order to recover her equanimity   the clocks were striking eleven when she left her mothers house and reentered her own she was surprised to find a light burning in the kitchen and ezekiel their hired man awaiting her in a dominant and nasal key of religious and practical disapprobation pity you wernt tu hum afore maam considerin the doins thats goin on in perfessed christians houses arter meetin on the sabbath day  whats the difficulty now ezekiel said mrs blandford who had regained her rigorous precision once more under the decorous security of her own roof  waal here comes an entire stranger axin for squire blandford and when i tells he warnt tu hum  not at home interrupted mrs blandford with a slight start i left him here  mebbee so but folks nowadays dont pear to keer much whether they break the sabbath or not trapsen raound town in and arter meetin hours ez if twor ginral tranin dayand hez gone out agin  go on said mrs blandford curtly  waal the stranger sez sez he show me the way to the stables sez he and

and he was john c calhoun hisself id a chucked it after him if it hadnt been the lords day and it mout hev provoked disturbance  mr demorest is worldly but one of edwards old friends said mrs blandford with a slight kindling of her eyes and he would not have refused to aid him in what might be an errand of grace or necessity you can keep the money ezekiel as a gift not as a wage and go to bed i will sit up for mr blandford  she passed out and up the staircase into her bedroom pausing on her way to glance into the empty back parlor and take the lamp from the table here she noticed that her husband had evidently changed his clothes again and taken a heavier overcoat from the closet removing her own wraps she again descended to the lower apartment brought out the volume of sermons placed it and the lamp in the old position and with her abstracted eyes on the page fell into her former attitude every suggestion of the passionate halffrenzied woman in the kitchen of the house only four doors away had vanished one would scarcely believe she had ever stirred from the chair in which she had formally received her husband two hours before and yet she was thinking of herself and demorest in that kitchen  his prompt and decisive response to her appeal as shown in this last bold and characteristic action relieved while it half piqued her but the overruling destiny which had enabled her to bring him from his hotel to her mothers house unnoticed had protected them while there had arrested a dangerous meeting between him and herself and her husband in her own house impressed her more than all it imparted to her a hideous tranquillity born of the doctrines of her youthpredestination she reflected with secret exultation that her moral resolution to fly from him and her conscientiously broken promise had been the direct means of bringing him there that step by step circumstances not in themselves evil or to be combated had led her along that even her husband and mother had felt it their duty to assist towards this fateful climax if edward had never kept up his worldly friendship if she had never been restricted and compassed in her own if she had ever known the freedom of other girlsall this might not have happened she had been elected to share with demorest and her husband the effects of their ungodliness she was no longer a free agent what availed her resolutions to demorests imperious hope she had said god knows what more could she say her small red lips grew white and compressed her face rigid her eyes hollow and abstracted she looked like the genius of asceticism as she sat there grimly formulating a dogmatic explanation of her lawless and unlicensed passion  the wind had risen to a gale without and stirred even the sealed sepulchre of the fireplace with dull rumblings and muffled moans at times the hotair drum in the corner seemed to expand as with some pentup emotion strange currents of air crossed the empty room like the passage of unseen spirits and she even fancied she heard whispers at the window this caused her to rise and open it when she found that the sleet had given way to a dry feathery snow that was swarming through the slits of the shutter a faint reflection from the already whitened fences glimmered in the panes she shut the window hastily with a little shiver of cold where was demorest in this storm would it stop him she thought with pride now of the dominant energy that had frightened her and knew it would not but her husbandwhat kept him it was twelve oclock he had seldom stayed out so late before during the first half hour of her reflections she had been relieved by his absence she had even believed that he had met demorest in the town and was not alarmed by it for she knew that the latter would avoid any further confidence and cut short any return to it but why had not edward returned for an instant the terrible thought that something had happened and that they might both return together took possession of her and she trembled but no demorest who had already taken such extreme measures could not consistently listen to any suggestion for delay as her only danger lay in demorests presence the absence of her husband caused her more undefinable uneasiness than actual alarm  the room had become cold with the dying out of the diningroom fire that warmed the drum she would go to bed she nevertheless arranged the room again with a singular impression that she was doing it for the last time in her present existing circumstances and placing the lamp on the table in the hall went up to her own room by the light of a single candle she undressed herself hastily said her prayers punctiliously and got into bed with an unexpected relief at finding herself still occupying it alone then she fell asleep and dreamed of demorest     chapter iv   when edward blandford found himself alone after his wife had undertaken to fulfil his abandoned filial duty at her parents house he felt a slight twinge of selfreproach he could not deny that this was not the first time he had evaded the sterile sabbath evenings at his motherinlaws or that even at other times he was not in accord with the cold and colorless sanctity of the family yet he remembered that when he picked out from the budding womanhood of north liberty this pure scentless blossom he had endured the privations of its surroundings with a sense of security in inhaling the atmosphere in which it grew and knowing the integrity of its descent there was a certain pleasure also in invading this seclusion with human passion the first pressure of her hand when they were kneeling together at family prayers had the zest without the sin of a forbidden pleasure the first kiss he had given her with their heads over the family bible had fairly intoxicated him in the thin rarefied air of their surroundings in transplanting this blossom to his own home with the fond belief that it would eventually borrow the hues and color of his own passion he had no further interest in the house he had left behind when he found however that the ancestral influence was stronger than he expected that the young wife instead of assimilating to his conditions had imported into their little household the rigors of her youthful home he had been chilled and disappointed but he could not help also remembering that his own boyhood had been spent in an atmosphere like her own in everything but its sincerity and deep conviction his father had recognized the business value of placating the narrow tyranny of the respectable welltodo religious community and had become a conscious hypocrite and a popular citizen he had himself been under that influence and it was partly a conviction of this that had drawn him towards her as something genuine and real it occurred to him now for the first time as he looked around upon that compromise of their two lives in this chilly artificial home that it was only natural that she would prefer the more truthful austerities of her mothers house had she detected the sham and did she despise him for it  these were questions which seemed to bring another selfaccusing doubt in his own mind although without his being conscious of it they had been really the outcome of that doubt he could not help dwelling on the singular human interest she had taken in demorests love affair and the utterly unexpected emotion she had shown he had never seen her as charmingly illogical capricious and bewitchingly feminine had he not made a radical mistake in not giving her a frequent provocation for this innocent emotionin fact in not taking her out into a world of broader sympathies and experiences what a household they might have hadif necessary in some other townaway from those cramped prejudices and limitations what friends she might have been with dick and his other worldly acquaintances what social pleasuresguiltless amusements for her pure mindin theatres parties and concerts would she have objected to themhad he ever seriously proposed them to her no if she had objected there would have been time enough to have made this present compromise she would have at least respected and understood his sacrificeand his friends  even the artificial externals of his household had never before so visibly impressed him now that she was no longer in the room it did not even bear a trace of her habitation it certainly bore no suggestion of his own why had he bought that hideous horsehair furniture to remind her of the old provincial heirlooms of her fathers sittingroom did it remind her of it the stiff and stony emptiness of this room had been fashioned upon the decorous respectability of his own fathers parlorin which his father who usually spent his slippered leisure in the family sittingroom never entered except on visits from the minister it had chilled his own youthful soulwhy had he perpetuated it here  he could only answer these questions by moodily wandering about the house and regretting he had not gone with her after a vain attempt to establish social and domestic relations with the hotair drum by putting his feet upon itafter an equally futile attempt to extract interest from the book of sermons by opening its pages at randomhe glanced at the clock and suddenly resolved to go and fetch her it would remind him of the old times when he used to accompany her from church and after her parents had retired spend a blissful halfhour alone with her with what a mingling of fear and childish curiosity she used to accept his equally timid caresses yes he would go and fetch her and he would recall it to her in a whisper while they were there  filled with this idea when he changed his clothes again he put on a certain heavy beaver overcoat on whose shaggy sleeve her little hand had so often rested when he escorted her from meeting and he even selected the gray muffler she had knit for him in the old antenuptial days it was lying in the halfopened drawer from where she had not long before taken her disguising veil  it was still blowing in sudden capricious gusts and when he opened the front door the wind charged fiercely upon him as if to drive him back when he had finally forced his way into the street a return current closed the door as suddenly and sharply behind him as if it had ejected him from his home for ever  he reached the fourth house quickly and as quickly ran up the steps his hand was upon the bell when his eye suddenly caught sight of his wifes passkey still in the lock she had evidently forgotten it here was a chance to mischievously banter that habitually careful little woman he slipped it into his pocket and quietly entered the dark but perfectly familiar hall he reached the staircase without a stumble and began to ascend softly halfway up he heard the sound of his wifes hurried voice and another that startled him he ascended hastily two steps which brought him to the level of the halfopened transom of the kitchen a candle was burning on the kitchen table he could see everything that passed in the room he could hear distinctly every word that was uttered  he did not utter a cry or sound he did not even tremble he remained so rigid and motionless clutching the banisters with his stiffened fingers that when he did attempt to move all life as well as all that had made life possible to him seemed to have died from him for ever there was no nervous illusion no dimming of his senses he saw everything with a hideous clarity of perception by some diabolical instantaneous photography of the brain little actions peculiarities touches of gesture expression and attitude never before noted by him in his wife were clearly fixed and bitten in his consciousness he saw the color of his friends overcoat the reddish tinge of his wifes brown hair till then unnoticed in that supreme moment he was aware of a sudden likeness to her mother but more terrible than all there seemed to be a nameless sympathetic resemblance that the guilty pair had to each other in gesture and movement as of some unhallowed relationship beyond his ken he knew not how long he stood there without breath without reflection without one connected thought he saw her suddenly put her hand on the handle of the door he knew that in another moment they would pass almost before him he made a convulsive effort to move with an inward cry to god for support and succeeded in staggering with outstretched palms against the wall down the staircase and blindly forward through the hall to the front door as yet he had been able to formulate only one ideato escape before them for it seemed to him that their contact meant the ruin of them both of that house of all that was near to hima catastrophe that struck blindly at his whole visible world he had reached the door and opened it at the moment that the handle of the kitchendoor was turned he mechanically fell back behind the open door that hid him while it let the cruel light glimmer for a moment on their clasped figures the door slipped from his nerveless fingers and swung to with a dull sound crouching still in the corner he heard the quick rush of hurrying feet in the darkness saw the door open and demorest glide outsaw her glance hurriedly after him close the door and involve herself and him in the blackness of the hall her dress almost touched him in his corner he could feel the near scent of her clothes and the air stirred by her figure retreating towards the stairs could hear the unlocking of a door above and the voice of her mother from the landing his wifes reply the slow fading of her footsteps on the stairs and overhead the closing of a door and all was quiet again still stooping he groped for the handle of the door opened it and the next moment reeled like a drunken man down the steps into the street  it was well for him that a fierce onset of wind and sleet at that instant caught him savagelystirred his stagnated blood into action and beat thought once more into his brain he had mechanically turned towards his own home his first effort of recovering will hurried him furiously past it and into a side street he walked rapidly but undeviatingly on to escape observation and secure some solitude for his returning thoughts almost before he knew it he was in the open fields  the idea of vengeance had never crossed his mind he was neither a physical nor a moral coward but he had never felt the merely animal fury of disputed animal possession which the world has chosen to recognize as a proof of outraged sentiment nor had north liberty accepted the ethics that an exchange of shots equalized a transferred affection his love had been too pure and too real to be moved like the beasts of the field to seek in one brutal passion compensation for another killingwhat was there to kill all that he had to live for had been already slain with the love that was in himin themalready dead at his feet what was it to him whether these two hollow lives moved on and passed him or mingled their emptiness elsewhere only let them henceforth keep out of his way  for in his first feverish flow of thoughtthe reaction to his benumbed will within and the beating sleet withouthe believed demorest as treacherous as his wife he recalled his sudden and unexpected intrusion into the buggy only a few hours before his mysterious confidences his assurance of joans favorable reception of his secret and her consent to the californian trip what had all this meant if not that demorest was using him the husband to assist his intrigue and carry the news of his presence in the town to her and this boldness this assurance this audacity of conception was like demorest while only certain passages of the guilty meeting he had just seen and overheard were distinctly impressed on his mind he remembered now with hideous and terrible clearness all that had gone before it was part of the disturbed and unequal exaltation of his faculties that he dwelt more upon this and his wifes previous deceit and manifest hypocrisy than upon the actual evidence he had witnessed of her unfaithfulness the corroboration of the fact was stronger to him than the fact itself he understood the coldness the uncongeniality nowthe simulated increase of her aversion to demoresther journeys to boston and hartford to see her relatives her acquiescence to his frequent absences not an incident not a characteristic of her married life was inconsistent with her guilt and her deceit he went even back to her maidenhood how did he know this was not the legitimate sequence of other secret schoolgirl escapades the bitter worldly light that had been forced upon his simple ingenuous nature had dazzled and blinded him he passed from fatuous credulity to equally fatuous distrust  he stopped suddenly with the roaring of water before him in the furious following of his rapid thought through storm and darkness he had come he knew not how upon the bank of the swollen river whose endangered bridge demorest had turned from that evening a few steps more and he would have fallen into it he drew nearer and looked at it with vague curiosity had he come there with any definite intention the thought sobered without frightening him there was always that culmination possible and to be considered coolly  he turned and began to retrace his steps on his way thither he had been fighting the elements step by step now they seemed to him to have taken possession of him and were hurrying him quickly away but where and to what he was always thinking of the past he had wandered he knew not how long always thinking of that it was the future he had to consider what was to be done  he had heard of such cases before he had read of them in newspapers and talked of them with cold curiosity but they were of worldly sinful people of dissolute men whose characters he could not conceiveof silly vain frivolous and abandoned women whom he had never even met but joano god it was the first time since his mute prayer on the staircase that the divine name had been wrested from his lips it came with his wifesand his first tears but the wind swept the one away and dried the others upon his hot cheeks  it had ceased to rain and the wind which was still high had shifted more to the north and was bitterly cold he could feel the roadway stiffening under his feet when he reached the pavement of the outskirts once more he was obliged to take the middle of the street to avoid the treacherous films of ice that were beginning to glaze the sidewalks yet this very inclemency added to the usual sabbath seclusion had left the streets deserted he was obliged to proceed more slowly but he met no one and could pursue his bewildering thoughts unchecked as he passed between the lines of cold colorless houses from which all light and life had vanished it seemed to him that their occupants were dead as his love or had fled their ruined houses as he had why should he remain yet what was his duty now as a manas a christian his eye fell on the hideous facade of the church he was passingher church he gave a bitter laugh and stumbled on again  with one of the gusts he fancied he heard a familiar soundthe rattling of buggy wheels over the stiffening road or was it merely the fanciful echo of an idea that only at that moment sprung up in his mind if it was real it came from the street parallel with the one he was in who could be driving out at this time what other buggy than his own could be found to desecrate this christian sabbath an irresistible thought impelled him at the risk of recognition to quicken his pace and turn the corner as richard demorest drove up to the independence hotel sprang from his buggy throwing the reins over the dashboard and disappeared into the hotel  blandford stood still but for an instant only he had been wandering for an hour aimlessly hopelessly without consecutive idea coherent thought or plan of action without the faintest inspiration or suggestion of escape from his bewildering torment withouthe had begun to feareven the power to conceive or the will to execute when a wild idea flashed upon him with the rattle of his buggy wheels and even as demorest disappeared into the hotel he had conceived his plan and executed it he crossed the street swiftly leaped into his buggy lifted the reins and brought down the whip simultaneously and the next instant was dashing down the street in the direction of the warensboro turnpike so sudden was the action that by the time the astonished hall porter had rushed into the street horse and buggy had already vanished in the darkness  presently it began to snow so lightly at first that it seemed a mere passing whisper to the ear the brush of some viewless insect upon the cheek or the soft tap of unseen fingers on the shoulders but by the time the porter returned from his hopeless and invisible chase of the runaway he came in out of a swarming cloud of whirling flakes blinded and whitened there was a hurried consultation with the landlord the exhibition of much imperious energy and some banknotes from demorest and with a glance at the clock that marked the expiring limit of the puritan sabbath the landlord at last consented by the time the falling snow had muffled the street from the indiscreet clamor of sabbathbreaking hoofs the landlords noiseless sledge was at the door and demorest had departed  the snow fell all that night with fierce gusts of wind that moaned in the chimneys of north liberty and sorely troubled the sabbath sleep of its decorous citizens with deep passionless silences none the less fateful that softly precipitated a spotless mantle of merciful obliteration equally over their precise or their straying footprints that would have done them good to heed and to remember and when morning broke upon a world of weekday labor it was covered as far as their eyes could reach as with a clear and unwritten tablet on which they might record their lives anew near the wreck of the broken bridge on the warensboro turnpike an overturned buggy lay imbedded in the drift and debris of the river hurrying silently towards the sea and a horse with fragments of broken and icy harness still clinging to him was found standing before the stabledoor of edward blandford but to any further knowledge of the fate of its owner north liberty awoke never again   part ii    chapter i   the last note of the angelus had just rung out of the crumbling fissures in the tower of the mission chapel of san buenaventura the sun which had beamed that day and indeed every day for the whole dry season over the redtiled roofs of that old and happily ventured pueblo seemed to broaden to a smile as it dipped below the horizon as if in undiminished enjoyment of its old practical joke of suddenly plunging the southern california coast in darkness without any preliminary twilight the olive and fig trees at once lost their characteristic outlines in formless masses of shadow only the twisted trunks of the old pear trees in the mission garden retained their grotesque shapes and became gruesome in the gathering gloom the encircling pines beyond closed up their serried files a cool breeze swept down from the coast range and passing through them sent their daylong heated spices through the town  if there was any truth in the local belief that the pious incantation of the angelus bell had the power of excluding all evil influence abroad at that perilous hour within its audible radius and comfortably keeping all unbelieving wickedness at a distance it was presumably ineffective as regarded the innovating stagecoach from monterey that twice a week at that hour brought its questionasking revolverpersuading and fortuneseeking load of passengers through the sleepy spanish town on the night of the 3d of august 1856 it had not only brought but set down at the posada one of those passengers it was a mr ezekiel corwin formerly known to these pages as hired man to the late squire blandford of north liberty connecticut but now a shrewd practical selfsufficient and selfasserting unit of the more cautious later californian immigration as the stage rattled away again with more or less humorous and open disparagement of the town and the posada from its outsiders he lounged with lazy but systematic deliberation towards mateo morez the proprietor  i guess that some of your folks here couldnt direct me to dick demorests house could ye  the senor mateo morez was at once perplexed and pained pained at the ignorance thus forced upon him by a caballero perplexed as to its intention between the two he smiled apologetically but gravely and said no sabe senor i ave not understood  no more hev i returned ezekiel with patronizing recognition of his obtuseness i guess ez heow you aint much on american you folks orter learn the language if you kalkilate to keep a hotel  but the momentary vision of a waistless woman with a shawl gathered over her head and shoulders at the back door attracted his attention she said something to mateo in spanish and the yellowishwhite of mateos eyes glistened with intelligent comprehension  ah posiblemente it is don ricardo demorest you wish  mr ezekiels face and manner expressed a mingling of grateful curiosity and some scorn at the discovery waal he said looking around as if to take the entire posada into his confidence way up in north liberty where i kem from he was allus known as dick demorest and didnt tack any forrin titles to his name et wouldnt hev gone down there i reckon mongst freeborn merikin citizens no morn aliases would in courtand i kinder guess for the same reason but folks get peart and sassy when theyre way from hum and put on ez many airs as a buck nigger and so he calls hisself don ricardo here does he  the senor knows don ricardo said mateo politely  ef you mean mewaal yesi should say so he was a partiklar friend of a man ive known since he was kneehigh to a grasshopper  ezekiel had actually never seen demorest but once in his life he would have scorned to lie but strict accuracy was not essential with an ignorant foreign audience  he took up his carpetbag  i reckon i kin find his house ef its anyway handy  but the senor mateo was again politely troubled the house of don ricardo was of a truth not more than a mile distant it was even possible that the senor had observed it above a wall and vineyard as he came into the pueblo but it was lateit was also dark as the senor would himself perceiveand there was still tomorrow tomorrowah it was always there meanwhile there were beds of a miraculous quality at the posada and a supper such as a caballero might order in his own house health discretion solicitude for oneselfall pointed clearly to tomorrow  what part of this speech ezekiel understood affected him only as an innkeepers bid for custom and as such to be steadily exposed and disposed of with the remark that he guessed dick demorests was a good enough hotel for him and that hed better be getting along there he walked down the steps carpetbag in hand and coolly departed leaving mateo pained but smiling on the doorstep  an animal with a pigs headwithout doubt said mateo sententiously  clearly a brigand with the liver of a chicken responded his wife  the subject of this ambiguous criticism happily oblivious meantime walked doggedly back along the road the stagecoach had just brought him it was badly paved and hollowed in the middle with the worn ruts of a century of slow undeviating ox carts and the passage of water during the rainy season the low adobe houses on each side with bright cinnamoncolored tiles relieving their darkbrown walls had the regular outlines of their doors and windows obliterated by the crumbling of years until they looked as if they had been afterthoughts of the builder rudely opened by pick and crowbar and finished by the gentle auxiliary architecture of birds and squirrels yet these openings at times permitted glimpses of a picturesque past in the occasional view of a laceedged pillow or silken counterpane striped hangings or dyed indian rugs the flitting of a flounced petticoat or flowercovered head or the indolent leaning figure framed in a doorway of a man in wide velvet trousers and crimsonbarred serape whose brown face was partly hidden in a yellow nimbus of cigarette smoke even in the semidarkness ezekiels penetrating and impertinent eyes took eager note of these facts with superior complacency quite unmindful after the fashion of most critical travellers of the hideous contrast of his own long shapeless nankeen duster his stiff halfclerical brown straw hat his wisp of gingham necktie his dusty boots his outrageous carpetbag and his straggling goatlike beard a few looked at him in grave discreet wonder whether they recognized in him the advent of a civilization that was destined to supplant their own ignorant sensuous colorful life with austere intelligence and rigid practical improvement did not appear he walked steadily on as he passed the low arched door of the mission church and saw a faint light glimmering from the side windows he had indeed a weak human desire to go in and oppose in his own person a debased and idolatrous superstition with some happily chosen question that would necessarily make the officiating priest and his congregation exceedingly uncomfortable but he resisted partly in the hope of meeting some idolater on his way to benediction and in the guise of a stranger seeking information dropping a few unpalatable truths and partly because he could unbosom himself later to demorest who he was not unwilling to believe had embraced popery with his adoption of a spanish surname and title  it had become quite dark when he reached the long wall that enclosed demorests premises the wall itself excited his resentment not only as indicating an exclusiveness highly objectionable in a man who had emigrated from a free state but because he ezekiel corwin had difficulty in discovering the entrance when he succeeded he found himself before an iron gate happily open but savoring offensively of feudalism and tyrannical proprietorship and passed through and entered an avenue of trees scarcely distinguishable in the darkness whose mysterious shapes and feathery plumes were unknown to him numberless odors equally vague and mysterious were heavy in the air strange and delicate plants rose dimly on either hand enormous blossoms like ghostly faces seemed to peer at him from the shadows for an instant ezekiel succumbed to an unprofitable sense of beauty and acquiesced in this reckless extravagance of nature that was so unlike north liberty but the next moment he recovered himself with the reflection that it was probably unhealthy and doggedly approached the house it was a long onestoried structure apparently all roof vine and pillared veranda every window and door was open the two or three grass hammocks swung emptily between the columns the bamboo chairs and settees were vacant his heavy footsteps on the floor had summoned no attendant not even a dog had barked as he approached the house it was shiftless it was sinfulit boded no good to the future of demorest  he put down his carpetbag on the veranda and entered the broad hall where an oldfashioned lantern was burning on a stand here too the doors of the various apartments were open and the rooms themselves empty of occupants an opportunity not to be lost by ezekiels inquiring mind thus offered itself he took the lantern and deliberately examined the several apartments the furniture the bedding and even the small articles that were on the tables and mantels when he had completed the roundincluding a corridor opening on a dark courtyard which he did not penetratehe returned to the hall and set down the lantern again  well said a voice in his own familiar vernacular i hope you like it  ezekiel was surprised but not disconcerted what he had taken in the shadow for a bundle of serapes lying on the floor of the veranda was the recumbent figure of a man who now raised himself to a sitting posture  ez to that drawled ezekiel with unshaken selfpossession whether i like it or not ez only a question betwixt kempany manners and truthtelling beggars hadnt oughter be choosers and transient visitors like myself neednt allus speak their mind but if you mean to signify that with every door and window open and universal shiftlessness lying round everywhere temptin providence you aint lucky in havin a fellercitizen of yours drop in on ye instead of some mexican thief i dont agree with yethats all  the man laughed shortly and rose up in spite of his careless yet picturesque mexican dress ezekiel instantly recognized demorest with his usual instincts he was naturally pleased to observe that he looked older and more careworn the softer sensuous climate had perhaps imparted a heaviness to his figure and a deliberation to his manner that was quite unlike his own potential energy  that dont tell me who you are and what you want he said coldly  waal then im ezekiel corwin of north liberty ez used to live with my friend and yours too i guessseein how the friendship was swapped into relationshipsquire blandford  a slight shade passed over demorests face well he said impatiently i dont remember you what then  you dont remember me thats likely returned ezekiel imperturbably combing his straggling chin beard with three fingers but whether its natral or not considerin the sukumstances when we last met ez a matter of oppinion you got me to harness up the hoss and buggy the night squire blandford left home and never was heard of again its true that it kem out on enquiry that the hoss and buggy ran away from the hotel and that you had to go out to warensboro in a sleigh and the theory is that poor squire blandford must have stopped the hoss and buggy somewhere got in and got run away agin and pitched over the bridge but seein your relationship to both squire and mrs blandford and all the sukumstances i reckoned youd remember it  i heard of it in boston a month afterwards said demorest dryly but i dont think id have recognized you so you were the hired man who gave me the buggy well i dont suppose they discharged you for it  no said ezekiel with undisturbed equanimity i kalkilate joan would have stopped that considerin too that i knew her when she was deacon salisburys darter and our famlies waz thick az peas she knew me well enough when i met her in frisco the other day  have you seen mrs demorest already said demorest with sudden vivacity why didnt you say so before it was wonderful how quickly his face had lighted up with an earnestness that was not however without some undefinable uneasiness the alert ezekiel noticed it and observed that it was as totally unlike the irresistible dominance of the man of five years ago as it was different from the heavy abstraction of the man of five minutes before  i reckon you didnt ax me he returned coolly she told me where you were and as i had business down this way she guessed i might drop in  yes yesits all right mr corwin glad you did said demorest kindly but half nervously and you saw mrs demorest where did you see her and how did you think she was looking as pretty as ever eh  but the coldly literal ezekiel was not to be beguiled into polite or ambiguous fiction he even went to the extent of insulting deliberation before he replied ive seen joan salisbury lookin healthier and ez far ez i kin judge doin more credit to her stock and raisin ginrally he said thoughtfully combing his beard and ive seen her when she was too poor to get the silks and satins furbelows fineries and vanities shes flauntin in now and that was in squire blandfords time too i reckon ez to her purtiness thats a matter of taste you think her purty and i guess them fellows ez was escortin and squirin her round frisco thought so too or she thought they did to hev allowed it  you are not very merciful to your townsfolk mr corwin said demorest with a forced smile but what can i do for you  it was the turn for ezekiels face to brighten or rather to break up like a cold passionless mirror suddenly cracked into various amusing but distorted reflections on the person before him townies aint to be fooled by other townies mr demorest at least that aint my idea o marcy hehe but seen youre pressin i dont mind tellen you my business im the only agent of seventeen patent medicine proprietors in connecticut represented by the firm of dilworth  dusenberry of san francisco mebbe you heard of em aforea1 druggists and importers waal im openin a field for em and spreadin em ginrally through these air benighted and onhealthy districts havin the contract for the hull stateespecially for wozuns universal injin panacea ez cures everythingbein had from a recipe given by a sachem to dr wozuns granther that bagleavin out a dozen paper collars and socksis all the rest samples thats me ezekiel corwinonly agent for californy and thats my mission  very well but look here corwin said demorest with a slight return of his old offhand mannerid advise you to adopt a little more caution and a little less criticism in your speech to the people about here or im afraid youll need the universal panacea for yourself better men than you have been shot in my presence for half your freedom  i guess youve just hit the bullseye there replied ezekiel coolly for its that halffreedom and halftruth that doesnt pay i kalkilate ginrally to speak my hull mindand i do wots the consequence why when folks find i aint afeard to speak my mind on their affairs they kinder guess im tellin the truth about my own folks dont like the man that truckles to em whether its in the sellin of a box of pills or a principle when they recognize ezekiel corwin aint goin to lie about em to curry favor with em theyre ready to believe he aint goin to lie about jones bitters or wozuns panacea and waal ive been on the road just about a fortnit and i havent yet discovered that the original independent style introduced by ezekiel corwin ever broke anybodys bones or didnt pay  and he told the truth that remarkably unfair and unpleasant spoken man had actually frozen hanleys ford into icy astonishment at his audacity and he had sold them an invoice of the panacea before they had recovered he had insulted chipitas into giving an extensive order in bitters he had left haywards creek pledged to burnes pillswith drawn revolvers still in their hands  at another time demorest might have been amused at his guests audacity or have combated it with his old imperiousness but he only remained looking at him in a dull sort of way as if yielding to his influence it was part of the phenomenon that the two men seemed to have changed character since they last met and when ezekiel said confidentially i reckon youre goin to show me what room i ken stow these duds o mine in demorest replied hurriedly yes certainly and taking up his guests carpetbag preceded him through the hall to one of the apartments  ill send manuel to you presently he said putting down the bag mechanically the servants are not back from church its some saints festival today  and so you keep a pack of lazy idolaters to leave your house to take care of itself whilst they worship graven images said ezekiel delighted at this opportunity to improve the occasion  if my memory isnt bad mr corwin said demorest dryly when i accompanied mr blandford home the night he returned from his journey we found you at church and he had to put up his horse himself  but that was the sabbaththe seventh day of the command retorted ezekiel  and here the sabbath doesnt consist of only one day to serve god in said demorest sententiously  ezekiel glanced under his white lashes at demorests thoughtful face his fondest fears appeared to be confirmed demorest had evidently become a papist but that gentleman stopped any theological discussion by the abrupt inquiry  did mrs demorest say when she thought of returning  she allowed she mout kem tomorrowbut added ezekiel dubiously  but what  waal wot with her enjyments of the vanities of this life and the kempany she keeps i reckon shes in no hurry said ezekiel cheerfully  the entrance of manuel here cut short any response from demorest who after a few directions in spanish to the peon left his guest to himself  he walked to the veranda with the same dull preoccupation that ezekiel had noticed as so different from his old decisive manner and remained for a few moments abstractedly gazing into the dark garden the strange and mystic shapes which had impressed even the practical ezekiel had become even more weird and ghostlike in the faint radiance of a rising moon  what memories evoked by his rude guest seemed to take form and outline in that dreamy and unreal expanse  he saw his wife again standing as she had stood that night in her mothers house with the white muffler around her head and white face imploring him to fly he saw himself again hurrying through the driving storm to warensboro and reaching the train that bore him swiftly and safely miles awaythat same night when her husband was perishing in the swollen river he remembered with what strangely mingled sensations he had read the account of blandfords death in the newspapers and how the loss of his old friend was forgotten in the associations conjured up by his singular meeting that very night with the mysterious woman he had loved he remembered that he had never dreamed how near and fateful were these associations and how he had kept his promise not to seek her without her permission until six months after when she appointed a meeting and revealed to him the whole truth he could see her now as he had seen her then more beautiful and fascinating than ever in her black dress and the pensive grace of refined suffering and restrained passion in her delicate face he remembered too how the shock of her disclosurethe knowledge that she had been his old friends wifeseemed only to accent her purity and suffering and his own wilful recklessness and how it had stirred all the chivalry generosity and affection of his easy nature to take the whole responsibility of this innocent but compromising intrigue on his own shoulders he had had no selfaccusing sense of disloyalty to blandford in his practical nature he had never suspected the shy proper girl of being his wife he was willing to believe now that had he known it even that night he would never have seen her again he had been very foolish he had made this poor woman participate in his folly but he had never been dishonest or treacherous in thought or action if blandford had lived even he would have admitted it yet he was guiltily conscious of a material satisfaction in blandfords death without his wifes religious conviction of the saving graces of predestination  they had been married quietly when the two years of her widowhood had expired his former relations with her husband and the straitened circumstances in which blandfords death had left her having been deemed sufficient excuse in the eyes of north liberty for her more worldly union they had come to california at her suggestion to begin life anew for she had not hesitated to make this dislocation of all her antecedent surroundings as a reason as well as a condition of this marriage she wished to see the world of which he had been a passing glimpse to expand under his protection beyond the limits of her fettered youth he had bought this old spanish estate with its near vineyard and its outlying leagues covered with wild cattle partly from that strange contradictory predilection for peaceful husbandry common to men who have led a roving life and partly as a check to her growing and feverish desire for change and excitement he had at first enjoyed with an almost parental affection her childish unsophisticated delight in that world he had already wearied of and which he had been prepared to gladly resign for her but as the months and even years had passed without any apparent diminution in her zest for these pleasures he tried uneasily to resume his old interest in them and spent ten months with her in the chaotic freedom of san francisco hotel life but to his discomfiture he found that they no longer diverted him to his horror he discovered that those easy gallantries in which he had spent his youth and in which he had seen no harm were intolerable when exhibited to his wife and he trembled between inquietude and indignation at the copies of his former self whom he met in hotel parlors at theatres and in public conveyances the next time she visited some friends in san francisco he did not accompany her though he fondly cherished his experience of her power to resist even stronger temptation he was too practical to subject himself to the annoyance of witnessing it in her absence he trusted her completely his scant imagination conjured up no disturbing picture of possibilities beyond what he actually knew in his recent questions of ezekiel he did not expect to learn anything more even his guests uncomfortable comments added no sting that he had not already felt  with these thoughts called up by the unlookedfor advent of ezekiel under his roof he continued to gaze moodily into the garden near the house were scattered several uncouth varieties of cacti which seemed to have lost all semblance of vegetable growth and had taken rude likeness to beasts and human figures one highshouldered specimen partly hidden in the shadow had the appearance of a man with a cloak or serape thrown over his left shoulder as demorests wandering eyes at last became fixed upon it he fancied he could trace the faint outlines of a pale face the lower part of which was hidden by the folds of the serape there certainly was the forehead the curve of the dark eyebrows the shadow of a nose and even as he looked more steadily a glistening of the eyes upturned to the moonlight a sudden chill seized him it was a horrible fancy but it looked as might have looked the dead face of edward blandford he started and ran quickly down the steps of the veranda a slight wind at the same moment moved the long leaves and tendrils of a vine nearest him and sent a faint wave through the garden he reached the cactus its fantastic bulk stood plainly before him but nothing more  whar are ye runnin to said the inquiring voice of ezekiel from the veranda  i thought i saw some one in the garden returned demorest quietly satisfied of the illusion of his senses but it was a mistake  it mout and it moutnt said ezekiel dryly thars nothin to keep any one out its only a wonder that you aint overrun with thieves and sich like  there are usually servants about the place said demorest carelessly  ef theyre the same breed ez that manuel i reckon id almost as leave take my chances in the road ef its all the same to you i kalkilate to put a paytent fastener to my door and winder tonight i allus travel with them seeing that demorest only shrugged his shoulders without replying he continued et aint far from here that some folks allow is the headquarters of that cattlestealing gang the driver of the coach went ez far ez to say that some of these high and mighty dons hereabouts knows more of it than they keer to tell  thats simply a yarn for greenhorns said demorest contemptuously i know all the ranch proprietors for twenty leagues around and theyve lost as many cattle and horses as i have  i wanter know said ezekiel with grim interest then youve already had considble losses eh i kalkilate them cattle are vallybleabout wot figger do you reckon yer out and injured  three or four thousand dollars i suppose altogether replied demorest shortly  then you dont take any stock in them yer yarns about the gang being run and protected by some firstclass men in frisco said ezekiel regretfully  not much responded demorest dryly but if people choose to believe this bluff gotten up by the petty thieves themselves to increase their importance and secure their immunitythey can but heres manuel to tell us supper is ready  he led the way to the corridor and courtyard which ezekiel had not penetrated on account of its obscurity and solitude but which now seemed to be peopled with peons and household servants of both sexes at the end of a long lowceilinged room a table was spread with omelettes chupa cakes chocolate grapes and melons around which half a dozen attendants stood gravely in waiting the size of the room which to ezekiels eyes looked as large as the church at north liberty the profusion of the viands the six attendants for the host and solitary guest deeply impressed him morally rebelling against this feudal display and extravagance he who had disdained to even assist the blandfords servantinwaiting at table and had always made his solitary meal on the kitchen dresser was not above feeling a material satisfaction in sitting on equal terms with his masters friend and being served by these menials he despised he did full justice to the victuals of which demorest partook in sparing abstraction and particularly to the fruit which demorest did not touch at all observant of his servants eyes fixed in wonder on the strange guest who had just disposed of a second melon at supper demorest could not help remarking that he would lose credit as a medico with the natives unless he restrained a public exhibition of his tastes  ez haaw queried ezekiel  they have a proverb here that fruit is gold in the morning silver at noon and lead at night  thatll do for lazy stomicks said the unabashed ezekiel when theyre once fortified by jones bitters and hard work theyll be able to tackle the lords natral gifts of the airth at any time  declining the cigarettes offered him by demorest for a quid of tobacco which he gravely took from a tin box in his pocket and to the astonished eyes of the servants apparently obliterated any further remembrance of the meal he accompanied his host to the veranda again where tilting his chair back and putting his feet on the railing he gave himself up to unwonted and silent rumination  the silence was broken at last by demorest who halfreclining on a settee had once or twice glanced towards the misshapen cactus  was there any trace discovered of blandford other than we knew before we left the states  waal no said ezekiel thoughtfully the last idea was that hed got control of the hoss after passin the bridge and had managed to turn him back for there was marks of buggy wheels on the snow on the far side and that fearin to trust the hoss or the bridge he tried to lead him over when the bridge gave way and he was caught in the wreck and carried off down stream that would account for his body not bein found they do tell that chunks of that bridge were picked up on the sound beach near the mouth o the river nigh unto sixty miles away thats about the last idea they had of it at north liberty he paused and then cleverly directing a stream of tobacco juice at an accurate curve over the railing wiped his lips with the back of his hand and added slowly thars another ideabut i reckon its only mine leastways i aint heard it argued by anybody  what is that asked demorest  waal it aint exakly complimentary to e blandford esq and it mout be orkard for you  i dont think youre in the habit of letting such trifles interfere with your opinion said demorest with a slightly forced laugh but what is your idea  that thar wasnt any accident  no accident replied demorest raising himself on his elbow  nary accident continued ezekiel deliberately and if it comes to that not much of a dead body either  what the devil do you mean said demorest sitting up  i mean said ezekiel with momentous deliberation that e blandford of the winnipeg mills was in march 50 ez nigh bein bust up ez any man kin be without actually failin that hed been down to boston that day to get some extensions that old deacon salisbury knew it and had been pesterin mrs blandford to induce him to sell out and leave the place and that the night he left he took about two hundred and fifty dollars in bank bills that they allus kept in the house and mrs blandford was in the habit o hidin in the breastpocket of one of his old overcoats hangin up in the closet i mean that that air money and that air overcoat went off with him ez mrs blandford knows for i heard her tell her ma about it and when his affairs were wound up and his debts paid i reckon that the two hundred and fifty was all there was leftand he scooted with it its orkard for youez i said aforebut i dont see wot on earth you need get riled for ef he ran off on account of only two hundred and fifty dollars he aint goin to run back again for the mere matter o your marrying joan ef he hadhed a done it afore this its orkard ez i saidbut the only orkardness is your feelins i reckon joans got used to hers  demorest had risen angrily to his feet but the next moment the utter impossibility of reaching this mans hidebound moral perception by even physical force hopelessly overcame him it would only impress him with the effect of his own disturbing power that to ezekiel was equal to a proof of the truth of his opinions it might even encourage him to repeat this absurd story elsewhere with his own construction upon his reception of it after all it was only ezekiels opinionan opinion too preposterous for even a moments serious consideration blandford alive and a petty defaulter blandford above the earth and complacently abandoning his wife and home to another blandfordperhaps a sneaking cowardly nemesishiding in the shadow for futureimpossible it really was enough to make him laugh  he did laugh albeit with an uneasy sense that only a few years ago he would have struck down the man who had thus traduced his friends memory  youve been overtaxing your brain in patentmedicine circulars corwin he said in a roughly rallying manner and youve got rather too much highfalutin and bitters mixed with your opinions after that yarn of yours you must be dry whatll you take i havent got any new england rum but i can give you some tenyearold aguardiente made on the place  as he spoke he lifted a decanter and glass from a small table which manuel had placed in the veranda  i guess not said ezekiel dryly its now goin on five years since ive been a consistent temperance man  in everything but melons and criticism of your neighbor eh said demorest pouring out a glass of the liquor  i hev my convictions said ezekiel with affected meekness  and i have mine said demorest tossing off the fiery liquor at a draft and its that this is devilish good stuff sorry you cant take some im afraid ill have to get you to excuse me for a while i have to take a ride over the ranch before turning in to see if everythings right the house is at your disposition as we say here ill see you later  he walked away with a slight exaggeration of unconcern ezekiel watched him narrowly with colorless eyes beneath his white lashes when he had gone he examined the thoroughly emptied glass of aguardiente and taking the decanter sniffed critically at its sharp and potent contents a smile of gratified discernment followed it was clear to him that demorest was a heavy drinker  contrary to his prognostication however mrs demorest did arrive the next day but although he was to depart from buenaventura by the same coach that had set her down at the gate of the casa he had already left the house armed with some letters of introduction which demorest had generously given him to certain small traders in the pueblo and along the route demorest was not displeased to part with him before the arrival of his wife and thus spare her the awkwardness of a repetition of ezekiels effrontery in her presence nor was he willing to have the impediment of a guest in the house to any explanation he might have to seek from her or to the confidences that hereafter must be fuller and more mutual for with all his deep affection for his wife richard demorest unconsciously feared her the strong man whose dominance over men and women alike had been his salient characteristic had begun to feel an undefinable sense of some unrecognized quality in the woman he loved he had once or twice detected it in a tone of her voice in a remembered and perhaps even once idolized gesture or in the accidental lapse of some bewildering word with the generosity of a large nature he had put the thought aside referring it to some selfish weakness of his own ormore fatuous than allto a possible diminution of his own affection  he was standing on the steps ready to receive her few of her appreciative sex could have remained indifferent to the tender and touching significance of his silent and subdued welcome he had that piteous wistfulness of eye seen in some dogs and the husbands of many charming womenthe affection that pardons beforehand the indifference it has learned to expect she approached him smiling in her turn meeting the sublime patience of being unloved with the equally resigned patience of being loved and feeling that comforting sense of virtue which might become a bore but never a selfreproach for the rest she was prettier than ever her five years of expanded life had slightly rounded the elongated oval of her face filled up the ascetic hollows of her temples and freed the repression of her mouth and chin a more genial climate had quickened the circulation that north liberty had arrested and suffused the transparent beauty of her skin with eloquent life it seemed as if the long protracted northern spring of her youth had suddenly burst into a summer of womanhood under those gentle skies and yet enough of her puritan precision of manner movement and gesture remained to temper her fuller and more exuberant life and give it repose in a community of pretty women more or less given to the license and extravagance of the epoch she always looked like a lady  he took her in his arms and halflifted her up the last step of the veranda she resisted slightly with her characteristic action of catching his wrists in both her hands and holding him off with an awkward primness and almost in the same tone that she had used to edward blandford five years before said  there dick that will do     chapter ii   demorests dream of a few days conjugal seclusion and confidences with his wife was quickly dispelled by that lady i came down with rosita pico whose father you know once owned this property she said shes gone on to her cousins at los osos rancho tonight but comes here tomorrow for a visit she knows the place well in fact she once had a romantic love affair here but she is very entertaining it will be a little change for us she added naively  demorest kept back a sigh without changing his gentle smile im glad for your sake dear but is she not a little flighty and inclined to flirt a good deal i think ive heard so  shes a young girl who has been severely tried richard and perhaps is not to blame for endeavoring to forget it in such distraction as she can find said mrs demorest with a slight return of her old manner i can understand her feelings perfectly she looked pointedly at her husband as she spoke it being one of her late habits to openly refer to their antenuptial acquaintance as a natural reaction from the martyrdom of her first marriage with a quiet indifference that seemed almost an indelicacy but her husband only said as you like dear vaguely remembering dona rosita as the alleged heroine of a forgotten romance with some earlier american adventurer who had disappeared and trying vainly to reconcile his wifes sentimental description of her with his own recollection of the buxom pretty laughing but dangerouseyed spanish girl he had however seen but once  she arrived the next day flying into a protracted embrace of joan which included a smiling recognition of demorest with an unoccupied blue eye and a shake of her fan over his wifes shoulder then she drew back and seemed to take in the whole veranda and garden in another long caress of her eyes ahyess i have recognized it mooch it es ze same of no changenot even of a leetle no she ess alwaysesso she stopped looked unutterable things at joan pressed her fan below a spray of roses on her full bodice as if to indicate some thrilling memory beneath it shook her head again suddenly caught sight of demorests serious face said ah that brigand of our husband laughs himself at me and then herself broke into a charming ripple of laughter  but i was not laughing dona rosita said demorest smiling sadly however in spite of himself  she made a little grimace and then raised her elbows slightly lifting her shoulders as it shall please you senor but he is gonethees passion yesswhat you shall call thees sentiment of lofzoas he came she threw her fingers in the air as if to illustrate the volatile and transitory passage of her affections and then turned again to joan with her back towards demorest  do please go ondona rosita said he i never heard the real story if there is any romance about my house id like to know it he added with a faint sigh  dona rosita wheeled upon him with an inquiring little look ah you have the sentiment and you she continued taking joan by the arms you have not eet ess good so when athe wife she continued boldly hazarding an extended english abstraction he has the sentimente and the hoosband he has nothing eet is not goodfor ahimze wife she concluded triumphantly  but i have great appreciation and i am dying to hear it said demorest trying to laugh  well poor one you look so but you shall lif till another time said dona rosita with a mock courtesy gliding with joan away  the other time came that evening when chocolate was served on the veranda where dona rosita mantilladraped against the dry clear moonlit air sat at the feet of joan on the lowest step demorest uneasily observant of the influence of the giddy foreigner on his wife and conscious of certain confidences between them from which he was excluded leaned against a pillar of the porch in half abstracted resignation joan under the tutelage of rosita lit a cigarette demorest gazed at her wonderingly trying to recall in her fuller and more animated face some memory of the pale refined profile of the puritan girl he had first met in the boston train the faint aurora of whose cheek in that northern clime seemed to come and go with his words becoming conscious at last of the eyes of dona rosita watching him from below with an effort he recalled his duty as her host and gallantly reminded her that moonlight and the hour seemed expressly fitted for her promised love story  do tell it said joan i dont mind hearing it again  then you know it already said demorest surprised  joan took the cigarette from her lips laughed complacently and exchanged a familiar glance with rosita she told it me a year ago when we first knew each other she replied go on dear to rosita  thus encouraged dona rosita began addressing herself first in spanish to demorest who understood the language better than his wife and lapsing into her characteristic english as she appealed to them both it was really very little to interest don ricardothis story of a silly muchacha like herself and a strange caballero he would go to sleep while she was talking and tonight he would say to his wife mother of god why have you brought here this chattering parrot who speaks but of one thing but she would go on always like the windmill whether there was grain to grind or no it was four years ago ah don ricardo did not remember the country thenit was when the first americans camenow it is different then there were no coachesin truth one travelled very little and always on horseback only to see ones neighbors and suddenly as if in one day it was changed there were strange men on the roads and one was frightened and one shut the gates of the pateo and drove the horses into the corral one did not know much of the americans thenfor why they were always going goingnever stopping hurrying on to the gold mines hurrying away from the gold mines hurrying to look for other gold mines but always going on foot on horseback in queer wagonshurrying pushing everywhere ah it took away the breath all except one americanhe did not hurry he did not go with the others he came and stayed here at buenaventura he was very quiet very civil very sad and very discreet he was not like the others and always kept aloof from them he came to see don andreas pico and wanted to beg a piece of land and an old vaqueros hut near the road for a trifle don andreas would have given it or a better house to him or have had him live at the casa here but he would not he was very proud and shy so he took the vaqueros hut a mere adobe affair and lived in it though a caballero like yourself with white hands that knew not labor and small feet that had seldom walked in good time he learned to ride like the best vaquero and helped don andreas to find the lost mustangs and showed him how to improve the old mill and his pride and his shyness wore off and he would come to the casa sometimes and don andreas got to love him very much and his daughter dona rositaah well yes trulya leetle  but he had strange moods and ways this american and at times they would have thought him a lunatico had they not believed it to be an american fashion he would be very kind and gentle like one of the family coming to the casa every day playing with the children advising don andreas andyeshaving a devotionvery discreet very ceremonious for dona rosita and then all in a moment he would become as ill without a word or gesture until he would stalk out of the house gallop away furiously and for a week not be heard of the first time it happened dona rosita was piqued by his rudeness don andreas was alarmed for it was on an evening like the present and dona rosita was teaching him a little song on the guitar when the fit came on him and he snapped the guitar strings like thread and threw it down and got up like a bear and walked away without a word  i see it all said demorest half seriously you were coquetting with him and he was jealous  but dona rosita shook her head and turned impetuously and said in english to joan  no it was astutciaa trick a ruse because when my father have arrived at his house he is agone and so every time when he have the fit he goes not to his house no and it ees not until after one time when he comes back never again that we have comprehend what he do at these times and what do you think i shall tell to you  she composed herself comfortably with her plump elbows on her knees and her fan crossed on the palm of her hand before her and began again  it is a year he has gone and the stagecoach is attack of brigands tiburcio our vaquero have that night made himself a pasear on the road and he have seen him he have seen one two three men came from the wood with something on the face and he is of them he has nothing on his face and tiburcio have recognize him we have laugh at tiburcio we believe him not it is improbable that this senor huanson  senor who said demorest  huansoneet is the name of him ah carrposiblemente it is nothinga don fulanoor an apodohuanson  oh i see johnson very likely  we have said it is not possible that this good man who have come to the house and ride on his back the children is a thief and a brigand and one night my father have come from the monterey in the coach and it was stopped and the brigands have take from the passengers the money the rings from the finger and the watchand my father was of the same and my father he have great dissatisfaction and anguish for his watch is given to him of an old friend and it is not like the other watch but the watch he go all the same and then when the robbers have made a finish comes to the window of the coach a mascara and have say who is the don andreas pico and my father have say it is i who am don andreas pico and the mask have say behold your watch is restore and he gif it to him and my father say to whom have i the distinguished honor to thank and the mask say  johnson interrupted demorest  no said dona rosita in grave triumph he say essmith for this essmith is like huansonan apodonothing  then you really think this man was your old friend asked demorest  i think  and that he was a robber even when living hereand that it was not your cruelty that really drove him to take the road  dona rosita shrugged her plump shoulders you will not comprehend it was because of his being a brigand that he stayed not with us my father would not have object if he have present himself to me for marriage in these times i would not have object for i was young and we have knew nothing it was he who have object for why inside of his heart he have feel he was a brigand  but you might have reformed him in time said demorest  she again shrugged her shoulders quien sabe after a pause she added with infinite gravity and before he have reform it is bad for the menage i should invite to my house some friend they arrive and one say i have not the watch of my pocket and another the ring of my finger he is gone and another my earrings she is loss and i am obliged to say they reside now in the pocket of my hoosband patience a little whileperhaps tomorrowhe will restore no she continued with an air of infinite conviction it is not good for the menagethe necessity of those explanation  you told me he was handsome said joan passing her arm carelessly around dona rositas comfortable waist how did he look  as an angel he have long curls to his back his moustache was as silk for he have had never a barber to his face and his eyessanta mariaso soft and soso melankoly when he smile it is like the moonlight but she added rising to her feet and tossing the end of her lace mantilla over her shoulder with a little laughit is finishadelante drrrive on  i dont want to destroy your belief in the connection of your friend with the road agents said demorest grimly but if he belongs to their band it is in an inferior capacity most of them are known to the authorities and i have heard it even said that their leader or organizer is a very unromantic speculator in san francisco  but this suggestion was received coldly by the ladies who superciliously turned their backs upon it and the suggester joan dropped her voice to a lower tone and turned to dona rosita and you have never seen him since  never  i shouldat least i wouldnt have let it end in that way said joan in a positive whisper  eh said dona rosita laughing so eet is you juanita that have the romanceeh ah bueno you have the houseso i gif to you the lover also i place him at your disposition she made a mock gesture of elaborate and complete abnegation but she added in joans ear with a quick glance at demorest do not let our hoosband eat him even now he have the look to strangle me make to him a little lof quickly when i shall walk in the garden she turned away with a pretty wave of her fan to demorest and calling out i go to make an assignation with my memory laughed again and lazily passed into the shadow an ominous silence on the veranda followed broken finally by mrs demorest  i dont think it was necessary for you to show your dislike to dona rosita quite so plainly she said coldly slightly accenting the puritan stiffness which any conjugal teteatete lately revived in her manner  i show dislike of dona rosita stammered demorest in surprise come joan he added with a forgiving smile you dont mean to imply that i dislike her because i couldnt get up a thrilling interest in an old story ive heard from every gossip in the pueblo since i can remember  its not an old story to her said joan dryly and even if it were you might reflect that all people are not as anxious to forget the past as you are  demorest drew back to let the shaft glance by the story is old enough at least for her to have had a dozen flirtations as you know since then he returned gently and i dont think she herself seriously believes in it but let that pass i am sorry i offended her i had no idea of doing so as a rule i think she is not so easily offended but i shall apologize to her he stopped and approached nearer his wife in a halftimid halftentative affection as to my forgetfulness of the past joan even if it were true i have had little cause to forget it lately your friend corwin  i must insist upon your not calling him my friend richard interrupted joan sharply considering that it was through your indiscretion in coming to us for the buggy that night that he suspected  she stopped suddenly for at that moment a startled little shriek quickly subdued rang through the garden demorest ran hurriedly down the steps in the direction of the outcry joan followed more cautiously at the first turning of the path dona rosita almost fell into his arms she was breathless and trembling but broke into a hysterical laugh  i have such a fear come to mei cry out i think i have seen a man but it was nothingnothing i am a fool it is no one here  but where did you see anything said joan coming up  rosita flew to her side where oh hereeverywhere ah i am a fool she was laughing now albeit there were tears glistening on her lashes when she laid her head on joans shoulder  it was some fancysome resemblance you saw in that queer cactus said demorest gently it is quite natural i was myself deceived the other night but ill look around to satisfy you take dona rosita back to the veranda joan but dont be alarmed dearit was only an illusion  he turned away when his figure was lost in the entwining foliage dona rosita seized joans shoulder and dragged her face down to a level with her own  it was something she whispered quickly  who  it washim  nonsense groaned joan nevertheless casting a hurried glance around her  have no fear said dona rosita quickly he is gonei saw him pass awayso but it was hehuanson i recognize him i forget him never  are you sure  have i the eyes the memory madre de dios am i a lunatico too look he have stood thereso  then you think he knew you were here  quien sabe  and that he came here to see you  dona rosita caught her again by the shoulders and with her lips to joans ear said with the intensest and most deliberate of emphasis  no  what in heavens name brought him here then  you  are you crazy  you you you repeated dona rosita with crescendo energy i have come upon him here where he stood and look at the veranda absorrrb of you you movehe fly  hush  ah yes i have said i give him to you and he came bueno murmured dona rosita with a halfresigned halfsuperstitious gesture  will you be quiet  it was the sound of demorests feet on the gravel path returning from his fruitless search he had seen nothing it must have been dona rositas fancy  she was just saying she thought she had been mistaken said joan quietly let us go init is rather chilly here and i begin to feel creepy too  nevertheless as they entered the house again and the light of the hall lantern fell upon her face demorest thought he had never but once before seen her look so nervously and animatedly beautiful     chapter iii   the following day when mr ezekiel corwin had delivered his letters of introduction and thoroughly canvassed the scant mercantile community of san buenaventura with considerable success he deposited his carpetbag at the stage office in the posada and found to his chagrin that he had still two hours to wait before the coach arrived after a vain attempt to impart cheerful but disparaging criticism of the pueblo and its people to senor mateo and his wifewhose external courtesy had been visibly increased by a line from demorest but whose confidence towards the stranger had not been extended in the same proportionhe gave it up and threw himself lazily on a wooden bench in the veranda already hacked with the initials of his countrymen and drawing a jackknife from his pocket he began to add to that emblazonry the trademark of the panaceaas a casual advertisement during its progress however he was struck by the fact that while no one seemed to enter the posada through the stage office the number of voices in the adjoining room seemed to increase and the ministrations of mateo and his wife became more feverishly occupied with their invisible guests it seemed to ezekiel that consequently there must be a second entrance which he had not seen and this added to the circumstance that one or two lounging figures who had been approaching unaccountably disappeared before reaching the veranda induced him to rise and examine the locality a few paces beyond was an alley but it appeared to be already blocked by several cigarettesmoking shortjacketed men who were leaning against its walls and showed no inclination to make way for him checked but not daunted ezekiel coolly returned to the stage office and taking the first opportunity when mateo passed through the rear door followed him as he expected the innkeeper turned to the left and entered a large room filled with tobacco smoke and the local habitues of the posada but ezekiel shrewdly surmising that the private entrance must be in the opposite direction turned to the right along the passage until he came unexpectedly upon the corridor of the usual courtyard or patio of every mexican hostelry closed at one end by a low adobe wall in which there was a door the free passage around the corridor was interrupted by wide partitions fitted up with tables and benches like stalls opening upon the courtyard where a few stunted fig and orange trees still grew as the courtyard seemed to be the only communication between the passage he had left and the door in the wall he was about to cross it when the voices of two men in the compartment struck his ears although one was evidently an americans ezekiel was instinctively convinced that they were speaking in english only for greater security against being understood by the frequenters of the posada it is unnecessary to say that this was an innocent challenge to the curiosity of ezekiel that he instantly accepted he drew back carefully into the shadow of the partition as one of the voices asked  wasnt that johnson just come in  there was a movement as if some one had risen to look over the compartment but the gathering twilight completely hid ezekiel  no  hes late suppose he dont comeor back out  the other man broke into a grim laugh i reckon you dont know johnson yet or youd understand this yer little game o his is just the one idea o his life hes been two years on that mans track and he aint goin to back out now that hes got a dead sure thing on him  but why is he so keen about it anyway it dont seem natral for a business man built after johnsons style and a rich man to boot to go into this detective business it aint the reward we know that is it an old grudge  you bet the speaker paused and then in a lower voice which taxed ezekials keen ear to the uttermost resumed its said up in frisco that cherokee bob knew suthin agin johnson way back in the states anyhow i believe its understood that they came across the plains together in 50and bob hounded johnson and blackmailed him here where he was livin even to the point of makin him help him on the road or give information until one day johnson bucked against itkicked over the tracesand swore hed be revenged on bob and then just settled himself down to that business wotever hed been and done himself he made it all right with the sheriff here and ive heard ez it wasnt anything criminal or that sort but that it was o some private trouble that hed confided to that hound bob and bob had threatened to tell agen him thats the grudge they say johnson has and thats why hes allowed to be the head devil in this yer affair its an understood thing too that the sheriff and the police aint goin to interfere if johnson accidentally blows the top of bobs head off in the scrimmage of a capter  and i reckon bob wouldnt hesitate to do the same thing to him when he finds out that johnson has given him away  i reckon said the other sententiously for its johnsons knowledge of the country and the hossstealers that are in with bobs gang of road agents that made it easy for him to buy up and win over bobs friends here so that theyd help to trap him  its pretty rough on bob to be sold out in that way said the second speaker sympathizingly  if they were white men prhaps returned his companion contemptuously but this yers a case of injin agen injin ez the men are mexican halfbreeds just as bobs a half cherokee the sooner that kind o cross cattle exterminate each other the better itll be for the country it takes a white man like johnson to set em by the ears  a silence followed ezekiel beginning to be slightly bored with his cheaply acquired but rather impractical information was about to slip back into the passage again when he was arrested by a laugh from the first speaker  whats the matter growled the other do you want to bring the whole posada out here  i was only thinkin what a skeer them innocent greenhorn passengers will get just ez theyre snoozing off for the night ten miles from here responded his friend with a chuckle wonder ef anybodys goin up from here besides that patent medicine softy  ezekiel stopped as if petrified  ef the  fools keep quiet they wont be hurt for our men will be ready to chip in the moment of the attack but weve got to let the attack be made for the sake of the evidence and if we warn off the passengers from going this trip and let the stage go up empty bob would suspect something and vamose but heres johnson  the door in the adobe wall had suddenly opened and a figure in a serape entered the patio ezekiel whose curiosity was whetted with indignation at the ignominious part assigned to him in this comedy forgot even his risk of detection by the newcomer who advanced quickly towards the compartment when he had reached it he said in a tone of bitterness  the game is up gentlemen and the whole thing is blown the scoundrel has got some confederate herefor hes been seen openly on the road near demorests ranch and the band have had warning and dispersed we must find out the traitor and take our precautions for the next time who is that there i dont know him  he was pointing to ezekiel who had started eagerly forward at the first sound of his voice the two occupants of the compartment rose at the same moment leaped into the courtyard and confronted ezekiel surrounded by the three menacing figures he did not quail but remained intently gazing upon the newcomer then his mouth opened and he drawled lazily  waal ef it aint squire blandford of north liberty connecticut im a treed coon squire blandford how do you do  the stranger drew back in undisguised amazement the two men glanced hurriedly at each other ezekiel alone remained cool smiling imperturbable and triumphant  who are you sir i do not know you demanded the newcomer roughly  like ez not said corwin dryly its a matter o four year sense i lived in your house even dick demorestyou knew dickdidnt know me but i reckon that mrs blandford as used to be  thats enough said blandfordfor it was hesuddenly mastering both himself and corwin by a supreme emphasis of will and gesture wait then turning to the two others who were discreetly regarding the blank adobe wall before them he said excuse me for a few minutes gentlemen there is no hurry now i will see you later and with an imperative wave of his hand motioned ezekiel to precede him into the passage and followed him  he did not speak until they entered the stage office when passing through it he said peremptorily follow me the few loungers who seemed to recognize him made way for him with a singular deference that impressed ezekiel already dominated by his manner the first perception in his mind was that blandford had in some strange way succeeded to demorests former imperious character there was no trace left of the old gentle subjection to joans prim precision ezekiel followed him out of the office as unresistingly as he had followed demorest into the stables on that eventful night they passed down the narrow street until blandford suddenly stopped short and turned into the crumbling doorway of one of the low adobe buildings and entered an apartment it seemed to be the ordinary livingroom of the house made more domestic by the presence of a silk counterpaned bed in one corner a prie dieu and crucifix and one or two articles of bedchamber furniture a woman was sitting in deshabille by the window a man was smoking on a lounge against the wall blandford in the same peremptory manner addressed a command in spanish to the inmates who immediately abandoned the apartment to the seeming trespasser  motioning his companion to a seat on the lounge just vacated blandford folded his arms and stood erect before him  well he said with quick business conciseness what do you want  ezekiel was staggered out of his complacency  waal he stammered i only reckoned to ask the news ez we are old friendsi  how much do you want repeated blandford impatiently  ezekiel was mystified yet expectant i cant say ez i exakly understand he began  howmuchmoneydoyouwant continued blandford with frigid accuracy to get up and get out of this place  waal consideren ez im travellin here ez the only authorized agent of a firstclass frisco drug house said ezekiel with a mingling of mortification pride and hopefulness unless youre travellin in the opposition business i dont see whats that to you  blandford regarded him searchingly for an instant who sent you here  dilworth  dusenberry battery street san francisco hev their card said ezekiel taking one from his waistcoat pocket  corwin said blandford sternly whatever your business is here youll find it will pay you better a  sight to be frank with me and stop this yankee shuffling you say you have been with demorestwhat has he got to do with your business here  nothin said ezekiel i reckon he wos ez astonished to see me ez you are  and didnt he send you here to seek me said blandford impatiently  considerin he believes you a dead man i reckon not  blandford gave a hard constrained laugh after a pause still keeping his eyes fixed on ezekiel he said  then your recognition of me was accidental  waal yes and ez i never took much stock in the stories that you were washed off the warensboro bridge i aint much astonished at finding you agin  what did you believe happened to me said blandford less brusquely  ezekiel noticed the softening he felt his own turn coming i kalkilated you had reasons for going off leaving no address behind you he drawled  what reasons asked blandford with a sudden relapse of his former harshness  waal squire blandford sens you wanter knowi reckon your business wasnt payin and there was a matter of two hundred and fifty dollars ye took with ye that your creditors would hev liked to hev back  who dare say that demanded blandford angrily  your wife that wasmrs demorest ez istold it to her mother returned ezekiel lazily  the blow struck deeper than even ezekiels dry malice imagined for an instant blandford remained stupefied in the five years retrospect of his resolution on that fatal night whatever doubt of its wisdom might have obtruded itself upon him he had never thought of this he had been willing to believe that his wife had quietly forgotten him as well as her treachery to him he had passively acquiesced in the results of that forgetfulness and his own silence he had been conscious that his wound had healed sooner than he expected but if this consciousness had enabled him to extend a certain passive forgiveness to his wife and demorest it was always with the conviction that his mysterious effacement had left an inexplicable shadow upon them which their consciences alone could explain but for this unjust vulgar and degrading interpretation of his own act of expiation he was totally unprepared it completely crushed whatever sentiment remained of that act in the horrible irony of finding himself put upon his defence before the world without being able now to offer the real cause the anguish of that night had gone forever but the ridiculous interpretation of it had survived and would survive it in the eyes of the man before him he was not a wronged husband but an absconding petty defaulter whom he had just detected  his mind was quickly made up in that instant he had resolved upon a step as fateful as his former one and a fitting climax to its results for five years he had clearly misunderstood his attitude towards his treacherous wife and perjured friend thanks to this practical selfish machine before him he knew it now  look here corwin he said turning upon ezekiel a colorless face but a steady merciless eye i can guess without your telling me what lies may be circulated about me by the man and woman who know that i have only to declare myself alive to convict them of infamyperhaps even of criminality before the law you are not my friend or you would not have believed them if you are theirs you have two courses open to you now keep this meeting to yourself and trust to my mercy to keep it a secret also or tell mrs demorest that you have seen mr johnson who is not afraid to come forward at any moment and proclaim that he is edward blandford her only lawful husband choose which course you likeit is nothing more to me  waal i reckon that as far as i know mrs demorest said ezekiel dryly it dont make the least difference to her either but if you want to know my opinion o this matter it is that neither you nor demorest exactly understand that woman ive known joan salisbury since she was so high but if ye expected me to tell you wot she was goin to do next id be able to tell ye where the next flash o lightnin would strike its wot you dont expect of joan salisbury that she does and the best proof of it is that she filed papers for a divorce agin you in chicago and got it by default a few weeks afore she married demorestand you dont know it  blandford recoiled impossible he said but his voice too plainly showed how clearly its possibility struck him now  its so but it was kept secret by deacon salisbury i overheerd it waal thats a proof that you dont understand joan i reckon and considerin that demorest himself dont know it ez i found out only the other day in talking to him i kalkilate im safe in sayin that youre neither o you quite up to deacon salisburys darter in natral cuteness i dont like to obtrude my opinion squire blandford ez were old friends but i do say that wot with demorests prematooriness and yer own hangfiredness its a good thing that you two worldly men hev got joan salisbury to stand up for north liberty and keep it from bein scandalized by the ungodly ef it hadnt been for her smartness whar yd both be landed now theres a heap in christian bringin up and a power in grace squire blandford  his hard dry face was for an instant transfigured by a grim fealty and the dull glow of some sectarian clannishness or was it possible that this womans personality had in some mysterious way disturbed his rooted selfishness  during his speech blandford had walked to the window when corwin had ceased speaking blandford turned towards him with an equally changed face and cold imperturbability that astonished him and held out his hand let bygones be bygones corwinwhether we ever meet again or not yet if i can do anything for you for the sake of old times i am ready to do it i have some power here and in san francisco he continued with a slight touch of pride that isnt dependent upon the mere name i may travel under i have a purpose in coming here  i know it said ezekiel dryly i heard it all from your two friends youre huntin some man that did you an injury  im hunting down a dog who suspecting i had some secret in emigrating here tried to blackmail and ruin me said blandford with a sudden expression of hatred that seemed inconsistent with anything that ezekiel had ever known of his old masters charactera scoundrel who tried to break up my new life as another had broken up the old he stopped and recovered himself with a short laugh well ezekiel i dont know as his opinion of me was any worse than yours or hers and until i catch him to clear my name again i let the other slanderers go  waal i reckon you might lay hands on that devil yet and not far away either i was up at demorests today and i heard joan and a skittish sort o mexican young lady talkin about some tramp that had frightened her and miss pico said  what who did you say demanded blandford with a violent start  waal i reckoned i heerd the first name toorosita  a quick flush crossed blandfords face and left it glowing like a boys  is she there  waal i reckon shes visitin joan said ezekiel narrowly attentive of blandfords strange excitement but wot of it  but blandford had utterly forgotten ezekiels presence he had remained speechless and flushed and then as if suddenly dazzled by an inspiration he abruptly dashed from the room ezekiel heard him call to his passive host with a spanish oath but before he could follow they had both hurriedly left the house  ezekiel glanced around him and contemplatively ran his fingers through his beard it aint joan salisbury nor dick demorest ez giv him that start humph waali wanter know     chapter iv   mrs demorest was so fascinated by the company of dona rosita pico and her romantic memories that she prevailed upon that heartbroken but scarcely attenuated young lady to prolong her visit beyond the fortnight she had allotted to communion with the past for a day or two following her singular experience in the garden mrs demorest plied her with questions regarding the apparition she had seen and finally extorted from her the admission that she could not positively swear to its being the real johnson or even a perfectly consistent shade of that faithless man when joan pointed out to her that such masculine perfections as curling raven locks long silken mustachios and dark eyes were attributes by no means exclusive to her lover but were occasionally seen among other less favored and even equally dangerous americans dona rosita assented with less objection than joan anticipated besides dear said joan eying her with feline watchfulness it is four years since youve seen him and surely the man has either shaved since or else he took a ridiculous vow never to do it and then he would be more fully bearded  but dona rosita only shook her pretty head ah but he have an aira something i know not what you callso she threw her shawl over her left shoulder and as far as a pair of soft blue eyes and comfortably pacific features would admit endeavored to convey an idea of wicked and gloomy abstraction  you child said joanthats nothing they all of them do that why there was a stranger at the oriental hotel whom i met twice when i was therejust as mysterious romantic and wickedlooking and in fact they hinted terrible things about him well so much so that mr demorest was quite foolish about my being barely civil to himyou understandand she stopped suddenly with a heightened color under the fire of rositas laughing eyes  ahsodona discretion tell to me all did our hoosband eat him  joans features suddenly tightened to their old puritan rigidity mr demorest has reasonsabundant reasonsto thoroughly understand and trust me she replied in an austere voice  rosita looked at her a moment in mystification and then shrugged her shoulders the conversation dropped nevertheless it is worthy of being recorded that from that moment the usual familiar allusions playful and serious to rositas mysterious visitor began to diminish in frequency and finally ceased even the news brought by demorest of some vague rumor in the pueblo that an intended attack on the stagecoach had been frustrated by the authorities and that the vicinity had been haunted by incognitos of both parties failed to revive the discussion  meantime the slight excitement that had stirred the sluggish life of the pueblo of san buenaventura had subsided the posada of senor mateo had lost its feverish and perplexing dual life the alley behind it no longer was congested by lounging cigarette smokers the compartment looking upon the silent patio was unoccupied and its chairs and tables were empty the two deputy sheriffs of whom senor mateo presumably knew very little had fled and the mysterious senor johnson of whom hestill presumablyknew still less had also disappeared for senor mateos knowledge of what transpired in and about his posada and of the character and purposes of those who frequented it was tinctured by grave and philosophical doubts this courteous and dignified scepticism generally took the formula of quien sabe to all frivolous and mundane inquiry he would affirm with strict verity that his omelettes were unapproachable his beds miraculous his aguardiente supreme his house was even as your own beyond these were questions with which the simply finite and always discreet human intellect declined to grapple  the disturbing effect of senor corwin upon a mind thus gravely constituted may be easily imagined besides ezekiels inordinate capacity for useless or indiscreet information it was undeniable that his patent medicines had effected a certain peaceful revolutionary movement in san buenaventura a simple and superstitious community that had steadily resisted the practical domestic and agricultural american improvements succumbed to the occult healing influences of the panacea and joness bitters the virtues of a mysterious balsam more or less illuminated with a colored mythological label deeply impressed them and the exhibition of a circular whereon a celestial visitant was represented as descending with a gross of rogers pills to a suffering but admiring multitude touched their religious sympathies to such an extent that the good padre jose was obliged to warn them from the pulpit of the diabolical character of their heresies of healingwith the natural result of yet more dangerously advertising ezekiel there were those too who spoke under their breath of the miraculous efficacy of these nostrums had not don victor arguello whose respectable digestion exhausted by continuous pepper and garlic failed him suddenly received an unexpected and pleasurable stimulus from the new england rum which was the basis of the jones bitters had not the baker tremulous from excessive aguardiente been soothed and sustained by the invisible morphia judiciously hidden in bloggs nerve tonic nor had the wily ezekiel forgotten the weaker sex in their maiden and maternal requirements unguents that made silken their black but somewhat coarsely fibrous tresses opened charming possibilities to the senoritas while soothing syrups lent a peaceful repose to many a distracted mothers household the success of ezekiel was so marked as to justify his return at the end of three weeks with a fresh assortment and an undiminished audacity  it was on his second visit that the sceptical noncommittal policy of senor mateo was sorely tried arriving at the posada one night ezekiel became aware that his host was engaged in some mysterious conference with a visitor who had entered through the ordinary public room the view which the acute ezekiel managed to get of the stranger however was productive of no further discovery than that he bore a faint and disreputable resemblance to blandford and was handsome after a conscious reckless fashion with an air of mingled bravado and conceit but an hour later as corwin was taking the cooler air of the veranda before retiring to one of the miraculous beds of the posada he was amazed at seeing what was apparently blandford himself emerge on horseback from the alley and after a quick glance towards the veranda canter rapidly up the street ezekiels first impression was to call to him but the sudden recollection that he parted from his old master on confidential terms only three days before in san francisco and that it was impossible for him to be in the pueblo stopped him with his fingers meditatively in his beard then he turned in to the posada and hastily summoned mateo  the gentleman presented himself in a state of such profound scepticism that it seemed to have already communicated itself to his shoulders and gave him the appearance of having shrugged himself into the room  haow long ago did mr johnson get here asked corwin lazily  ahpossiblythen there has been a mr johnson this is a polite doubt of his own perceptions and a courteous acceptance of his questioners  waal i guess so considerin i jest saw him with my own eyes returned ezekiel  ah mateo was relieved might he congratulate the senor corwin who must be also relieved and shake his respected hand bueno and then he had met this senor johnson doubtless a friend and he was well and all were happy  look yer mattayo what i wanter know ez this when did that man who has just ridden out of your alley come here sabe thatits a plain question  ah surely of the clearest comprehension bueno it may have been last weekor even this weekor perhaps yesterdayor of a possibility today the senor corwin who was wise and omniscient would comprehend that the difficulty lay in deciding who was that man perhaps a friend of the senor corwinperhaps only one who looked like him there existedmight mateo point outa doubt  ezekiel regarded mateo with a certain grim appreciation waal is there anybody here who looks like johnson  again there were the difficulty of ascertaining perfectly how the senor johnson looked if the senor johnson was americano doubtless there were other americanos who had resembled him it was possible the senor corwin had doubtless observed for a little space a caballero who was here as it were in the instant of the appearance of senor johnson possibly there was a resemblance and yet  corwin had certainly noticed this resemblance but it did not suit his cautious intellect to fall in with any prevailing scepticism of his host satisfied in his mind that mateo was concealing something from him and equally satisfied that he would sooner or later find it out he grinned diabolically in the face of that worthy man and sought the meditation of his miraculous couch when he had departed the sceptic turned to his wife  this animal has been sniffing at the trail  trulybut mother of godwhere is the discretion of our friend if he will continue to haunt the pueblo like a lovesick chicken he will get his neck wrung yet  following out an ingenious idea of his own ezekiel called the next day on the demorests and in some occult fashion obtained an invitation to stay under their hospitable roof during his sojourn in buenaventura perfectly aware that he owed this courtesy more to joan than to her husband it is probable that his grim enjoyment was not diminished by the fact while joan for reasons of her own preferred the constraint which the presence of another visitor put upon demorests uxoriousness of late too there were times when dona rositas naive intelligence which was not unlike the embarrassing perceptions of a bright and halfspoiled child was in her way and she would willingly have shared the young ladys company with her husband had demorest shown any sympathy for the girl it was in the faint hope that ezekiel might in some way beguile rositas wandering attention that she had invited him the only difficulty lay in his uncouthness and in presenting to the heiress of the picos a man who had been formerly her own servant had she attempted to conceal that fact she was satisfied that ezekiels independence and natural predilection for embarrassing situations would have inevitably revealed it she had even gone so far as to consider the propriety of investing him with a poor relationship to her family when dona rosita herself happily stopped all further trouble on her very first introduction to him that charming young lady at once accepted him as a lunatic whose brains were turned by occult scientific and medical study ah she rosita had heard of such cases before had not a paternal ancestor of hers one don diego castro believed he had discovered the elixir of youth had he not to that end refused even to wash him the hand to cut him the nail of the finger and the hair of the head exalted by that discovery had he not been unsparingly uncomplimentary to all humanity especially to the weaker sex even as the senor corwin  far from being offended at this ingenious interpretation of his character ezekiel exhibited a dry gratification over it and even conceived an unwholesome admiration of the fair critic he haunted her presence and preoccupied her society far beyond joans most sanguine expectations he sat in openmouthed enjoyment of her at the table he waylaid her in the garden he attempted to teach her english dona rosita received these extraordinary advances in a no less extraordinary manner in the scant masculine atmosphere of the house and the somewhat rigid new england reserve that still pervaded it perhaps she languished a little and was not averse to a slight flirtation even with a madman besides she assumed the attitude of exercising a wholesome restraint over him if we are not found dead in our bed one morning and extracted of our blood for a cordial you shall thank to me for it she said to joan also for the not empoisoning of the coffee  so she permitted him to carry a chair or hammock for her into the garden to fetch the various articles which she was continually losing and which he found with his usual penetration and to supply her with information in which however he exercised an unwonted caution on the other hand certain naive recollections and admissions which in the quality of a voluble child she occasionally imparted to this madman in return were in the proportion of three to one  it had been a hot day and even the usual sunset breeze had failed that evening to rock the tops of the outlying pinetrees or cool the heated tiles of the pueblo roofs there was a hush and latent expectancy in the air that reacted upon the people with feverish unrest and uneasiness even a lull in the faintly whispering garden around the demorests casa had affected the spirits of its inmates causing them to wander about in vague restlessness joan had disappeared dona rosita under an olivetree in one of the deserted paths and attended by the faithful ezekiel had said it was earthquake weather and recalled with a sign of the cross a certain dreadful day of her childhood when el temblor had shaken down one of the mission towers you shall see it now as he have left it so it has remain always she added with superstitious gravity  thats just the lazy shiftlessness of your folks responded ezekiel with prompt ungallantry it aint no wonder the lord almighty hez to stir you up now and then to keep you goin  dona rosita gazed at him with simple childish pity poor man it have affect you also in the head this weather so it was even so with the uncle of my father hush up yourself and bring to me the box of chocolates of my table i will gif to you one you shall for one time have something pleasant on the end of your tongue even if you must swallow him after  ezekiel grinned ye aint afraid o bein left alone with the ghost that haunts the garden miss rosita  after youneverrr  ill find mrs demorest and send her to ye said ezekiel hesitatingly  eh to attract here the ghost thank you no very mooch  ezekiels face contracted until nothing but his bright peering gray eyes could be seen attract the ghost he echoed then you kalkilate that its he stopped insinuatingly  rosita brought her fan sharply over his knuckles and immediately opened it again over her halfembarrassed face i comprehend not anything to ekalkilate will you go don fantastico or is it for me to bring to you  ezekiel flew he quickly found the chocolates and returned but was disconcerted on arriving under the olivetree to find dona rosita no longer in the hammock he turned into a bypath where an extraordinary circumstance attracted his attention the air was perfectly still but the leaves of a manzanita bush near the misshapen cactus were slightly agitated presently ezekiel saw the stealthy figure of a man emerge from behind it and approach the cactus reaching his hand cautiously towards the plant the stranger detached something from one of its thorns and instantly disappeared the quick eyes of ezekiel had seen that it was a letter his unerring perception of faces recognized at the same moment that the intruder was none other than the handsome recklesslooking man he had seen the other day in conference with mateo  but ezekiel was not the only witness of this strange intrusion a few paces from him dona rosita unconscious of his return was gazing in a halffrightened breathless absorption in the direction of the strangers flight  waal drawled ezekiel lazily  she started and turned towards him her face was pale and alarmed and yet to the critical eye of ezekiel it seemed to wear an expression of gratified relief she laughed faintly  ef thats the kind o ghost you hev about yer its a healthy one drawled ezekiel he turned and fixed his keen eyes on rositas face i wonder what kind o fruit grows on the cactus that hes so fond of  either she had not seen the abstraction of the letter or his acting was perfect for she returned his look unwaveringly the fruit eh i have not comprehend  waal i reckon i will said ezekiel he walked towards the cactus there was nothing to be seen but its thorny spikes he was confronted however by the sudden apparition of joan from behind the manzanita at its side she looked up and glanced from ezekiel to dona rosita with an agitated air  oh you saw him too she said eagerly  i reckon answered ezekiel with his eyes still on rosita i was wondering what on airth he was so taken with that air cactus for  rosita had become slightly pale again in the presence of her friend joan quietly pushed ezekiel aside and put her arm around her are you frightened again she asked in a low whisper  not mooch returned rosita without lifting her eyes  it was only some peon trespassing to pick blossoms for his sweetheart she said significantly with a glance towards ezekiel let us go in  she passed her hand through rositas passive arm and led her towards the house ezekiels penetrating eyes still following rosita with an expression of gratified doubt  for once however that astute observer was wrong when mrs demorest had reached the house she slipped into her own room and bolting the door drew from her bosom a letter which she had picked from the cactus thorn and read it with a flushed face and eager eyes  it may have been the effect of the phenomenal weather but the next day a malign influence seemed to pervade the demorest household dona rosita was confined to her room by an attack of languid nerves superinduced as she was still voluble enough to declare by the narcotic effect of some unknown herb which the lunatic ezekiel had no doubt mysteriously administered to her with a view of experimenting on its properties she even avowed that she must speedily return to los osos before ezekiel should further compromise her reputation by putting her on a colored label in place of the usual celestial distributer of the panacea ezekiel himself who had been singularly abstracted and reticent and had absolutely foregone one or two opportunities of disagreeable criticism had gone to the pueblo early that morning the house was comparatively silent and deserted when demorest walked into his wifes boudoir  it was a pretty room looking upon the garden furnished with a singular mingling of her own inherited formal tastes and the more sensuous coloring and abandon of her new life there were a great many rugs and hangings scattered in disorder around the room and apparently purposeless except for color there was a bamboo lounge as large as a divan with two or three cushions disposed on it and a low chair that seemed the incarnation of indolence opposed to this on the wall was the rigid picture of her grandfather who had apparently retired with his volume further into the canvas before the spectacle of this ungodly opulence a large bible on a funereal trestlelike stand and the primmest and barest of writingtables before which she was standing as at a sacrificial altar with an almost mechanical movement she closed her portfolio as her husband entered and also shut the lid of a small box with a slight snap this suggested exclusion of him from her previous occupation whatever it might have been caused a faint shadow of pain to pass across his loving eyes he cast a glance at his wife as if mutely asking her to sit beside him but she drew a chair to the table and with her elbow resting on the box resignedly awaited his speech  i dont mean to disturb you darling he said gently but as we were alone i thought we might have one of our oldfashioned talks and  dont let it be so oldfashioned as to include north liberty again she interrupted wearily weve had quite enough of that since i returned  i thought you found fault with me then for forgetting the past but let that pass dear it is not our affairs i wanted to talk to you about now he said stifling a sigh its about your friend please dont misunderstand what i am going to say nor that i interpose except from necessity  she turned her dark brown eyes in his direction but her glance passed abstractedly over his head into the garden  its a matter perfectly well known to meand i fear to all our servants alsothat somebody is making clandestine visits to our garden i would not trouble you before until i ascertained the object of these visits it is quite plain to me now that dona rosita is that object and that communications are secretly carried on between her and some unknown stranger he has been here once or twice before he was here again yesterday ezekiel saw him and saw her  together asked mrs demorest sharply  no but it was evident that there was some understanding and that some communication passed between them  well said mrs demorest with repressed impatience  it is equally evident joan that this stranger is a man who does not dare to approach your friend in her own house nor more openly in this but who with her connivance uses us to carry on an intrigue which may be perfectly innocent but is certainly compromising to all concerned i am quite willing to believe that dona rosita is only romantic and reckless but that will not prevent her from becoming a dupe of some rascal who dare not face us openly and who certainly does not act as her equal  well rosita is no chicken and you are not her guardian  there was a vague heartlessness more in her voice than in her words that touched him as her cold indifference to himself had never done and for an instant stung his crushed spirit to revolt no he said sternly but i am her fathers friend and i shall not allow his daughter to be compromised under my roof  her eyes sprang up to meet his in hatred as promptly as they once had met in love and since when richard demorest have you become so particular she began with dry asperity since you lured me from the side of my wedded husband since you met me clandestinely in trains and made love to me under an assumed name since you followed me to my house under the pretext of being my husbands friend and forced meyes forced meto see you secretly under my mothers roof did you think of compromising me then did you think of ruining my reputation of driving my husband from his home in despair did you call yourself a rascal then did you  stop he said in a voice that shook the rafters i command you stop  she had gradually worked herself from a deliberately insulting precision into an hysterical and it is to be feared a virtuous conviction of her wrongs beginning only with the instinct to taunt and wound the man before her she had been led by a secret consciousness of something else he did not know to anticipate his reproach and justify herself in a wild feminine abandonment of emotion but she stopped at his words for a moment she was even thrilled again by the strength and imperiousness she had loved  they were facing each other after five years of mistaken passion even as they had faced each other that night in her mothers kitchen but the grave of that dead passion yawned between them it was joan who broke the silence that after her single outburst seemed to fill and oppress the room  as far as rosita is concerned she said with affected calmness she is going tonight and you probably will not be troubled any longer by your mysterious visitor  whether he heeded the sarcastic significance of her last sentence or even heard her at all he did not reply for a moment he turned his blazing eyes full upon her and then without a word strode from the room  she walked to the door and stood uneasily listening in the passage until she heard the clatter of hoofs in the paved patio and knew that he had ordered his horse then she turned back relieved to her room  it was already sunset when demorest drew rein again at the entrance of the corral and the last stroke of the angelus was ringing from the mission tower he looked haggard and exhausted and his horse was flecked with foam and dirt wherever he had been or for what object or whether objectless and dazed he had simply sought to lose himself in aimlessly wandering over the dry yellow hills or in careering furiously among his own wild cattle on the arid brittle plain whether he had beaten all thought from his brain with the jarring leap of his horse or whether he had pursued some vague and elusive determination to his own door is not essential to this brief chronicle enough that when he dismounted he drew a pistol from his holster and replaced it in his pocket  he had just pushed open the gate of the corral as he led in his horse by the bridle when he noticed another horse tethered among some cotton woods that shaded the outer wall of his garden as he gazed the figure of a man swung lightly from one of the upper boughs of a cottonwood on the wall and disappeared on the other side it was evidently the clandestine visitor demorest was in no mood for trifling hurriedly driving his horse into the enclosure with a sharp cut of his riata he closed the gate upon him slipped past the intervening space into the patio and then unnoticed into the upper part of the garden taking a narrow bypath in the direction of the cotton woods that could be seen above the wall he presently came in sight of the object of his search moving stealthily towards the house it was the work of a moment only to dash forward and seize him to find himself engaged in a sharp wrestle to half draw his pistol as he struggled with his captive in the open but once in the clearer light he started his grasp of the stranger relaxed and he fell back in bewildered terror  edward blandford good god  the pistol had dropped from his hand as he leaned breathless against a tree the stranger kicked the weapon contemptuously aside then quietly adjusting his disordered dress and picking the brambles from his sleeve he said with the same air of disdain yes edward blandford whom you thought dead there im not a ghostthough you tried to make me one this time he said pointing to the pistol  demorest passed his hand across his white face then its youand you have come here forforjoan  for joan echoed blandford with a quick scornful laugh that made the blood flow back into demorests face as from a blow and recalled his scattered senses for joan he repeated not much  the two men were facing each other in irreconcilable yet confused antagonism both were still excited and combative from their late physical struggle but with feelings so widely different that it would have been impossible for either to have comprehended the other in the figure that had apparently risen from the dead to confront him demorest only saw the man he had unconsciously wrongedthe man who had it in his power to claim joan and exact a terrible retribution but it was part of this monstrous and irreconcilable situation that blandford had ceased to contemplate it and in his preoccupation only saw the actual interference of a man whom he no longer hated but had begun to pity and despise  he glanced coolly around him whatever weve got to say to each other he said deliberately had better not be overheard at least what i have got to say to you     chapter v   demorest now as selfpossessed as his adversary haughtily waved his hand towards the path they walked on in silence without even looking at each other until they reached a small summerhouse that stood in the angle of the wall demorest entered we cannot be heard here he said curtly  and we can see what is going on good said blandford coolly following him the summerhouse contained a bench and a table blandford seated himself on the bench demorest remained standing beside the table there was a moments silence  i came here with no desire to see you or avoid you said blandford with cold indifference a few weeks ago i might perhaps have avoided you for your own sake but since then i have learned that among the many things i owe toto your wife is the fact that five years ago she secretly divorced me and that consequently my living presence could neither be a danger nor a menace to you i see he added dryly with a quick glance at demorests horrorstricken face that i was also told the truth when they said you were as ignorant of the divorce as i was  he stopped half in pity of his adversarys shame half in surprise of his own calmness five years before in the tumultuous consciousness of his wrongs he would have scarcely trusted himself face to face with the cooler and more selfcontrolled demorest he wondered at and partly admired his own coolness now in the presence of his enemys confusion  as your mind is at rest on that point he continued sarcastically i dont suppose you care to know what became of me when i left north liberty but as it happens to have something to do with my being here tonight and is a part of my business with you youll have to listen to it sit down very well thenstand up its your own house  his half cynical wholly contemptuous ignoring of the real issue between them was more crushing to demorest than the keenest reproach or most tragic outburst he did not lift his eyes as blandford resumed in a dry businesslike way  when i came across the plains to california i fell in with a man about my own agean emigrant also i suppose i looked and acted like a crazy fool through all the journey for he satisfied himself that i had some secret reason for leaving the states and suspected that i was like himselfa criminal i afterwards learned that he was an escaped thief and assassin well he played upon me all the way here for i didnt care to reveal my real trouble to him lest it should get back to north liberty he interrupted himself with a sarcastic laugh of course you understand that all this while joan was getting her divorce unknown to me and you were marrying heryet as i didnt know anything about it i let him compromise me to save her buthe stopped his eye kindled and losing his selfcontrol in what to demorest seemed some incoherent passion went on excitedly that man continued his persecution hereyes here in this very house where i was a trusted and honored guest and threatened to expose me to a pure innocent simple girl who had taken pity on meunless i helped him in a conspiracy of cattlestealers and road agents of which he was chief i was such a cursed sentimental fool then that believing him capable of doing this believing myself still the husband of that woman your wife and to spare that innocent girl the shame of thinking me a villain i purchased his silence by consenting may god curse me for it  he had started to his feet with flashing eyes and the indication of an overmastering passion that to demorest absorbed only in the stupefying revelation of his wifes divorce and the horrible doubt it implied seemed utterly vacant and unmeaning  he had often dreamed of blandford as standing before him reproachful indignant and even desperate over his wifes unfaithfulness but this insane folly and fury over some trivial wrong done to that plump babyfaced flirting dona rosita crushed him by its unconscious but degrading obliteration of joan and himself more than the most violent denunciation dazed and bewildered yet with the instinct of a helpless man he clung only to that part of blandfords story which indicated that he had come there for rosita and not to separate him from joan and even turned to his former friend with a halfembarrassed gesture of apology as he stammered  then it was you who were rositas lover and you who have been here to see her forgive me nedif i had only known it he stopped and timidly extended his hand but blandford put it aside with a cold gesture and folded his arms  you have forgotten all you ever knew of me demorest i am not in the habit of making clandestine appointments with helpless women whose natural protectors i dare not face i have never pursued an innocent girl to the house i dared not enter when i found that i could not honorably retain dona rositas affection i fled her roof when i believed that even if i broke with this scoundrelas i didi was still legally if not morally tied to your wife and could not marry rosita i left her never to return and i tore my heart out to do it  the tears were standing in his eyes demorest regarded him again with vacant wonder tearsnot for joans unfaithfulness to himbut for this silly girls transitory sentimentalism it was horrible  and yet what was joan to blandford now why should he weep for the woman who had never loved himwhom he loved no longer the woman who had deceived himwho had deceived them both yes for joan must have suspected that blandford was living to have sought her secret divorceand yet she had never told himhimthe man for whom she got it ah he must not forget that it was to marry him that she had taken that step it was perhaps a foolish cautiona mistaken reservation but it was the follythe mistake of a loving woman he hugged this belief the closer albeit he was conscious at the same time of following blandfords story of his alienated affection with a feeling of wonder and envy  and what was the result of this touching sacrifice continued blandford trying to resume his former cynical indifference ill tell you this scoundrel set himself about to supplant me taking advantage of my absence his knowledge that her affection for me was heightened by the mystery of my life and trusting to profit by a personal resemblance he is said to bear to me he began to haunt her lately he has grown bolder and he dared even to communicate with her here for it is he he continued again giving way to his passion this dog this sneaking coward who visits the place unknown to you and thinks to entrap the poor girl through her memory of me and it is he that i came here to prevent to exposeif necessary to kill dont misunderstand me i have made myself a deputy of the law for that purpose ive a warrant in my pocket and i shall take him this mongrel halfbreed cherokee bob by fair means or foul  the energy and presence of his passion was so infectious that it momentarily swept away demorests doubts of the past and i will help you before god blandford he said eagerly and joan shall too she will find out from rosita how far  thank you interrupted blandford dryly but your wife has already interfered in this matter to my cost it is to her i believe i owe this wretchs following rosita here she already knows this manhas met him twice in san francisco he even boasts of your jealousy you know best how far he lied  but demorest had braced himself against the chill sensation that had begun to creep over him as blandford spoke he nerved himself and said proudly i forbade her knowing him on account of his reputation solely i have no reason to believe she has ever even wished to disobey me  a smile of scorn that had kindled in blandfords eyes darkened with a swift shadow of compassion as he glanced at demorests hard ashen face he held out his hand with a sudden impulse enough i accept your offer and shall put it to the test this very night i knowif you do notthat rosita is to leave here for los osos an hour from now in a private carriage which your wife has ordered especially for her the same information tells me that this villain and another of his gang will be in wait for the carriage three miles out of the pueblo to attack it and carry off the young girl  are you mad said demorest in unfeigned amazement do you believe them capable of attacking a private carriage and carrying off a solitary defenceless woman come blandford this is a schoolgirl romancenot an act of mercenary highwaymenleast of all cherokee bob and his gang this is some madness of rositas surely he continued with a forced laugh  does this mean that you think better of your promise asked blandford dryly  i said i was at your service said demorest reproachfully  then hear my plan to prevent it and yet take that dog in the act said blandford but we must first wait here till the last moment to ascertain if he makes any signal to show that his plan is altered or that he has discovered he is watched he turned and in his preoccupation laid his hand for an instant upon demorests shoulder with the absent familiarity of old days unconscious as the action was it thrilled them bothfrom its very unconsciousnessand impelled them to throw themselves into the new alliance with such feverish and excited activity in order to preclude any dangerous alien reflection that when they rose a few moments later and cautiously left the garden arminarm through the outer gates no one would have believed they had ever been estranged least of all the clever woman who had separated them   it was nearly nine oclock when the two friends accompanied by the sheriff of the county left san buenaventura turnpike and turned into a thicket of alders to wait the coming of the carriage they were to henceforth follow cautiously and unseen in a parallel trail to the main road the moon had risen and with it the long withheld wind that now swept over the distant stretch of gleaming road and partly veiled it at times with flying dust unchecked by any dew from the clear cold sky demorest shivered even with his ready hand on his revolver suddenly the sheriff uttered an exclamation of disgust  blasted if thar aint some one in the road between us and their ambush  its one of their gangscouting lie close  scout be darned look at him bucking round there in the dust he cant even ride its some blasted greenhorn taking a pasear on a hoss for the first time damnation hes ruined everything theyll take the alarm  ill push on and clear him out said blandford excitedly even if theyre off i may yet get a shot at the cherokee  quick then said demorest for here comes the carriage he pointed to a dark spot on the road occasionally emerging from the driven dust clouds  in another moment blandford was at the heels of the awkward horseman who wheeled clumsily at his approach and revealed the lank figure of ezekiel corwin  you here said blandford in stupefied fury  waal yes squire said ezekiel lazily in spite of his uneasy seat i kalkilated ef there was suthin goin on id like to see it  you cursed prying fool youve spoiled all there he shouted despairingly as the quick clatter of hoofs rang from the arroyo behind them there they go thats your work blockhead out of my way or by god but the sentence was left unfinished as joined by the sheriff who had galloped up at the sound of the robbers flight he darted past the unconcerned ezekiel demorest would have followed but blandford with a warning cry to him to remain and protect the carriage halted him at the side of corwin as the vehicle now rapidly approached  but ezekiel was before him even then and as the driver pulled up that inquiring man tumbled from his horse ran to the door and opened it demorest rode up glanced into the carriage and fell back in blank amazement  it was his wife who was sitting there alone pale erect and beautiful by some illusion of the moonlight her face and figure covered with soft white wrappings for a journey looked as he remembered to have seen her the first night they had met in the boston train the picture was completed by the traveling bag and rug that lay on the seat before her another terrible foreboding seized him his brain reeled was he going mad  joan he stammered you what is the meaning of this  ezekiel whom but for his dazed condition he might have seen violently contorting his features in joans face presumably in equal astonishmentbroke into a series of discordant chuckles  waal ef that aint deacon salisburys darter all over ha here are ye two men folks makin no end o fuss to save that mexican gal with pistols and ambushes and plots and counterplots and yers joan salisbury shows ye the way haow to do it and so maam you succeeded in fixin it up with dona rosita to take her place and just sell them robbers cheap waal maam yer sold this yer party tooforhe advanced his face close to hersi never let on a word though i knew it and although they nearly knocked me off my hoss in their fuss and fury ha ha they wanted to know what i was doin here hehe tell em joan tell em  demorest gazed from one to another with a troubled face yet one on which a faint relief was breaking  what does he mean joan speak he said almost imploringly  joan whose color was slightly returning drew herself up with her old cold puritan precision  after the scene you made this morning richard when you chose to accuse your wife of unfaithfulness to her friend her guest and even your reputation i resolved to go myself with dona rosita to los osos and explain the matter to her father some rumor of the ridiculous farce i have just witnessed reached us through ezekiel and frightened the poor girl so that she declinedand properly too to face the hoax which you and some nameless impersonator of a disgraced fugitive have gotten up for purposes of your own i wish you joy of your work if the play is over now i presume i may be allowed to proceed on my journey  not yet said demorest slowly with a face over which the chasing doubts had at last settled in a grayish pallor believe what you like misunderstand me if you will laugh at the danger you perhaps comprehend better than i do but upon this road wherever or to whatever it was leading youtonight you go no further  then i suppose i may return home she said coldly ezekiel will accompany me back to protect me fromrobbers come ezekiel mr demorest and his friends can be safely trusted to take care ofyour horse  and as the grinning ezekiel sprang into the carriage beside her she pulled up the glass in the fateful and set face of her once trusting husband the carriage turned and drove off leaving him like a statue in the road    the bell of the north liberty second presbyterian church had just ceased ringing but in the last five years it had rung out the bass viol and harmonium and rung in an organ and choir and the old austere interior had been subjected at the hands of the rising generation to an invasion of youthful warmth and color nowhere was this more apparent than in the choir itself where the bright spring sunshine piercing a newlyopened stainedglass window picked out the new spring bonnet of mrs demorest and settled upon it during the singing of the hymn perhaps that was the reason why a few eyes were curiously directed in that direction and that even the minister himself strayed from the precise path of doctrine to allude with ecclesiastical vagueness to certain shining examples of the christian virtues that were again in our midst the shrewd face and white eyelashes of ezekiel corwin junior partner in the firm of dilworth  dusenberry of san francisco were momentarily raised towards the choir and then relapsed into an expression of fatigued selfrighteousness  when the service was over a few worshipers lingered near the choir staircase mindful of the spring bonnet  it looks quite natral said deacon fairchild ter see joan salisbury attendin the ministration of the word agin and i aint sorry she didnt bring that second husband of hers with her it kinder looks like old timesafore edward blandford was gathered to the lord  thats so replied his auditor meekly and they do say ez haow demorest got more powerful worldly and unregenerate in that heathen country and that joan ez a professin christian had to leave him ive heerd tell thet hed got mixed up out thar with some halfbreed outlaw of the name o johnson ez hez a purty highflyin mexican wife it was fortnit for joan that she found a friend in grace in brother corwin to look arter her share in the property and bring her back tu hum  shes lookin peart said sister bradley though to my mind that bonnet savors still o heathen vanities  ets the new ideescrept in with that organ groaned deacon fairchild butshothar she comes  she shone for an instanta charming visionout of the shadow of the choir stairs and then glided primly into the street  the old sexton still in waiting with his hand on the halfclosed door paused and looked after her with a troubled brow a singular and utterly incomprehensible recollection and resemblance had just crossed his mind
