the morning was hot and kit musgrave leaning on the african liners rail watched the volcanic rocks of grand canary grow out of the silver haze he was conscious of some disappointment because on the voyage to las palmas he had pictured a romantic white city shining against green palms its inhabitants were grave spaniards who secluded their wives and daughters in old moorish houses with shady patios where fountains splashed now he saw he had got the picture wrong  las palmas was white but not at all romantic a sandy isthmus swept by rolling clouds of dust connected the town and the frankly ugly port the houses round the harbor looked like small brown blocks behind them rose the isleta cinder hill in front coalwharfs and limekilns hidden now and then by dust occupied the beach moreover the spaniards on board the boats about the ship were excited gesticulating ruffians bombay peddlers short darkskinned portuguese and canario dealers in wine tobacco and singing birds pushed up the gangway all disputed noisily in their eagerness to show their goods to the passengers  yet kit was not altogether disappointed somehow the industrial ugliness of the port and the crowds businesslike activity were soothing kit had not known much romantic beauty but he knew the lancashire mining villages and the mean streets behind the liverpool docks besides he was persuaded that commerce particularly british commerce had a civilizing uplifting power  seeing he would buy nothing the peddlers left him alone and he mused about the adventure on which he had embarked things had happened rapidly since he went one morning to don arturos office in liverpool and joined the crowd in the great mans waitingroom don arturo was not spanish but at grand canary he was generally given the castilian title and the spaniards declared the island would soon be his he was an english merchant of the new imperialist school and he gave kit exactly one and a half minutes perhaps he approved the embarrassed lad for half an hour afterwards kit had engaged to start for the canaries and take a sobrecargos post on board a spanish steamer the secretary admitted the pay was small but argued that since don arturo controlled all the business worth controlling in the canaries and west africa the chances for promotion were remarkably good in short kit could sail in two days and was a fool if he did not go  kit agreed and signed the contract he knew some castilian which he had studied at evening classes conducted by the liverpool ymca since he thought the associations motto mens sana in corpore sano good he had also trained his muscles at the ymca gymnasium for a city clerk he was healthy and strong  the two days before he sailed were marked by new and disturbing thrills kit was conservative and sprang from cautious puritanical stock his grandfather was a cumberland sheep farmer his father kept a shop and had taught kit the virtues of parsimonious industry his mother was kind but dull and had tried not to indulge her son although kit was honest and something of a prig he had the small clerks respect for successful business he was raw and his philosophy was smiles in order to make progress one must help oneself  yet he had not altogether escaped the touch of romance and when he agreed to sail his first duty was to explain things to betty she kept the books at a merchants office and sometimes they went to a teashop and sometimes to a cheap concert betty did not go to theaters but now and then took kit to church she was highchurch and wore a little silver cross betty was thin pale and quiet and kits mother approved her although nothing had been said about their marrying kit saw that in the meantime marriage was not for him to marry on pay like his was not fair to the girl yet he imagined he loved betty anyhow he liked her much  when she left the office in the evening they went to a teashop kit found a quiet corner and helped betty to cakes he was embarrassed and his careless talk was forced betty studied him and did not say much her quietness had some charm and she was marked by a touch of beauty that might have developed had she enjoyed fresh air good food and cheerful society women had not then won much reward for their labor and betty was generally tired at length kit with awkward haste told her his plans betty drained her cup and gave him a level glance kit thought her paler than before but the electric light was puzzling  you are going to the canaries and perhaps to west africa are you going for good she said  why no said kit i expect ill stop for a year or two anyhow if i make much progress ill come back then you see im forced to go theres no chance for me in liverpool you get old while you wait for the men in front to move up the ladder if i stop until im forty i might get up a few rounds  is it necessary to get up betty asked  kit looked at her with surprise sometimes bettys philosophy was puzzling and he wondered whether she got it at church kit had not heard another clergyman preach like the vicar and thought him privately rather a fool but betty seldom argued and they did not jar  of course he said so long as you can get up honestly you have got to get up you cant stop in the pushing crowd at the bottom  betty was quiet for a few moments she looked tired and kit imagined she knew all he knew about the pressure of the crowd then she said if only we didnt push perhaps theres room enough and we might make things better  oh well said kit rather comforted by her calm but vaguely disappointed because she could philosophise anyhow although its hard i must seize my chance i shall miss you you have been much to me now ive got to go i begin to see how much perhaps its strange i didnt see before you dont argue you belong to my lot but somehow one feels youre finer than other girls one meets  he stopped and betty gave him a curious smile do you know many girls kit  i dont he admitted i havent bothered about girls i havent had time they expect you to tell them theyre pretty to send them things to josh and make them laugh and now and then to quarrel about nothing rather a bore when youd sooner be quiet but youre not like that we have been pals and now i wish you were going out with me  theres not much use in wishing  that is so kit agreed and hesitated for a moment or two while his face got red you couldnt go now but im coming back suppose i get on and my pay is good will you marry me when i go out again  betty gave him a long level glance for all that he thought her hand shook when she moved her cup and his heart beat  no she said quietly anyhow i wont promise perhaps if you do come back well talk about it but you mustnt feel youre bound to ask  kit got a jolt that betty liked him was obvious and the girls he knew were keen for a lover betty of course was not like them but she was human in a sense however her refusal was justified perhaps he was a dull fellow a girl by whom he was once attracted declared he was as gloomy as a funeral then with his rather shabby clothes and small pay he was certainly not worth bothering about for all that bettys refusal strengthened his resolve  she was firm but he got a hint of strain the thrill of his adventure had gone and he was sorry for betty he knew how she lived the dreary shabby street she left in the morning for her nine hours work the pinching to make her pay go round all was dull and monotonous for her but he was going to a land of wine and sun he could not move her and she left him puzzled and unhappy in the street  the evening before he sailed they went to a concert and betty let him come with her to the door of her lodgings she opened the door and then looked up the street nobody was about and when kit advanced impulsively she put her arms round his neck and kissed him then she firmly pushed him back  goodbye she said and the door shut  kit thought about it while he leaned against the rails on board the african boat perhaps it was strange but he had not kissed betty before to hold her in his arms had rather moved him to a curious tenderness than to passion when he thought about betty he felt gentle but he braced himself and forced a smile for the new governor of an african jail came up with bones and blades  considine was an old soldier with a red face and twinkling eyes who had been long in india but did not state his rank bones and blades were raw lads from lancashire going out to a west african factory for the yearly pay of eighty pounds their notion of life at the factory was romantically inaccurate  the boat stops six hours considine remarked long enough to see the town and they tell me wine is cheap ill go ashore with you musgrave wheres my money bones  ill keep t brass until you come back bones rejoined  considine was fat and his hair was going white but he turned with unexpected swiftness and seizing the lad took his cap  no time to get my boots but your deckshoes wont go on hand out my pocketbook  bones gave up the book and went to the gangway with kit  i expect thats your boat we were pretty good pals on this voyage and i hope well meet again what do you say blades  id like it agreed the other and then his friendly grin vanished and his freckled face got grave all the same africas a queer country and you cant have adventures without some risk well good luck musgrave id better say goodbye  kit gave him his hand and afterwards learned that blades dream of romantic adventures was not realized his job was to count bottles of trade gin and he and bones died of fever before they earned their first years pay  in the meantime considine jumped into the boat he wore neat white clothes thin red slippers and bones cap which was much too small  i ought to have stopped on board he said with a twinkle all the same when i get to africa ill have long enough to play up to my job at las palmas im not important when you want a frolic go where youre not known  kit did not want a frolic he was thoughtful and rather daunted all his old landmarks were gone he was in a new country where people did not use the rules he had known at liverpool besides he was thinking about betty for all that when the spanish boatman rowed him across the harbor to a lava mole he roused himself the patron declared that although the fare was fixed in pesetas english passengers paid with shillings it was however not for nothing kit sprang from sternly frugal stock he stated in his best castilian that the peseta was worth ninepence and he would pay with spanish money or would not pay at all the patrons violent arguments did not move him but when he heard a laugh he looked up  two ladies occupied the pavement at the top of the steps one was little dressed in white with fine lace on her fashionable clothes and looked dignified the other was young and wore a dress of cornyellow her eyes were brown and luminous her hair was nearly black and her rather olive skin had something of a peachs bloom her type of beauty was new to kit but when he saw she remarked his glance he turned to the gesticulating boatman  mrs austin was an important lady at las palmas where her husband and her father don pancho brown carried on a merchant business people said jacinta austin ruled both olivia her sister had not long returned from an english school  señor don erminio martinez captain of a small spanish mail steamer engaged the ladies in talk because olivia was beautiful and he waited for his boat don erminio was big brownskinned and athletic he wore shabby english clothes and a small english cap and looked something like a bullfighter on the whole he was a trustful genial ruffian although the barcelona anarchists were his political models he used a little uncouth french and english  mrs austin noted her sisters glance at the boat the tall young man was obviously english and had come to take a post he was raw and did not wear the tourists stamp mrs austin knew men and there was something honest and thoughtful about him that she approved all the same she did not want olivia to approve  book castilian i think the accents lancashire the girl remarked i wonder where hes going african shipping office bananas or coal  its not important mrs austin rejoined  oh well unless hes a hermit we are bound to meet him and hes fresh blood anyway one gets very bored by the banana and coaling men still i think hes their type  the types plain but i doubt if hes for the coaling wharf the young man looks honest said mrs austin and turning to the captain added i expect he will join the correillo  correillo is not classical castilian but the captain knew she meant a small mail steamer and spread out his hands  aha another animal he come to me all animales the yngleses of don arturo verdad people without shame and education  i am english my friend mrs austin rejoined  one forgets the thing looks impossible said don erminio with a bow you have a charm and sympathy but the others with teeth and neck like the camel and the air commanding they come on board my steamer i am ynglesa all the ship for me but another animal of a sobrecargo señora i am your servant i go and tear my hair  he went off and olivia laughed its strange but people dont like us and at the beginning i expect the young man will have some trouble on board campeador all the same don erminios really a good sort well it looks as if the dispute about the fare had stopped hes beaten the patron  she stepped back for kit came up the steps behind a boatman who carried his tin box considine followed and at the end of the mole the boatman called a tartana kit got into the little trap and considine pushing the driver from his seat seized the reins the horse kicked the tartana rocked and they started for las palmas in a cloud of dust  at home were a sober lot mrs austin remarked in the south were joyfully irresponsible how do you account for it  i dont account for it said olivia theres no use in bothering about things like that besides the young man looks remarkably sober     chapter ii  other rules   after a collision with a steam tram the tartana reached las palmas and considine got down at a wine shop he refused to pay for the damage to the trap and wishing kit good luck vanished among the barrels in the dark shop the tartanero drove kit to the steamship office and sitting on the doorstep declared he would not go away until his just claim was met kit somewhat embarrassed was shown into the managers room and received by a little fastidiously neat spanish gentleman the drivers mournful voice pierced the lava walls and when kit narrated the grounds for his complaint don ramon shrugged  it is not important when the tourists are about such disputes are numerous he said in careful english and gave a clerk some orders  the tartaneros clamour stopped and don ramon resumed we will send a note to the purser and if your countryman does not miss his ship the thing is finished many do miss their ships and there is trouble for us i have much admiration for the english but they make disturbances  we are not all like that kit objected  you are not like that in england i was at the companys office don ramon agreed all was in stern order but in this country you have other rules well it is not important tonight you join your steamer i will tell you your duties  he did so with kind politeness and kit liked the man then and afterwards by and by don ramon sent him to a spanish hotel and for a time he wrote letters to his mother and betty behind a bougainvillea that climbed from the flagged patio to a balcony the creepers splendid purple shone against the yellow wall and on the opposite balcony old bronze rails twinkled the shade was cool and all was quiet but for the rumble of the atlantic surf while kit wrote his frank boyish letters he thought about betty with shy tenderness in a sense she had refused him but his normal mood was calm and he had not known passion yet he wrote to betty very much as he wrote to his mother  by and by he put up his writing case and went off to get some stamps at a bakers shop in spanish countries one cannot as a rule buy stamps at a post office then he looked at his watch and seeing it was two oclock walked across the town don ramon had stated that he need not go on board before midnight the streets were strangely quiet and for the most part nobody was about kit understood the citizens went to sleep in the afternoon he saw nothing romantic las palmas rather looked businesslike and modern than picturesque the houses had straight square fronts and the roofs were flat only the white belt of surf and background of broken volcanic mountains relieved the utilitarian ugliness  the wine shops had no call for kit but he noted the splashed floors pungent smells and swarms of flies a girl on a balcony near the cathedral dropped a red oleander and another smiled but kit did not turn his head he sprang from sober puritanical stock and his code was austere one earned ones pay and studied in order to earn more one shunned indulgence and trained ones body kit had trained his at the gymnasium and a cheap swimming club in summer he sailed races on board cheap little boats although his horizon was not wide his health and nerve were good  he followed the carretera that runs south from the town in spain a road is often a bridletrack a mule can hardly climb but the government carretera is wide and level in the distance was telde where oranges grow and kit set off in the dust and scorching heat the tradebreeze blew behind him on his left hand the atlantic broke in shining foam against black lava reefs on his right across the thin belt of cultivation dark rocks melted by volcanic fire rose like a giant wall  a few palms and fields of feathery sugar cane bordered the road then kit saw vines tied to sticks and growing in hot dust and by and by a thread of water in a deep barranco washerwomen knelt by the channel beating wet clothes with stones and kit understood afterwards why his shirts wore out some of the women were young but when he stopped for a moment at the bridge they did not look up to beat the clothes was their job and maize flour and goats milk cheese are dear farther on kit saw others carrying big earthen jars on their heads they looked like moorish women for their feet and arms were very brown and long black shawls half hid their faces in the fields barefooted men laboured among the tomatoes and vines it was obvious the peons did not sleep in the afternoon but for the most part their white clothes were good and they looked happy  soon after he passed a lava village kit got tired this was strange but the sun was hot and there was a wall about which lizards ran behind grew fleshy green bananas with big flowers like bleedinghearts and he sat down in the shade he had meant to walk to telde going four miles an hour one could get back before nine oclock but it was cool among the bananas and he had begun to feel the drowsy calm of the islands where nothing is important and the sun always shines  he mused about betty she was thin and often looked tired if he could bring her out to feel the sun and balmy wind and see the blaze of colour he pictured her bending over her account books in a dark office and going home through the dreary streets she knew no joy and brightness his horizon was getting wider but hers was not then he remembered bettys silver cross betty went to church perhaps she found her romance there and saw things beyond his view she had refused to marry him and perhaps her kiss was meant for goodbye he did not know but when he got promotion he was going back to try again in the meantime for bettys sake he meant to keep his simple rules to go straight do what he said cheat nobody and by diligence force his way to fortune  he heard shouts and mocking laughter and looked up the governor of the african jail was running along the road his face red and wet by sweat bones small cap occupied ridiculously the back of his head his white jacket had lost some buttons and blew open his thin red slippers were trodden down at the heels he laboured on with stern resolution looking straight in front behind came a swarm of ragged children pelting him with soil and stones  shilling penique puerco ynglisman they cried  for a moment or two kit gazed at considine with angry impatience he did not know if the fellow was very drunk but it was obvious he was not sober and his breathless panting jarred on the drowsy calm don ramon had said the english made disturbances yet the fellow was kits countryman and he got up driving off the children he stopped considine  where are you going  must catch my ship purser said five oclock  kit looked at his watch it was four oclock and las palmas was some distance off the port was three miles farther but one could get a tartana at the town  youre heading the wrong way he said can you run  turn me round and see me go considine replied beat you anyway loser pays for drinks  kit turned him round and they started but when a piece of lava a boy threw struck his head it cost kit something to use control now and then considines red slippers came off and they were forced to stop considine declared that if he stooped he could not get straight again and kit resignedly put the slippers on his feet he felt himself ridiculous and wanted to leave the wastrel but somehow could not if considine lost his ship and got into trouble at las palmas he might lose his post kit saw his business was to help him out  he got very hot the tradebreeze blew the dust in his face and the dust turned to mud on his wet skin he saw dark patches on his white jacket considines slippers came off oftener and kit remarked that not much of his stockings was left but they made progress and at length the town was close in front kit wondered whether the citizens had finished their afternoon sleep and did not know if it was a relief or not to find the first street empty and quiet he did not want people to see him but he must find a tartana and none was about considine going five miles an hour was a yard or two in front when he saw a wine shop he stopped  here we are he gasped the loser pays  kit pushed him across the pavement considine turned and knocked off his hat while kit picked up his hat the other reeled towards the wine shop and people came out kit seized him and drove him on the market was not far off and he had seen tartanas in the square he was breathless tired and dusty and had trodden on his soft grey hat people were beginning to run after them but he meant to put considine on board a tartana and send him to the port  the market was nearly deserted for in the canaries one buys food before the sun is high but a few stalls were occupied and three or four small traps waited for hire kit waved to a driver and seized considine then he tried to get his breath and wiping his hot face smeared his skin with muddy grit  loser pays said considine whats good stopping in the sun lets get some wine  he tried to make off but kit shook him angrily and glanced about a crowd had begun to gather and all the traps were coming at the end of a neighbouring street the girl he had noted at the mole talked to a man in english clothes she was very handsome and looked cool and dignified kit was young and got hotter when he saw her eyes were fixed on his dishevelled companion he felt humiliated and could have borne it better had she looked amused but she did not she watched him and considine with grave curiosity as if she studied people of another type than hers kit got very angry  four traps arrived the drivers gesticulating and cracking whips and kit dragged considine to the nearest considine struggled and tried to push him back  not going yet he shouted beat you easy wheres my wine dont you pay your debts  his jacket tore and he almost got away but kit got a better hold  youre going now get in  wont go with that fellow dont like his horse considine declared  the crowd had got thicker and people jeered and laughed  todos animales gente sin verguenza one remarked  kit frowned he knew the castilian taunt about people who have no shame but he held on to considine the drivers did not help they disputed noisily who should get the passenger then the man kit had noted with the girl came up  put him on board ill lift his legs he said  they did so with some effort for considine was heavy and kicked  to the mole african steamers boat said kit considine occupied the drivers seat  show you how to drive he said and shoving back the tartanero used the whip  the horse plunged the wheels jarred the pavement there was a crash as a stall overturned and the tartana rolled across the square and vanished kit heard considines hoarse shout and all was quiet he looked about the girl who wore the yellow dress was gone but the man stood close by and gave him a quiet smile he had a thin brown face and kit saw a touch of white in his hair a mark on his cheek looked like an old deep cut  you didnt go with your friend he remarked  i did not ive had enough said kit and added anxiously dyou think hell get the african boat  the other looked at his watch if he runs over nothing before he makes the port its possible a westcoast trader i expect  no said kit hes the governor of a jail an old soldier i understand  his companion smiled the british colonial office uses some curious tools but if he sweated for you in india their plans perhaps as good as handing out a job to a political boss  then youre not english  im an american i dont know if its important but since youd had enough of the fellow why did you bother  for one thing i wanted to get rid of him kit said naïvely then of course since he is english i felt i had to see him out  the other nodded a pretty good rule but if you stick to it at las palmas i reckon youll be occupied which way do you go  to the fonda malagueña said kit  his companion indicated a shady street and left him at the top and when kit loafed in the patio after his six oclock dinner he pondered las palmas was not at all the romantic city he had thought and the men he had met going south on board the steamer were a new type they were business men holding posts at african factories but they were not the business men he knew at liverpool he could not picture them punctual careful about small things or remarkably sober they had a touch of rashness he distrusted but rather liked yet he understood some occupied important posts in fact it looked as if the liverpool small clerks rules did not apply everywhere in the south men used others although kit was puzzled his horizon was widening     chapter iii  a mountain excursion   two weeks after kit joined his ship she returned to las palmas and on the whole he was satisfied with his occupation campeador was fast and built on a steam yachts model except that her bow was straight although she rolled horribly across the combers the tradebreeze piles up she shipped no heavy water then kit thought it strange but she was kept as clear as a british mailliner  he had begun to like her crew the grave barelegged fishermen who rowed the cargo launches and the careless officers all were spanish but don pedro macallister the chief engineer for although the roll stated that his birthplace was portobello it was not in spain the rules require that spanish mailboats be manned by spanish subjects but government officials are generally poor and english merchant houses sometimes generous  for two weeks campeador steamed round the islands stopping at surfhammered beaches to pick up cattle camels sheep and mules now the livestock was landed and kit waiting for a boat to carry him ashore mused about his first encounter with the captain campeador was steaming out from las palmas rolling violently as she breasted the long foamcrested seas and kit staggered in the dark across the lumbered deck where the crew were throwing cargo into the hold she had as usual started late for in spain nobody bothers about punctuality  he reached the captains room under the bridge don erminio had pulled off his uniform and now wore a ragged white shirt and shabby english clothes his cap ridiculously shrunk by spray was like a schoolboys kit inquired politely what he was to do about some goods not recorded in the ships manifest and the blood came to the captains olive skin  another animal all sobrecargos are animals people without honour or education he shouted i am a spanish gentleman not a smuggler  kit was half daunted by the others theatrical fury but his job was to keep proper cargo lists and what he undertook he did it was not for nothing his ancestors were hard sheepfarmers in the bleak north  nevertheless i want to know about the chemical manure for palma he said  don erminio seized the tin dispatchbox and threw it on the floor  look for the documents do i count bags of manure i am not a clerk when the company doubts my honour i am an anarchist he kicked the tumbled papers if you find five pesetas short i throw the manure in the sea people without education i go and tear my hair  he went and when the door banged kit sat down and laughed he had borne some strain but the thing was humorous to begin with don erminios hair was very short then although his grounds for anger were not plain kit thought it possible the cargo belonged to a relation of the captains picking up the papers he returned to his office and when campeador reached port the bags of manure were entered on the manifest don erminio however bore him no grudge in the morning he met kit with a friendly smile and gave him a list of the passengers for whom landing dues must be paid  sometimes one disputes about the sum it is human but not important he remarked you will write three lists for the robbers who collect the dues  kit said the list obviously did not give the names of all on board and don erminio grinned  it is a custom of the country if one pays all one ought there is no use in having official friends i put down the names of people the collectors know  when the steamer was ready to leave palma kit and don erminio went to the agents office and were shown a pile of bags of silver there was a bank at las palmas but for the most part the merchants did not use its cheques and kits duty was to carry the money to their creditors the agent gave him a list  you will count the bags before you sign it is the english habit he said  kit saw don erminio studied him and imagined the agents voice was scornful for a moment or two he thought hard and then took up a pen  i expect all the money is here  i have counted said the agent and kit signed the document  he knew he had broken a sound business rule and perhaps had run some risk but he had begun to see the rules were different in spain when he went out he heard the agent say muy caballero  this one is not altogether an animal the captain agreed  kit afterwards counted the silver and found the list accurate on the morning he waited for his boat at las palmas he mused about it and admitted that perhaps his philosophy did not cover all the complexities of human nature by and by macallister joined him and he asked who is the american with a scar on his cheek i met before we sailed  im thinking ye mean jefferson a fine man he was austins partner and they transact some business together noo  then who is austin  he was sobrecargo and held your post but he didna bother aboot the freight pented pictures until he and jefferson salved the cumbria and i married him to jacinta brown  you married him to the lady kit remarked  weel i reckon i had something to do with it for a that don pancho brown is cautious and although hes anither daughter i doubt if i could do as much again ony way if ye trust old peter yell no go far wrang  kit was frankly puzzled about his new friend macallisters hair was going white but his eyes twinkled humorously and kit often found it hard to determine whether he joked or not all the same people did trust macallister in the meantime kit wanted to know about austin and jefferson macallister told him  jefferson was mate of an american sailing ship and inheriting a small legacy undertook to float a wreck on the african coast his money soon ran out his men fell sick and when he fronted disaster jacinta brown sent austin to help austin was poor and not ambitious but he had some talent that jacinta roused him to use macallister said jacinta could make any man do what she wanted and the girl jefferson married was her friend money was raised austin went to africa and he and jefferson salved the stranded ship their adventures made a moving tale and when they returned pancho brown gave austin a share in his merchant business macallister repeated that he was really accountable for jacintas marrying austin and when he stopped studied kit  i dinna ken what i can do for you he said in a thoughtful voice yere no like austin he was a lad o parts aweel yere young and a the lassies are no fastidious  anyhow im not an adventurer kit rejoined and hesitated besides if im ever rich enough to marry theres a girl at home  yin remarked macallister man when i was young i had the pick o twelve then im thinking it was no for nothing she let ye away maybe ye have some talents but yere no amusing  he turned for juan the mate who wore spectacles and the captain came on deck don erminio carried an old pinfire gun hung round his shoulders by a strap he wore a big cartridge belt and black leggings and looked like a brigand  vamos he said me i am cazador i go shoot the rabbit if the patron is not about perhaps i shoot the goat  a boat came to the ladder and kit rather doubtfully got on board he knew something about his companions and imagined the excursion might be marked by adventures for one thing the goats that roamed among the hills were not altogether wild but belonged to somebody when the party landed he thought his doubts were justified two horses a big white donkey and a mule were waiting and a violent dispute began for the muleteer declared he went with the animals and must be paid before they started he called his saint to witness that he knew the captain  buen don erminio remarked at length and turned to kit he is more animal than the mulo but it is not important vamos now we start  they set off in a dust cloud but presently left the road and laboured across a waste of hot sand when the sand stopped they went by winding paths to the hills and when they pushed up a dry watercourse kits troubles began the track was rough and dangerous in places where the sharp lava blocks were piled in heaps but don erminio rode his lean horse like a gaucho the fat mate rode like a sack but his big cautious donkey knew the hills and macallister had the carriage and balance of a cavalry soldier he declared he had learned to ride in the greys and kit thought it possible although macallisters statements were sometimes not accurate he carried a sharp stick with which at awkward spots he pricked kits mule  a spanish mule is as surefooted as a cat but riding is not a pastime for small shipping clerks and kit had not mounted before the packsaddle was very wide and galled his legs the jolts shook him hard and when they reached the top of the watercourse his muscles ached intolerably the muleteer ran beside him sometimes holding on by the stirrup and sometimes by the animals tail at the top the path went obliquely up a precipitous cinder bank and macallister used his pointed stick the mule kicked and kit falling backwards rolled for some distance down the pitch when he got up he was shaken bruised and very sore but he saw macallisters twinkle and heard don erminios hoarse laugh his mouth went hard he had engaged to ride to a hill village and he was going to ride there  the muleteer helped him up and they presently reached a row of square lava houses standing among palms and sugar cane there was a small dark wine shop at which don erminio stopped  buen caballero he remarked to kit now we take a drink and then i shoot the goat  there was no glass in the wine shop windows and the tradebreeze blew through the room after the glare outside to sit in the shade and rest ones aching muscles was soothing and kit drank two cups of red wine the captain drank caña a raw rum and presently picking up a guitar began to sing his voice was good and kit liked the music although he did not know it was classic opera he sang on without embarrassment when macallister began gae bring to me a pint o wine and the clashing melodies brought a group of peons to the door  ave maria one exclaimed but they are strange the men of the sea  by and by kit noted the empty bottles and got up he had had enough and resolved he would not help don erminio to shoot anothers goat moreover he imagined his companions had had too much starting for the port he left the village but soon afterwards sat down by a euphorbia bush although his head was clear his legs were a trifle unsteady the red wine was stronger than he had thought but perhaps his coming out from the cool dark shop into the scorching sun accounted for something he frowned and resolving he would not again indulge like that began to look about  overhead a tremendous rampart of broken mountains cut the sky in places the rocks torn by volcanic heat were black as ink in places they were red and some belts shone in the searching light like polished steel in the hollow of a barranco where water ran were tall palms and luminous green cane dotted by red oleanders and geraniums the sky was all blue and the atlantic glimmered like a big turquoise  kit felt the landscapes charm for he had not known much of natures beauty at liverpool when one went out with a bicycle on saturdays one followed the tramlines across a flat country stained by smoke and the dust of traffic he had once stopped for a week with his fathers relations in the north and remembered the quiet green valley where the river ran but the moors about it were hidden by rainclouds and mist rolled down the long wet slopes now sea and mountains were touched with splendid colour by the southern sun  he mused about his companions he thought macallister a good sort and liked the mate and don erminio their irresponsible carelessness had charm but kit did not altogether approve his friends and relations were frugal industrious folk he had a vague notion that their utilitarian virtues were sometimes shabby for example in kits circle one was sober because soberness paid but at the same time to waste his youth and talents in indulgence was folly  yet he was not altogether moved by selfish caution kits unconscious asceticism was his by inheritance the blood of yeomen flockmasters who by stern selfdenial had held their sheepwalks on the bleak hills was in his veins they were hard folk who fronted bitter gales took no thought for their bodies and lived that they might work  but since he was not a hermit it was plain he must go with his new friends as far as his code allowed but when he had done so he would stop he thought for example he had stopped in time when he left the wine shop after macallister ordered another bottle then looking at his watch he got up and started for las palmas     chapter iv  kits obstinacy   when he had gone some distance kit climbed down a ravine that promised a short line to the harbour and stopped as he crossed a field of maize at the bottom a girl standing by a horse was occupied by a strap and kit knew her before she looked up she wore a short linen ridingskirt a thin yellow jacket and a big yellow hat that shone against the tall green corn her olive skin had a warm tinge her brown hair looked burnished she was mrs austins sister and kit admitted he had not in england met a girl like this he thought her vivid it was the proper word  have you some bother about the harness he asked  olivia looked up and noted that he was tall and straight his colour was fresh for kit was not much sunburned yet and his eyes were frank in a way he was rather an attractive fellow but not altogether her sort for one thing he was don arturos man and his white clothes were cheap all the same when the winter tourists were gone young men were not numerous  a strap has broken she replied perhaps one could get a piece of string through the hole have you some  i have a leather bootlace said kit if youll wait a minute  he was going off but she stopped him you had better see how much we need because if you cut too much you may have some trouble to reach las palmas  that is so youre rather clever said kit who looked at the broken strap well ill find a block where i can take off my boot  olivia smiled lava blocks were all about but she liked his fastidiousness in a minute or two he came back with a piece of the lace and began to mend the strap  let me help said olivia that loop is not very neat i dont think you are much of a workman  in england i was a shipping clerk kit rejoined  olivia noted his frankness as a rule the young men from the coal wharf and banana stores talked guardedly about their english occupations some had come for a warmer climate and some for fresh experience but none admitted he had come for better pay she helped kit to pull the loop straight and he remarked that it did not look very firm  it will hold she said in grand canary harness is mainly string you are on board the correillo are you not i think i saw you land from the african boat  kit said he had joined the ship two weeks since and olivia wondered whether he was dull he ought to have seen that her remembering his arrival was flattering but he obviously did not  well she resumed what do you think about the correillos officers  i dont know yet you see one doesnt meet men like these at liverpool for one thing campeador generally sails an hour or two late thats significant  in spanish countries punctuality is not a virtue and nobody is a slave to rules we do what we like when we like and let people wait  sometimes it must make things awkward kit remarked however if youre satisfied about the harness can i help you up  olivia gave him a quick glance it looked as if he were willing to let her go he was dull but his dullness was intriguing in fact since olivia knew her charm it was something of a challenge she said she would walk across the maize field and signed kit to lead the horse  i expect youll make for the carretera he said isnt it the easiest way to your side of the town  if you know where i live you know who i am  i do know you are mrs austins sister macallister told me  olivia frowned she was not jealous but sometimes she felt as if jacintas popularity swamped hers  what did don pedro tell you about my sister  he said she ruled the english colony and at las palmas what she said went  oh well perhaps he did not exaggerate very much macallister does exaggerate you know but was this all  kit was embarrassed macallister had said much more  he told me something about mr austin and the wreck on the african coast  olivia pondered she knew macallister and noted kits embarrassment  he occupied the post austin had occupied on the whole olivia was amused but while she thought about it they passed the end of a path that turned off through the corn  kit was quiet he felt the vivid light and colour made a proper background for his companions exotic beauty and not long since it was unthinkable that a girl like this should engage him in friendly talk yet although one got a hint of pride and cultivation she was frank and he thought her kind the dreariness he had known at liverpool was gone walking in the splendid sunshine by olivias horse he felt another man for all that olivia thought they had talked long enough and when they came out from the maize she stopped then she saw with some annoyance she had passed the proper path  they had reached the edge of the narrow tableland and in front a bank of volcanic cinders ran down steeply and vanished as if there was a cliff not far below the smooth surface was broken here and there by the marks of horses feet and one saw in the distance a bridle path wind among the rocks a little cement channel carrying water from the hills crossed the steepest pitch and indicated how the horses had reached an easier gradient yet to ride along the channel looked horribly risky and kit thought the bank of cinders had recently slipped down and carried away the path  give me the bridle said olivia  youre not going to get up  olivia smiled she had pluck and rode like a spaniard moreover in the canaries the hill roads are generally bad then perhaps she was willing kit should see her cross the awkward spot  my sister is waiting for me can you hold the stirrup  i wont try you mustnt ride along the channel  the blood came to olivias skin jacinta ruled all the men she knew and olivia thought something of her sisters power was hers then she was proud and young and the fellow had told her she must not  do you mean you wont help me up she said after all i can get up without you  kit went forward a few yards and then turned and fronted her he blocked the way and his mouth was firm olivia looked at him haughtily and her eyes sparkled his object was plain he meant to stop and force her to go another way  move back please she said sharply  not yet said kit and indicated the watercourse you see for a few yards theres nothing but the channel you couldnt walk across the cinders and lead the horse the pitch is very steep  one could ride along the channel  i think not the tops rounded and the cements smooth the horse would slip  do you know much about horses olivia asked  kit coloured because he imagined he understood her taunt i know nothing until this morning i hadnt mounted a horse all the same the risk is obvious  olivia looked at her wristwatch my sister has some engagements for the afternoon and needs me i ought to be at home this is the shortest line to the town but since you wont let me use it perhaps you have another plan  i have said kit ill ride the horse across  with an effort he got into the saddle the saddle was a mans but he had not long since finished his first riding lesson and all his muscles ached olivia marked his awkwardness and hesitated although she let him go the thing was not so risky as he thought and the horse was steady still she admitted that the fellows nerve was good  kits heart beat and his look was strained he expected to fall and might roll over the cliff then he noted that the horse tried the treacherous cinders with its feet as it climbed obliquely to the watercourse he thought the animal was used to the hilltracks and if it knew how to get across he would let it one could not go up hill because of the rocks and on the other side the slope was precipitous not far off the bank of cinders stopped and one saw nothing but a vulture poised against the sky he left the bridle slack and the horse went on after a few minutes the animal stepped off the watercourse and headed cautiously down the slope  to brace himself back hurt horribly but kit did so they had nearly passed the top of the cliff and in front a slump of cactus grew beside a winding path if he could hold out until they reached the clump he could get down in the meantime his stiff galled knees had no grip and the animals cautious movements jarred his aching back he sat like a sack until the horse stepped on a rolling stone and then his feet came out of the awkward spanish stirrups he struck the ground and rolled into the cactus a cloud of dust marked his plunge  when the dust blew away kit was rather surprised to find he had stuck to the bridle and the horse had not run off then he was conscious of a strange pricking over much of his body as if he had been stung by nettles he looked at his clothes and saw they were pierced by small spines like needles he pulled out a number but they stuck to his hands and it was plain both ends were sharp then he looked at the cactus and understood why it was called prickly pear the needles grew in tufts on the round fruit and thick fleshy leaves he got up and shook his clothes but could not shake off the tormenting spines while he was occupied olivia joined him  since you have got across i expect you see youre not very logical she remarked  it looks like that said kit nevertheless i was logical as far as i knew  olivia studied him quietly and kit got embarrassed his clothes and skin were smeared by dust and he felt like a pincushion the prickling was intolerable and he wanted to rub his leg olivias charm was strong but he wished she would go in fact he imagined she knew this because her eyes twinkled  your logics not very sound she resumed for example i began to ride when i was eight years old and you admitted you began this morning why did you imagine you could ride along the channel when i could not however you have kept me for some time and i mustnt stop  kit did not know what he ought to do but he gave her the bridle and held the stirrup  not that way keep your hand firm and your arm stiff she said and putting her foot on his hand sprang to the saddle then she turned and smiled you have pluck but you had better get back on board and change your clothes  she started the horse and leaning back in a strangely graceful pose let the animal go the pitch was steep and the soil was loose but they plunged down the hill kit knew nothing about a horses paces he rather thought it skated when olivia had gone he tried to pull out the spines but finding that for the most part they stuck to his hands he gave it up then he lighted a cigarette and reflected moodily  to begin with it looked as if miss brown knew all about prickly pear and her amused sympathy annoyed him then his battling her was obviously not justified and as he watched her speed down the slopes below he frowned he had refused to let a girl who rode like that undertake a feat he had tried and then had fallen into the prickly pear the thing was ridiculous in the meantime his skin was tingling he must get off his clothes and he started for las palmas     chapter v  mrs austins veranda   don erminio and kit were fishing in the bay behind the isleta the hill of volcanic cinders that shelters the port of light offshore the tradebreeze was fresh but in the bay the rocks broke the sea the captain had moored his barquillo to a reef and stood in a pool with the warm green water washing about his knees his legs and arms were bare as were kits but they wore rawhide sandals because where the seaurchin grows one protects ones feet don erminio carried a dripping bag in which something moved and a pole with a sharp hook like a salmon gaff kit carried a short fishing rod and was rather wet stepping out on a dry ledge he looked about  a quarter of a mile off the long whitetopped combers rolled across the bay and then broke on the north shore of the island in a belt of foam mist had begun to creep down the mountain wall and in the distance galdar hill rose against the sunset farther off across a belt of shining sea teneriffes snowy peak glimmered upon a background of dull green and red some distance from land a small ketchrigged vessel steered for the isleta it was nearly six oclock and would soon be dark  vamos said don erminio one does not get rich while one looks about and the salt fish i sent home from san sebastian is almost gone  kit remarked that the captain had sent a large box and asked if señora martinez liked salt fish  she does not but it is not important said don erminio children are always hungry and meat costs much when one is a sportsman fish costs nothing and there is more money for me  he stepped on some wet weed and staggering across the ledge declared the man who made his sandals had no shame but don erminio was seldom angry long and kit admitted he was a sportsman they were looking for the big yellowstriped eel which in the canaries is a delicacy and when the captain got his breath he plunged into the shallow water and began to whistle  salta morena he called in a thin highpitched note  the morena feeds on pulps the squid and octopus which blow out air with a whistling noise when the pools get dry the spaniards eat the small pulps but some are large and morenafishers state they eat men after a time don erminio jumped into a chasm where the surge swung to and fro and presently stopped in front of a dark cave long weed tossed about with the wash and the light that touched the rock was broken by puzzling reflections in which the captains legs shone lividly white kit standing behind him rather wished he would leave the cave alone somehow the dark hole looked forbidding but don erminio declared he had seen a morena go in and kit resigned himself to wait  by and by he remarked under water a dark object stretched across a rock it was spotted and looked rather like a thick stalk of weed he thought it wavered but the movement of the water might account for this and don erminio began to pull about the weed when kit looked down again the object was curved and thicker than he had thought it obviously moved and its outer end was getting near the captains leg then kit saw another and for a moment stood stiff and quiet while something throbbed in his ears he knew the objects were the arms of an octopus  he roused himself and pushing the captain back lifted his rod and struck don erminio saw and shouted but turned to the cavern and his pole jarred on kits the weed tossed the water got disturbed and thick and kit saw indistinctly three or four waving arms it looked as if the thing was coming out and he struck in savage panic at the spot he thought it occupied then don erminio leaped on to a dry ledge and pulled kit up when they looked back an indistinct spotted horror writhed about the mouth of the cave for a few moments kit fought against a sense of nausea and the throbbing in his ears got worse  buen mozo said the captain beating his shoulder one has enough the big pulpo is the devil vamos in english we get out  while they pulled their boat to the rocks a man some distance off crossed the reef and waved a white jacket it looked as if he signalled and kit saw the ketch he had noted was nearer land but thought her too far off for the crew to see the man however saw the boat for he began to scramble across the rocks shouting to don erminio  the ketch is señor jeffersons and they do not want her to make the port where she must pay some dues the captain said to kit she is to go on to africa but the fellow says his boat is damaged and he cannot carry the message me i think the wind is too strong for him however señor jefferson is very much a gentleman and the thing is possible  kit looked at the sea and doubted the wind was fresh and outside the shelter of the rocks the combers were white and big but don erminio could handle a small sailing boat kit signed agreement and the captain turned to the fisherman  go home mackereleater and say two sailors have taken on your job  they got on board and while the captain rowed kit reefed the latine sail the boat plunged and spray began to blow about when the sail was hoisted kit got on the windward gunwale and the captain took the helm the barquillo was small and did not carry much ballast and the reefed sail pressed her but in order to reach the ketch she must be driven to windward boldly the others saw her coming for they hove their vessel to some distance off kit knew they durst not run far into the rocky bay  the long yard began to bend and foam leaped about the gunwale the barquillo was fast and the latine sail took her well to windward but a small boat going to windward is generally wet when she lurched obliquely across the rollers the spray blew in clouds from her weather bow and now and then their tops broke on board kit durst not get down to throw out the water his weight was needed for a counterbalance on her lifted side and he presently imagined she could not stand much more don erminios clothes and face were wet but he met the big curling seas with cool confidence and somehow the boat went across  when kit could look ahead he saw the ketch was not far off her mainsail was lowered and with jib and mizzen set she swung her forefoot out of the foam and sank until her rail was hidden it was plain the boat could not reach her on one tack and by and by don erminio waved his cap  let them do something now they must come to us he said  the ketchs helm went up she swung round before the wind and when she luffed the boat was close under her lee don erminio and the patron shouted a letter was thrown across the ketch hoisted her mainsail and kit slacked the latine sheet going back the wind was fair and they sped with bows out of the water across the long seas while a wedge of foam stood up above the depressed stern when they landed behind a reef it was nearly dark and don erminio studied kit with a grin  señor jefferson is very much a gentleman and the letter is important he said if you go by the triana and do not stop near the lights nobody will see you i must take the fish to my señora before she buys some meat  kit did not want to go for one thing his thin wet clothes stuck to his body he wore rawhide sandals and could not find one sock yet he would rather like to meet jefferson who no doubt expected the letter he started for the town and after a time stopped at a house in a quiet street somebody opened an iron gate in a narrow arch and kit crossed the patio he saw the stars shine over the court and shadowy bougainvilleas trail from the balconies a fountain splashed in the gloom and he smelt flowers then jefferson came from a lighted room and took him in he gave kit a quick glance and noted his wet clothes but did not look surprised to look surprised was not jeffersons habit  you have saved me some port dues and an awkward delay he said when he had read the letter will you take a drink  kit refused politely and jefferson resumed my wife cant receive you shes at palma and theres something about which i ought to put austin wise will you come along i expect you know mrs austin  perhaps i can claim to know miss brown kit replied and then indicated his clothes  youre near my height and i can fix you i didnt mean to let you go off like that said jefferson smiling  kit wanted to go and when he had put on a white suit of jeffersons they started mrs austins house was modern and occupied a natural terrace on the hill behind the town a veranda ran along the front and kit saw a group of people in basket chairs when jefferson presented him mrs austins smile was kind and olivia gave him her hand presently kit sat down in a corner and looked about  the veranda was wide and mrs austin used it for a drawingroom english and spaniards owned her influence she meddled benevolently with others affairs and presided over something like a salon of the old french school at one end of the veranda a lamp stood on a bronze pillar and bright beams shone out from the rooms behind but kits corner was in the gloom and he was satisfied since he rather doubted the fit of jeffersons clothes in front one saw the clustered lights of the town and the white belt of surf that ran back to the shadowy isleta the sea sparkled in the moons track and then melted into the blue dark behind which was the african coast  kit studied his hosts mrs austin was slender and small her skin was olive and he noted some white in her hair she was very graceful but her glance was rather thoughtful than commanding austin loafed in his easychair he was handsome but looked languidhis hands were white and finelyshaped his glance was careless kit could hardly picture him the hero of macallisters romantic tale in fact austin and jacinta rather disappointed kit  on the whole it was easier to picture jefferson doing something big he was thin and although he was quiet looked resolute and so to speak roughhewn kit thought his was the abraham lincoln type the others however were not really important when olivia was about she wore black and amber a spanish dress of diaphanous material and lace her olive skin was faintly touched like a peach by red kit thought her strangely beautiful and got a hint of pride and conscious power by and by she crossed the floor and joined him  have you gone for another ride she asked  not yet he said we have been at sea and one ride is enough for some time  do you mean you were shaken by your fall if so im sorry  i dont mean the fall going up the barranco to the hills shook me worse i think you know it was my first adventure on horseback anyhow you saw its inglorious close  but i rather thought you enjoyed adventures olivia replied with a twinkle shortly before you arrived i was at a shop in the triana and you crossed the front of the window  kit coloured for he had seen his reflection in jeffersons dressing glass he imagined olivia knew his shoes pinched and the clothes he wore were not his her quiet amusement jarred but he reflected that clothes were not really important  my last adventure was on board a boat not long since he said however i do know a little about a boat  mr musgrave certainly does know jefferson remarked he went off to meet cayman in a fresh breeze that scared the fellow i sent  now you ought to be satisfied said olivia  im not satisfied i didnt expect mr jefferson to back my statement  then you didnt want to persuade me you can manage a boat  not at all said kit i wanted to state that when you stick to things you know youre not ridiculous when i met you at the maize field i was ridiculous because it was pretty obvious i couldnt manage a horse in fact i feel i ought to apologise  i wonder you declared you were logical as far as you knew and when i thought about it i agreed you imagined the channel wasnt safe and saw i was obstinate in consequence you resolved to ride the horse across on the whole i think you were nice  are you disputing mrs austin asked  oh no said olivia i am trying to persuade mr musgrave he was rather noble not long since he rode my horse across a spot he didnt think safe for me  then i reckon his nerve is pretty good jefferson remarked  austin laughed mrs austin said nothing but looked interested and the blood came to kits skin he almost thought olivia shabby anyhow he had had enough if he stopped he might look like a fool again and he declared he must write out some cargo lists mrs austin told him he might come back and after a glance at olivia he turned to jefferson  thank you for the clothes he said in rather a loud voice ill send them home tomorrow  he went off and mrs austin said i dont altogether see  it isnt very obvious olivia replied however i imagine mr musgrave has some grounds for thinking i ought to understand she smiled and resumed well one gets rather tired of the banana men and although mr musgrave has some drawbacks i think hes good stuff what do you think jake  i reckon you know said jefferson who looked at mrs austin you see i brought the young fellow  oh well said olivia we will admit that is something but perhaps its not important mr musgrave has engaged to return your clothes if you had trusted anybody else on board his ship i expect you would not have got them back the correilleros keep all they get     chapter vi  the injured passenger   the red sunset shone behind lanzarotes broken hills and the tradewind had for an hour or two dropped to a light breeze campeadors boat under jib and spritsail was beating up the coast don erminio held the tiller kit sat on the gunwale and smoked and looked about between sea and mountains ran an empty plain crossed by lava ridges and covered by sand that had blown for sixty miles from the sahara in the distance the little whitewashed port of arrecife glimmered against the dark sea the landscape was cleancut and arid kit thought it looked like pictures of palestine  rabbits and vividlycoloured fish occupied the bottom of the boat for don erminio was a keen sportsman and made his sport pay as a rule his other ventures were not profitable and he had taken kit along the coast to look at a new tomato farm in which he had bought shares they found a rude wall enclosing a belt of sand in which kit imagined nothing could be forced to grow and the captain stormed about the knavery of the people who had persuaded him to speculate until he saw a goat now however he was resigned and philosophical  business is not for sailors who are honest people he remarked in english you have seen the finca de tomate buen ejemplo  kit had seen and sympathised with the captain  did you invest much money he asked  fiftydollar money of my señora and when i arrive at my house she make escandolo when they start the finca there is a feast mucho talk and drinky me i say viva la industria take my fiftydollar hombre when i calculate the vermouth fiftydollar buy  kit said it was hard luck and tried not to smile for the captains speculations were something of a joke at las palmas  other time i buy the mule cart don erminio resumed i say if the merchant want his cargo he must use my cart the plan is good i buy more cart and get rich quick vaya the cart is on the mole two good mule in front comes the locomotura pushing the concrete block mal rayo the driver not look and the mule is in the sea i am no more commerciante i am anarchist  kit thought he understood the accident for the mole at las palmas is narrow and the concrete blocks carried on rails to its end are large the captain paused and coughed  don pedro savvy much he buy whisky he went on now i have seen the finca mi troat is like the lime pit  kits throat did not bother him he had inherited an ascetic vein and in a country where wine is cheap he was abstemious for all that he was hungry and he looked ahead to see if the little port got nearer he hoped the breeze would not freshen much before they arrived then he heard blocks rattle and looked astern a schooner had gone about behind them and was overtaking the boat her forefoot swung out of the smooth swell and a thin streak of foam marked her waterline her high sails were black against the sunset as she came up she swerved a jib was hauled aback to stop her and her aftercanvas flapped  la malagueña said don erminio now we get a drink  when the schooner forged past somebody threw a rope kit pulled down the boats mast and in a few minutes he and don erminio got on board she was a beautifullymodelled vessel belonging to the fruitcarrying fleet but kit understood an english merchant had recently chartered her when he jumped down from the bulwarks wolf the merchant crossed the deck  if youll come below and smoke well tow your boat he said and addressed don erminio in good castilian hallo my friend how do things go  they do not go well said the other i have seen the tomato farm  wolf laughed and took them to the small stern cabin where he got out two or three bottles some figs and cigars kit took a copita of sweet white muscatel and studied his host wolf was darkskinned and wore white clothes canary rawhide slippers and a spanish sash but his english was good although he was fat his movements and glance were quick  well put you on board your steamer when we anchor off the town he said presently  then youre not going in said kit  i think not arrecife is an awkward port to make in the dark if the wind holds light well anchor and wait for daybreak  the wind she freshen said don erminio i know the reefs like a fish i pilot you  a steward had lighted the swivelled lamp and kit occupied a locker behind the small swing table don erminio and wolf were opposite and kit thought the captains offer embarrassed the merchant he however smiled and said they would wait they could not land cargo until the morning the casino was dull and to win three or four pesetas was not exciting then he turned to kit  since you sail for las palmas soon ill give you a passenger i expect you know we are trying to start a trade with the tribes on the sahara coast one of my men got hurt and if he goes with you the doctor will look after him tomorrow id like you to send on a note ill give you as soon as you arrive and keep the man on board until a boat comes then perhaps you neednt register him in your passenger lists hes not a spanish subject and we dont want the commandancia officers to make inquiries about the accident  the officers are animals me i know them don erminio remarked  sometimes they bother one wolf agreed however ill pay the sobrecargo for a firstclass berth  don erminio spread out his hands indignantly no señor a friend of yours is a friend of mine there is no use in being captain if ones friends must pay  oh well wolf said smiling i expect the sobrecargo is accountable for the passengers  he put down an envelope and some money kit counted the coins and pushed back three or four  you have given me too much  wolf looked at don erminio and kit thought he slightly lifted his brows don erminio shrugged and wolf leaned forward to pick up the money kit did not know if he got it for the schooner lurched and the floor slanted one heard the water rush along her side and a noise on deck loose canvas banged ropes and blocks rattled and it was plain the breeze had not kept light as a rule the boisterous northeaster freshens after dark  don erminio jumped for the ladder and a few moments afterwards kit got on deck all was dark and showers of spray blew about but he saw the schooner was now lyingto and the crew had partly lowered the big mainsail the indistinct figures hanging on to the long boom were trying down a reef presently they rehoisted the sail and when the schooner started foam boiled about her lee bulwarks and all forward was lost in a cloud of spray kit looked aft and saw campeadors boat lifted half her length out of water at the end of the towrope  they made two tacks and then hove the schooner to with the lights of the little town abeam the crew pulled up campeadors boat and kit balancing on the schooners rail waited for a minute before he jumped long whitetopped combers ran in the dark the schooner rolled lifting her wet side out of the foam sometimes the boat bumped her planks and sometimes swung away on the backwash at length kit jumped and held her off while don erminio rather unsteadily came down a rope then two men appeared at the gangway carrying another the boat swung towards the vessel kit bracing himself to bear a load reached up and next moment the man fell upon him  a rope splashed he stepped the little mast and hoisted the jib don erminio seized the tiller the schooner vanished and the boat headed for arrecife the passenger lay in her bottom and did not move by and by campeadors lights tossed in the dark ahead for there was no moon and the gloom was thickened by spray and blowing sand the steamer rolled savagely and kit knew if they missed her it would be awkward to make the shallow surfswept port one could not trust the captains pilotage wolf had been generous with his liquor  riding on a combers crest they sped past campeadors stern and kit saw her side pierced by lights lengthen out he jumped for the mast and dropped sail while don erminio shoved down the helm the boat ran on towards the illuminated square of the gangway under the saloondeck and a rope came down then kit pulling out the mast held her off with the hook and the steamer rolled her bilge out of the water gangway and ladder went up her side looked like a high slanted wall and then she rolled back and buried the ladder in swirling foam  indistinct figures cut against the light and scrambled down the ladder kit let the boat swing in and somebody seized the passenger and dragged him out of the boat next moment kit was on the platform at the bottom of the ladder with the water about his knees helping the others who pulled their load through the gangway the officers messroom was opposite and carrying in the man they put him on the locker cushions he looked young but his eyes were shut he breathed heavily and a dirty bandage covered the lower part of his face when they entered macallister got up  whas this where did ye get him  his names scot and we brought him from wolfs schooner hes hurt  maybe the bandage indicates it said macallister who studied the man for a that i alloo hes drunk  kit was surprised and rather indignant but macallister grinned  im telling ye and i ought to ken  verdad said the captain don pedro savvy much me i savvy something too es cierto the animal is drunk  the ship was crowded by emigrants for cuba and when they had put a pillow under scots head kit went for his dispatch box and got to work at midnight he returned to the messroom and found scot sitting up with his back against the bulkhead his eyes were dull and his pose was slack but he awkwardly sucked up some liquor through a maize stalk macallister sat opposite looking sympathetic  is that stuff good for him kit asked  dye ken what the stuff is macallister rejoined  kit admitted that he did not and remembered that the other sometimes doctored the captain from the ships medicinechest when don erminio had friends on board his throat was generally bad  anyhow kit added i only see one glass  he can hear ye although he canna talk macallister resumed  where were you when you got hurt kit asked  scot moved his hand over his shoulder and kit thought he meant to indicate the african coast  how did you get hurt  the other felt in his pocket and taking out a piece of lead dropped it on the table kit saw it was a bullet and the end was flattened  hit a bone macallister remarked  but how did they get the bullet out wolf has not a doctor on board  macallister smiled scornfully when ye have gone to sea langer yell ken a sailors talents for a that yell no trust the captain if the boat carries an engineer but im modest and will not boast  campeador steaming before the big rollers plunged violently one heard the measured beat of engines and roar of broken seas the messtable slanted and kit picked up the bullet which rolled about and struck the ledge he wanted to ask scot something but macallister waved his hand  dinna bother the puir fellow away and count your tickets  kit went and got a bath and was afterwards occupied until campeador steamed into the port of light when he sent off wolfs note some time afterwards a boat with a portuguese runner from a big hotel came alongside and they put scot on board in the evening kit went to ask for him but the clerk declared scot had not arrived and he doubted if their runner had gone to meet the correillo muleteers and cameldrivers from arrecife did not stop at fashionable hotels kit was forced to be satisfied but he thought the thing was strange     chapter vii  the bullet   all the basket chairs on mrs austins veranda were occupied and two or three young men leaned against the posts mrs austin used no formality people came and went when they liked jacinta had a smile for all to some she talked in a low voice and with some she joked she knew things her guests hid from everybody else and held a clue to numerous intrigues the others revolved about her jacinta so to speak occupied the middle of the stage  austin as usual was satisfied to leave his wife alone the evening reception was her business and if she needed his help he would know in the meantime he talked to jefferson and kit kit was half conscious that he owed his hostess much his clothes were better and the colours did not clash he had dropped one or two mannerisms mrs austin quietly discouraged and had begun to take for models her husband and jefferson jefferson was thin and hard and often quiet although his smile was friendly austin was urbane and looked languid but kit now imagined he was not in fact both had a calm and balance kit admired they had risked and done much but they did not talk down to him to feel they weighed his remarks was flattering  notwithstanding this he was rather annoyed by the young man who talked to olivia the fellow had returned from england and was telling her about cricket and tennis matches and london restaurants olivia looked interested and kit was jealous his cricket was elementary and he knew nothing about tennis but he thought olivia ought to see nasmyth was a fool for one thing he wore spanish alpaca clothes a black spanish hat and a red sash and looked like a brigand from the opera kit instinctively hated a theatrical pose and wished olivia had seen the fellow crumple up after a few minutes dispute with macallister about some coal  he was not in love with olivia this was of course ridiculous she did not move him as betty had moved him to a shy tenderness that was mainly protective when he was with olivia he was romantic and ambitious she inspired him with vague resolves to make his mark and use his talents her charm was strong but kit knew his drawbacks  by and by jefferson asked did you see wolfs schooner when you were on the lanzarote coast  why yes said kit we went on board one evening and brought back a hurt man  he stopped for a moment wolf had asked him not to enter scot on the list of passengers but then he had not asked him not to talk about it besides the thing was puzzling and kit was curious he narrated their getting scot on board and sending him off with the hotel runner at las palmas when he stopped he thought austin looked thoughtful  do you know wolf austin asked  i do not said kit i hadnt met him before he was polite but of course he knew my post  you mean he reckoned you were not worth cultivating jefferson remarked sometimes a mailboats sobrecargo is a useful friend  i dont expect wolf has much use for me hes trading in northwest africa is he not what does he get  the saharas not all desert there are oases and wadys where water runs the berber tribes have goods to trade and some of the stuff that comes out of the hinterland is valuable in fact the caravan roads may presently go west to the atlantic and not north to algiers  what sort of fellows are the tribesmen  physically theyre magnificent i reckon its the proper word six feet tall muscular and hard as rawhide we dont know much about their morals but theyre fearless proud and distrust strangers anyhow theyre a pretty tough crowd to get up against  have you got up against them kit asked  jefferson smiled we have had disputes i reckon you know austin and i send the cayman across now and then sometimes she brings back sheep and barley and sometimes other goods the trouble is the spanish crew are not keen about anchoring on the sahara coast they know the moros but the fellows are not moors but berbers of a sort the true berber is rather short and light these folk are big and dark  whose is the country  the berbers austin replied with some dryness nominally the rio de oro belt belongs to spain france claims the hinterland the coast south of rio de oro and some territory north however did you look up the fellow scot  i tried he was not at the hotel and when i went to the house where wolfs note was sent the old spaniard i saw knew nothing about him  where is the house austin asked  kit told him and he looked at jefferson who knitted his brows  oh well said austin do you know how scot got hurt  kit took out the bullet he couldnt talk but when we asked about his injury he put this on the table the boat was rolling and i thought the thing would jump off  jefferson examined the bullet and gave it to austin who said nothing for a few moments and then lighted a cigarette  strange and perhaps significant austin remarked  why is it strange we know the man was shot said kit  the berbers use long smoothbore muzzleloading guns beautiful guns with inlaid stocks probably made long since in persia and india i dont know how they get them but these people are not savages they have a pretty good trading system and caravan roads this bullet was fired from a modern rifle a mauser i think do you want it  kit said he did not and austin glanced at mrs austin who presently beckoned jefferson he went off and kit pondered on the surface the others had been frank but he doubted if they had told him all they knew then it was perhaps strange mrs austin had signed to jefferson  looks as if the bullet interested you kit ventured  that is so austin admitted with a smile we imagined we knew the range of the berbers smooth guns since they make very good shooting we found this useful but a modern rifle is another thing in fact i begin to see  kit was intrigued by the hint of romantic adventure but austin stopped and got up for olivia advanced sitting down by kit she opened her fan  since you come to see us i expect youre not bored she said  not at all said kit i feel i owe mrs austin much for leave to come alls so new to me  the people well i suppose were rather a mixed lot  i didnt altogether mean the people although they are new at liverpool my friends were of a type the industrious clerks type we had our rules you must be sober and punctual you must look important and your aim was to get on at las palmas youre not a type but individuals doing what you like still i think the new surroundings count for more after the shabby streets the rows of little mean houses to come to this  he indicated the dark volcanic mountains whose broken tops cut the serene sky the atlantic sparkling in the moons track and the twinkling lights along the belt of surf when he stopped he heard the sea and the cazadores band playing in the alameda the smell of heliotrope came from the dusty garden  all is really beautiful anyhow at night when you cant see the port olivia agreed it looks as if you felt its charm but i think you resist some people dont trust beauty  in a sense to come south was like coming out of a dark room when the sun is bright im so to speak dazzled and cant see which way to go  youre not emancipated yet olivia rejoined in spain we dont bother where we go so long as the road is easy and the sun does shine however we wont philosophise you did look bored not long since  kit had not imagined olivia had noted his annoyance when she talked to the young man in the theatrical clothes but he was beginning to know her  dont you think i was justified he asked  she laughed the charm of the souths insidious when you arrived you were a puritan something of jeffersons stamp well he doesnt flatter one but one trusts him  i think him and austin fine kit declared theyre quiet and austins humorous but you feel what they say goes then you know their politeness is sincere but since jeffersons american why does he live at las palmas  ill tell you his story he was mate of an american sailing ship some time since when sailing ships were numerous she was wrecked and when she was sinking the crew got at some liquor and tried to kill their officers i believe they did kill one or two and then jefferson got control  you can picture his getting control kit remarked but this doesnt account for  the survivors story was tragic and jefferson lost his post he came to las palmas and went to the coaling wharf in the meantime he had met on board a steamer the girl he married  ah said kit calm nights in the tropics with the moon on the sea the girl was romantic and liked adventure  not at all muriel gascoyne was conventional the daughter of a remarkably disagreeable clergyman who came out to stop the marriage but arrived too late macallister had something to do with that he delayed the correillo when gascoyne was crossing from teneriffe then jefferson got a small legacy and bought the wreck of the cumbria austin went to help him and when they floated the ship married my sister the doctors said mrs jefferson could not stand a northern climate and jefferson stopped at las palmas he and austin had earned rather a large sum by their salvage undertaking i think thats all but the storys romantic doesnt it fire your ambition  to begin with i dont expect a legacy kit remarked then im not like austin  olivia smiled and shut her fan no you are something like jefferson he married a clergymans daughter well i imagine jacinta wants me  she went off and kits heart beat olivia thrilled him but he was not a fool for one thing he knew she knew he was not her sort then wrecks that poor adventurers could float were not numerous all the same when he talked to olivia he was carried away and wondered whether he could not by some bold exploit mend his fortune he frowned and lighted a fresh cigarette  soon afterwards wolf came up the steps with his dark skin soft black sombrero and black silk belt he looked like a spaniard his urbanity was rather spanish than english when he stopped by mrs austin kit somehow imagined she was not pleased but she laughed and they talked for a few minutes then wolf joined another group and afterwards pulled a chair opposite kits  i must thank you for landing scot looks as if you used some tact your getting him quietly was an advantage  a hotel runner brought his boat but when i went to look him up the clerk knew nothing about him kit replied  wolf smiled a dollar carries some weight with a hotel tout and i didnt want to put the port captains men on the track since scot landed in the hotel boat theyd take it for granted he was a sick english tourist and unless were engaged in business the spanish officials dont bother us  kit rather doubted if wolf was english as his remark implied and reflected that he had not much grounds for trusting him for one thing when he paid scots passage he put down a larger sum than was required and kit thinking about it afterwards imagined the fellow expected him to keep the money then macallister declared scot was drunk and kit had noted that he was strangely dull to some extent however wolfs frankness banished his doubts  is scot getting better he asked  hes not making much progress in fact since the town is hot just now we have sent him away  kit noted that he did not state where scot had gone but perhaps this was not important and he wanted to be just  are you satisfied with your post on board the correillo wolf resumed  in a way said kit i like my job but the pay is small  wolf looked thoughtful perhaps you ought to stop until you know the country and the spanish merchants but i might help you by and by well talk about it again  he crossed the floor and by and by kit got up mrs austin gave him her hand and olivia went with him to the steps  is mr wolf a friend of yours she asked  i dont know said kit i think hes friendly  olivia knitted her brows jacinta receives him but sometimes i wonder anyhow i imagine she approves you and you might find her a useful friend people come to her when they cant see their way  she let him go and kit returned to his ship wondering whether her remarks indicated that he ought to consult mrs austin before he made friends with wolf     chapter viii  a swimming match   a light breeze touched the long swell that splashed about the coaling mole for the range that runs down the middle of teneriffe cut off the tradewind the sun was near the mountain tops and cool shadow touched santa cruz the houses on the hillside had faded to grey but the lower town shone dazzlingly white and the sea was like wrinkled silver at the end of another mole across the flatlycurving bay a beach of black sand and a green house with balconies marked the citizens bathing place the correillo rode at anchor near the moles seaward end and an african mail boat rolled upon the sparkling swell between her and the coaling station  kit standing in the shade of a truck pulled off his clothes and glanced at the water the strong light pierced the smooth undulations and he saw the stones three or four fathoms down a young clerk from a merchant house half undressed sat upon a lava block and three or four others were stripping in the shadow of a neighbouring truck one bantered macallister who wore a towel and talked at large  i was a swimmer before ye were born the engineer rejoined weel i alloo yere soople and a bonny pink but yere saft when i get in the water ill let ye see  youre not really going in remarked another and a lad seized macallisters arm  put on your clothes mac well let you off your bet  yere generous but its possible ye canna pay though id feel shame to rob ye i never made a bet i didna try to win macallister replied and stretching his arms above his head balanced on his toes thirty years sin ye would not have seen me go but the cares o the world have worn me no to talk aboot keeping steam wi shortweight coal  kit turned to his companion perhaps its curious but i havent seen macallister in the water since he started the match i suppose he can swim  you cant argue like that about don pedro said the other anyhow i think nelson doubts he tried to stop him  kit glanced with some curiosity at the young man who had meddled crossing the plaza on the evening before he stopped in front of a hotel and heard somebody singing perhaps it was because the song was english and heard among the tall white spanish houses had an extra charm but kit was moved by the music and thought the voice very fine entering the hotel he found macallister in the group about the piano and when the engineer admitted that nelsons song was good but declared he himself could beat any englishman singing riding or swimming the match was arranged  nelsons at the coaling sheds i think kit remarked  that is so agreed the other don arturo heard him sing in a church choir at home and gave him the coaling job  because he can sing  the other laughed doesnt look very logical but don arturos reasoning isnt always obvious you dont know why he likes you and this has some advantages  kit threw off his shirt and when he walked to the edge of the mole in his thin swimming suit the other gave him an approving glance his head was well poised on his sunburned neck his figure was tall finelylined and muscular he looked hard and athletic but he was tired for it was not long since he had laboured with don erminio across the high rocks of gomera to look for suppositious wild goats  the suns hot and i wish theyd send us off but i dont see the launch to take our clothes across he said  thats nelsons job and nelson forgets they tell you in the sheds he sometimes forgets how many bags of coal go to a ton which leads to complications since they dont fix the weight by scale and beam but don juan is coming get ready to start  a man carrying a watch jumped on a truck shouted a warning and began to count white figures leaped from the wall and for a moment kit turned his head he saw macallister advance to the edge of the mole and the campeadors mate seize him from behind there was a struggle and the mate and macallister fell but next moment kit heard his number and threw himself forward in a long flat plunge he came up on top of a roller and shaking the water from his eyes saw the african boat and campeador cut the dazzling sky then a long green slope rose in front  he swung out his left arm and dropped his hand in front of his head his head went under with the impetus he got and when he came up he saw santa cruz glimmer pearlygrey the shadow had crept across the town and was moving out to sea kit did not see the others when one uses the overhand stroke one does not see much and for the most part he was down in the hollow of the trough he made the best possible speed he could but after a time found the effort hard kit was not a mountaineer and climbing across broken lava for eight or nine hours is strenuous work besides the water was colder than he had thought and when he swung up on a long undulation he stopped and looked about  the sun had gone and the sea was dark between him and the beach a small white object broke the surface and vanished farther back he saw a dot like a swimmers head he was too far out the bathing house looked a long way off he could not see the launch then he sank into the hollow and the view was lost  kit changed his stroke and swam on his chest he must economise his strength because he doubted if he could reach the sandy beach and to land on the reefs would be awkward in fact it began to look as if he was not altogether swimming for sport perhaps he ought to steer for the correillo but she was some distance off by and by he heard a faint shout and paddled easily until a man overtook him  hallo nelson he said are you trying to get past  not at all gasped the other ive had enough saw you were going away and made a spurt  kit swimming slowly could talk without much effort and asked wheres macallister  on the mole wish i was where are you heading  i thought about the correillo  nelson blew the water from his sinking lips too far im going to the african boat  we have got no clothes  its not important lets get out of the water  clothes are important kit rejoined i expect she has a crowd of tourists on board and dont see myself walking about the saloondeck in a bathing suit  get on and stop talking nelson spluttered  now im going easy i can talk all right  dont growled nelson youll have to help me before long  kit got level with him brace up go slow and keep stroke with me  they went on sometimes seeing for a few moments the slanted hull and white deckhouses of the african boat sometimes nothing but sky and heaving water still the ship was getting near and by and by her whistle shrieked  wants the waterbarge said nelson she cant start yet  kit was relieved to know this the steamer had finished coaling and if she started before they reached her it would be awkward after a few minutes he lifted his head and looked about the liner rolling on the long swell was now close in front he saw her wet plates shine as she lifted them from the sea and the groups of passengers about her rail some had glasses and he thought they were watching him and his companion the vessel was obviously taking home the last of the winter tourists and kit frowned when he noted womens dresses it did not look as if he could get on board quietly all the same he must get on board because he could go no farther  he encouraged nelson and passing her high bow they swam along her side the ladder was aft and all the passengers on the saloondeck came to the rail kit seized the ladder and when he had pulled nelson on to the platform hesitated no shore boats were about and he could not swim to the beach  embarrassing but lets get up gasped nelson  kit set his mouth and went up a steward who wore neat uniform met him at the top  have you got a ticket sir  i have not said kit do i look like a passenger  ships cleared sir all visitors sent off were only waiting for the waterboat  kit made an effort for control to get savage would not help and the fellow had no doubt been ordered to let nobody come on board for all that a number of amused passengers were watching the dispute the thing was ridiculous and he was cold he thought he knew one of the passengers and tried to signal but the fellow went behind a boat although an iron ladder a few yards off led to the welldeck the steward resolutely blocked the way then a very smart mate crossed the deck  why have you come on board what do you want he asked  clothes to begin with said kit anyhow we have got on board and were going to stop until we get a boat  the whistle shrieked and drowned the others reply he turned nelson pushed kit and they ran for the ladder plunging down they reached an alleyway and nelson laughed  i dont expect the fellow will come after us a liners mate has got to be dignified if you want help when things are awkward try the engineer  they went up the alleyway and met a short thin man wearing a stained blue jacket and greasy trousers he stopped and studied them without surprise  weel he said are ye going to a fancy ball  we want to borrow some clothes dungarees overalls anything youve got said kit we had to give up a swimming match and couldnt reach my ship astern of you  the little spanish mailboat yere with macallister  of course he got up the match although i think he didnt start  its verra possible said the other dryly mack canna swim but if ye are friends o his i must get ye clothes  kit thanked him and then looking at the man thoughtfully added that he doubted if the things would fit  i wasna meaning to lend ye my clothes the engineer replied if yere no fastidious the seconds aboot your size since hes occupied below i dinna think hell mind  he took them into the messroom gave them some white clothes and went off remarking yell be ready to go ashore with the waterboat when theyve filled my tanks we start  he wont start for some time said nelson you see until we were on the mole i forgot to tell felix they wanted water jardine sent the coal but the waters my job  you seem to forget rather easily kit remarked  oh well said nelson don arturo gave me the post because i can sing he paused and added apologetically i really can sing you know  kit laughed he thought he liked nelson where do you think the others went  theres a sandy spot near the barranco and i expect they crawled out of course the distance was too long but macallister insisted we should go right across  yet the engineer declared he cant swim  he cant swim i have gone in with him at the bathing beach all the same i dont think this would bother mack if your mate had not meddled hed have started  but the things ridiculous kit exclaimed if you cant swim and jump into deep water you drown  unless somebody pulls you out anyhow mack is like that and i forget things don arturos men are a fantastic lot a number of us have talents that might be useful somewhere else and so far as i can see a number have none but we keep the business going and beat spaniards french and germans at jobs theyve studied i dont know if its good luck or unconscious ability however well go on deck and look for the waterboat  they went up the ladder and saw a tug steaming for the ship with a barge in tow a few minutes afterwards the passenger kit thought he knew crossed the deck  mr scot said kit looking at him hard  i am scot said the other met you on board the correillo come to the smokingroom and lets get a drink  the smokingroom was unoccupied and they sat down in a corner kit thought scot had not wanted to meet him and was curious the fellow talked awkwardly and the side of his face was marked by a red scar  you picked up my bullet he said  i did kit admitted meant to give it you back but i forgot do you want the thing  id like to know what you did with it  austin got the bullet i gave it him one evening when we were talking about africa  you gave it austin scot exclaimed after all perhaps it doesnt matter i have had enough and am not going back  how did you get hurt  for one thing id put on a cloth jacketthe evenings are pretty coldand dark serge doesnt melt into a background of stones and sand i imagined the tribe knew me  perhaps a stranger fired the shot  there are no strangers about the wady azar i carried an automatic pistol but i reckoned the other fellows knew it wouldnt pay to shoot in fact i dont yet see why i was shot  the bullet was not from a smoothbore but a rifle said kit  scot gave him a keen glance and smiled oh well ive had enough of africa suppose we talk about something else  nelson and scot talked about london until the tugs whistle blew and they ran to the gangway the ladder was hauled up but kit and nelson went down a rope to the waterboat and as she sheered off the engineer came to the steamers rail  yell mind aboot the clothes when we come back he shouted     chapter ix  kit gives his confidence   campeador bound for teneriffe rolled with a languid swing across the shining swell her slanted masts and yellow funnel flashed her boats and deck were dazzling white and kit coming out of his dark office looked about him with halfshut eyes when he joined the correillo he had not expected to find the spanish crew kept her clean but she was as smart as an english mailboat and kit admitted that some of his british prejudices were not altogether justified now however she was not steaming at her proper speed the throb of engines harmonised in a measured rhythm with the roar at the bows but the beat was slow kit turned and saw macallister watching him with a grin  ye look glum said the engineer  its possible we are late again and i dont see how im to finish my business at santa cruz before we start for orotava have your muleteer firemen got too much rum or did you forget to chalk the clock  macallister smiled yere hipped im thinking olivia wasna kind but ye have not much notion o amusing a bonny lass theyre no all satisfied to be looked at man when i was young but ye needna tell me ye didna go til mrs austins i saw ye stealing off with your new silk belt and your shoes fresh chalked  miss brown has nothing to do with the boats arriving late  i mind a trip when her sister had much to do with our arriving verra late indeed gascoyne mrs jeffersons father was on board going to stop the wedding and jacinta gave me a bit hint but thats anither tale the trouble is when yere short o fuel ye cannot keep steam i allood i kenned a the tricks o the coaling trade but a lad with the looks and voice o a cherub let me down two hundredweight a ton weel i might have kenned after the innocent set on juan to hold me so i couldna win the swimming match  youre near the limit mack kit remarked and went off  he was disturbed but campeadors slowness did not account for all before she sailed a letter arrived from his mother who stated in a postscript that betty did not look well the girl felt the cold of an unusually bleak spring and worked too hard mrs musgrave understood the doctor thought she ought to go south but betty of course could not  kit walked up and down the deck and pondered betty had refused him and he had resigned himself to let her go in fact he had begun to think he had not really loved her much now however to know she was ill hurt he wanted to help but it was impossible  then he remembered that mrs austin and mrs jefferson were on board perhaps he ought to see if they were comfortable besides to talk to them might banish his moodiness he found them sitting to lee of the deckhouse and leaned against the rail opposite beneath him in the moving shadow of the ship the water was a wonderful blue farther back the long undulations touched here and there by white melted into the shining plain of the atlantic in the distance teneriffes high range was streaked by silver mist from which projected a glittering cone  mrs austin held a book and rings sparkled on her hand mrs austin was fond of rings kit knew she was the daughter of a merchant who began his business career by selling sailors cheap tobacco but he thought her like an old french marquise a marquise with a salon where plots were made  mrs jefferson was not like that she was not fashionable and one felt her gentle calm somehow kit knew the calm was inherited one could not altogether get it by cultivation she had quiet eyes her sympathetic voice moved him now and then he was rather afraid of mrs austin he loved mrs jefferson he owned it strange he should enjoy the society of ladies like these  in the meantime mrs austin studied kit although he was very raw when he arrived he was so to speak toning down she had taught him something mrs austin had educated a number of raw young men but since it looked as if olivia were interested in his progress she wondered whether she was rash to meddle with kit for one thing he was rather handsome he carried himself well and his figure was good he was honest and his frank look had some charm then he had begun to choose his clothes properly mrs austin admitted she had given him some hints now however he was obviously disturbed and she had grounds for curiosity she knew she could persuade him to give her his confidence and she did so with a cleverness kit did not note by and by he gave her impulsively his mothers letter  im bothered about the thing he said  mrs austin passed on the letter to mrs jefferson on the whole she was conscious of some satisfaction because she thought mrs musgraves use of the postscript significant  one doesnt like to hear ones relations are ill she remarked in a sympathetic voice  for a moment or two kit hesitated mrs austin was olivias sister and he had not meant to talk about betty sometimes he did talk when he ought to be quiet  betty is not a relation but im bothered about her being ill he said and indicated the snowy peak silver mist and shining atlantic i feel shabby as if the things not just you see ive got so much and betty who needs all ive got more is shivering in the cold you dont know liverpool when the east winds blow in spring  i know other english and some american towns in winter said mrs jefferson when my husband found i could not stand the cold he brought me back to the canaries i think i can sympathise with betty  not altogether kit rejoined when you are tired you can rest betty cant you have not to go to an office at nine oclock knowing that if youre ill for a week or two you may lose your job you are not forced to stop until nine oclock in the evening without extra pay when trade is good  are office girls paid nothing extra for extra work  all i know are not said kit perhaps five pounds at christmas if the house is remarkably prosperous but i dont think betty minded this you feel the dreariness most the poor food you eat in the middle of a crowd the fight for the tramcars when it rains and the long walk through muddy streets when you cant get on board i expect a girl hates to sit all day in wet clothes besides it isnt good then bettys office is dark and she writes entries in a book until her eyes ache the things so to speak hopeless you feel youve got to go on like that for ever  he paused and his look was very gentle when he resumed betty bore it cheerfully she has pluck but i knew she was tired and now shes ill  was she going to marry you mrs austin asked  no said kit blushing like a girl when i got my post i wanted her to promise she would marry me when i came back but she refused  this was just before you sailed mrs austin remarked thoughtfully  of course until don arturo sent for me i knew it might be long before i could support a wife betty knew but she went about with me sometimes we went to small concerts and sometimes on saturday afternoons across the river on the cheshire side you can get away from the streets theres a wood one can reach from a station and primroses and hyacinths grow in the dead leaves betty was happy among the flowers she loves things like that she used to watch the thin birch sprays swing across the white trunks i didnt know they were birches until she told me but i sometimes thought her eyes were like the hyacinths however ive talked a lot and im boring you  we are not bored said mrs jefferson and mrs austin mused  kits voice was very gentle it looked as if he had not known passion and mrs austin thought betty had qualities one could picture a girl whose life was dreary using all her charm to get a lover but betty obviously had not she had refused kit although nothing he had said indicated that she was calculating and ambitious well one sometimes met a girl whose thought was not for herself  after all a sobrecargos pay on board the correillo is not large she said  that is so kit agreed but one has so much besides the sea the sunshine friends i could not have got at liverpool one feels confident there are better jobs and perhaps one is not forced to be poor always anyhow betty didnt bother about the pay she can go without things but when i tried to persuade her she was firm well i think its done with she wont marry me all the same if i could bring her out to rest and get strong in the sun  he stopped with some embarrassment and resumed i have bored you and must get the captain to sign the manifests  he went off and mrs austin looked at mrs jefferson  well she said  i like him said mrs jefferson i think id like the girl one feels he drew her better than he knew  yet hes not her lover  he doesnt know he is her lover but its important that when he thinks about her being ill hes strongly moved to know she might get well here but he cant help hurts im sorry she cant come  i dont know that its impossible mrs austin replied  mrs jefferson gave her a thoughtful glance jacinta was generous and often helped people but mrs jefferson imagined she had an object now  you dont know her and i expect shes independent  for all that i dont imagine she would refuse a good post and a post where the work is light might be got well talk about it again  when campeador arrived at santa cruz mrs austin and mrs jefferson drove across the island to orotava and kit went round with the ship orotava is open to the atlantic and landing is sometimes awkward but onions were cheap and the company had engaged to load a barque for cuba kit sent off a quantity on board the cargo launches and then went to the agents office to pay for the goods in spanish countries business is not transacted with much speed and when he started for the harbour it was dark he wore deckshoes and thin white clothes and his pockets bulged with documents at the marina he met mrs austin olivia and jefferson  we came down after dinner to see the surf its rather grand tonight olivia remarked i suppose you are going on board  kit said he was going he carried the ships papers and she could not sail until he arrived then he asked jefferson have you seen my boat  they ran her up when the sea began to break i reckon youll have some trouble to get off  this was obvious at orotava the surf is not quiet long and while kit was engaged at the agents the rollers had got high and steep for a moment or two he looked up the famous horseshoe valley mist floated about the shoulders of the giant peak but the mist was still and lights high up on the shadowy slopes did not twinkle the illumination about the big hotel on the cliff was steady one got no hint of wind the night was calm and hot for all that the atlantic was disturbed and the crash of breakers rolled about the little town the air throbbed with the measured roar  kit looked seawards two short moles enclosed a break in the lava rocks but their ends were lost in phosphorescent foam and a white turmoil marked the gap between now and then most part of a wall vanished and a yeasty flood ran far up the beach kit saw a group of indistinct figures standing about a boat and left the party  can one get a boat off mrs austin asked jefferson  its risky musgrave means to try the danger spot is where the rollers break on the shallows at the harbour mouth beyond that theyre smooth  after a few minutes kit returned and jefferson said well  kit laughed theyre not keen about going but the promise of a bottle of caña carries some weight and old miguel is a useful man at the steering oar anyhow ive got to try keeping up steam costs something and a barque at palma waits for the onions  dyou reckon a sobrecargos pay covers the risk jefferson asked  they stood near a lighted wine shop and kit gave him a puzzled look perhaps we ought to get paid for an extra awkward job but in a sense the pay has nothing to do with it when you sign on you engage to do whats required but you ought to see  jefferson saw and his eyes twinkled kit was embarrassed because he had remembered the others and thought he was talking like a prig all the same the young fellow was staunch  miguel will come to the steps for me kit resumed and they went with him along the wall a quarter of a mile off the correillos lights tossed in the dark  the boat was a thirtyfoot cargo launch rowed double banked by sturdy fishermen but swinging about on the white turmoil she looked small sometime when a thundering roller broke across the mole she vanished to get on board was awkward but when she stopped opposite some steps kit ran forward and stood stiffly posed at the top  ahora señor somebody shouted  kit jumped the others saw his white figure plunge and vanish a crash half drowned by the roar of the sea indicated that he had got on board and the boat went out on the backwash that rolled down the harbour like an angry flood there was no moon but one could see her dark hull against the phosphorescent foam the men were pulling hard their bodies swung and fiery splashes marked the big oars path at the mouth of the harbour she lurched up almost perpendicular over a white sea plunged and melted into the dark  they have got out said olivia it was very well done  then well go back to the hotel mrs austin remarked rather coolly you are wearing your dinner dress and the spray is thick  im not going yet olivia declared  mrs austin knew her sister and waited although she was annoyed one could not blame kit for doing what he ought but the thing was unlucky after a minute or two jefferson jumped on a lava block and olivia cried out just outside the harbour a long dark object rolled about in the foam the object was like a boat but it was obviously not the proper side up  she may clear the head of the mole said jefferson and he and olivia plunged into the spray  mrs austin hesitated and was too late a sea washed across the wall the others had vanished and she durst not go alone men began to run about and she saw the boat was coming back extraordinarily fast she was upside down but two or three white objects clung to her and swimmers heads dotted the frothing surge that carried her along jefferson and olivia ran back and mrs austin went with them to the beach the boat struck the lava and was pulled up a group of dripping men pushed through the crowd and jefferson stopped the patron  have you all got back he asked  all but señor musgrave said the other we held on to the boat he went on  he went on olivia broke in do you mean swimming where did he go  to the ship señorita he shouted he must get on board  the man went off and jefferson remarked i reckon musgrave will make it the surfbelts narrow and theres nothing to bother him after he gets through if hed come back he might have washed past the harbour and hit the rocks ill wait at the agents office and see if the correillo starts  ill stop with you said olivia firmly  they waited for half an hour and then campeadors whistle pierced the roar of the surf her lights began to move and jefferson said shes steaming off musgrave has made it  olivia thrilled but said nothing mrs austin said they had better go back to the hotel and pondered while they climbed the steep path to the cliff kit had tried to get on board because he thought he must he had not consciously wanted to persuade olivia he had pluck all the same he had done a bold thing with an object that justified his rashness and olivia had seen the risk he ran mrs austin however was rather sorry she had suggested their going to the mole     chapter x  mrs austin makes some plans   mrs austins veranda was not as crowded as usual for one thing a steamer that touched at las palmas regularly had arrived from the argentine and her captain was giving a ball to which mrs austin had resolved she would not go captain farquhars friends were numerous but rather mixed his feasts were not marked by the strict observance of conventional rules and at las palmas jacinta austin was something of a great lady when kit came up the steps she gave him a gracious smile  im flattered because you have not like the others deserted me she said  you are kind to hint you would note if i came or not kit replied however i must own i dont dance  then if you did dance you would have gone to captain farquhars ball  kit smiled i think not to begin with id sooner come here and i went on board carsegarry when she called on her outward run captain farquhars kind but i had enough in another sense so had macallister and don erminio  you would be nicer if you knew where to stop mrs austin remarked  if youll let me stop now for half an hour ill be satisfied said kit  satisfied said mrs austin oh well i know youre frank frankness has advantages but perhaps its not always necessary  she noted that his glance wandered to olivia and she began to talk about something else he was not going to join olivia but while she talked she studied kit he was an honest sober young fellow and had recently begun to make allowances for others and had learned to laugh in the meantime however she thought his laugh was forced  if you are not amused you neednt make an effort to be polite she said when you arrived i knew you were moody  then im duller than i thought kit rejoined you oughtnt to have known on your veranda ones bothers vanish  why were you bothered  i got another letter and bettys worse said kit my mother states she has been warned she must give up her post her works too hard she must get the sun and fresh air i feel i ought to help but its impossible thinking about this ive begun to see my job on board the correillo leads nowhere perhaps theyll let me stop when my engagements up but theres no promotion  mrs austin knew the spanish manager was satisfied and meant him to stop  all the same you like your job she said  for the most part but one gets some jars recently we have been buying onions a ship is going to cuba the freight is low and havana merchants give a good price for onions but the peons who grow them in the mountains know nothing about this they have got a big crop that nobody wants to buy and the price has fallen to a very small sum the poor folks are a remarkably frugal industrious lot  i dont know a country with finer peasants mrs austin agreed still if theyre willing to sell you the onions why should you not buy  we are buying too cheap  mrs austin turned to jefferson mr musgrave puzzles me he grumbles because hes buying onions too cheap  let him state his case said jefferson  ill try our plans like this said kit at daybreak campeador steams up to a beach from which cargo can be shipped don erminio and i get horses and go off to the hills where nobody knows about the steamer don erminio stops at a village wine shop and plays the guitar while i talk to the peons theyre an unsophisticated lot with the manners of fine gentlemen and live on maize bananas and goats milk cheese yet for all their poverty i must eat membrillo jelly and drink a cup of wine before we get to business they have stacks of onions and at havana onions are short but the peons dont know and my jobs to buy their crop very cheap the worst is the fellows are grateful and try to make us a feast if they got half the sum their goods are worth theyd be rich its rather like robbing a trustful child  i am a merchants daughter and doubt if i ought to sympathise said mrs austin to buy at the lowest price the seller will take is a sound business plan were you not a business man at liverpool  at liverpool nobody i knew made a profit of a hundred per cent kit rejoined the things not honest besides one feels its not sound  jefferson laughed on the whole i reckon musgraves justified you can fool people once or twice you cant fool them all the time when they find you out they charge you double or sell to another  kit looked at olivia she was talking to two or three young men and the position of their chairs would make it awkward for him to join the group moreover he imagined mrs austin had not meant him to do so by and by he looked at his watch  i must go its later than i thought and ive got to stop at the carsegarry  you said you were not going to the ball  im not going to dance we sail at ten oclock and i must get macallister and don erminio on board  then i allow you have undertaken something of a job jefferson remarked  that is so kit agreed the last time i went for them i got rather damaged and they tore my clothes don erminios excitable and macallister is big all the same somebody must go don ramon at the office is patient but ive known him firm after all hes accountable and we carry the spanish mail  he went off and mrs austin laughed kits naïve but i like him hes a good sort  olivia sent off the young men and stopped for a moment by her sisters chair  kit musgrave is a very good sort but his luck is to get a knockabout part  ones luck turns said jefferson if musgrave gets another part i reckon hell play up  olivia went into the house and mrs austin said to jefferson if harry has finished his writing bring him to me  when jefferson went for austin she knitted her brows kit was obviously attracted by olivia and mrs austin did not approve although in other ways she meant to be his friend she had married a poor man and rousing him to use his talent had helped him to get rich but she doubted if kit had much talent moreover she had qualities olivia had not and kit was not like harry  mrs austin did not know about olivia she thought her sister saw kits drawbacks but the tourists only stopped for a few months in the winter and for the most part the coaling and banana men were dull in fact mrs austin resolved to run no risk  when jefferson returned with austin she said you work too long harry you began this morning as soon as you got up  im forced to work austin replied since jake and i started the african business im pretty closely occupied for one thing he wont write the english letters and my spanish clerks cant  viñoles speaks good english  that is so austin said with a smile you speak good castilian but to write a foreign language is another thing in fact i remember a note of yours that embarrassed a sober spanish gentleman anyhow viñoles method of addressing an english merchant house is señor don bought of thomas dash  what about engaging an english clerk  austin shook his head the experiments risky when the pays not large you must get them young and dont know your luck until they arrive some come out for adventurei imagine these are worstand some come to loaf if musgrave wanted another job i might engage him  i think not said mrs austin firmly why not try an english business girl she wouldnt lose her pay at the casino and borrow from you she wouldnt make disturbances at cockfights  it might work austin replied in fact i begin to see where im being gently led i expect you know a candidate but she mustnt be pretty modern business has nothing to do with romance  the girl i thought about is a friend of musgraves  ah said austin with a twinkle the plot thickens  now youre ridiculous mrs austin rejoined anyhow my plan has some advantages  she indicated the advantages and enlarged upon bettys business talents about which kit had not said much when mrs austin felt her cause was good she was not fastidious moreover she knew her husband and jefferson and felt she was on firm ground when she drew a moving picture of bettys struggle against failing health and poverty it counted for much that muriel jefferson could not stand the winter in the north when she stopped jefferson glanced at austin  perhaps we might risk it muriel would look after the girl  austin agreed and mrs austin let them go her plans had worked but she was not altogether selfish she liked to help people and thought betty needed help in the meantime however kit must not know she would write to mrs musgrave for when kit gave her the letter she had noted where his mother lived mrs austins habit was to note things like that so far the scheme went well but she had not gone far enough after all betty had refused kit and the correillo stopped at las palmas for three or four days every two weeks betty would be occupied by her business duties but olivia had none mrs austin admitted that her supposition about the girls grounds for refusing kit might not be accurate and imagined a longer voyage for kit was indicated by and by wolf entered the veranda and she saw a plan yet she hesitated she had no logical grounds for doubting wolf but she did doubt him  mr scot whom you sent home after his injury has not come back she said presently  wolf said he did not think scot would come back and waited  are you not embarrassed without him  to some extent wolf replied i cant however go to england and to engage a young man you havent seen is risky then i dont know a coaling clerk id care to hire  but you do want help  wolf agreed and mrs austin looked thoughtful  perhaps its lucky because id like to get mr musgrave a good post i expect you know im a meddler and managing peoples affairs is my habit  i know you are kind and a number of people owe you much wolf replied  mrs austin gave him a gracious smile well i really think mr musgrave is the man you want hes honest and resolute and although i dont know if hes very clever hes not a fool  wolf thought his luck was good he did want a resolute young man but did not want him clever and had for some time thought about kit then he had an object for satisfying mrs austin who did not disown her debts  well he said i imagine i could give musgrave a post hed be willing to take in fact when my schooner comes back from africa ill probably send for him  he stopped and mrs austin waited with quiet amusement she knew wolf did nothing for nothing  señor ramirez arrived from madrid a few days since he resumed i understand don arturo comes from liverpool by the next boat i would like to meet them  but this ought not to be difficult  in a way not at all difficult one can go to a public function and if one is lucky talk for a few minutes to the honoured guest who forgets one immediately afterwards there is not much use in this but to meet an important man at a friends house is another thing  mrs austin pondered ramirez was a spanish officer of high rank and came to the canaries now and then on the governments business don arturo had invested much money in the islands and west africa austin knew both gentlemen and wolf wanted to meet them at her house it looked as if he knew ramirez was going to dine with austin on the whole mrs austin did not want to indulge him and imagined austin would not approve yet wolf had promised to give kit a post  why do you want to meet señor ramirez she asked  i rather think its obvious the spaniards are jealous about the rio de oro belt and i am a foreigner there are rules about trading with the berbers that stand in my way a quiet talk to ramirez might help me much and i imagine he would be interested  jacinta saw something must be risked and after all ramirez knew men he would not take wolfs honesty for granted because he was her friend  very well she said señor ramirez will dine with us one evening and i will tell you when the time is fixed i dont know about don arturo yet  you are very kind said wolf i had meant to send for musgrave but now i feel i must use an extra effort to give him a good post  he went off and soon afterwards mrs austin told austin who frowned  i dont know if i altogether approved the fellows coming to the veranda but this didnt imply much his coming to dinner does  he promised hed give kit a post mrs austin replied  austin looked at her rather hard  you might have helped musgrave at a cheaper cost however one doesnt cheat ramirez easily and so long as you are satisfied  do you imagine wolf will try to cheat him  its possible said austin dryly  mrs austin laughed anyhow ramirez is just and wont make you accountable besides if he is cheated wolf is cleverer than i think     chapter xi  the plans work   dinner was over the night was hot and mrs austin had taken her party to the veranda wolf had gone he declared he could not put off another engagement but mrs austin wondered the fellow was clever and knew when to stop a man like that did not go farther than was necessary and risk losing ground he had won all the same mrs austin was satisfied she had paid her debt and although she had hesitated about asking wolf she now felt her doing so was justified he had interested her famous guests the dinner party had gone well  señor ramirez occupied a chair by a table that carried some fine glass copitas from which one drinks the scented liquors used in spain his family was old and distinguished and his post important he was thin darkskinned and marked by an urbane dignity as a rule he looked languid but sometimes his glance was keen  don arturo sat opposite he was strongly built and getting fat although his hair and eyes were very black he was essentially british he had known poverty but now controlled large commercial undertakings and steamship lines don arturo was loved and hated some found him strangely generous and some thought him hard and careless about the tools he used and broke he made bold plans and had opened wide belts in africa to british trade  mrs jefferson austin and two or three others occupied the background they were so to speak the chorus and in the meantime not important austin knew when to let his wife play the leading part  when i was honoured by your opening your house to me i knew my entertainment would be good but i must own it was better than i thought ramirez presently remarked  ah said mrs austin i hesitated you have public duties i doubted if you could come  duties are always numerous and pleasures strangely few besides at las palmas you command but if one is allowed to talk about your other guest  señor wolf wanted to meet you i hope you were not bored  ramirez smiled some people want to meet me and some do not but i was not bored at all your friend is an interesting man he told me much about which i must think you have known him long  not long said mrs austin she wanted to hint that she did not altogether make herself accountable for her guest and resumed still at las palmas we are foreigners and since he is english  then you imagine señor wolf is english  i have imagined so said mrs austin with some surprise however his skin is rather dark  darker than mine for example ramirez rejoined with a twinkle well the colour of ones skin is not important in spain there are descendants of the visigoths whose colors is white and pink one must rather study mental characteristics  then you think wolfs mentality is foreign said don arturo  it is not english one notes a touch of subtlety an understanding of ones thoughts a keen intelligence  don arturo laughed and mrs austin waved her fan  but señor i am patriotic are we very dull  my lady your grounds for patriotic pride are good your people have qualities let me state an example in these islands our peons are frugal sober and industrious a fine race our merchants are intellectual and cultivated in mathematics philosophy and argument i think no brains are better than ours it is possible we got much from the moors  my coaling and banana clerks are not philosophical and i doubt if many are cultivated don arturo remarked  ramirez spread out his hands you use my argument i admit you have qualities these raw english lads do things we cannot they load in a night bananas we cannot load in two days they get the best fruit they use our fishermen and labourers to coal your ships the profit and all that is good in grand canary goes to you at the hill villages where the peons went to bed at dark your mule carts arrive with cheap candles and oil the shops are full of english clothes and tools when the peon finds he needs your goods he grows things to sell sometimes we are jealous but we trust you  it looks as if you trusted wolf although you imagine he is not english don arturo said dryly  he is the señoras guest said ramirez bowing to mrs austin  ah said mrs austin this does not carry much weight i am not a clever politician and perhaps my judgment is not very sound  all the same i did trust señor wolf he wanted some concessions a little slackening of our rules about trading on the african coast  your rules are rather numerous don arturo remarked  it is so my friend our possessions in africa are small and the moors of rio de oro are fierce and troublesome but i think that belt of atlantic coast will some time be worth much valuable goods cross the sahara from the west soudan and when we have made harbours caravans that now go to morocco and algiers will arrive well perhaps we are cautious we have greedy neighbours and when one has not got much one keeps what one has  don arturo looked thoughtful west africas my field and i dont know the north but now france has got all the hinterland i sometimes think the dispute about the atlantic coast may be reopened i imagine the spanish government is not a friend of islam  when we are not anarchists we are staunch catholics ramirez agreed well in north africa the sun and the tribesmens blood are hot a strange wild country where the agreements diplomatists make do not go but this is not important i think the señoras talented friend interested you  i promised to charter him a steamer said don arturo dryly  a spanish steamer  she is now an english cargoboat of two thousand tons i do not know if wolf will hoist the spanish flag perhaps this might be allowed  ramirezs eyes twinkled it is possible we are poor and cannot pay our officers much but two thousand tons to carry a few sheep  i understand wolf will send her to mojador and saffi for maize and beans  oh well said ramirez we will talk about something else he turned to mrs austin my lady you have seen our politeness is not as deep as people think but you will make allowances when one meets a famous english merchant and a man of talent who knows the rio de oro like señor wolf  although he is not english mrs austin remarked but ramirez smiled and turned to the others who played up  after a time the guests went off and mrs austin said to her husband somehow i feel ive meddled with a bigger thing than i knew in fact i rather wish i had not  your objects good said austin you have got kit a job i suppose this was all you wanted  mrs austin smiled i didnt want to help wolf and if i have helped its because one gets nothing unless one pays however well let it go  when kit returned to las palmas he found a note from wolf and in the evening went to a house in an old quarter of the town the street was narrow quiet and dark but the moon touched one side with misty light kit heard the throbbing rumble of the surf and coming from the noisy steam tram and the lights of the main street he got a hint of mystery in the quietness and gloom the houses had flat tops and looked like forts their straight fronts were pierced by a few narrow slits and a low arch the slits were high up and barred kit thought that part of the city looked as if it had not been built by europeans it rather belonged to egypt or algiers there was something romantic but sinister about it  he knocked at a door and an old man took him across a patio where a ray of moonlight fell the man showed him into a room furnished like an office and kit waited and looked about there was no window but an arch opened on to a passage with dark wooden pillars supporting a balcony a few maps occupied the wall and kit began to study one of the rio de oro belt maps drew him they called one to countries one had not seen and this map pictured a wild land white men did not know much about for all that kit thought it good green rings marked the oases blue threads the wadys where water sometimes runs and the red lines were the tracks by which loaded camels came from the soudan the marks however were not numerous and kit mused about the blank spaces  then he turned with a start and saw wolf he had not heard the fellow come in and noted that he wore slippers of soft red leather his shirt and trousers were white but he wore a red silk sash and a fez cap  my map interests you he said well i doubt if the spanish government owns one as good i expect to have noted that for the most part it is not printed  kit had noted that the caravan roads and wadys were drawn by a pen  i was studying the unmarked spaces he replied  wolf smiled and indicated a chair the explorers instinct theres something about the unknown that pulls all the same more is known about the country than some people think and in one sense it is not a desert then the people are not savages although their rules are the rules the arabs brought a thousand years since they spring from famous stocks carthaginian roman saracen adventurers who pushed across the atlas range and vanished the countrys intriguing but to know it one must be resolute  i suppose the tribes are mohammedans kit remarked  wolf gave him some scented wine and a cigarette with a curious taste and while he smoked kit heard the measured beat of the surf somebody on a neighbouring roof played a guitar and the music was strange and melancholy  some of the tribes are fanatics wolf replied islam was born in the desert and its driving force comes from the wilds when the prophets were made caliphs they lost their real power the turk has got slack and meddles with forbidden things but the faith lives and has spread far recently its missionaries however do not come from constantinople lean john baptists appear in the desert and found fierce reforming sects one has grounds for imagining their job is something like this  ah said kit do they expect a new mohammed  i think they expect a new prophet wolf said quietly not a political caliph but a man from the wilds who will reenforce the ancient arab laws they have waited for him long and have sometimes been cheated their habit is to wait it is possible they will be cheated again  kit was young and romance and mystery appealed well he said id like to see something of northwest africa  then the chance is yours i am sending a steamer to the morocco coast and want a man i can trust to meet the jew merchants and put on board the maize and beans ive bought then shell steam south to pick up goods at rio de oro and my agent must go inland with an interpreter to meet the tribesmen if you like you can go  kits eyes sparkled ill take the post he said and then stopped and frowned i forgot he resumed my engagement with the correos runs for some time  this is not much of an obstacle i am chartering the steamer from the company and expect don ramon will let you off  if don ramon is willing there is no obstacle kit declared and when wolf told him about his pay and duties his resolve was keener he would use a power and responsibility he had not yet known and be richer than he had thought  very well said wolf when you come back from palma you had better see don ramon in the meantime ill get things in trim  kit went down the street with a light step the old spanish house the map and wolfs talk had fired his imagination adventure called in a week or two he was going to see the desert and try his powers     part ii  responsibility     chapter i  olivias experiment   when the correillo returned from palma and kit went to the companys office he was bothered by doubts don ramon the spanish manager had been kind and kit felt shabby he had engaged to serve the company for twelve months and doubted if his asking the other to release him was justified for all that he wanted to go to africa  he was shown into the private office and don ramon after indicating a chair occupied himself for a few minutes with the papers on his desk kits embarrassment was obvious and the manager was amused  i have studied your notes about business at the ports compeador touched on her new round he said presently some of your suggestions are useful i expect you wanted to talk to me about this  not altogether kit replied  then perhaps you meant to talk about painting the passengers rooms  no said kit the rooms need painting but i really meant to ask you to let me off my engagement i have heard about another post  don ramon studied him quietly for a few moments kits glance was direct but the blood had come to his skin the spaniard was very subtle and knew something about young englishmen he rather approved kit  a better post he said  it is better but im not altogether influenced by this kit replied awkwardly i havent much scope on board campeador one likes to feel one is responsible and doing something worth while  ah said don ramon a number of your countrymen arrive at this office with the resolve to do as little as possible however i imagined you were satisfied on board  in a way i am satisfied the captain and engineer are my friends i like the companys agents and your clerks make things easy in fact if you think i ought to stop i will stop  you imply that you are willing to give up the better post unless we agree to your leaving us  of course said kit i wont urge you to agree  don ramon smiled after all your joining mr wolf has some advantages particularly since the steamer he has chartered is ours and i dont know that it is necessary for you to break your engagement with us if it is not broken you could go back to campeador after the other boats return and in the meantime will get your pay i expect mr wolf did not state how long he wanted you  he did not said kit and pondered  perhaps it was strange but he had not stipulated that he must be employed for a fixed time he ought to have stipulated then he was surprised because don ramon knew his object for wanting to go don ramon was clever and his remarks hardly indicated much confidence in wolf  you are generous kit resumed however i doubt if i can honestly work for you and wolf you see the office now and then buys corn at the moorish ports  i think i see don ramon replied with a twinkle you imply that so long as you take wolfs pay you are his man and we must not expect you to study his business for our benefit well we do not expect this and you will find wolfs business is for the most part transacted at a neighbourhood we leave alone all the same the chartered steamer is valuable and although we have asked for some guarantees we would like a companys servant on board don erminio and macallister will join the ship  kits hesitation vanished his luck was strangely good and he thanked don ramon who presently sent him off while his double engagement lasted he would be rich and when he returned to the correillo he wrote to his mother asking her to make some plan for helping betty for example betty might take a holiday and if mrs musgrave used proper tact need not know kit had borne the cost he wanted betty to get a holiday that would brace her up yet it was obvious he was not in love  his reflections were disturbed a fowl cackling in wild alarm came down the ventilator shaft that pierced the ceiling of his small room it struck the rack above the folding washstand and kits hairbrush and a box of brass buttons fell the buttons rolled about the floor and under his berth then the fowl swept his desk with fluttering wings and the inkpot overturned kit frowned and put his letter in the envelope his friends on board liked a rude joke and a fowl had come down the shaft before kit had thought he had spoiled the joke by painting the inside of the bowlhead on deck but the paint did not long keep wet he tried to catch the fowl with the object of putting it in macallisters bed and finding he could not opened the door and drove it out soon afterward macallister came in and indicated the stained desk  shes no rolling but it looks as if ye couldna keep your inkpot rightsideup he said weel ive kenned garcias sherry account for stranger things than yon  ive known it account for your losing your boots kit rejoined  macallister grinned the night was balmy i was tired and my feet were sair yell mind i scalded them saving the ship when the boiler tubes burst  i was not on board said kit anyhow don erminio states felix your stoker stopped the tubes but you certainly lost your boots  how was i to ken the spaniards would rob me while i slumbered and i have my doubts mills o the estremedura was tacking along the mole and theyre no a gentlemen aboard yon boat but well let it go ye dinna ken what auld peter has done for ye  my notion is you have done enough kit remarked its some time since the mate and you sold my clothes when i was ashore but you havent paid me yet  if my luck is good ye will be paid and ye have not heard my news the company is chartering the old mossamedes and yere to gang to africa on board i got ye the job  go on said kit dryly i expect its a romantic tale  macallister lighted his pipe and put his coaly boots on the locker cushions  it was like this don ramon called me to the office we have chartered mossamedes for a run to the morocco coast says he captain erminio is no much o a navigator and the mates eyes are no very good but if yere in the engineroom ill ken alls weel then we need a sobrecargo whom would ye like  maybe mr musgrave would suit says i hes slow and dour but for a crabbit englishman he has some parts besides when he gangs ashore the lassies will not bother him hes no the sort to charm a fastidious ee if ye send mr musgrave yell not go far wrang  did you argue in scots or castilian kit inquired  in edinburgh scots better english than ye use what for would i use castilian  i see one important obstacle said kit when a man who has long been chiefengineer on board a spanish ship is forced to paint the pressure gauge and chalk the clock in order to let his firemen know what steam must be raised  theres no a shabby hotel tout who canna speak six languages macallister rejoined don arturo and i use english since i dinna convairse with foreigners what for would i learn their language if they want to talk to me they must use mine  he went off and kit laughed he owned that his conventional notion of the grim parsimonious scot was strangely inaccurate the scots he knew in the canaries were marked by freakish humour and rash generosity they were kind with the kindness of a benevolent puck in fact all the correilleros were to some extent like that a reckless irresponsible lot but kit had known men with virtues shabbier than the sailors faults  a week afterwards he got up one evening from his revolving chair in the mossamedes saloon she was going to sea at daybreak and don erminio had brought his friends on board all the chairs were occupied and cigarette smoke drifted about the green trailers of a sweetpotato that grew across the beams the empty bottles were numerous and at the end of the table don erminio made a speech kit heard something about animals and anarchists and noted that the wine dripped from the glass in the captains hand at the other end of the table macallister sang  kit had had enough he thought he had done all politeness required and the noisy revels jarred it was a relief to go on deck and breathe the cool night breeze mossamedes was a larger boat than the correillo riding near the harbour mouth her masts and funnel swung languidly and her lights threw trembling reflections on the black water a long deckhouse ran aft from the captains room and pilot house at the bridge and a row of stanchions carried its top level with the rail luminous smoke rolled from the funnel one heard the clank of shovels and hiss of steam in the background were glimmering surf lights that twinkled in clusters against dark rocks and then a gap where the atlantic rolled back to africa  when he ordered his boat kits heart beat his last duty before the vessel sailed was to get some documents from the commandancia and then he was going to mrs austins mrs austin was not at home but olivia received him on the veranda  harry and jacinta will not be very long she said  im sorry said kit i cant stop but i wanted to say goodbye and thank your sister  then you waited for some time didnt you know jacinta was going to the metropole  not altogether kit replied with some awkwardness i think i knew she might go but the captain was giving a party and i couldnt get off  olivia smiled she knew her charm and kit was rather obvious  when his guests started i was at the mole and i expect the portguards will get some amusement when they come back she said but why do you want to thank jacinta  i imagine she had something to do with my getting the new post  olivia gave him a keen glance and was quiet for a few moments then she said its possible you feel you ought to thank her  of course said kit and pondered it looked as if olivia were angry and this was puzzling  the post is good he resumed i could get no farther on board the correillo and my work was not important on the bigger boat ill have some responsibility wolf is not going with her and gives me control you see  i think i do see olivia interrupted with a touch of scornful impatience you imagine you are going to force people to own your talents this of course is enough for you and you see nothing else you imagine jacinta knew your ambition and wanted to help  im satisfied she did want to help and she has helped mrs austins kind  olivia laughed kit was very dull but jacintas firm rule was sometimes galling olivia saw her object and wanted to baffle her besides she doubted wolf and knew austin did not like him  kit she said suppose i asked you to do something for me  try he said rather tensely and waited  then dont go to africa stop at las palmas  kits heart beat olivia had come nearer him if he moved his hand he would touch her her voice had a strange soft note and she fixed her eyes on his for a moment he hesitated and then braced himself to resist it was not for nothing he sprang from puritan stock  but this is not for you and i am forced to go mossamedes sails in the morning and wolf cannot get another man besides the company ordered me on board and i have the ships papers i cant break my engagement when the boat is ready to start  olivia gave him a glance that fired his blood and then turned her head at the beginning she had meant to baffle jacinta but she had another object now kits stubbornness was a challenge and if she could not move him she must own her charm was weak vanity accounted for something but not for all his resistance moved her to passion  is it a drawback that the thing i ask is rather for your sake than mine she said looking up would you sooner i didnt care if you ran a risk or not  kit used stern control olivia was very alluring and he noted the tremble in her voice he was strongly tempted but although he thrilled he was not a fool she did not belong to his circle he was poor and her sister with careless kindness had tried to help him by and by perhaps if he got a good post he pulled himself up if he meant to be honest and justify mrs austins kindness he must stick to his job besides if there was a way at all this was the way that led to olivia  i think you know id like you to care he said and paused to talk like this was dangerous but why do you want me to stop he resumed with an effort for calm  are you very dull kit olivia asked quietly  kit coloured and got up after all he was human and knew he could not hold out long he thrilled and his hands shook as he turned his soft hat mrs austin trusted him and since he could not see another plan he must run away  if my luck is good and i get promotion i wont refuse another time now because your sister got me the post i must stick to it and go on board  olivia gave him a cool level glance oh well i know your obstinacy you baffled me before then her look got softer and she added but be cautious kit i dont like wolf  she let him go and when he went down the steps he frowned he had tried to take the proper line but he was young and wondered whether his scruples were extravagant     chapter ii  the first voyage   to some extent kits first voyage on board mossamedes was disappointing and he felt as if he had been cheated nothing romantic marked the run the boat was large her roll was slow and regular and while her big engines pushed her north against the tradebreeze one could without much balancing walk the deck on board campeador one could not her sharp plunges sent one staggering about and one must dodge the spray that swept her like a hailstorm when the white surges burst against her forecastle the spray and violent motion had some drawbacks but kit got a sense of mans struggle with the sea  on the whole he thought the morocco coast dreary the towns were like the spanish towns dazzlingly white on the waterfront but meaner and dirtier in fact to walk about the narrow streets in the dark was rash and kit was satisfied by his first experiment the hot foulsmelling cafes by the harbour had no charm for him and he lost himself in a network of alleys between straight walls the alleys were very dark sometimes an indistinct figure stole past and sometimes he saw a yellow gleam in a high and narrow window this was all and it was a relief to get back to the beach and feel the fresh tradebreeze  as a rule they moored mossamedes some distance from the beach and she rode uneasily rolling on the long swell while her cable jarred against the stem boats came off with her cargo of beans barley and maize and kit watching the dustclouds roll along the parched coast wondered where the produce grew when he asked yusuf wolfs agent the jew vaguely indicated the hinterland he was he said a merchant and the merchants stopped in the towns the moors of the back country were strange people and one left them alone notwithstanding this yusuf was obviously a good business man for the quantity of grain he sent on board was large and when mossamedes weighed anchor kit thought wolf would find her first voyage profitable  getting off was not easy she had swung and her cable sweeping the bottom had fouled the anchor they hove all on board in a horrible tangle and for hours the barefooted crew were occupied in dragging the ponderous links about in the meantime mossamedes steamed slowly south with a yellow smear on her port hand that stood for the coast the shallows run far to sea and the charts are not remarkably good yusuf had sent her to load sheep at the mouth of a wady but stated that she might wait some days before the animals arrived  miguel the old quartermaster steered her in he had long sailed on board a fishing schooner and knew the shoals for where the african coastshelf drops to the deep atlantic fish are numerous fish lightly salted and dried in the sun make the spanish baccalao and the peons whose main food it is are sometimes touched by leprosy miguel never wore boots and stockings although when he went home on feast days he carried rawhide sandals kit rather doubted if he put the sandals on his clothes were strangely patched and he could not read but his manners were the manners of a spanish grandee he was something of a mystic and believed in miracles he told kit the moors were cruel and treacherous but his saint was king of angels and he was not afraid the mate was a catalan freethinker and believed in nothing he could not touch and see since he wore spectacles his vision was limited  when they reached the spot agreed upon miguel went to the bridge and they rigged the deepsea lead and stopped the ship miguel posed like a greek statue stood on top of the pilothouse his thin clothes windpressed against his body and his white hair blown about his red cap there were no shore marks and don erminios reckoning was not always accurate across a belt of blue sea one saw a brown and yellow streak its outline was vague and broken only the colour was distinct  the punta said miguel the barranco is a league south a bad place captain and the people are without shame  kit knew barranco in castilian and wady in arabic mean a stony hollow where water sometimes flows he looked for an anchorage but saw none in places the belt of blue was broken by patches of pale green and farther on by glistening white lines these marked ridges on the coastshelf and shallow spots where the long rollers broke the wind was fresh but blew obliquely off the coast  how much water don erminio asked and when miguel answered signed to a man on the forecastle  veremos we will see he said  the lead plunged the line ran aft and stopping swung upright at the poop two men began to haul and one shouted the depth  half a brazo too much it is very good the captain remarked  then the screw began to throb and mossamedes going halfspeed forged ahead sometimes she crossed green belts and sometimes went round patches where the water was yellow and the swell curled as if the atlantic waves ran up an inclined bottom kit thought miguel did not hesitate his lined face was imperturbable and he directed the helmsman with a firm movement of his hand yet it was obvious they crept round banks where a ship like mossamedes would not float when miguel nodded and the captain rang his telegraph all felt some relief  fondo the captain shouted and the anchor leaped from the forecastle  the splash was drowned by the roar of running cable that presently stopped with a jar she brought up swung to the wind and there was a strange quietness on board  we are arrived said don erminio if miguels saint does not guard him until the sheep come i do not think we will get to sea again in the meantime we will catch fish and make baccalao for my señora  in the morning they launched a boat and rowed to the coast the point was low and stony and farther along the hammered beach a shallow hollow ran down to the sand in the background one saw a sandy waste dotted by thickstalked euphorbia one could land by jumping overboard into the surf while the others held off the boat and don erminio shot a partridge and got some bait then they went back to the steamer and for three days kit and the captain fished  shoals surrounded the basin where mossamedes rode two miles from land from her deck it looked as if she were at sea for the banks that sheltered her were only marked by lines of foam although she rolled the motion was not violent and kit got a sense of space and freedom he liked the lonely anchorage better than a noisy port in the morning they hoisted the boats lugsail and following the edge of the sands stopped where fish were numerous a disturbed swell crossed the shoals and spray blew about sometimes when the boat sank in the trough they could not see the ship but the fresh breeze tempered the heat and drove along a thin haze that softened the light kit caught strange deepbodied fish with square heads and was content  one day however the breeze backed north and the boat could not leave the ship it blew hard and big hollowfronted seas rolled along the coast in the distance their ragged crests cut the sky and the horizon was indented like the edge of a saw in the foreground they crashed upon the shoals and all about mossamedes one saw spouting foam brown dustclouds tossed behind the yellow streak that marked the coast and the sky was darkened as if by smoke macallister was ready to start his engines but the leadline that crossed the steamers rail ran straight down although she plunged her anchor held  kit sitting behind the deckhouse smoked and mused he saw that since he arrived at las palmas he had taken greedily all his new life offered sports he could not enjoy before the society of cultivated people fresh excitements and emotional thrills now however a reaction had begun he must pause and try to see where he was going  to begin with he thought he had not neglected his duties it looked as if don ramon at the office approved him and if they got the sheep on board wolf ought to be satisfied mossamedes carried a paying cargo and kit had kept the cost of shipment low he was making good and now he had been given some responsibility found he could without much effort carry his load in a sense however this was not important he really meant to think about olivia olivia had carried him away and after a halfhearted struggle he had let himself go she had beauty pluck and a cultivation higher than his sometimes she was gracious and when they jarred he thought she found the jars amusing she laughed at him afterwards and he did not mind he would sooner she laughed than let him alone he could not think about her without a disturbing thrill  yet the thing was ridiculous olivia was rich and extravagant but he was poor and not like austin who had married her sister but suppose he somehow made his mark if don arturo for example gave him a good post kit lighted a fresh cigarette and frowned for he began to see his doubts would not be banished then after all he was not olivias sort he understood halfconsciously that for him her charm was mainly physical and he had tried to resist he had an inherited distrust for all that appealed to his senses with olivia he would get excitement shocks and thrills he would live at high tension and she would take him far but his vein was sober and perhaps he would not want to go yet he was flesh and blood and her beauty called  the others left him alone and when a cloud of spray sweeping over the deckhouse drove him aft he looked for another quiet spot the sea was getting worse and spindrift blew across the turmoil like a fog mossamedes rolled until her scuppers dipped and when she swung to the savage gusts the jar of her cable pierced the rumble of the sea the water in her bilges splashed and a ragged plume of smoke blown flat from her funnel indicated that macallister kept keen watch for all that the anchor held and kit sheltering behind the after wheelhouse thought about betty  betty was his sort she understood him although he did not always understand her she did not ask much and would not urge one far bettys plan was to brighten the spot she occupied kit had doubted its wisdom but he began to see it had some advantages yet if betty did not urge now he thought about it he had felt her gently lead and had known her way was better than his he did not see all she saw but sometimes he was dull betty was calm and kind and did not think about herself she had however refused him and he had let her go all the same he was glad he could help her and if his mother had used some tact  the swinging stern lifted and the iron deck throbbed the foam was torn in a frothy patch kit saw the screw spin and the throbbing stopped macallister had turned his engines to satisfy himself they were ready to start on the surface he was careless and irresponsible but when the strain came one could trust old mack  on the whole the break in his disturbing thoughts was a relief to kit his philosophy was rude and he did not understand that he was moved by two antagonistic forces one was altogether of the flesh the other was not he did however see that his business on board mossamedes was with her cargo and he began to speculate about the sheep if the animals did not arrive soon they ought not to stop the anchorage was dangerous and mossamedes was the companys boat he got up and went off to talk to don erminio  in the night the wind veered to the northeast and got lighter and soon after daybreak a streak of smoke blew along the beach juan the mate hove out a thirtyfoot cargo launch and kit went down the rope with miguel the interpreter and some sailors a flock of sheep occupied the wady and five or six men mounted on tall camels moved the animals to the beach the shepherds were big men but their bodies and for the most part their dark faces were covered by blue and white cloth kits job however was to count the flock and see all were got on board he let the interpreter talk and helped miguel  they dropped an anchor and the boat rode in the shallow surf a few yards from the beach when a large roller ran in they hauled her off and waited and then letting her drift back jumped over and picked up as many sheep as possible before another roller broke the work was exhausting and sometimes men and sheep washed about in the surf when they pulled off the boat held much water and now and then the seatops splashed on board alongside mossamedes the sheep were thrown into a tub swung out by a derrick when for a few moments she stopped rolling the tub went up and came down empty but after the most part of the flock was on board one plunged out through the gangway and the others followed don erminio stormed and miguel with stolid patience steered the heavy launch in chase of the animals  she went back and brought off a number of loads but when the last was on board kits muscles were sore and his burned skin smarted with salt he had however got all the flock and when he went below to bathe in fresh water the screw began to throb miguel climbed to the top of the pilothouse and mossamedes steamed out slowly between the shoals     chapter iii  kits surprise   soon after his arrival at las palmas kit started for jeffersons office he had passed an hour with wolf who declared himself altogether satisfied about the voyage and gave kit some compliments kits mood was cheerful his employers frank praise was encouraging and he felt he was making good besides wolf would not want him again until next day and if he were lucky he might find olivia at home it was about four oclock in the afternoon and as a rule mrs austins visitors did not arrive before the evening on the voyage he had begun to see his haunting mrs austins veranda was rash but as he got nearer las palmas his good resolutions melted  nevertheless he must first see jefferson when they steamed along the morocco coast they met the cayman she hove to and signalled the steamers engines stopped and a message was shouted through a megaphone since kit was keen to get to mrs austins to carry the message was rather a bore but he admitted that jefferson ought to know what his captain wanted  in spanish towns a merchants office generally occupies the ground floor of his house and kit liked jeffersons the narrow street was very hot and the reflections from the white walls hurt his eyes to enter the tunnel guarded by a fine iron gate and cross the shady patio was a relief in the middle a little fountain splashed the walls were lemonyellow and a splendid purple bougainvillea trailed about the pillars that carried a balcony the dark spaces behind the posts looked like cloisters in front big heliotrope bushes occupied green tubs  as he crossed the patio kit met jefferson going to the gate  hallo said jefferson got back all right sorry i cant stop ive fixed it to meet a customer at the metropole  kit told him about their meeting the cayman and pulled out a folded paper i made a note  thanks i must order the truck the captain wants said jefferson who did not take the paper the port doctor allowed you had loaded up the boat and brought a good flock of sheep what did you trade for them  we landed no goods i imagined the sheep would be paid for afterwards looks as if wolf had an agreement with somebody in the interior  its not usual nobody trusts us like that jefferson remarked in a thoughtful voice you carried an interpreter did you talk to the berbers  not at all said kit you see  he stopped jefferson was his friend but after all he was to some extent his employers antagonist the other noted his pause  oh well i reckon wolf knows his job but id watch out for those fellows theyre a pretty hard crowd anyhow i must get along do you mind giving my english clerk the note  he smiled as if something amused him and went off and kit crossed the flags at the arch that opened on jeffersons office he stopped abruptly and wondered whether his imagination had cheated him  a few yards off betty sat in front of a writingtable her head was bent kit saw her face in profile against the coloured wall and noted the clean flowing line after a moment or two she looked up and kits heart beat his advance was impetuous and when she gave him her hand he pulled himself up with an effort when he last saw betty in the shabby street at liverpool he had kissed her it was strange and disturbing but he had come near to kissing her again betty however was very calm and her hand was cool and steady  why kit you looked startled she said  im very much surprised he admitted you see i thought you were at liverpool  at liverpool then you didnt think id gone for a holiday to the south coast  kit was embarrassed it looked as if his mother had not used much tact but bettys smile was gentle  sometimes youre rather nice kit but all the same you ought to see i couldnt go  we wont talk about it kit replied when i came in you didnt look at allsurprised  betty gave him a calm glance but he thought she had noted his hesitation surprised was not altogether what he had meant  i was not she said i knew you were on board a ship that had just arrived then i heard you talking to mr jefferson  he pulled up a chair and studied her while she neatly folded some documents betty was thin but if she had been ill she was obviously getting better a faint colour had come to her skin and her eyes were bright at liverpool she had worn very plain dark clothes because they were economical now her dress was white and she had pretty grey shoes in fact betty was prettier than he had thought perhaps her escape from monotonous labour and the dark liverpool office accounted for much but she was not the tired girl he had known  kit looked about the room there was not much furniture and all was made of canary pine that polishes a soft brown the wall was yellow and blue curtains hung across the arch kit knew they were needed to keep out the morning sun a rug was on the floor and it was like the curtains the dull blue one saw in morocco betty had fastened a spray of heliotrope in her white dress  do you like my room she asked  its just right the strange thing is i hadnt noticed this before i dont thinkjefferson bothered about his office anyhow the room was his  now its mine mrs jefferson gave me the rug i think it came from africa she said you were a friend of hers isnt she nice  she is a very good sort kit agreed im glad you have got an office like this the dark stuffy hole at liverpool wasnt fit for you i havent asked if youre getting better because i can see somehow you are another girl  betty said nothing but rather thought kit another man he looked stronger and his skin was brown then something about his voice and carriage indicated quiet confidence at liverpool when kit was resolute he was so to speak aggressive as if he wanted others to remark his firmness now his glance was calm his nervous jerkiness had gone all the same she thought he had not got fresh qualities but developed those he had betty knew kit  but where do you live he resumed in a spanish town its awkward  i live with mrs jefferson before i came we agreed on this shes very nice and takes me about sometimes for a drive to the mountains and sometimes in the sailing boat when i remember my other post i feel as if id got out of prison  kit was satisfied to know betty was happy was much she deserved the best then she gave him a thoughtful glance  its strange you didnt know i was coming mr jefferson wrote to me a month since  jefferson wrote  of course he stated he wanted somebody to answer his english letters and undertake general office work and he understood from you i might take the post  i certainly did not tell jefferson anything like this said kit i gave mrs austin my mothers letter in which she said you were ill and must leave the office but mrs jefferson was with mrs austin and perhaps they talked about it afterwards  then giving me the post was mrs austins plan betty remarked and kit thought her voice was rather hard  i expect it was he agreed mrs austin does things like that i imagine she persuaded wolf to send me on board mossamedes  betty studied him she did not think he saw the light he had given her sometimes kit was dull  dont you like mrs austin he asked  i like mrs jefferson better betty replied she stopped and noting that kit was puzzled resumed she is kind so is mr jefferson when he comes into his office he throws away his cigar he asks mewont i write a note for him and count up the bills he doesnt think because im paid it doesnt matter how he talks but why did you give mrs austin your mothers letter  now i think about it i dont altogether know shes sympathetic and i was bothered because you were ill i imagine she saw i was bothered  were you bothered very much  of course said kit you were breaking down and must stop at liverpool in the rain and cold i had the sea and sun sometimes i was savage because i couldnt help  then you didnt think mrs austin might persuade her husband to give me a post at las palmas  i did not i gave her the letter thats all mrs austin likes helping people and austin and jefferson wanted an english clerk i expect this accounts for their engaging you  betty doubted for one thing she had met olivia and two or three young men from the coaling wharfs who had tried to amuse her by humorous gossip about the english people at las palmas then mrs austin had sent kit on board wolfs steamer which made longer voyages than the correillo and had persuaded jefferson to engage her for his clerk betty thought mrs austins object was plain but wondered much what kit had said to her since she could not find out she began to talk about liverpool and kit presently narrated his adventures on the african coast  nobody disturbed them and the shady room was cool the smell of heliotrope floated in one heard the fountain splash and the languid rumble of the surf betty leaned back in her revolving chair and kit lighted a cigarette  jefferson was occupied for some time at the metropole but when he crossed the patio he slackened speed in front of the arch he was a sober merchant but it was not very long since he was a romantic sailor and the picture that met his glance had some charm his pretty clerk rested her cheek in her hollowed hand her pose was unconsciously graceful and she studied kit with thoughtful eyes kit talked and his face wore a strangely satisfied smile jefferson imagined he did not know his cigarette had gone out his thin figure was athletic he looked keen and virile jefferson approved them both they had not his wifes and austins cultivation but they were honest redblooded people in fact they were good stuff  for all that he was puzzled he had not thought musgrave a philanderer besides his office was not a drawingroom and he advanced rather noisily kit pulled out his watch and got up with a start but betty did not plunge into her proper occupation betty was generally marked by an attractive calm then she knew her employer  i expect you gave miss jordan the note about the stores for cayman jefferson said to kit  kit took out the paper sorry but i did not i must get on board perhaps i ought to have gone before  you can go now come back for supper if you like jefferson replied with a twinkle and put down some documents if you can give me a few minutes miss jordan  when betty got to work at her typewriter he went to mrs jeffersons drawingroom  i have asked young musgrave to supper and reckon hell come he said  dont you know if he is coming mrs jefferson rejoined  he didnt state his plans i imagine he was rattled when i fired him out it had probably dawned on him hed been loafing about my office most part of the afternoon  you knew he was a friend of miss jordans mrs jefferson remarked  i knew jacinta austin was pretty smart but it begins to look as if she was smarter than i thought  mrs jefferson smiled oh well you have got a good clerk and kit has got a post he likes  but what about olivia  i dont think you need be disturbed about olivia said mrs jefferson dryly anyhow you mustnt meddle your touch is not light  that is so jefferson agreed jacintas touch is surely light she can pull three or four wires at once without your knowing how shes occupied for all that ive a notion shell some time snarl the wires in a nasty tangle cant you give her a hint shes got to leave my clerk and kit alone  i doubt the thing is puzzling you see betty refused kit mrs jefferson remarked in a thoughtful voice however i think two of the leading actors in the comedy know what they want the others do not  it rather looks as if three didnt know  i think my calculations accurate however i see no useful part for us ours is to look on and smile when the plays amusing  if jacinta hurts miss jordan i wont smile jefferson rejoined im fond of the girl because in a way shes like you  sometimes youre very nice said mrs jefferson and went off to talk to the spanish cook in the kitchen that had when jefferson got the house adjoined the stable     chapter iv  wolf gives a feast   kit returned for comida which in spanish countries is the second proper meal at jeffersons it was served about five oclock and when kit arrived mrs jefferson indicated a chair opposite bettys at the table in a big cool room  now we can begin she said and jefferson clapped his hands for the majordomo in old spanish houses there are no bells and one uses customs the moors brought long since from the east  if im late im sorry kit replied i had to call at the commandancia and they kept me longer than i thought  i expect the ayutante was getting his comida jefferson remarked anyhow you didnt hold up our meal miss jordan hadnt finished some letters i wanted sent off by the castle boat  thats some relief kit said to mrs jefferson although i hurried i was afraid  to wait for ones dinner is not much relief jefferson rejoined then since you know the spanish rules my notion is you ought to have got on a hustle earlier  mrs jefferson gave him a quiet glance and he began to move some plates betty did not look up but kit thought she was not at all embarrassed  i forgot about the ayutantes comida in fact he said and stopped it was strange but he had forgotten he had meant to go to mrs austins  give me the hot plates said mrs jefferson and when jefferson did so one slipped and rattled  perhaps its lucky my touch is not light he remarked if it had been lighter id have broken some crockery  kit imagined there was a joke but since the joke was not obvious he studied betty she now wore a thin black dress made in the spanish fashion with black lace at the short sleeves and neck her skin was very white and smooth and kit thought she looked as if she had always worn a dinner dress  the room was spacious mrs jeffersons china and silver were good a bowl of splendid roses occupied the middle of the table and although they had no smell the little tierra roses half hidden by the others were seductively sweet decanters of red and yellow wine shone among coloured fruit and in front of betty a cluster of white muscatel grapes glimmered against dark vine leaves  one got a hint of taste and cultivation and kit remembered that for a time after his arrival he had felt raw and awkward at houses like his hosts at liverpool betty had worn rather shabby clothes and often when he met her going home from the office her boots were wet and muddy now she looked as if she belonged to mrs jeffersons circle kit did not know if this was strange or not he began to think he had not really known betty  all the same he was conscious of keen satisfaction betty had fronted poverty and smiled but her smile was no longer forced she had escaped like cinderella from dreary servitude and kit was very glad although he doubted if his analogy were good cinderella was splendidly conspicuous when she went to the ball but betty was not her charm was her gracious quietness she did not stand out from her background she harmonised with it kit thought her like the muscatels that glimmered with pearly tints among the leaves  i guess you are thinking about wolfs cargo jefferson remarked  not at all said kit i was thinking about liverpool and muscatel grapes  he imagined bettys glance rested on him for a moment and was gone but jefferson looked amused  dont you get things mixed when we towed out on board the old orinoco in the sooty fog liverpool wasnt much like a vineyard however i allow the muscatels a pretty good fruit doesnt catch your eye like the red grapes but when you put the colorado in the press the wine has a bite and some is mighty sour the white wines sweet and fragrant all the same you dont get the proper bouquet until the grapes are in the press what dyou think about my philosophy miss jordan  sometimes the press hurts betty remarked quietly  it hurts all the time said jefferson and his thin face got grave you know this when you have felt the screws well i guess its done with but when i hear them sing their latin psalm in exitu i understand some of us have been in egypt  now you are mixing things you were not in egypt mrs jefferson rejoined and kit thought she meant to banish her husbands sombre mood  anyhow egypts in africa and considerably cooler than the swamp where the cumbria lay then i reckon harry austin and i made some bricks without much straw  jacinta helped she has helped a number of people  mrs austin has helped me kit agreed and looked at betty it was strange but he imagined she did not own her debt to mrs austin  soon afterwards it got dark and they went to the flat roof there was no moon but the stars were bright and the sky was clear the soft landbreeze had begun to blow and stirred the mist that rolled down the dark rocks behind the town lights twinkled along the sweep of bay and two that swung across a lower group marked mossamedes rolling at the harbour mouth footsteps and broken talk echoed along the narrow street one heard guitars and somebody began to sing the africana  kit was strangely content betty was getting strong again and he thought her happy he himself had a post he liked and all went well his ambitions were not important he was not moved as he was moved at mrs austins to efforts that would force people to own his talents in fact he recovered something of the tranquillity that had marked the afternoons when betty and he gathered primroses in the woods  jefferson talked about the strain and suffering on board the sailing ships he pictured a battered wooden vessel stripped to her topsails and staysails and kept afloat by the windmill pump beating round cape horn while her exhausted crew got mutinous and food got short the story harmonised with the languid rumble of the surf for jeffersons voice was quiet as if he talked about things that were done with man had come out of bondage and steam was his deliverer  kit did not want to talk he was satisfied to be near betty and mrs jefferson it was plain that they were friends and he thought them alike neither urged her rules on one but one felt the rules were good one could do nothing shabby when one had been with them  in the morning kit went to wolfs office with some documents perhaps it was the contrast between his employer and his recent hosts but somehow wolf jarred kit began to feel vague doubts about the fellow nevertheless he admitted that wolfs approval was flattering and they planned a dinner to be given on board mossamedes  the dinner was not like the captains feast it was served with much ceremony and the guests were important people for the most part spanish merchants and government officers all the chairs at the long tables in the saloon were occupied and don erminio sitting at the end of one did not look comfortable the captain liked old english clothes but now wore his tight blue correo uniform moreover since don ramon the companys manager was not far off and his neighbors were commandancia officials he could not talk about animals and anarchists  kits chair was next to jeffersons and opposite austins and he was satisfied to look on he was rather interested by the captain of a french gunboat that had recently anchored behind the mole captain revillon did not talk but he looked about thoughtfully and kit imagined he knew castilian  the giver of the loyal toast was a high official who said the spanish crown stood for justice and steady progress one lost much by rash experiments and to modify cautiously old traditions was a better plan a countrys prosperity was built upon the efforts of all its citizens and men must know the reward of their labour was theirs just laws were needed and the loyal canarios knew the spanish laws were good but this was not all effort must be made for cultivation and commerce although the islanders were industrious much of the soil was barren and sometimes food was short spain owned a belt of africa with fertile oases where corn was grown and flocks were fed the country was richer than people thought it must be developed and extended until it made up for the territories spain had lost this was why he wished the new venture launched under the spanish flag good luck  there was a shout and a rattle of glasses but kit thought the little french captain pondered  since france claims the back country i expect revillon wonders how theyre going to extend the rio de oro jefferson remarked  don ramon urbane and smiling got up the islanders must live by trade he said they were a virile race of sailors and small farmers but since modern ships and machines cost much they could not refuse foreign help with english help they had made much progress and might go farther they had built up cuba and now cuba was gone they must build up their african colony the mossamedes flying the spanish flag was opening a new rich field don ramon was proud he had some part in sending her out  he has struck the same note austin observed in a way its the note one would strike but somehow i imagine wolf has used the tuning fork when you make a speech to order you rather like a hint about the line you ought to take however the fellow is going to talk  kit afterwards thought wolfs speech clever to begin with he indicated the richness of the rio de oro belt and its hinterland his venture was small but when he had opened the way spanish effort would make the african oases another cuba he paused and turned to the high official who smiled as if he agreed then wolf hinted at a community of interest and talked as if his gains would be his guests kit felt that a stranger might imagine the merchants were shareholders and the others had given the undertaking official patronage  looks as if we were all in it jefferson commented on the whole im satisfied our house is not id rather like to know what revillon thinks  revillons thoughts are not very obvious since he has stopped at las palmas before i expect he knows our friends are patriotic sentimentalists austin replied  soon afterwards kit went on deck wolf did not want him and the saloon was hot leaning against the rails he looked across the harbour and his glance rested on the french gunboat she was a small twomasted vessel of a type that was getting out of date but was used by french and british for police duty on the african coast sometimes she touched at las palmas for coal and kit understood she cruised from morocco to senegal she was not fast and he thought her rather deep for use in shallow water when he was on board the correillo he had seen her hauled up on the beach after grounding hearing a step he turned and saw wolf  i came up for a few minutes to get away from revillon the fellows rather curious about your voyage said wolf besides i want to talk to you lets go into the captains room  the captains room was on the boatdeck below the bridge one reached it by a ladder and nobody was about wolf turned on the electric light and gave kit a cigarette  i havent told you much about your cargo for this run but i had some grounds for not doing so  the cargos ready to put on board said kit  not all wolf replied meaningly yusuf my agent in morocco will supply or tell you where to get the rest you will carry out his orders unless of course you resolve to turn down the job  then we are to carry goods the spaniards would not allow us to land  wolf smiled now you perhaps see why i gave the feast my guests so to speak have given my venture the governments sanction in spain it pays to have official friends and a tactful present carries weight the officers are not as fastidious as yours  he stopped and kit wondered whether he had said yours unconsciously kit had thought wolf claimed to be english but there was a hint of a sneer in his voice  what are we to carry he asked  cartridges if you dont like the job i think i can get another man  kit imagined all traffic with native africans in breachloading guns and ammunition was forbidden moreover it was obvious the spanish government would not approve wolfs supplying the berber tribes with cartridges this however was the governments business and kit was young romantic smuggling had some charm but he hesitated  why do the berbers want the cartridges he asked  wolf shrugged i dont know their plans theyre a turbulent independent lot and sometimes quarrel with their neighbours who are supposed to belong to france i expect they have a dispute with another tribe in the back country about an oasis or perhaps the control of a caravan road anyhow im sending a small quantity of ammunition because i want to keep a good customer well i wont persuade you are you going  ill risk it said kit rather doubtfully does the captain know  of course said wolf smiling don erminios not scrupulous and sees a chance of earning something besides his pay all the same he understands that while he is navigator you are my representative but i mustnt leave the others long  he went off and kit smoked a fresh cigarette the adventure had some charm but he was not altogether satisfied he had however agreed to go and presently he banished his doubts     chapter v  wolfs offer   jefferson sat in the shade of the bougainvillea and pondered some letters austin lounged in a basketchair opposite and read the diario they had combined their business as far as possible but pancho brown would not agree to a formal amalgamation all was quiet one heard the fountain splash and bettys typewriter rattle sometimes a voice came from the room where jeffersons spanish clerks were occupied but this was all  presently austin put down the newspaper  the tomato crop was light and the vines are doing badly its ominous that the palma import houses are cutting down their orders  martinez allowed he wanted to get out of the deal in chemical fertilisers trade is looking sick jefferson agreed  when i joined pancho brown i used to study the accounts and congratulate myself when i saw our credits going up austin remarked with a smile to feel i could write a cheque for a good sum was something very new now im bothered because we have money at the bank i dont see how its going to be usefully employed  you want to keep money moving well i met wolf a day or two since and he hinted he knew about a deal i wasnt keen but he said he might come around and see us i rather expect him  you dont trust the fellow  sure thing reckon its instinctive i like straightforward folks wolfs a mystery man  austin looked up and laughed hes coming  wolf crossed the flags and when he stopped by the bougainvillea his face was red he was fat and his thin black alpaca jacket looked very tight  suns fierce will you take a drink said jefferson and clapping his hands for a servant ordered cerveza  as a rule in hot countries cautious white men do not drink much beer but wolf drained his glass of pale yellow liquor with obvious satisfaction  the glasgow stuff is good he said in fact for british lager its very nearly right  where dyou reckon to get it exactly right chicago or munich jefferson inquired  wolf laughed its good at both cities at munich theres a garten but im not going to bore you by talking about lager  bettys typewriter stopped the light in the patio was strong and to sit in her dark office and study the group outside was like watching a play on an illuminated stage the curtains at the arch narrowed her view and the figures of the actors sharply distinct occupied the opening bettys sense of the dramatic was keen and she had remarked that wolf sat down where a beam shone over his shoulder then when jefferson talked about chicago and munich she thought he tried to study wolfs face but could not wolf had hesitated for a moment before he admitted that he knew the cities betty rested her face in her hand and resolved to watch for one thing wolf was kits employer  trade is slack wolf resumed the spanish merchants see they cant ship much produce and are cutting their orders i dont know if you feel the slump but my african speculation promises well the trouble is i cant finance it properly and if you would like to come in  pancho brown is oldfashioned and not keen about new undertakings austin replied cautiously do you expect to get larger lots of sheep  its possible but i thought about buying camels i reckon i can get them for a low price paid in trade goods and i expect you know what they are worth just now  austin pondered the singlehumped camel is used in the canaries particularly in the dry eastern islands and the animals cost much all the same austin knew his partner doubted  where do your customers get the camels jefferson asked  i frankly dont know the berbers are not the people to give you their confidence its possible they steal the camels anyhow they state they can get them  well if you are short of money we might perhaps supply the goods you want and take the camels at a price agreed  i can get credit for the tradegoods and sell the camels to spanish buyers as soon as they arrive in fact i see no particular advantage in your plan  then what is your proposition  something like this i want you to join me in the speculation and take your share of the profit and the risk there is some risk the business is going to be bigger than i thought and my capital is not large i want partners who will help me seize all the chances that come along and will back me if i get up against an obstacle  austin lighted a cigarette and betty imagined he weighed the plan but jefferson did not wolf drank some beer and when he put down his glass betty thought the glance he gave the others was keen he looked cunning and she thought if she were austin she would let his offer go after a few moments jefferson looked up  harry and i will talk about it and send you a note will you take another drink  wolf drained his glass and went off when he had gone jefferson turned to austin and smiled  i reckon nothings doing  then why did you promise to talk about it  i am talking about it jefferson rejoined i didnt want wolf to imagine id resolved to turn down his proposition  after all i dont think he meant to cheat us  not in a sense he knows youre not a fool and don panchos very keen  then what does he want austin asked  i dont know im curious anyhow he doesnt want me although if you and don pancho joined he reckoned id come in im not a british merchant im an american  but what has this to do with it  i allow i dont altogether see anyhow wolfs a german austin looked puzzled and jefferson smiled you dont get me yet the fellow has cultivated out his accent and claims hes english thats important because he got his english in the united states and doesnt claim hes american when i talked about chicago and munich i made an experiment  he admitted he knew the cities  that is so he saw i was on his track and he mustnt bluff if id met wolf in the united states i mightnt have been prejudiced but i met him at grand canary starting a trade with spanish africa i reckon the spaniards are sore about morocco at the grabgame france and britain scooped the pool germany and spain got stung anyhow ive no use for taking a part in world politics and when musgrave has gone a voyage or two in mossamedes ill try to get him off the ship  i wonder whether you know jacinta sent him on board  jefferson smiled does jacinta trust wolf talk to her about the deal and if she approves ill come in  very well said austin and they started for the town  when jefferson returned to his office a clerk brought in a note from don enrique sir  jefferson opened the envelope and laughed for the note ran nothing doing in camels jacinta does not approve  sometimes a womans judgment is sound miss jordan he remarked mrs austin doesnt know all i know but she gets where i get and i think she got there first  it is strange betty said quietly  one doesnt know when youre amused and when youre not jefferson rejoined however i want you to send wolf a note  dear mr wolf betty suggested  i reckon dear sir will meet the bill said jefferson dryly then lets see in reference to our conversation this morning after careful consideration we regret we cannot see our way to entertain your proposition pretty good office english  there are three tions betty observed  propositions all right said jefferson thoughtfully fix the others as you like you know the sort of thing  he went up the outside stair and found mrs jefferson on the balcony  if musgraves not a philanderer hes mighty dull he said id like you to have seen miss jordan just now a model clerk very cool and businesslike manner exactly right all the same before i got started she saw where i was going and i guess she smiled  its very possible mrs jefferson agreed well perhaps its lucky im not jealous  youre not jealous but if ive got an eye for fine and pretty things youre accountable once on a time i reckoned a big sailing ship closehauled on the wind with all shed carry set was beautiful i hadnt seen you talking to our guests across the fruit and flowers now im thankful for all beauty things men made like sailing ships and pretty girls betty in white by the bougainvillea olivia on the veranda in her black and gold this old world is charming since you opened my eyes  for a business man youre sometimes extravagant mrs jefferson replied all the same you are a dear  jefferson turned and looked over the balcony a young man who wore spotless white flannel and a red silk belt crossed the flags he stopped abruptly when jefferson shouted hello  we thought if you were going to haul up cayman for scraping youd like to know our tug is off the slip the other remarked  thanks said jefferson dryly you neednt bother miss jordan about it caymans gone to palma  the young man recrossed the flags and jefferson laughed his last brain wave was to see if cayman would take coal across for ballast and he could keep us some hefty lumps yesterday two banana men blew in with a fool proposition about my sending fruit to africa and before they were through walters from the cold store arrived looks as if id got to put up barbed wire  oh well said mrs jefferson i dont suppose a sailing ship is their standard of beauty besides the big sailing ships are gone  betty studying some figures in the office heard jefferson stop the coaling clerk and smiled young men from the coal wharfs and fruit stores arrived rather often when they thought her employer was not about and if she was not occupied she sometimes let them talk for the most part they were a careless goodhumoured lot and she liked their cheerfulness but this was all when she refused kit at liverpool she was resolved he must get his chance now it looked as if she had got hers she was not moved  she contrasted him with the others they frankly amused her and sometimes kit was dull yet she sensed in his soberness something fine that did not mark the rest they joked and did not bother kit bothered much betty liked his tightmouthed thoughtful look his habit was to weigh things but when he was satisfied he went stubbornly ahead betty wondered whether he was satisfied about olivia then with something of an effort she resumed her calculations     chapter vi  betty carries a message   the morning was hot and betty had pulled the curtains across the arch she typed an english letter and thought about kit although she knew he had gone to mrs austins it was some days since she had seen him and his steamer would soon sail betty had expected him to say goodbye to her and was hurt because he had not presently she heard jeffersons step in the patio he stopped and somebody crossed the flags  come inside the sun is pretty fierce he said and olivia went through the arch  i think you know miss jordan jefferson resumed  betty stopped her typewriter she was in the shadow and studied olivia who stood where the strong light shone into the room betty thought her clothes were made in london or paris they were in the latest exaggerated fashion but she admitted that miss browns beauty justified her wearing clothes like that betty herself wore plain white and a cheap spanish sewing woman had helped her to make the dress  it looks as if you had got up before harry although you kept him for some time last night olivia said to jefferson and took out a small packet he had not begun his breakfast when the mail arrived with some samples you want for morocco harry thought mr musgrave might leave them for your agent at saffi but our man was not about and i was going to the shops  jefferson pulled out his watch thanks ill send the thing on board im going up town will you come along  ill stop in your cool office for a few minutes olivia replied and jefferson turned to betty  felix will be around soon send him off with the packet i expect musgrave will be at the commandancia you have about half an hour  he went off and olivia lighted a cigarette she threw the match on the floor and although people smoke in spanish offices betty was annoyed she wondered whether miss browns carelessness was studied but after a few moments olivia gave her a thoughtful look  i understand kit musgrave is an old friend of yours  he is my friend said betty  then i expect you know hes satisfied with his post all the same he ought to give it up  betty said nothing she thought she saw why miss brown had brought the packet but did not see where she led besides she was conscious of a subtle antagonism the girl was not the type whose friendship was good for kit in the meantime olivia occupied herself with her cigarette she had meant to make an experiment and satisfy her curiosity for kit had not come to the veranda much since his return and she had missed him when he was away  he ought to go back to the correillo she resumed however i expect you know hes obstinate  sometimes hes firm said betty quietly although quietness was hard  she did know kit was obstinate but to allow miss brown to talk about it was another thing besides she was bothered about the others object for stating kit ought to go back  oh well its really not important olivia replied as if she were bored i thought perhaps you might persuade kit to rejoin the campeador she paused and smiled carelessly i cant i admit i tried  why do you want mr musgrave to leave his ship i understand your sister got him the post  olivia was embarrassed although her embarrassment was not obvious she had begun by wanting to baffle mrs austin whose object for sending kit on board mossamedes was plain this however was some time since and now she did not know what she did want she would not acknowledge kit her lover but she liked to know he was about all the same her efforts to separate him from wolf were to some extent unselfish  i dont want kit to leave the mossamedes i think it better for him to do so she rejoined its possible my sister did get him the post jacinta does things like that but sometimes her plans do not work as she hoped  then when mrs austin sent kit to africa she had a plan  olivia looked up sharply and threw her cigarette on the floor she had not found out much and did not mean to argue with jeffersons clerk  we dont get forward and i cant stop she said ill tell you all i know i think my sister doubts wolf jefferson frankly distrusts him he was talking to harry on the veranda and i was in the room behind it was plain they were puzzled about wolf jefferson said the fellow was playing a crooked game and kit ought to quit anyhow he ought to know his bosss african scheme was a cover for something else and he was going to use the french captain wolf meant to give revillon a part in the plot  olivia got up thats all but i rather agree with jefferson  if you think mr musgrave ought to be warned why didnt you warn him  for one thing i imagined you were his friend olivia rejoined with a careless smile to write a note is sometimes awkward the steamer sails very soon and its obvious i cant go on board and ask for the sobrecargo well you are jeffersons clerk and have the packet of samples you can goif you like  the curtain swung back and for a minute or two betty pondered her curiosity was excited and she wondered much how far olivias interest in kit went that it went some distance was plain betty felt a keen antagonism for the fashionable and rather scornful girl yet to some extent the others object was good betty thought kit ought to be warned about his employer all the same miss browns statement that betty could warn him was hardly accurate spanish conventions were strict and betty knew the gossip that marked the english circle if she went on board the steamer people would talk and mrs jefferson would be annoyed but felix jeffersons boatman did not arrive and betty looked at her watch something must be risked and perhaps she might meet kit outside the commandancia office picking up the packet she got her hat  a tartana waited for passengers at the end of the street and she got down at the catalina mole mossamedes windlass rattled and her cable was coming in but a boat with the african houseflag painted on the bow lay against the wall and betty knew kit had not gone on board for all that she did not see him and the steamers anchor would soon be up if he did not come in a minute or two she would have no time for talk then he ran out of the office pushing some papers into his pocket and stopped  hallo he said you are kind to see me off  i didnt come to see you off at least that wasnt all betty replied  oh well kit said laughing youre generally frank id rather have liked to think you did want to see me off anyhow im glad you have arrived  betty gave him the packet and he noted the address  all right ill land it at saffi i wish you had come sooner theyve broken the anchor out  she went across the mole with him and stopped at the top of the steps he looked keen alert and handsome his white clothes were well made his thin figure was athletic and betty liked his smile she felt rewarded kit was glad she had come the trouble was she could not send him off like that  theres another thing she said jefferson thinks you ought not to stop on board mossamedes he declares wolf is not to be trusted  ah said kit rather sharply but how do you know  betty braced herself she must be honest although it was plain honesty might cost her something  miss brown came to the office half an hour since and brought the packet she heard jefferson talk to austin about wolf and thought you ought to be warned  she came to the office kit exclaimed and betty saw his satisfaction well shes very kind but she sent a message  wolf is plotting something in africa his business isnt what it looks captain revillon has some part in it  kit laughed miss brown meant well you mean well but you dont understand wolf is cheating the french captain hed an object for asking him to the feast in fact i see his plan  i dont think miss brown was cheated betty urged  mossamedes whistle shrieked foam splashed about her stern and she began to forge ahead kit shouted to the men in the boat and betty gave him her hand  dont bother about the thing he said perhaps wolf is rather tricky but i know him and i wont get hurt anyhow miss brown was kind to let me know and youre a good sort to carry the message  still youll use some caution kit said betty but he waved his hand and ran down the steps  mossamedes circled slowly and forged by the end of the mole her white deckhouses shining in the sun kits boat vanished round her stern smoke rolled from her funnel and with a white wave breaking at her bows she steamed out of the harbour for a time betty watched the ship and her thoughts were moody  she had refused kit at liverpool because both were poor tired as she was of badlyrewarded labour she might have been satisfied to occupy her self with frugal housekeeping had she not seen that for kit to marry meant bondage for him a married clerk with kits pay durst run no risks he must stick to his job indulge his employers and wait for them to offer him better wages she might have promised to marry kit and let him go to try his luck but she knew girls whose lovers had gone away one had come back another man and betty imagined he saw the girl he dutifully married was not the girl he had thought the others had not come back at all  it was not that betty doubted kit he was staunch and did all he engaged to do but he was young betty imagined his was a boys romance and she did not want him to return for her because he thought he ought besides he had some talent and might make his mark abroad if he did so she was not going to embarrass him in fact she so to speak resolved that kit must have his chance  now he was obviously attracted by miss brown and betty knew olivia was not the girl for him moreover she was persuaded olivia saw his drawbacks kit was poor his infatuation was ridiculous and to find it out would hurt but kit would find out betty frowned because she could not help  by and by she noted that mossamedes masts and funnel were getting indistinct the ships hull had melted to a dark streak seen for a moment when she plunged across a rollers crest and betty got up she had stopped longer than she ought and must hurry back to the office as she went along the mole she remembered that she had been willing to risk something in order to warn kit and he had laughed sometimes ones fine resolutions were rewarded like that perhaps the thing was amusing but her smile was dreary  at the office she found jefferson reading a newspaper  i see you havent begun the english letters he remarked did olivia stop long  betty said the boatman had not arrived and she had taken the packet to the mole  well i wanted the thing to go across i reckon you gave it to musgrave  i did so said betty and noted jeffersons twinkle all the same she thought his taking out his watch was unconscious  perhaps you had better go ahead with the letters he said  betty started her typewriter but her thoughts were not fixed on what she wrote she pondered about wolf and was vaguely disturbed kit had laughed at olivias warning but sometimes kit was confident and rash after all it was possible miss brown was justified then betty glanced at a letter she took from the machine and tore the sheet across jefferson was not fastidious but he liked his customers to know what he meant she could think about wolf and kit again and in the meantime must concentrate on her proper duty olivia brown could indulge her romantic imagination when she liked but betty was a merchants clerk     chapter vii  shipping camels   mossamedes dropped anchor as near as was safe to the flatroofed moorish town the roadstead was open and the harbour was only deep enough for boats but so long as the wind did not back to the north one could ship cargo and the agent sent off a quantity of maize and beans in the canaries corn is scarce and the peons roast and grind such grain as they can get for their coarse gofio meal kit was rather disturbed about the cartridges although wolfs jewish agent had so far refused to state when they would go on board kit was the steamship companys servant the ship was british and he thought he ought to have warned the manager how she might be used the trouble was he was wolfs servant too besides it was possible don ramon was informed  when the grain was on board kit went one evening to the agents house yusuf was old and yellowskinned his beard was thin and his long hair greasy with scented oil but he had a touch of dignity kit went through a little dark shop to his office and sat on a low flattopped couch an iron chest stood against the opposite wall and an open lamp hung by chains from the roof a door with a horseshoe arch and a leather curtain led to the house the door to the shop was strong and ironbound one very narrow window pierced the wall the jews have long traded in morocco but they know the risk and kit generally found it a relief to finish his business and get back to the harbour yusuf transacted wolfs business in the evening and when kit arrived the copper lamp was lighted  yusuf gave him a little cup of black coffee and a cigarette with a strange bitter taste then he talked about the grain and presently took a long roll of paper and some documents from the chest  this voyage we will give you camels he said in good castilian you will get them where you got the sheep since you will not come back i will give you the bills of lading for the captain to sign  the rule is to sign the bills of lading when the goods are shipped kit remarked  in this country english rules do not go a trader must run some risks and you will need proper documents for the spanish officers  kit agreed wolf had told him he must trust yusuf but he did not although he was willing to carry out his orders there was something secretive about the old fellow one felt strange plans were made in his small dark shop in fact kit would have trusted nobody in the town the people were a strange silent lot the moors stamped by an inscrutable reserve the jews and halfbreed christians looked furtive and afraid to hear the negroes noisy talk was a relief but all was quiet after dark  i understand you have some other cargo for us he remarked  that is so when you go back to your boat you will find the boxes are on board  kit thought it strange his boat lay alongside the little mole where people could see goods carried down and since yusuf had got the cartridges kit wondered why he had not smuggled them off overland to use a steamer like mossamedes to carry a few boxes along the coast was a strange plan but then the business was all strange  where must we land the goods he asked  i will show you said yusuf and when he unrolled the long paper kit saw with some surprise it was a good chart of the african coast  you will anchor here and signal he said marking a spot when you see smoke among the sandhills send off your boat afterwards you will steam back to the anchorage you know and wait for the camels  but we may wait for some time kit objected noting the distance between the spots  i think not a messenger will be sent and a good camel travels fast yusuf replied and kit picking up the chart started for the harbour  the night was not dark and when he jumped on board his boat he noted a row of small boxes stowed in the bottom  but this stuff is heavy said old miguel striking a cardboard match  kit told him to put out the match but was relieved to see the boxes were not numerous then they had so to speak been put on board openly and kit felt that after all he need not bother don ramon about the thing  we will go push off he said  the men pulled down the harbour a smooth swell rolled in and two or three anchor lights tossed and swung by and by engines throbbed in the dark and kit saw moving beams of red and green the french gunboat had arrived the day before and her launch was coming off from the mole for a minute or two kit was disturbed but the launch steamed by and vanished in the dark kit steered for mossamedes lights and when he got on board went to the captains room don erminio wearing his old english clothes fronted macallister in greasy dungarees and between them some bottles and glasses balanced the swingtable kit put down the bills of lading and remarked that he had agreed the captain would sign the documents  but of course said don erminio when i sign for señor wolf i will sign all you ask when i sign for me it is another thing then if i am not cautious somebody gets my dollars  where are we going macallister asked  kit spread out the chart and indicated the spot yusuf had marked on the curve of a bay it looked as if landing would not be hard but although the chart did not give the political frontiers he imagined the bay was outside the spanish belt  i expect the coast is french its awkward particularly since we carry cartridges  senegals french said macallister the rest is nobodys the strongest tribe uses the ground it wants man theyre amusing fellows at the foreign offices do they think they can parcel out africa wi a gold fountain pen  sometimes the french foreign office uses the foreign legion  must i teach ye geography the legion leeves in algeria and thats tither side the country o kaid maclean  it is not important don erminio remarked all politicians are animals and if the moors shoot somebody with the cartridges it is not my affair i will catch fish for baccalao and then my señora will not want much money  kit put away the chart and went on deck he rather envied don erminios philosophical carelessness the captain did not bother if he could catch fish and shoot rabbits he was satisfied kit was not like that his job was to keep things going smoothly but things did not go smoothly when one left them alone he was accountable to wolf and the owners of the ship and began to see his duties might clash walking up and down the boatdeck he frowned when he heard the clink of glasses and don erminios laugh then macallister began to sing and kit went off impatiently to his room  at daybreak they hove anchor and steamed south along the coast until one morning a dark line on the port bow indicated land then they turned a quarter circle the line got faint as if it ran back to the east and after they took soundings mossamedes steamed into a wide shallow bay some time after she brought up a plume of smoke blew across the sandhills a boat was swung out and kit and the interpreter went ashore nothing romantic marked the landing of the cartridges a few big darkskinned men came down the beach took the boxes from the sailors and vanished in the sand the boat pulled off and kit began to think smuggling in africa was strangely flat  then mossamedes stopping now and then to use the lead steamed north deadslow they saw no ships although at times a trail of smoke stained the blue horizon liners bound for cape town kept deep water and the captains of the guinea boats hauled off until they made cape verde the stream of traffic flowed along but did not touch the forbidding coast  at length don erminio headed cautiously for the beach and mossamedes dropped anchor in the pool among the sands for two or three days the captain and kit went fishing and then when the smoke signal wavered about the mouth of the wady kit went ashore with miguel in the big cargo launch in a sense perhaps the job was not his but he felt his responsibility the camels were his employers and he must see them got on board  the morning was hot the sea luminous green streaked by dazzling lines of foam sandhills and stony hummocks floated like a mirage in quivering reflected light farther off dust storms tossed in spirals and dissolved now and then the wind got light for a few minutes and kit felt he could not breathe but there was no break in the steady beat of the white surge on the beach  when the rollers began to curl miguel threw out an anchor and the boat drove in sternforemost until the rope brought her up this was possible because the headland broke the sea but kit thought the launch would soon be swamped if the wind backed farther north the interpreter jumped overboard and by and by men in fluttering blue and white clothes drove the camels from the wady when the animals reached the beach all the crew but miguel went overboard and the hardest work kit had known began the camels knelt while the headropes were fixed but some stretched their long necks and tried to seize his arm with their yellow teeth they grunted and made savage noises and when they were driven to the water obstinately stopped  the singlehumped camel can swim but will not unless it is forced and to break the big animals firm resolve is not easy moreover the launch leaped and plunged and must be hauled off when a large roller came in like a glittering wall spray blew about sometimes the men were kneedeep and sometimes buried to the shoulders in angry foam now and then kit was knocked down and washed up the beach among the legs of a floundering camel in the background the group of moors sat on the beach and watched their dark skins and harshlycoloured clothes distinct in the strong light  when miguel was satisfied he could take no more they hauled off the boat and tied the camels by the short headropes along her gunwale then the anchor was got up and they began to row but although they pulled the long oars doublebanked did not make much progress it looked as if the camels supported by their halters were satisfied to be towed the animals floated awkwardly and their bodies were a heavy drag  to drive the boat ahead was exhausting labour in the burning sun and by and by kit relieved a man whose efforts got slack his clothes had dried stiff his hair was full of sand and the salt had crystallised on his burned skin at length they stopped abreast of the steamers gangway and somebody threw a rope mossamedes rolled lifting a long belt of rusty side out of the foam sometimes she was high above the boat and sometimes she sank until the water splashed about the open iron doors a man seizing a boathook stood ready to fendoff the launch the others got canvas bands under the camels then a long derrick swung out and a band was hooked to a wire rope  ahora llevadlo shouted miguel and a winch began to rattle  the rope tightened with a jerk a camel rose from the water and for a few moments swung wildly to and fro the animal looked ridiculous with its outstretched neck and paddling legs then mossamedes steadied and one heard running wire the camel sank and vanished and the rope came down again when all were on board miguel started for the beach with a fresh crew and kit went to see the animals fastened up and fed the mate was accountable for their stowing but camels were worth much at grand canary and kit imagined his employers interest was his sometimes when he thought about his efforts afterwards he smiled  he was occupied until the launch returned and he went ashore again the tide had risen and the surf was worse but they got another load the launch came back halfswamped with the men exhausted and a broken oar and on her next voyage the crew kept her off the beach until the tide fell while she rolled and plunged at anchor kit lay in her bottom and watched the angry combers crash upon the beach  they brought off the last few animals in the dark and kit washed away the sand and salt three or four dark bruises marked his skin his hands were blistered and he limped because a camel had stepped upon his foot all the same when he put on soft clean clothes he was satisfied mossamedes would go to sea at daybreak and it was something to know the job was done     chapter viii  an idle afternoon   the veranda was shady and kit sat on the top step in the cool breeze that blew between the posts olivia occupied a basketchair farther back her pose was languidly graceful and sometimes she smiled it was not for nothing she had put on clothes she liked the best of all she had but she thought she knew why kit for the most part looked at the town and not at her sometimes his puritanical conscience bothered him mrs austins rule was to receive all her friends who liked to come after six oclock but kit had arrived two hours sooner because olivia had hinted that he might she knew jacinta would not be about and now thought kit imagined he ought to go  the landscape he contemplated had some charm the sun was behind the mountains and the dark rocks were a good background for the white town and the cathedral towers the white was not dead the shadow had touched it with elusive grey and blue and the rows of houses glimmered somehow like pearls in front the sea was a wonderful ultramarine  in the meantime olivia studied kits figure and his face in profile she thought his profile good there was something ascetic about its cleanness of line he was thin but his white clothes rather emphasised the firm modelling of his neck and shoulders and the curve to his waist all the same olivia thought his quietness tiresome  the view from the veranda is rather fine she said  kit looked up with an apologetic smile you imply im dull perhaps i am dull you see i was pretty strenuously occupied not long since  catching fish for the captains señora  we did catch some fish but we shipped some camels through the surf and ran into bad weather coming home to keep the animals alive was an awkward job the sea came on board the fodder washed about and the scuppers were choked the ship got a list and two or three feet of water splashed in the angle between her deck and side camels cant stand getting wet you know  i dont know olivia rejoined besides i dont see how the bad weather accounts for your absorption in the view  oh well after a job like ours you want a rest and theres something about grand canary that makes you satisfied to loaf the island of the golden apples the old explorers talked about then i think the nicest spot in grand canary is mrs austins veranda anyhow if i had talked you might have got bored you are bored sometimes  olivia laughed you are modest but if you know when i am bored you are cleverer than i thought however when you first arrived you would have been hurt  one gets philosophical and no doubt i was very raw i hadnt known you and mrs austin  to know jacinta is something of an education olivia agreed but you talked about the old explorers have you ever seen the island of san borondon  i have not said kit im a practical fellow and dont see things like that all the same our quartermaster declares he has seen san borondon and its possible old miguels a mystic and the finest sailor we have on board the sort of fellow theyd have made a saint in columbuss days  he mused for a few moments and resumed well the storys curious if you leave out a few desert rocks there are six canary islands the first explorers saw seven the seventh was san borondon where it is always calm when the galleons came back to conquer it the island was gone but now and then somebody sees the mountains against the sunset in the same spot as you steam west to hierro a mirage no doubt but one can understand the sailors weaving legends about san borondon  i expect the monks wove the legends olivia remarked their business was to point a moral and the grail storys old it looks as if they could not find a knightadventurer like galahad yet you imagine your quartermaster  old miguel is something like galahad kit said quietly although a touch of colour came to his skin believes in his saints and keeps his rules as trustful as a child polite as a spanish hidalgo and brave as a lion one does meet some fine gentlemen jeffersons another  olivia said nothing but on the whole she agreed although jefferson had some drawbacks and kits were numerous their puritanical sincerity had charm as a rule she had not found the type polite but kit was getting sophisticated his touch of colour indicated this  i expect you are going back on board mossamedes she said by and by  for another run after that i dont know kit replied  he did not know and was rather disturbed when he was going to mrs austins he met don ramon who stopped him  has wolf talked about his future plans the manager asked  kit said wolf had not and don ramon resumed  you see the charter does not run long and mossamedes is an expensive boat for the morocco trade  kit had thought this and was bothered about something else he wondered whether don ramon knew about the cartridges in a way perhaps the thing was not important since the quantity was small but kit thought don ramon ought to know yet so long as he took wolfs pay he was wolfs man  before you sailed on your last voyage i sent you a message olivia resumed  i got the message you were very kind  but this was all you thought i exaggerated  no said kit you stated wolf meant to use captain revillon well i thought i saw his object  you mean wolf meant to cheat him  in a way perhaps kit agreed and stopped  olivia laughed you are very staunch in fact you have a number of qualities one does not at first expect all the same i dont think you ought to go to africa often  she was sincere because she instinctively distrusted wolf but she wanted to keep kit about las palmas to some extent because jacinta had planned to send him away she did not know if she wanted him to stop for good his firmness intrigued her she liked his honesty and his physical attraction was strong sometimes she hesitated and sometimes resisted olivia was calculating rather than romantic and frankly did not see herself marrying a steamship sobrecargo  i must go for another voyage kit replied i have engaged to go and for another thing mrs austin got me the post i want her to think im making good its obvious i owe her much  olivia knew he owed her sister less than he thought sometimes kit was very dull but he had given her an opportunity to experiment  jacinta likes helping people and as a rule it doesnt cost her much for example when you told her about miss jordan harry and jefferson wanted an english clerk i think miss jordans satisfied but i doubt if shes as grateful as you  shes altogether satisfied kit declared and stopped bettys gratitude to mrs austin was not very marked  oh well olivia resumed jeffersons a good sort and i think hes lucky miss jordan is a good clerk and an attractive girl people like her and jeffersons patio is getting a fashionable spot in the afternoon you can study the latest styles in mens light clothes  do you mean the coaling and banana men pretend they have some business and hang about  i dont know if they pretend but they do hang about jefferson declares if he wanted coal he could get an extra bag to the ton and ritchie told him an ingenious plan by which he could cut down caymans fresh water bill  ritchies the theatrical fellow with the sombrero and brigands sash  he is theatrical olivia agreed and smiled since he has neglected me his theatricalness is plainer no doubt miss jordan finds him amusing but when cayman is in port he goes to the office looking for orders i believe  all the coal cayman burns goes on the galley fire kit remarked with a frown a ton a voyage would see her out  olivia noted his frown she admitted that her methods were crude but cleverness so to speak would be wasted on kit in some respects he was like a child  after all i dont see why miss jordan should not marry a coaling clerk she said one or two are rather nice  kit set his mouth he had not thought about bettys marrying and owned that it ought not disturb him but it did so his look was sternly thoughtful and olivia touched his arm she had made her experiment and although she did not know if she wanted kit for herself or not she resolved he was not for betty  you have no grounds for meddling and miss jordan is not a fool i think shes fastidious she said when you come back we must try to get you a post at las palmas if you get a proper start you might go far and perhaps the post can be got  kits heart beat olivia wanted him to go far and this implied much he forgot betty and then looking up saw mrs austin and her husband on the steps  hallo said austin i imagined you were occupied on board as a rule you stick to your job tighter than i stuck to mine anyhow since you have come ashore youll dine with us  kit was somewhat embarrassed he had seen mrs austin give olivia a keen glance moreover she had left her husband to ask him to stop signing to olivia she went into the house  why did you put on that dress she asked  its light and cool olivia replied and added with a smile sometimes youre romantic and let your imagination go  id like to think i was romantic but i doubt anyhow kit is flesh and blood why cant you leave him alone  my dear you really ought to keep the conventions the proper line is to argue i oughtnt to let the young man bother me however its obvious you dont mean to be nice  mrs austin frowned and went off she had controlled her husband and others but olivia baffled her if the girl resisted from obstinacy there was perhaps no need for disturbance the trouble was mrs austin did not know besides kit was trustful she had meant to be his friend and was angry because her plans had not worked  kit did not enjoy his dinner mrs austin was polite but he felt she was annoyed and when he tried to talk to olivia she firmly started another subject olivia looked amused and her amusement jarred kit was young and if he were being punished thought olivia ought to sympathise soon after dinner he declared he must go on board and olivia got up  where are you going mrs austin asked  im going to the gate with kit olivia replied carelessly and mrs austin knew her smile meant she could not meddle when the others were about  olivia went down the path with kit and stopped at the gate it was getting dark and some tamarisk grew between them and the house  you dont look very cheerful she remarked  im not cheerful kit admitted im afraid i have annoyed mrs austin  jacinta has her moods olivia agreed however if she wasnt very nice to you she wasnt nice at all to me besides you really ought not to have stopped when she was not at home jacinta is conventional although she pretends she is not we all are conventional you know  kit looked hard at her and was hurt olivia herself had fixed the time for him to come and had kept him when he would have gone for all that he said nothing and she resumed in a gentle voice well you are going back with the steamer and i will not see you before you sail youll use caution kit  he thrilled but said quietly i dont think much cautions indicated we have gone twice and nothing has bothered us  oh well said olivia you are obstinate and i suppose you must go perhaps im superstitious but sometimes the third venture is unlucky she touched his arm i dont want you to run a risk  kit tried to seize her hand but she was gone he saw her figure melt into the gloom among the tamarisk and then looking round noted wolf coming up the path  hallo musgrave said wolf have you gone to the commandancia for your papers  i went in the afternoon and got the documents kit replied and started for the road  wolf went to the veranda and talked to mrs austin until some others arrived then he crossed the floor a chair by olivia was unoccupied and noting wolfs advance she gave a young man an inviting smile the young man did not remark this and wolf got the chair  malin deserves to pay for his dullness he said  then you saw me signal olivia rejoined all the same you came  one sometimes gets a humorous satisfaction from baffling people besides i wanted to persuade you im not revengeful its obvious you dont like me  oh well said olivia i dont claim my prejudices are always logical sometimes one likes people and sometimes one does not  well let it go and ill try to be resigned however i dont think you ought to prejudice my sobrecargo  olivias eyes sparkled it looked as if wolf had seen her touch kit he was very keen  do you know i have prejudiced mr musgrave she asked  he has not hinted this the young fellow is staunch for all that i dont imagine you approve his sailing on board my ship do you approve  olivia said nothing and wolf resumed if it will give you much satisfaction ill discharge him after the next voyage  for a few moments olivia thought hard she wanted kit to leave mossamedes but she did not know yet if she wanted him to stop about las palmas altogether then she felt that wolf was not the man to whom she would like to owe a debt the fellow was cunning  oh no she said smiling its really not important and i wouldnt like to feel accountable if he didnt get another post  very well if he wants to go ill use no arguments if he wants to stop you wont try to persuade him he ought not  i agree said olivia and getting up waited until wolf went off     chapter ix  the third voyage   mossamedes was hauling out from the mole and kit on his way to his room stopped to look about the deck was strewn with cargo for a small steamer that had tied up alongside had just moved astern winches rattled and a gang of men lowered some heavy wooden cases into the hold another gang got in the slack of a big rope made fast on the wall there was much shouting the pilot in front of the wheelhouse roared orders don erminio ran up and down the bridge and the mate was vociferous on the forecastle  macallister looked out with ironical amusement from the door of the engineroom as a rule the scot is not theatrical and when others were noisy macallisters dour calm was marked  theyre pretty clothes he said indicating kits white uniform for a that if i had your figure id wear something thick i alloo miss brown thought ye like a tablecloth on a pump but why are ye no helping the ithers at the comic opera  i have another job kit rejoined putting a bundle of documents in his pocket it doesnt look as if you bothered about yours  the engines had begun to throb and the telegraph rang violently macallister signed to somebody below and grinned  yons don erminio taking the floor he means naething and i dinna mind him when the action kin o drags he shouts and gives the telegraph handle a bit pull when ye think aboot it temperaments a curious thing maybe ye have seen a big boat haul out on the clyde noo an then an officer lifts his hand ye hear a whistle and a winch starts alls calm and quiate shes away ten thousand tons o her before ye ken whats gaun on  youre a grim efficient lot kit remarked just now it looks as if the pilot meant to hit the coaling tug i dont know if you can stop him thats your business and his ill get to mine before she starts to roll  he went to his room pulled up his folding stool and threw the documents on his desk for he was rather puzzled about some cases of agricultural machinery and tools perhaps these were the boxes transhipped from the other boat but so far as kit knew agricultural machinery was not much used in morocco in fact he thought the moors methods were the methods of abraham in the meantime the shouts got louder and kit imagined juan on the forecastle disputed with the pilot on the bridge  pero señor the mates expostulating cry pierced the turmoil and then kits inkpot jumped from the desk  he saw a dark smear on his new clothes mossamedes trembled and he felt a heavy shock his stool tilted and he went over backwards and struck his head against the locker  getting up rather shakily he remarked that the ship had listed for the floor of his room was sharply inclined when she lurched upright with a jerk he seized the doorpost and then since it was obvious she was not capsizing put the cork in the inkpot and began to pick up his papers he had something of the sobriety that marks the puritan temperament and it was characteristic that he occupied himself with his proper job the papers for which he was accountable must not get stained by ink when he had put all straight he went on deck  not far off the coaling tug circled back for the wharf her bulwarks were broken some plates were bent and she had let go the string of barges she towed on board mossamedes don erminio leaned against the bridgescreens and his face was very white the pilot stated loudly the course the tugs patron ought to have steered and the mate and a number of sailors ran about the deck kit did not think they were usefully employed  going to the forecastle he found macallister leaning over the rails a plate was bulged and the stem was bent but it looked as if all the damage were above the water lines of foam ran by and melted ahead for mossamedes was steaming sternforemost out of port  shes no much the worse i dinna ken aboot the tug macallister remarked and took kit to a spot beneath the bridge tell the captain to brace up and get away to sea he resumed if hes no quick the commandancia launch will come off and stop us to make reports theyll forget a aboot it before were back  kit translated and don erminio pulling himself together advanced upon the pilot a savage dispute began but presently the captain stopped and spread out his hands  the animal is not satisfied he will not go  aweel ill come up and pit him off macallister remarked and climbed the ladder  the pilot hesitated his duty was to take the ship outside the mole but the engineers look was resolute and he retreated to the ladder at the opposite end of the bridge when macallister reached the top the pilot had reached the bottom and a few moments afterwards went down a rope to his boat  noo if yell put the helm across ill give her a bit shove ahead and well get away macallister said to the captain and rejoined kit  nane o it was my job and maybe on board a british ship id no ha done as much he observed and vanished below  mossamedes circled the engines throbbed harder the mole dropped back and kit began to laugh he agreed that macallister would not have done as much on board a british ship for all that his rude but cool efficiency was rather fine  half an hour afterwards kit took some documents to the captains room don erminio was stretched on a locker and a bottle of vermouth and some palma cigars balanced the swingtable when he saw the documents he frowned  another day just now i am ill he said when one has an assassin for a pilot to command a ship is not amusing i bear much but some time i take enrique maria contallan y clavijo by the neck and throw him in the sea in the meantime i have saved the ship and we will take a drink  kit refused politely and did not smile he liked don erminio and the captain was not a fool kit had known him calm and steady when things were awkward and sometimes his pluck was rash all the same he was unstable one could not foresee the line he would take the spanish character frankly puzzled kit it was marked by sharp contrasts and one could use no rules macallister and jefferson were not like that their qualities so to speak were constant when the strain was heavy one knew they would be cool  mossamedes steered for the eastern islands and in the morning the parched rocks of lanzarote melted in the glitter on the horizon then she headed for africa and at sunset don erminio stopped the ship and used the lead he got soundings on the coastshelf and kit passing the chartroom imagined the mate and captain argued about the ships position but when mossamedes went on again the compass indicated that don erminio had hauled out to avoid shoals when the moon rose one saw nothing but sparkling water the swell was long and measured and the leadsman making another cast got no bottom it looked as if they had left the hummocks on the coastshelf astern and mossamedes went fullspeed  about midnight kit lounged and smoked on a locker in the engineroom he was not sleepy and since mossamedes sailed had thought much about olivia on the whole his thoughts were disturbing when he was with olivia he forgot his poverty all he saw was her charm she was beautiful she was clever and now and then he got a hint of tenderness that gave him a strange thrill the thrill moved and braced him while it lasted all looked possible somehow he would mend his fortune and make his mark austin who had held kits post had done so and married olivias sister  afterwards when olivia was not about kit knew himself to be a fool to begin with he had not austins talents and must be satisfied to keep his proper level then supposing he did get rich after all he was not olivias sort kit was staunch and stopped there he would not admit that sometimes he vaguely doubted if olivia were the girl for him instincts he had inherited from sober and frugal ancestors were strong yet for the most part he resisted unconsciously when one is young and carried away by an attractive girl one is not logical  lighting a fresh cigarette he looked about mossamedes rolled and light and shadow played about the machinery in front the bright cranks flashed and faded in a shallow pit the crossheads slammed between their guides and the connectingrods shining like silver swung out of the gloom above the big cylinders throbbed and shook with the impulse that drove the ship ahead men like shadows moved about with oilcans and tallowswabs but now and then a moving beam touched a face beaded by sweat macallister occupied the top of a tool box and smoked a black pipe  kit liked the engineroom the steady beat of the machine was soothing one got a sense of order measured effort and strength that matched the strain force was not wasted but sternly controlled in the engineroom macallister was another man quiet keen concentrated and kit understood the scots satisfaction when all ran well they sprang from a stock that counted rule and effort to be worth more than beauty  there was a crash and kit jumped from the locker mossamedes stopped and the shock threw him against a column he seized the iron and held on conscious that he trembled the jar was terrifying because it was not expected a sea broke about the vessel she shook and water rolled across the deck a greaser shouted and kit saw macallister on the grated platform above he had not seen him go but his hand was on the throttlewheel he did not look disturbed and signed a man to the control of the reversinggear if the link were pulled across the engines would go astern the telegraph however was silent and macallister did not turn the wheel  the ship lifted lurched forward as if a sea had borne her up and went on macallister waited for a few moments and then went up to the door with kit the door on the starboard side looked out towards africa but nothing broke the furrowed plain of glittering sea  im thinking she bumped a bit hummock macallister remarked she got a jolt but the old boat was built by men who dinna scamp their job where ye see yon houses name ye ken the work is good  all the same you have started the bilge pump said kit for a sharp throbbing pierced the beat of machinery  pepe will let her rin a few minutes although i dinna expect shell draw much water ye keep the rules macallister replied and turned to miguel who came along the alleyway what do you think about it friend the third voyage has not begun well  macallisters castilian was uncouth but miguel understood it is not good don pedro a bad coast and a treacherous people but one is not disturbed some of the saints were fishermen and mine is king of all but i go to try the after well  he went off but kit had noted that the line he carried was neatly coiled and the soundingrod was wet he thought it typical that the old quartermaster had tried the forward well a few moments after the ship struck moreover his talk about his saint somehow was not extravagant one felt that miguel knew and trusted his great patron  a most queer fellow macallister remarked a believer in wax images and pented boards  pented boards said kit  just that macallister rejoined yell no ken the scottish classics when the great reformer was a galley slave they gave him the image to worship a pented brod mair fit for swimming than praying til says he and threwt overboard weel for miguel the images are not pented things and ive met weelgrounded scots i wouldna trust like him he kens his job and his word goes i alloo its much  kit went on deck the sea sparkled in the moon and long regular combers rolled up from the north one could not see land and nothing indicated shoals ahead mossamedes dipped her bows to the knightheads and showers of spray leaped about the rail then her stern went down and the rising forecastle cut the sky for a time kit forgot olivia and mused about the engineer and miguel  macallisters mood was sometimes freakish and his humour rude but behind this was a stern honest efficiency the quartermaster was a mystic but when the big white combers chased the cargo launch one could trust him with the steering oar after all to know ones job was much     chapter x  smoke on the horizon   an angry swell rolled along the coast dust blew across the flatroofed town and mossamedes with two anchors out rode uneasily she had unloaded some cargo and kit going ashore in the evening speculated about the rest he did not think he was superstitious but the voyage had not begun well and he wanted to get it over there was something strange about the business in which he was engaged and he resolved he would talk to wolf when he returned  moreover he did not like the dirty moorish town when it got dark the narrow streets were forbidding but yusuf declared he could not transact the ships business until he closed his shop in the canaries and morocco rich merchants keep a shop one could buy a shipload of their goods or a few pesetas worth  yusufs little room was very hot the dust had blown in and the floor was gritty flies hovered about the copper lamp which burned an aromatic oil the agent gave kit coffee and a cigarette the tobacco was bitter but soothing and kit imagined it was mixed with an eastern drug at yusufs he generally felt dull perhaps it was the smell of the lamp leather and spices they began to talk and presently kit remarked if you send your boats tomorrow we will hoist out the last of the cargo have you got much stuff for us  i have got nothing said yusuf smiling your cargo is on board  all the goods we carry are consigned to the greek merchant here and you  that is so but i will endorse the bill of lading and file a statement for the customs officers that the cases of machinery will be landed at another port  ah said kit who began to see a light then we are to carry the cases along the coast i was puzzled about this lot of cargo but we got it from a spanish ship at las palmas the cases were put on board in daylight when two of the port captains men were on deck  the plan was good yusuf remarked when one does things openly nobody is curious  all the same the moorish officers know machinery is not used in the sahara  it is not the officers business they are friends of mine and in this country a present carries some weight  kit knew wolf and his agent were clever but began to think they were cleverer than he liked he felt he was being used and so to speak kept in the dark he did not know the others plans in which he was involved but if the plans did not work he thought he ran some risk yusuf was subtle and kits instinctive antagonism hardened for all that he was wolfs servant and must carry out his agents orders  i will endorse the bill of lading the other resumed you will land the boxes at the spot you got the camels and the owner will take his goods perhaps he will keep the document for a talisman some of these people have a strange respect for all that is written on paper  very well said kit who got up  yusuf went with him to the door and kit starting along the street heard the heavy bolts shoot back to know the business was over was something of a relief although yusuf was inscrutable at his house one got a sense of fear and secrecy in morocco a jew trader was perhaps forced to use caution but kit thought he would sooner deal with the wild berbers who ruled the open desert yet he owned he had no firm grounds for doubting wolfs agent when he got on board mossamedes he went to the chartroom and found don erminio playing cards with the mate the captain had won two pesetas and was jubilant  juan is clever and cautious i am not clever but i am bold he said  kit noted the bottle on the table when don erminio drank a few glasses of caña he philosophised kit narrated his interview with yusuf and the captain looked thoughtful  it is plain the boxes hold guns he said the moors do not carry guns to shoot the rabbit and if we land the boxes somebody will get killed however it is not important the moors are numerous and all are bad  i was not thinking about the moors kit rejoined the business is strange the guns were on board a spanish ship and if the moors use them to steal camels the camels will no doubt be stolen on soil that is claimed by france there may be trouble afterwards our employer knows this  don erminio picked up the cards spanish cards are not marked like english cards but kit thought the one the captain indicated stood for the ace of clubs  bastones don erminio remarked and shuffled the pack i put it at the bottom you see it is there now take three away and you will find it at the top a trick but clever señor wolf plays a game like this  kit carried out his instructions and laughed wolf is no doubt clever but this is not the card  don erminio frowned and swept the pack on to the floor the swingtable tilted but juan stretched out his hand and seized the bottle  señor he expostulated the caña cost two pesetas  i have forgotten something all the same you see the moral don erminio resumed merchants are cheats and use cunning tricks one thinks one knows their plan but one does not one puts ones money on the wrong card and it is gone sailors are honest and do not get rich well we will carry out our orders that is enough for me i have drunk some caña and in the morning my throat is bad  two days afterwards mossamedes hove her anchors and steamed south as a rule the tradebreeze blows steadily but now and then its strength varies sometimes a little rain falls and the day is nearly calm sometimes the wind backs north and blows hard mossamedes holds were almost empty and her rolling was wild when she plunged across the long swell half her screw came out of the water and one heard the top blades thrash don erminio followed the coast steering as near land as he durst he wanted to avoid the traffic and mossamedes going light did not draw much water she was built to cross the sands at african river mouths  one morning kit went to the bridge the sun was not high and the air was fresh the wind had dropped and the faint haze that generally softens the light and glitter when the tradebreeze blows had vanished the sky was a harsh vivid blue and the tops of the long rollers cut the horizon with sharp distinctness they did not break but rose and subsided leaving here and there soft streaks of foam for all that the swell ran high mossamedes lurched about and kit thought wind was coming he was bothered about it if the wind were fresh they could not land their dangerous cargo the mate leaned against a stanchion and searched the skyline with his glasses after a time he gave the glasses to kit  look he said  kit saw a faint brown smear drawn across the sky it was rather like a thin cloud but he thought it smoke when the wind is light a steamers smoke spreads far and floats for some time the strange thing was the steamer was there inside the proper track he glanced at mossamedes funnel but the last coal they had got was good and diaphanous vapour rolled astern kit put down the glasses and went to the captains room don erminio came out studied the smoke and frowned he wore pyjamas and a shooting jacket torn at the back  the animals cannot see us but a steamer ought not to be so near the coast he said then we will soon reach the spot where we land the guns  perhaps the captain takes a drink juan remarked  it is possible when i drink much caña my calculations are not good don erminio agreed all the same to run a risk is foolish we will stop and use the lead  after he got a sounding he changed his course three or four points east and steered obliquely for the land in the meantime the smoke vanished and kit went down and told macallister to keep his fires clean to see smoke where smoke ought not to be was disturbing and if the others had seen mossamedes they would speculate about her captains object for navigating shallow water  when kit went on deck again the swell had begun to break and ran ominously high the wind was not yet strong but it strengthened and the sky in the north was black at noon a sailor in the rigging thought he saw smoke again don erminio went up with his glasses but saw nothing and gave the glasses to kit  the norther begins he said  in the distance a brown fog obscured the horizon and kit knew it was a duststorm blowing off the coast spray leaped about mossamedes forecastle her plunges were violent and to hold on to the rigging while the mast swung was hard they went down and soon afterwards the lookout hailed kit was on deck and joined don erminio on the bridge when mossamedes lifted two masts and the top of a funnel cut the horizon kit thought it ominous that he saw no smoke  the sea had got up and long whitetopped combers rolled after the ship when her stern swung out of the water the engines ran away and their savage throbbing shook the deck with her rudder lifted she did not steer and while the helmsman sweated at the wheel she yawed about until her quarters sank and the screw got hold one could not drive her fast but much of her side was above water and the savage wind helped for a time the other vessels smoke vanished in the thickening spray then they saw her again sharp and distinct the ominous thing was they did not as they might have expected see her on the quarter but abeam it was plain that when mossamedes changed her course or soon afterwards the stranger had changed hers  the french gunboat don erminio said and clenched his fist somebody has sold us  going to the compass he got the others bearing and kit marked his coolness when the strain was steady the captain did not tear his hair he took kit and the mate to the chartroom and a few moments afterwards macallister came up the rules of the british liners were not used on board mossamedes and don erminio spread a chart on the table then he lighted a cigarette and indicated the steamers course along but converging on the coast  the wady is not far ahead he remarked and put a pin in the spot to cross the shoals might be dangerous and i doubt if our anchor would hold however if we do not cross the animal will soon be nearer  it was obvious when the captain sketched a triangle of which the gunboat occupied the apex and mossamedes course was the base in order to clear the shoals she must shorten the base and steaming out lessen the distance between them if she turned and steamed the other way the gunboat would come down obliquely and cut her line the long chase is the stern chase but mossamedes could not make off like this because she was jambed against the coast two things were plain the frenchman commanded the faster vessel and had well chosen her position  the jew has sold us but just now it is not important don erminio resumed we cannot long run away from the french animal but i have a plan we will throw the guns overboard and wait for him  he looked at kit who hesitated for a few moments the captains plan had marked advantages and some drawbacks for one thing the guns were valuable and if they were sacrificed wolf must front a heavy loss moreover if they were not delivered the tribes with whom he traded would refuse to trust him again this counted for much but kit was not altogether thinking about wolf his rule was to do what he undertook and to do so now might baffle the man who had cheated him  i think not he said our business is to deliver our cargo if yusuf has plotted with the frenchman we must spoil the plot and i dont know a better plan than to carry out his orders he sent us south to land the guns and we will land them it will soon be dark and if we get across the shoals there is some shelter behind the sands revillon durst not cross  buen muchacho said the captain and looked at macallister it will be dark at six oclock can we keep in front  macallister knitted his brows ill no say its easy when the screws jumping oot o water ye cannot get much grip to shove her along for a that yon stumptail gunboat will jump worse and the old engines good if she does not shake off her screw ill keep ye ahead  kit began to translate but the captain smiled me i know the english don pedro good ol sport bueno muy bueno i jump much en caballo now i jump the sandbank if the other thinks he catch us we drown the animal  kit thought it possible mossamedes was built with heavy bottom frames to bump across african river bars and was going light he imagined the gunboats draught was some feet more than hers all the same the thing was risky if mossamedes touched the sand she might not come off  it is good i go for miguel sænz juan the mate agreed     chapter xi  miguel takes control   a black cloud rolled from mossamedes funnel and blew across her bows the beat of engines quickened and when the stern swung up their furious racing shook the ship kit pictured macallister sternly calm at the throttle wheel much depended on his skill for if he were slow when the spinning screw came down and the runaway machinery resumed its load something must break kit however did not go to the engineroom he stood at the door of the pilothouse inside which miguel sænz gripped the slanted gratings with his bare feet his face was wet by sweat and his brown hand was clenched on the steamsteering wheel  although the muscular effort was not great steering was hard mossamedes rode high above water and the gale pressed upon her side the combers lifted her and screw and rudder could not get proper hold sometimes she came up to windward and rolled until the white seas swept her rail sometimes she yawed to lee kit saw the bows circle and pictured the compass spinning in its bowl  so far miguel steered by compass don erminio had changed his course and headed obliquely for the shoals it was not the course the gunboats captain would expect him to steer revillon no doubt imagined the line along which mossamedes travelled inclined at a small angle out to sea in order to clear the hammered sands and he could steam down from his commanding position and cut her off the line however really slanted the other way dark clouds obscured the sky the light was bad and the driving spray made accurate observation hard kit thought don erminios plan was good but longed for dark  sometimes he saw the gunboats masts and sometimes when a comber lifted mossamedes he saw her hull she was getting indistinct and dusk was not far off kit imagined she flew some signals but one need not bother about the flags revillon could not launch a boat and there was not much use in shooting from a rolling platform at a mark that for the most part could not be seen besides kit thought revillon would not use his guns commanding the faster vessel his plan was to pin mossamedes to the coast and when the gale blew out come on board and search her then if the cargo was not jettisoned she might perhaps be seized kit did not know much about international rules but if he threw the guns overboard revillon would after all win the game guns lying at the bottom of the sea could not be landed in africa  kit felt his youth and responsibility standing for his employer he had urged the captain to hold on to the cargo yusufs treachery had made him savage he felt he had been cheated like a child but this was not all kit did not mean to let the cunning brute rob his master he was wolfs man and his business was to guard his interests moreover he was moved unconsciously by inherited stubbornness he had engaged to land the guns and was going to do so  in the meantime he thought his luck strange not long since he was a humble shipping clerk occupied by tame conventional duties now he was a smuggler breaking rules ambassadors and men like that had drawn all the same in a way the adventure was not romantic there was no shooting and for the most part one could not see the pursuing ship before long kit hoped one could not see her at all the risk was rather from the sea than the gunboat for all that kit knew two men bore a heavy strain macallister on his reeling platform guarding his engines from sudden shock and miguel at the wheel when kit looked into the pilothouse the quartermasters pose was rigid his mouth was hard and his eyes were fixed on the revolving compass steam pulled across the rudder but one must use nerve and sound judgment to hold mossamedes straight  by and by another man climbed the ladder and went into the pilothouse miguel came out and joined the captain he looked slack as if he felt the reaction now the strain was gone and held on by the rails while he looked about kit saw his cotton clothes were stained by sweat the wind blew the thin material against his skin he wore a tight red knitted cap and the spray beat upon his face the captain talked and gesticulated when the turmoil of the sea drowned his voice  the light was going fast and the gunboat had melted into the gloom but her smoke rolled in a thick black trail across the water it looked as if she were steaming hard and revillon did not try to hide his advance kit wondered whether he imagined he had pinned mossamedes against the shoals and meant to shorten the distance in order not to lose her in the dark mossamedes made no smoke macallister kept his fires thin and clean and it was important that the gunboats smoke was now on her quarter this indicated that revillon did not know she had swung off a few points and steered for the land  kit waited until the ship went up on a combers back and then looked ahead the sea was angrier some distance in front were broad white belts where the rollers broke in savage turmoil between the belts kit thought he saw a gap in which the seas were regular in the distance a brown haze indicated a dust storm raging about the point one might find some shelter behind the point but not much  highwater was near and although on the open atlantic coast the rise of tide is not marked the moon was new and one might perhaps expect an extra fathoms depth then if mossamedes could get across to the pool when the ebb began to run the sands would lie like a breakwater between her and the sea kit rather doubted if she could get across one could see no marks the captain durst not stop for proper soundings and the handlead used from a platform that constantly changed its level was not much guide  all the same it looked as if old miguel meant to try for a few moments he stood with his eyes fixed ahead and his lean upright figure at an angle with the slanted bridge then he turned and went into the wheelhouse his slackness was gone his movements were somehow resolute the other man came out of the house and kit saw macallister at the top of the ladder holding on by rails the engineer looked about  if miguels saint is watching now well no be independent and refuse his help he said for a that theres a line in the vaya that betther meets our bill  he misquoted from the sailing permit of the spanish correo but kit knew the line and with the raging shoals ahead owned its force when one fronted the fury of the sea words like that meant much  the mills good and running weel but if miguels no sure and steady theres no much use in my keeping steam macallister resumed the bit spark o human intelligence ootweighs a the power thats bottled in my furnaces i dinna see whats to guide him but maybe the old fella thinks like a baccalao  baccalao is salt fish said kit  it was swimming before it was sautit macallister rejoined then ye dinna get fish in deep water they seek their meat in the channels and the tides that run across the sands weel miguel has his job ill away to mine  he went down the ladder but kit clung to the rails he had not a job his part was played when he urged don erminio to steer for the land and now as he watched the white seas curl and break he knew his rashness the steamers course was a zigzag with the savage wind on her quarter her bows swerved about all miguel could do was to let one divergence balance the other in front was an ominous white crescent running back into the dark but broken by a gap in the middle a man strapped outside the bridge hove the lead but this was an obvious formality because if he got shallow water mossamedes could not steam out if miguel tried to bring her round she would drive broadside on against the hammered sands  there was no smoke astern revillon no doubt had seen the surf and hauled off but mossamedes went inshore fast the horns of the crescent enclosed her and kit no longer saw a gap the sea was all a white turmoil and furious combers rolled up astern one felt them run forward as if they travelled up an inclined plane and the ship rode dizzily on their spouting crests then for a time kit saw nothing foam enveloped mossamedes her deck vanished and he was beaten and blinded he could hold on but this was all the spray came over the wheelhouse like a cataract kit knew mossamedes was swinging round because the wind now blew across the house  the plunges got less violent and the spray was thinner one saw the iron bulwarks and the winches in the forward well about which an angry flood washed at the end of the bridge don erminios figure looking strangely slanted cut the sky mossamedes had run through the gap and was in deeper water behind the sands yet the water was not all deep another shoal occupied part of the basin and kit tried to recapture its bearings as he had noted them when he went fishing in the boat he found he could not when the light was strong and the swell slow one could judge distance and know the depth by the changing colour and the measured line of foam now there was nothing but foam that tossed in the dark  mossamedes forged ahead and kit wondered whether don erminio knew where he went on the whole he thought the captain did not know sometimes one must blindly trust ones luck she came round again lurched by the turmoil on a sand and steamed head to wind then miguel came to the door of the wheelhouse  we are arrived señor  don erminio signed to the leadsman who swung the plummet round his head and let go  good we have water enough said the captain and rang the telegraph  the reversed engines shook the ship and the anchor plunged she stopped and but for the roar of the breakers all was quiet somehow miguel had brought her across the sands when she dragged out her cable the guns were hoisted up and put near the gangway where if needful one could heave the boxes overboard miguel cleared the cargo launch ready for launching and they stripped the covers from a lifeboat  since they had brought their dangerous cargo to the spot agreed kit was resolved it must be landed to carry out yusufs orders was perhaps the best plan to defeat his treachery and kit thought his doing so had a touch of humour he felt he would like to see yusuf again but he need not bother much about revillon the frenchman had chased mossamedes and lost her if he returned at daybreak he would not venture across the sands anyhow they could get rid of the evidence against them soon after they saw the gunboats smoke all the same kit meant to land the guns  when all was ready he went to the engineers messroom and smoked he was highly strung and could not sleep but to wait for daybreak was hard the gunboat might arrive and he doubted if the cargo launch could cross the surf one must run some risk but he was not going to drown his men he heard the wind although its roar was dulled by other noises then mossamedes rolled the water in her bilges splashed about chains clanged on deck and one heard hammers and shovels in the stokehold strange echoes rolled about the empty iron hull  now and then don erminio came down and talked about shooting rabbits sometimes macallister pulled back the curtain lighted his pipe and philosophised but did not stop long barefooted firemen and sailors flitted along the alleyway it looked as if nobody could rest at length when kits mouth was parched from smoking he got up shivered and turned off the light a pale glimmer pierced the glass and putting on a thick jacket he went on deck  day was breaking and it was cold the wind was dropping but the swell ran high and the sand blew from the point like a brown fog under the fog were white lines of surf by and by don erminio climbed the rigging and kit joined him where the steel shrouds got narrow the mast swung carrying them with it in a reeling sweep until they could have dropped into the sea in the meantime the light had got stronger and presently don erminio gave the glasses to kit so far as one could see nothing broke the horizon  it is good said don erminio the animal is gone we will get to work     chapter xii  the retreat to the boat   at the bottom of the wady it was very hot and kit lay on the sand behind a rock his smarting skin was crusted by salt his clothes had dried stiff and his muscles were sore he had landed the guns and it had not been easy to run the launch through the surf and hold her off the roaring beach while the boxes were brought ashore the boat was half swamped and the sailors laboured up to their waists in water  after the cargo was landed a few darkskinned men arrived and when they loaded the boxes on their camels a dispute began kit understood the berbers declared the rifles were not the pattern they expected to get and wolf had not sent the number agreed the leader a very big truculent fellow had opened a box and argued angrily with the interpreter simon was a syrian and since he owned that the morocco he knew was the mediterranean coast kit imagined he did not altogether understand the others dialect the berbers dissatisfaction was obvious and kit agreed to go up the wady and meet the chief  when he had gone two or three miles the berbers stating that they would bring the chief left two of their party and vanished with the loaded camels among the stones kit rather thought the two who stopped were meant for guards they carried long guns and refused to talk to the interpreter after waiting for some time kit began to get disturbed since he had left some men on board the launch his party was not large and carried no weapons but their long spanish knives moreover the yellow haze round the sun and the pillars of sand that span about the wady indicated a dust storm not far off if the wind freshened much the launch could not ride in the surf kit resolved he would not stop long and lighting a cigarette began to ponder  they had not seen the gunboat it looked as if revillon imagined mossamedes had got away in the dark and was searching the coast for her he would no doubt come back but since the incriminating cargo was landed this was not important perhaps revillon had come back the sea was hidden by the hot stony banks and kit was tired and languid to climb to the parched table land was too much effort he began to think about the rifles so far the tribesmen had brought the sheep and camels they had agreed to deliver now it looked as if they thought they had been cheated this was strange but kit remembered that none of his friends trusted wolf he must see the chief and if possible satisfy the fellow all the same he would not wait much longer don erminio would get disturbed and the wind was rising if nobody arrived when his cigarette was smoked he would start  they are sulky fellows he said indicating the berbers  the moors are very bad people miguel agreed when a baccalao schooner is wrecked on the coast one does not see the crew again it is possible all are not drowned but they vanish  kit looked at the berbers and thought their quietness sinister their dark faces were inscrutable and they did not move one could hardly distinguish them from the stones  this time they bring no sheep or camels miguel resumed meaningly  it is strange said kit we have brought them rifles but perhaps they have already paid for the lot  some day they will get the rifles without payment remarked juan the mate so long as they expect another lot they are honest but when they get all they want they will cut your throat they will not cut mine i have had enough señor wolf is clever but the game is dangerous if he cheats you will pay  kit looked at simon who knitted his brows i do not altogether understand but they are angry something is not as they had thought  the haze about the sun was thicker puffs of fiery wind blew down the wady a whirling pillar of dust broke and fell near the group and the distant rumble of the surf got loud it was very hot and the men were languid but a sailor pulled a knife with an ornamented handle from his sleeve and began to sharpen it on his belt kits cigarette had burned to a stump and he looked at his watch juan got up  vamos we start now he said señor wolf knows much he stops at las palmas and if his customers carry us off it is our affair  one of the berbers began to talk in an angry voice but they set off and to start was some relief to kit standing for his employer he felt himself accountable for his party and he had waited long enough in fact he wondered whether he had not waited too long since the rising surf might force the launch to return to the ship now he was going he wanted to go fast but for a time did not he was tired the heat was enervating and the path was rough big stones lay about the dry river bed and the gaps were filled by soft sand in which ones feet sank besides it was prudent to use control the others were obviously disturbed and he must make an effort for calm  for all that when the sand began to blow down the wady his speed got faster the dust stuck to his hot skin and gathered on his eyelashes he could not see properly and his breath was laboured but when a sailor in front began to run he kept up he frankly did not want to be left behind perhaps it was imagination but he began to feel as if somebody followed him  turning his head he looked about he saw big stones and clumps of tamarisk but this was all the dust might hide the berbers camels and a camel travels faster than a tired man the strange thing was although he had gone up the wady to meet the berbers he now wanted to reach the launch before they arrived kit admitted he was not logical but to know the launch might have gone bothered him  at length the wady got wider and peering through the dustcloud he saw the sea the launch had not gone and the lifeboat was coming from the steamer kit thought this strange since the launch would carry all but perhaps don erminio had sent to find out why they had not returned the surf was high and a man on board the launch stood up and waved his arms as if he signalled the party to be quick then the dust got very thick and boats and surf vanished juan shouted but kit did not hear what he said they were all running as fast as possible slipping and stumbling across the stones  they reached the open beach and the dust rolled by for a few moments the view was clearer and kit saw the man on the launch was not waving to him he signalled to the lifeboat looking back kit understood camels were coming down the wady then the dust rolled up again and he saw nothing  breathing hard he laboured across the beach the sailors had paid out cable and the launch with her bows to the breakers tossed about in the surf in a few moments he would reach her but somebody behind seized him he staggered and tried to turn and then a sailor swerved and jumped kit saw the spanish knife shine and next moment he was free he plunged into the water and the launchs stern struck the sand close by a broken sea rolled in and men jumped overboard they carried oars and knives for the baccalao fishers quarrel with the moors is old kit seized the launchs tiller a thick bar of african oak  men with darker skins than the spaniards were in the water but so far as kit could see they did not shoot it looked as if they meant to capture the party kit however could not see much dust and sand rolled across the beach and the spray was thick the launch was half swamped and he thought the berbers would hold her until the surf beat in her bilge long oars and stretchers swung miguel used an iron anchorstock and the mate crouched like a cat on the stern thrust with his knife perhaps the struggle had gone on for a minute when the white lifeboat rode in on a combers top she swung to her anchor and don erminio jumped overboard to come ashore was not the captains business but don erminio was a sportsman  for the next few moments the struggle was savage but kit did not know much about it he was knocked down and washed against the lifeboat his head hurt he could not get on his feet and the surf rolled him up and down the beach then when he was going out with the backwash somebody dragged him on board and while he lay in the water under the thwarts he was dully conscious that the boat was off the beach he knew this because she lurched violently but did not strike the sand spray blew about and the tops of the seas splashed across the gunwale she made slow progress and kit thought all the oars were not manned  crawling aft under the rowers feet he seized a thwart and pulled himself up don erminio lay on the sternsheets and groaned his face was very white and his leg was not its proper shape the launch laboured across the combers some distance off kit pushed a man from the tiller and told him to row his head ached but he could steer  they were long pulling off to mossamedes and then were forced to wait for some minutes she rolled lifting her bilgekeels out of the water and one must watch for a chance to hook on the tackles at length a broken sea smaller than the others lifted the boat and kit seized the swinging hook the bowman was quick and got the other hook a winch rattled and the big boat went up she struck the steamers plates but did not stop and in a few moments the swivelling davits dropped her on the skids macallister and a steward lifted out the captain and kit went aft to see the launch hove up then he went to his room and for a time knew nothing more  he was roused by macallisters bathing his face and gave him a dull look  im thinking yell no be very bonny for a week or two the engineer remarked for a that yere luckier than the captain  is don erminio hurt kit asked  his legs and some ribs are broken maybe he was washed aneath the launch but yons no a when the boats came off juan and miguel were not on board  kit lifted himself awkwardly and leaned against the back of his bunk his head ached horribly and his brain was dull but he felt the throb of engines and heard water flow along the plates mossamedes was steaming hard and he must get up he got his leg across the ledge and then macallister pushed him firmly back  yell bide felix and i have work enough wi the captain and two or three mair  but you must stop her im going back for miguel  ye cannot go back i dinna ken how we won out  ah said kit who felt the steamers regular rise and fall she has crossed the shoals  it looks like that when i stopped to use the big lead we got good water  but who took her out miguels not on board  sometimes ye must trust your luck macallister replied before the lifeboat went away don erminio hove the cable short and when ye brought him off unconscious i broke the anchor out theres no a sound plank in the launch the lifeboats sternposts smashed and the sea was getting up if juan and miguel are living the moors have carried them off weel since the second mate is damaged i reckoned my job was to get back to grand canary i sent salvador to the wheel started the mill and let her gang  you went across blind kit exclaimed with dull surprise  just that she hit the bottom but came off and we got no extra water in the wells  the thing looked impossible kit had thought nobody but miguel could steer mossamedes across the shoals for all that her even movements indicated that she had reached open sea and kit tried to brace himself  but if the captain and second mate are knocked out we havent a navigator and grand canarys small  ye have a good engineer and a crew o baccalao fishermen macallister rejoined i alloo grand canarys small but its high and ye can see the peak o teneriffe over a hundred miles weel i ken where we started and put over the patent log when ye steer for an archipelago ye needna bother about a few degrees  kit nodded six high volcanic islands rise from deep water and mossamedes crew had manned the fishing schooners on a short voyage one could navigate by deadreckoning  ill away and look at the captain macallister resumed if yell no promise to lie quiate until i let ye up ill lock ye in  kit promised because he doubted if he could get out of his bunk and when macallister had gone he turned awkwardly and looked at the glass on the wall a purple mark crossed his swollen forehead and his jaw was cut somebody had knocked him down with a gun or perhaps he had got under the plunging boat all his body felt battered for a few minutes he leaned against the side of his bunk and then slipped back and went to sleep     part iii  kit finds his level     chapter i  illumination   mossamedes steamed into las palmas harbour one evening and as soon as she was moored kit landed don erminio and filed the necessary documents at the commandancia offices he however said nothing about the struggle on the beach and accounted for the captains injuries by stating that he was washed under the boat the sailors hurts were not serious and kit had not allowed the port doctor to see the men his visit was an embarrassment but on the whole kit and macallister thought they had not excited his curiosity  while he lay in his bunk kit had pondered and made his plans he meant to return and look for the mate and miguel but if the spanish officers knew he was persuaded they would not let him go they would no doubt make exhaustive inquiries and reports and then send a properly organised search party speed however was important and anything undertaken by the spanish government was not done soon  although it cost him some effort he went from the commandancia to the mates house and told his story to a startled woman with a powdered face when señora diaz was calm she asked kit what he was going to do about it and he said in the morning i sail for africa i do not think juan is hurt the moors wanted prisoners to hold until they get satisfaction you must not be afraid somehow we will find him  señora diaz was comforted kit was young but he looked very resolute and capable something in his quiet voice gave her confidence  vaya con dios she said and let him go  kit felt the señora had not used conventionally the polite goodbye anyhow he had not given her an empty promise he was going to find her husband and wolf was going to help if it were necessary kit meant to force him for he had noted that cayman was in the harbour ready for sea wolf must charter her in the next hour or two and she must sail before the commandante knew about the fight on the beach responsibility had developed kit and brought into action qualities he had not altogether known were his he could front a crisis and saw he must front one now cayman was in port and with the fresh tradebreeze abeam would soon reach the wady a few resolute men might find and make some bargain with the moors but if a gunboat landed a strong party the tribe would vanish in the desert  after the lonely anchorage and desolate surfbeaten coast the noise and traffic in the streets were strange bright lights burned in the shops people crowded the pavements enjoying the cool of the evening and kit heard the band in the alameda he felt he had nothing to do with the careless loungers and their cheerful voices jarred his load was heavy and he was highly strung  to reach the quiet street where wolf lived was some relief but kit went slowly trying to think he had taken yusufs selling them to revillon for granted but he doubted if this were all kit was satisfied wolf had not carried out his engagements with the moors and since the fellow had cheated his customers he would not hesitate to betray his servants he had used them unscrupulously and now two might be forced to pay for his dishonesty he must send them help  for a few minutes kit mused about something else mrs austin had got him the post and it looked as if she knew wolf was a cheat anyhow olivia knew and she was not as clever as her sister after he had seen wolf he was going to see mrs austin if there was any difficulty about wolfs chartering cayman she must persuade her husband austin was jeffersons partner and owned some shares in the boat  kit stopped at the arch that led to wolfs patio all was dark inside and the iron gate was fast he rang a bell and a man crossed the flags and pulled back the heavy bolt his face was near the bars and kit noted with some surprise that it was not wolfs servant  what does your honor want he asked  kit said he wanted wolf and would go to the office but the other did not open the gate  señor wolf is not here  not here then where is he said kit with an effort for calm  the other spread out his hands quien sabe many are curious but nobody knows the señor went some days since i am the landlords servant and take care of the house  ah said kit sharply did he leave a letter for his sobrecargo  he left nothing señor the boxes in the office were empty there was a heap of ashes as if somebody had burned papers but this was all  kit thanked the man and went off he knew enough wolf was gone and one saw what his going meant numerous steamers touched at las palmas and the fellow had no doubt quietly got on board since he could buy his ticket from the purser there was no use in inquiring at the steamship offices well kit must see mrs austin  the shortest way to the house was across the alameda the band was playing lamps burned among the dusty trees and as kit approached a group of people he stopped olivia talked to a spanish lady the ladys husband two or three young spanish girls and some coaling clerks stood about but when olivia saw kit she left the others going with him to a bench at a quiet spot not far off she sat down kit leaned against a tree and a beam from a lamp touched his face olivia noted the dark bruise and the hardness of his mouth he looked very tired and his eyes were dull  why kit what is the matter she said  i expect you know wolf is gone  yes i do know but what does it mean  for one thing it means wolfs a thief and im a trustful fool in the meantime perhaps thats enough  i wouldnt bother about it said olivia soothingly you look ill and you have hurt your head  i must bother kit rejoined i was wolfs servant and have lost two of his men since i stood for their employer in a sense the men were mine the moors have got them wolf cheated the fellows they followed us to the boats and there was a fight i got on board but all the men whod gone with me did not i was their leader i ought to have gone off last  olivia was moved by his distress and put her hand gently on his arm  oh kit im sorry but youre not accountable if it had been possible to save the men you would have brought them off  her sympathy thrilled him he was highly strung and although he tried for control he was carried away  the voyage was disastrous all went wrong from the start he said you warned me and talked about bad luck but i went perhaps im obstinate but i think you knew why i did go  olivia turned her head and thought she had known why he went but it was plain the reserve he had used was gone his control was broken and he would be frank she liked him but now he forced her to choose her line she admitted this was all  i think you were rather ridiculous she said quietly looking up  he tried to pull himself together but could not he had got a nasty knock  it looks like that he said in a hoarse voice all the same you knew my ambition and didnt hint i was ridiculous  the blood came to olivias skin and her eyes sparkled  to some extent she felt kits retort was justified but she was modern and had pluck  i thought you lonely and we were pals she said did you expect me to warn you i didnt want a lover  if you had warned me it would not have cost you much perhaps i am dull but sometimes i do understand i thought i might like austin mend my fortune he held my post and married your sister you knew and i expect you were amused the thing was a joke well sometimes i saw i was a fool but i wasnt logical long when youre about one isnt logical i meant to mend my fortune  are you logical now  kit laughed harshly oh yes my rashness is plain enough you had long since resolved to refuse me all i hadnt the pluck to ask well my luck is certainly not good i have been refused before and in the meantime  she stopped him by a proud gesture you are breaking rules kit and mustnt talk like this again when you are cool you will know you ought not what have your love affairs to do with me  he gave her a steady look and his face got rather white the dark bruise was plainer and the blood left his lips  my rules are the rules of the humble folk to whom i belong all the same i might have tried to use yours had i been my proper self well perhaps i deserve some punishment im poor and have no talent to help me along i let wolf use and cheat me like a schoolboy then when i met you a few minutes since i forgot about the men id lost however im going back to look for them and if i find them and some time get a proper job well talk about my rashness again ill go to don pancho and state i mean to ask you to marry me youll no doubt refuse but my proposal will be regular and to refuse an offer ive some right to make wont humiliate you  olivia thought fatigue and strain accounted for much he had got a bad knock and she had hurt him worse she was half sorry and half angry but her anger was keenest against mrs austin who had sent him on board the ship  you are ridiculous kit she said gently but if you are in trouble about wolf and the men in morocco go to jacinta i think she ought to help thats all you mustnt keep me the others are curious  she rejoined the party at the band and kit went on to mrs austins he agreed with olivia but did not stop where she stopped mrs austin was going to help when he reached the veranda she was talking to mrs jefferson and nobody else was about kit remembered this was an evening on which she did not receive guests she glanced at him with some surprise noting his bruised face and disturbed look and then indicated a chair  i dont know that youll urge me to stop when you have heard my tale he said however is mr austin or mr jefferson at home  harry is at teneriffe and jefferson has gone to madeira  then my luck is bad again said kit all the same ive come to ask for something and meant to state that i expected your support i meant to see you anyhow  mrs austin was surprised but said nothing kit had not talked to her like this before he was cool and very stern somehow he looked older and she wondered about the bruise  very well he resumed i met miss brown at the alameda and understand you know wolf is gone i did not know until i arrived but begin to see light its possible his going did not surprise you you knew he was a rogue  you are taking much for granted mrs austin remarked quietly  not at all said kit your sister knew and warned me people declare youre the cleverest woman at las palmas  mrs austin pondered if olivia had warned kit it was possible the girl herself did not know as much as her elder sister had thought about betty for example  well she said  ill tell you my story kit replied and narrated his adventures after landing the guns  i begin to see mrs austin remarked then for her line of argument was sometimes not very obvious she resumed you met olivia not long since by the band  that is so kit replied with some dryness all the same you have no grounds to be disturbed miss brown knows my drawbacks in fact when you persuaded wolf to give me the post your meddling wasnt necessary but you did get me the post although you doubted wolf this is important  at las palmas mrs austin was a great lady and kit had gratefully owned his debt to her now he took another line a line that nobody she knew durst use for all that she was sorry for kit he looked ill and worn she saw that losing the men weighed hard on him  suppose i admit i sent you to wolf she said you feel you are entitled to blame me because your adventure was not fortunate  not at all my objects not to blame you said kit when i took the post i thought you kind to find out that all you wanted was to get me away from las palmas hurt however we wont bother about this  he paused mrs austins calm was beginning to embarrass him in fact there was something very dignified about her quietness although she admitted that her plotting had cost him much kit however braced himself  i meant to see you before i saw mr austin he resumed im going back for the men and must get a boat at once if the commandante knew i was going he wouldnt let me sail and he will know soon caymans ready for sea and you must lend me her  mrs austin smiled i dont think your argument is altogether sound cayman belongs to my husband and jefferson and they are away  all thats mr austins is yours and mrs jefferson is here  i imagine i can promise for my husband mrs jefferson remarked  very well said mrs austin you may have the boat i will give you a letter for the captain  she went off and mrs jefferson turned to kit have you seen betty  kit started he had forgotten betty he was again a fool she would understand his troubles and would sympathise he was persuaded she would agree he ought to go  id like to see her but i cannot he said we must sail at daybreak and i have much to do all i can think about is getting back to africa but if you will tell her why i didnt go to the office  mrs jefferson smiled betty had qualities but mrs jefferson doubted if she would approve kits sending another to tell his tale she said nothing and mrs austin presently returned and gave kit an envelope  this is an order for the captain your adventures rash and i really ought not to agree she said for all that i wish you luck  kit thanked her and when he went down the steps mrs austin looked at mrs jefferson  if he wrecks cayman or the crew get hurt i shall have some trouble with harry sometimes he is firmer than people think  mrs jefferson smiled on the whole i imagine jake will approve perhaps kit was rude but in a way he was rather fine he wont wreck the boat and i expect he will get the men kit is good stuff however i suppose youre satisfied you were entitled to meddle  about olivia yes so far as that goes my plan was good my father was a steamship steward and began business at las palmas by selling tobacco on board the ships all the same kit musgrave is not olivias sort if she doesnt know this now he and she would soon find it out well im going to be firm  i doubt if firmness is indicated mrs jefferson rejoined with a twinkle sometimes the best plan is to leave things alone     chapter ii  caymans start   soon after he left mrs austins kit rowed off to mossamedes got some clothes and talked to the interpreter who hesitated for a time before he agreed to go with him then he picked out three men from the crew but ordered them to stop on board until he was ready it was obvious that his adventure must not be talked about before he left the port  afterwards he was rowed to cayman and gave mrs austins letter to the captain cayman was a fast and strong ketchrigged vessel of about sixty tons four hands could sail her and relieve the watch but she carried six when goods are not all landed at the ports trading on the morocco coast has some drawbacks and jefferson ran no risks the captain was an old baccalao fisherman and when he read the order he asked where do you want to go  kit told him and he looked thoughtful i know the spot the sands are dangerous and the moors are bad  for all that you must anchor the ketch behind the banks and wait until i come back from the desert said kit and stated why he meant to undertake the journey  ah said the captain that is another thing my men will not grumble they know the moors well we are not allowed to carry guns but i can throw a knife and maccario can kill a jumping goat with his sling then andres the wrestler knows a trick the moor he seizes will drop with a broken back  your men will stop on board they are señor jeffersons servants and the job is mine when i land three or four from the steamer will go with me  we will talk about this again but you had anchored behind the sands and had lost miguel how did you get to sea  i dont know said kit i was in my bunk and don erminio was in his but we did get to sea i understand don pedro took control  the captain laughed el maquinista ave maria señor for a good sailor who is not a fisherman the thing was impossible but i know don pedro i have seen him dance strange dances of the north at the wineshop by the mole some say he is mad all the same the steamer is not wrecked ma  kit stopped him it looked as if macallisters friends were numerous but there was much to be done and he rowed the captain to the port office and left him to file his papers one could not without complying with some formalities sail before daybreak and kit thought to send to the ayutantes house was risky  engaging a tartana he went to see don erminio the captains small house smelt of salt fish garlic and burned olive oil and señora martinez received kit in the court she was fat and her brown skin was thickly powdered  you will not excite my husband she said when he is ill he is sometimes difficult and he has had a dispute with the doctor  she took kit up the outside stairs and along a balcony to a small hot room don erminio occupied the oldfashioned bed and when kit came in looked up with a savage frown but the frown vanished  i thought it was the animal of a doctor coming back he remarked me i am a sailor and he will not let me drink the anisado was on the table he put the bottle in his pocket and i could not get up then he looked in the cupboard the animal is cunning but another time i put the bottle under the bed however the moors have got juan and miguel we must do something  kit stated his plans and the captain signed approval he was tightly bandaged and could hardly move his head  it is very good but you will take don pedro  i think not in fact he does not know i am going  the captain urged but kit was firm caution and tact were indicated and although macallister was generally cool his coolness often masked a freakish rashness  very well don erminio agreed at length sometimes don pedro is humorous but the moors are not people with whom one jokes i will lend you my gun  he signed to señora martinez who brought the old pinfire gun and gave it to kit  the gun is good if you are careful she will not go off before you want but you must not shake her he resumed and frowned when he saw the mark on the box of cartridges what is this he asked his wife bring the number b señor musgrave does not shoot the rabbit  señora martinez got another box and don erminio nodded it is good if pepe has used the proper measure she will kill a moor at twenty yards but you must not shake her the hammerspring is loose  kit thanked him and soon afterwards went off he had taken the gun in order to indulge the captain since it was obvious that when he met the moors he could not use force for all that he had not a pistol and to some extent the old gun might give him moral support  when he was rowed across the harbour he heard a guitar badly played and jumping down from caymans bulwarks saw macallister sitting under the anchor light the engineer held the guitar awkwardly and the sailors sat round and laughed  hallo kit said frowning why have you come on board  yere a dour crabbit englishman and no as clever as ye think macallister rejoined ye had not been gone ten minutes when i kenned what ye were after and reckoned i had got to see ye oot ye didna ken i talk averrrack  i doubt it now said kit and macallister beckoned the interpreter who had come on board with him  ye shall judge adjia simonidas  is this arabic it sounds like greek said kit  simons from aleppo macallister rejoined when ye trade in the levant ye use arabic turkish italian and greek and whiles ye mix the lot theres no a sailors café between suez and smyrna i dinna ken but yere a doubting creature weel simon  he began to talk and the interpreter leaned against the mast and laughed  he is truly droll simon remarked in french but i think he is safe with the moors good moslems believe that allah guards such as him  kit lighted a cigarette he had undertaken an awkward job and was sternly serious mack was of course a good sort but when he was not engaged in the engineroom his talents were for something like comic opera kit would frankly sooner he had stopped on board mossamedes for all that he had known macks reckless humour useful when sober thought was not and he must be resigned mack was on board and would not go back  when kit had smoked his cigarette he got two of the men to wash caymans boat and rowed across the harbour to a coaling wharf the clerks had gone but kit knew how the hose key worked and brought back the boat loaded with fresh water as deep as she would float then he looked at his watch and going to the patrons small cabin tried to sleep  the rattle of chain woke him and he went on deck day was breaking and a cold wind blew off the land mist rolled about the mountains and in the background las palmas glimmered against dark volcanic rocks its outline was blurred and the white houses were indistinct the town looked ghostly and unsubstantial in the harbour steamers with gentlyswaying masts floated on the smooth swell nobody moved about their decks and all was very quiet but for the surf that beat against the mole  some of the crew began to hoist the mainsail they moved slackly as if they were halfasleep their bare feet made no noise and kit liked to hear the thud of the canvas they threw off the boom then blocks began to rattle and when the gaff was up the sail flapped in the wind they left the peak hanging and went forward to hoist the jib the noise of running wire and chain halyard was cheerful and kit tried to rouse himself  there is something that moves the imagination about a large steamer leaving port one gets a sense of organised effort of force in mans control and the triumph of his inventions kit had vaguely felt that the correillos sailing with the mails on board was so to speak a social function of some importance to all to mark a mailboats departure by a gun or detonating rocket was proper but caymans start was flat and dreary she must steal out of harbour lest she be stopped and kit shivering in the cold wind was daunted  he had left his ship without leave and macallister had frankly run away they had broken useful rules and would no doubt lose their posts but this did not much bother kit he had undertaken a job that so far as he could see he could not carry out in fact the thing was ridiculous the moors were fierce and cunning desert thieves and he was going to force them to agree with him he knew no arguments they would admit and his only protection was don erminios old pinfire gun  kit felt his youth but his inheritance counted for much his code was the puritans and its rude simplicity had advantages one must do this because it was proper the other was not there was no use in arguing when one knew what was right kit saw his duty and if it cost him something he must pay all the same he shrank to do what he ought might cost much  cayman rode to a buoy and when the jib was sheeted they brought the mooring aft and let her swing the patron went to the long tiller and wore her round and the slack mainsail lurched across then all went to the peak halyard and kits spirits rose the rattle of blocks was cheerful he liked to see the straining figures rise and fall the mens laboured breath and rhythmic movements gave him a bracing sense of effort  cayman stole between a big cargo boat and a passenger liner and by contrast with their lofty hulls looked absurdly small when she began to list the water was nearly level with her covering board the list got sharper she forged past the end of the mole and her bowsprit splashed in the high green swell the patron studied the mist that rolled about the mountains and turned to kit  the wind blows up there and we will get it when we get the sun well we must drive her off the coast before the commandante knows why we have gone i think we will not steer the usual course  they ran up the staysail and set the mizzen cayman leaped forward and the spray blew from her plunging bows her white wake trailed across the tops of the seas astern and the water that bubbled through the scuppers crept up her lee deck for all that the captain was not satisfied and he looked to windward knitting his brows  one can see far with the telescope from the isleta signal station he remarked the mist is clearing we will risk the topsail  the big sail was hoisted and caymans list got very sharp one could not see how far the water crept up her inclined deck because a sparkling cascade splashed across her weather bow and swelled the flood they had hauled her on the wind and her channels dragged in the foam one heard the wire shrouds hum and the masts groan and now and then a sea rolled aft and broke against the boat on deck for all that the captain held on and when the sun rose grand canary had melted into the silver mist     chapter iii  the wady   the sun was nearly overhead and kit sat in the hot dust that lay about the wady a low bank rose behind him and shaded his head his eyes hurt he was tired and his burned skin was sore for the dust stung as if it were mixed with alkali in the open one could hardly front the sun but the nights were keen and at daybreak he had got up shivering from his hard bed behind a stone  macallister simon and three sailors from mossamedes occupied the narrow belt of shade their poses were cramped and awkward for all tried to get some shelter from the sun they had lunched frugally on gofio goatsmilk cheese and a little sour wine gofio is roasted grain ground and mixed with water the gritty paste stuck to kits parched mouth for he tried to control his thirst the skin in which they had brought water from the ketch did not hold much  the map in wolfs office indicated an oasis not very far from the coast and kit imagined that where water was he would find the berbers since the wady ran nearly straight inland he resolved to use it for a guide and for three days the party had laboured across the dust and stones as a rule the hollow was not deep or sharply marked for the most part easy slopes led to a bare tableland where the soil swept and consolidated by the wind looked like rock in places however the hollow pierced rolling ground and sank to a stony ravine  the country was strangely desolate but was not the level sandy desert kit had thought in fact there was not much sand and in spots it looked as if the soil was sometimes cultivated the bank behind kits camp was sharply cut as if by an angry torrent but since he had left the beach he had not seen water there was not a rabbit or a partridge although in the dry canaries rabbits haunt the stony ravines and redlegged partridges run in the prickly pear nothing but a pair of buzzards floating very high up had crossed the sky  half closing his eyelids kit looked about strange reflections quivered across the stones and distant objects were magnified in the foreground the light was dazzling and the hollow melted into a luminous belt of brown and yellow a euphorbia bush with stiff thick stalks however was harshly green and looked like a house although it was but four or five feet high the euphorbia puzzled kit in a country where one found no water its stalks were tender with milky sap he glanced at his companions their cotton clothes had gone yellow their skin was brown and he thought one could not distinguish them a short distance off an hour since he imagined somebody had looked out from behind a stone although he wanted to meet the berbers he did not want to think they cautiously followed his track  he mused about the barrenness of the country at lanzarote sixty miles from the african coast it sometimes did not rain for six or eight months and then when the concrete cisterns were nearly dry it rained in floods perhaps it was like that in morocco sheep and camels could not live if it did not rain at all kit began to think about the good bishop who used all his fortune to send the people of lanzarote water  a sailor shouted and kit jumped up a cloud of dust rolled down the wady and in the dust about sixty yards off men on camels rode for the camp kit watched their advance with dull surprise a few moments since he had seen nobody and a camel is a large object to hide it looked as if the berbers had sprung from the sand then he heard the humming flight of a stone and a camel swerved a sailor laughed hoarsely and stooped to get another stone for his sling but kit stopped the man he had come to meet the berbers and they carried long guns had they meant to hurt him they could have hidden behind the stones and shot the party  for all that when they pulled up a few yards off his heart beat and coolness was hard they were big muscular fellows and the nearest looked scornfully fierce kit could not see the others faces because they wore loose hoods one or two of the spaniards had drawn their knives but nobody moved the little party stood against the bank and looked at the berbers then kit braced himself and signed to the interpreter  for a few moments simon and one of the others talked but the berbers remarks were short his pose was easy but very still and the long gun he balanced somehow emphasised his height he was like a bronze and blue statue and kit thought his quietness forbidding the camel moved its long neck and grunted  he says we must go with him simon remarked his chief is waiting that is all  kit looked at macallister who calmly cleaned his pipe aweel he said ye wanted to find the moors and ye ought to be satisfied yon fellows no for arguing well just gang  the berber touched his camel and lifted his hand his gesture was commanding and when the others moved forward kit told the spaniards to put up their knives the berbers did not threaten they pushed their camels against the bank and the men must move or be trampled  arrai said the leader his camel grunted and kits men set off one behind the other between two rows of the clumsy animals  the camels went fast their necks moving backwards and forwards like engine pistonrods at the bottom of the wady the heat was intolerable and thick dust rolled up moreover the ground was rough but kit pushed on as fast as possible he did not think the berbers would argue about the pace it looked as if they thought his business was to keep up he heard macallister breathe hard and sometimes simon coughed the sailors went silently in their open rawhide shoes the berbers said nothing and one could not hear the camels feet in fact all was strangely quiet and somehow flat  kit had started with high resolves but owned he had not played a romantic part things had not gone as he had vaguely planned the situation so to speak was not in his control his party was driven along rather like a flock of sheep although he had meant to negotiate with the chief it looked as if he was the fellows prisoner  the wady pierced a stony hill and in the defile the heat got worse kits skin was scorched the dust got into his nose and throat sometimes he could hardly see his eyes hurt and his head ached nevertheless it was obvious that he must keep up and he laboured on  by and by the berbers turned and climbed the side of the defile to climb was hard for parched soil and loose stones rolled down the slope the camels however went up and kit saw he must keep in front of the animals behind him the track was narrow and it did not look as if the berbers would stop he could not see macallister gasping men and lurching camels moved in a yellow fog  at the top they crossed a dazzling tableland where the soil was firm and to feel the wind was some relief when they went down again a few miles farther on kit saw prickly pear thorny aloes and in one spot short white stubble but there were no tents the hollow was wide and ran on straight in front until stones and dust melted into the quivering reflections nothing indicated that a camp was near  the sun sank and the camels threw grotesque shadows across the parched soil kit began to lose the sense of feverish heat and although he was worn out walking was easier when the sky was luminous red and green the wind got cool and the camels pace was fast somehow he kept up and at length the berbers stopped  dark tents dotted the wady and sheep occupied a belt of dry stubble in places an aloe lifted a tall shaft tamarisk and prickly pear grew on the banks but kit saw no palms a few ruined stone huts hardly distinguishable from the background occupied a bend of the hollow and a broken heap that might have been a watch tower on the ridge cut the sky kit understood the berbers were nomads but it looked as if somebody had long since built a village  no excitement marked the partys arrival the leader shouted foocha and the camels knelt the men got down and pushed kit and the sailors forward indistinct figures appeared at the tent doors and he smelt acrid smoke in front of the middle tent the leader stopped and a man came out  it was getting dark but kit remarked that the man was not as big as the camel drivers and his skin was lighter his mouth and jaw were covered and his blue clothes were clean for a moment or two he studied the group and his calm glance rather annoyed kit all the berbers he had met were marked by an imperturbable calm then the fellow said something to a camel driver who signed the party to go with him and took them to a hut the front was broken and the roof had fallen but the building gave some shelter from the keen wind by and by another man brought them a bowl of stuff like porridge some dried meat kit thought was goats flesh and dates  what did the sheik say to the camel driver he asked simon  he will talk to us in the morning this was all if he had meant to hurt us he would not have sent the food when you go call him wazeer it is not his title but he will like it  kit doubted if the berber would be moved by flattery but he said the food is good this porridge stuff is better than the canary gofio what do they call it  couscous said simon from morocco to nigeria all food that looks like this is couscous it may be made with sour milk palm oil or water and roasted grain and some is very bad in africa they do not use many names  im thinking to talk much would hurt them macallister remarked a very reserved people and yon sheiks the dourest o the lot for a that when i try him wi avarrrack  kit turned impatiently to the interpreter we have got to negotiate with the man since we cant buy his friendship i dont see my line  to be poor is not always a drawback simon replied perhaps it is better he does not think us rich in africa one gives a present and we have some wine left it is not good but when one has none  but a mohammedan is not allowed to drink wine  simon smiled i will use some caution if the headman breaks the rules his people must not know those who got no wine would be horrified in this country one uses caution always frankness is dangerous  do you know much about the country  i know something simon replied a levantine and a jew may go where an englishman cannot and a spaniard would be killed in egypt i was an hotel servant in algiers a pedlar i have sold wine to the legion at the outposts and in senegal i was majordomo for a french commandant a small fat man with a theatrical dignity but the black soldiers loved him when they drilled well he gave them sugar he did not send an orderly the commandant went along the line with the sugar in his cap some french are like that your officers are just but one doubts if the africans love you much well in algiers one has adventures but in morocco south of casablanca one is lucky if one keeps ones life if you are not bored  kit said he was not bored to listen was some relief from his gloomy thoughts and simon told a romantic tale the fellow was obviously a bold and unscrupulous vagabond but kit did not know when his narrative stopped he was very tired and presently his head dropped forward and his shoulders slipped down the broken wall  when he awoke the stars were shining and it was very cold two sailors lay beside him and all was quiet kit put his head on another stone and went to sleep again     chapter iv  kit negotiates   in the morning before the sun was high a berber took kit and his party to the headmans tent and signed them to sit in the sand their clothes were smeared by dust to which the dew had stuck and kits boots were broken his fatigue had not worn off much he felt horribly dirty and dull but he knew he must brace up the headman and two or three others occupied the open front of the tent in the background a row of camels making strange noises knelt beside a broken wall and behind the uncouth animals stones and clumps of tamarisk melted into the widening bottom of the wady the wind had dropped it was not yet hot and thin smoke with a pungent smell floated about the camp  kit studied the headman with some curiosity since he did not know if the fellow was his host or captor but got no hint from his inscrutable face he understood the people were berbers but at las palmas he had borrowed a book that stated the berbers were short and lightskinned the tribesmen kit had met were big and dark but the chief was lighter in build and colours than the rest he was obviously not a savage somehow kit thought him wellbred  why have you come to my camp he asked  simon translated and afterwards carried on the talk as a rule it dragged and kit imagined the interpreter was sometimes puzzled and used the lingua franca of the moorish ports  tell him i have come for the men his people carried off from the boats said kit  you thought to take them from us  no said kit we knew this was impossible  yet you brought a gun  kit had missed the gun but when the headman signed one of the others brought don erminios old doublebarrel the berber studied it and kit thought him amused  then you mean to buy the men he resumed  kit said he did not he had no money but if the men were not released it was possible the spanish government would send soldiers to look for them the headman let this go and asked what his and macallisters occupation was simon replied and the other was quiet for a few moments then he said i have a better gun than yours but sometimes it does not shoot if this man knows machines let him mend it  he clapped his hands and a berber brought macallister a big automatic pistol  i doubt my lucks no very good macallister remarked a watch i ken when ye can grip her in a vice and have tools to pick oot the works she need not puzzle ye lang but a pistol ye must hold on your knee is anither job im thinking there might be trouble if i spoil her for a that if ye have a peseta ill try t  kit with some hesitation gave him the coin he had known macallister spoil a useful watch and return another bearing the marks of the vicejaws experimenting with watches had a strange charm for him but sometimes he made a good job and if he mended the pistol it might help macallister got to work with the coin and his big pocket knife and the headman turned to kit  i seized the men because your master cheated me if i let them go i will not get the goods he owes  you will not get the goods kit agreed my master is gone  the headman and one of the others talked and simon said to kit they think it is so they have found out that yusuf is gone i expected something like this  not long since i would have sold the men i might have sold you all the berber resumed now however this is perhaps not safe we are not afraid of the soldiers but we have enemies and sometimes our neighbours take the white mens bribes  he is frank but it is like that simon remarked in africa the white mans power is not his native soldiers one tribe hates the next and foreign money rules the desert he paused and shrugged it is possible the fellow would have sold us baccalao fishermen have vanished at the wineshops the spaniards tell stories but he wants to know why you bother about the sailors they are not your servants  kit hesitated he did not know the berbers code and if he claimed his object was unselfish the fellow might think he had another yet he was not going to make up a plausible tale kits anger was quick and hot the brute had pondered selling white men like camels  tell him i saw somebody must look for them when his people tried to carry me off i think one put me on board the boat thats all he said  then they have no rich friends who would pay you if you brought them back the chief asked  you have seen them kit rejoined and indicated his companions they are men like these rich men dont labour in a steamers boats  the berber gave him a thoughtful glance kit was angry and his naive honesty was obvious the berber was subtle but it did not look as if he doubted kit thought he weighed something and then he looked up with a start  he had heard a sharp report and a thin streak of smoke curled about the automatic pistol sheep ran across the stubble a camel got up and kit saw a small hole in the tent  noo i ken whats wrang with his gun macallister remarked  holding the pistol in front he advanced towards the berbers none moved and the headmans look was imperturbable kit wondered whether the magazine held another cartridge and hoped nobody would move he knew macallister the engineer stopped opposite the headman and for a moment their glances met then he held out the pistol with the butt to the other  for a camel thief yere a trustful person he said dryly  kit had not seen a berber laugh but when simon translated it looked as if the headman smiled he signalled and across the wady a man with a modern rifle got up from behind a stone and another crawled out of the sand kit thought they were picked shots and had marked the range all the same he doubted if the headman knew there was a cartridge in the magazine macallister stopping by the other opened the pistol  noo he said ye see  his lingua franca was uncouth but when he took some pieces from the pistol with his pocket knife it looked as if the headman saw he was obviously interested something of his reserve vanished and presently he signed one of the others back and macallister sat down on the piece of carpet by his side the engineer gave kit a smile he understood it was as if he had said ye dinna ken old peter yet  kit mused he had borne some strain and was languid and the headman was occupied it was strange but macallister by luck or talent generally took the middle of the stage kit was not like that but now chance had given him a leading part the part must be played and he weighed the arguments he had used he had stated that he was poor and wolf had vanished if the chief were satisfied about this there was obviously no use in his holding the party for ransom or to force payment of wolfs debt then he had hinted that the spanish government might send soldiers to search the country and the berber admitted that he had enemies who intrigued with the white men kit did not know another argument perhaps he had said enough and he waited  by and by the headman talked to the interpreter who said he wants to know why you landed the guns when you had not brought all  we thought we had brought all kit replied we didnt know until the french gunboat came that yusuf had cheated us but he hasnt heard about the gunboat yet you must try to make him understand  he narrated their escape from the gunboat the story was long for the berbers were not sailors and translation was difficult sometimes simon hesitated but the headman did not look impatient his face was inscrutable and one got no hint about his thoughts the sun got hot and the wind began to blow the dust about the wady  at length kit stopped and for a few moments the headman pondered  you might have thrown the guns into the sea but you did not he remarked  the guns were yours said kit when we knew the jew had sold us we resolved to deliver them you see we had got the camels  the headman gave him a searching look if i let you have the men we took you will be satisfied  yes said kit that is all we want  very well said the other your master robbed me but he is gone and my debt will not be paid i will let your men go to keep them might be dangerous he paused and although he did not smile kit imagined he was amused all the camels with which i paid for the guns were not mine he went on some belonged to people who are friends of the french i will send for your men they are not here and you must wait for two or three days  he sent off a man to the camels and then touched macallister  if you will stop with me you shall take care of my guns and you may get rich he said and turned to kit if you can bring me the goods i want i will trade with you then he indicated the interpreter if this fellow comes back we will shoot him  he got up signed that the audience was over and went into his tent simons eyes twinkled  perhaps he thinks i know too much and i know something all the same i will not come back in morocco one runs risks and i have not got paid at cairo the tourists are curious about the east and some are generous they know simon at the big hotel i will return  kit went off to the shade of the ruined hut perhaps it was strange but he trusted the haughty berber and he had not altogether trusted simon on the whole he thought the fellows plan was good if the tourists at cairo were like some at las palmas simon would be a useful guide about the town at night kit himself would sooner be a robber like the darkskinned chief then macallister sat down opposite and began to clean his pipe  if i kent where to steal a handy bit steamboat yon headman and me would make a bonnie pair o pirates but ive no much use for camels he remarked weel i alloo ye took a very proper line wi him  i didnt see the line i ought to take i was frank  macallisters eyes twinkled just that im no saying ye were plausible but the headmans no a fool he saw ye were a simple weelmeaning body onyway its done with well get off when miguel comes  three days afterwards miguel and juan arrived riding in a frame hung across a camel the quartermaster got down awkwardly and stretched his arms and legs  but i am sore it is like beating to windward in a plunging boat he said and went up to kit we were anxious señor the moors are bad but i did not bother very much i knew you would come back for us and my saint would guard you  the blood came to kits skin he said nothing but gave miguel his hand     chapter v  the return to the beach   it was getting cooler and long shadows marked the curves of the wady on the other side oblique sunbeams touched the bank the wind had dropped and as the dew began to fall the hot soil smelt like a brickkiln in the distance the surf throbbed and kit thought its measured beat soothing he had had enough of the parched wilderness  he was languid for he had borne some strain and when miguel and the mate arrived a reaction had begun the berbers gave the party a little food and water before they broke camp and vanished in the desert and kit started for the coast travelling as fast as possible he had used his short supplies with stern economy and now when he thought the shore was three or four miles off he was hungry and tired  to some extent dejection accounted for his fatigue he had got the men for whom he went but the thrill he felt at first was gone wolf had run away his wages were not paid and since he had left his ship without leave he expected don ramon would dismiss him when he got back moreover he had perhaps involved the company in trouble with captain revillon and the spanish officers in fact it looked as if he were ruined and disgraced  he was not going to think about olivia she had refused him but he had really known she would refuse it was done with he would be sent back to liverpool and would not see her again there was one comfort betty would stop she was getting well and making progress jefferson trusted her and her pay was good at liverpool he would not see betty but like olivia she did not want him in fact nobody had much use for him he had been easily cheated and had muddled all he undertook still he had got betty a good post and this was much  after a time he imagined he ought to see the bay from the top of the bank and telling macallister where he was going he went up the slope the climb was laborious and at the top he stopped for breath and shaded his eyes from the level rays the sun was near the atlantic and in its track the water was red the broken ground about him shone like copper outside the crimson reflections the sea was wrinkled and marked by thin white lines where the long rollers broke the strong light hurt his dazzled eyes and with a vague sense of disturbance he turned his head when he looked again he could see the end of the point and the anchorage but cayman was gone  kit felt slack and sat down in the sand he could not see all the bay but a vessel could only anchor at one spot and cayman was not there kit had got a very bad jolt the food and water would hardly last for another day the coast was an arid desert and he did not think he could reach the camp the berbers had left he did not know if he hoped cayman had been blown ashore but if she were wrecked the crew might have saved some stores a mile or two farther on one ought to see the beach from the top of ground that now broke his view and he was anxious to get there but went down slowly he must be cool and not alarm the others yet  at the bottom he joined macallister who had waited and gave him a keen glance  weel said the engineer  caymans not riding in the pool kit replied  macallister was quiet for a moment or two then he said we have half a gallon o smelling water and there are eight o us as a rule i ha no much use for water but i mind when we broke the condensing plant on a coolie pilgrim boat ye could not fill your tanks at every coaling station then i got some water from the hot well tasting o copper and grease we fed the boilers from the sea and drove her with funnel flaming and tubes caked wi salt iron burns ye ken unless its clean and i thought the softening furnaces would blow down she was crowded fore an aft wi sweating gasping coolies and we let her gang when we made port i swallowed maist a gallon o lemonade claret and ice man i hear the ice tinkling against the pail  to talk about it makes one thirsty and we mustnt be thirsty yet kit remarked frowning say nothing to the others well push on for the ridge  to push on was some relief from suspense the rest of the party had not stopped and there was nobody but macallister to note kits keen impatience he wanted to reach the high ground that commanded the beach because it was possible cayman had broken her cable and driven ashore kit felt he must know and the shadows got longer fast perhaps it would be dark before he got to the ridge his burned skin was wet by sweat and his breath was short but he stubbornly laboured on  at length he climbed a sloping bank and from a high spot searched the bay the sun had gone and the red on the sky and water was fading but behind the point caymans mast cut the glow kits heart beat the ketch was not at her anchorage but she was not on the beach he shaded his eyes and looked again  the mast was slightly inclined in the glimmering reflections he could hardly distinguish the boats hull the tide was ebbing and he thought her keel touched bottom but there was some water under her bilge although the risk of hunger and thirst was gone kit was disturbed when he studied the waterline on the beach it looked as if cayman would presently fall over on her side on a flat open coast the tides do not rise much but there was a difference of some feet in the level and at low ebb the boat would be nearly dry  kit wondered whether she was damaged because one of two things had happened when it blew fresh cayman had broken her cable and driven ashore or the captain had slipped the anchor and tried to get to sea that he had not done so was plain but since she had not broken up kit imagined she lay in a hollow sheltered to some extent by higher sands outside to get to sea she must wait for the big tides at the new moon and then perhaps one must land all heavy gear and ballast and put the stuff on board again when she reached the anchorage the job would be awkward and long  pulling himself together kit went down to the wady and told the others the ketch had grounded the tired men saw all this implied and while the light faded made the best speed they could when they reached the beach it was dark but the captain had kept good watch and soon after they arrived a boat came shorewards on a smoothtopped roller running into the water they pushed her off and kit presently climbed on board the ketch caymans deck was sharply slanted sometimes she lifted her lower side and one felt her bilge work in the sand some distance out to sea the rollers crashed upon the shoals but the waves that broke about the ketch were small kit dined on salt fish potatoes and sour red wine in the morning he would talk to the captain now he was very tired and must sleep  he got up soon after daybreak and joined the captain on a plank hung over the side a man with a mallet caulked an open seam and indicated three or four butt joints that were freshly tarred when kit had looked about the captain sat down on the plank and made a cigarette  it blew señor but it blew he said when the anchor dragged we hoisted jib and mizzen but she would not beat out then while we hoisted the reefed mainsail she struck a comber threw her up the sand we lowered all sail and let her drive until we knew by the smoother water she had crossed the shoal then two anchors brought her up  kit nodded what are you going to do about it  when we have caulked some seams she will not leak much and if it does not blow again she will lie here until the tides get high in the meantime we will heave out the ballast and land it on the beach then perhaps at the new moon we can kedge her across to the pool  the job will be long said kit my men must rest today in the morning we will get to work  they began at sunrise next day but the work was hard cayman had been built for speed and when sail was set would not stand up without a large quantity of ballast the ballast was iron kentledge moulded to fit her frames and when the floors were up the men crouching in the dark pulled the heavy blocks out of the bilgewater except for an hour or two at low tide cayman did not lie quiet when the water lifted her she rolled the blocks were sent up in a sling and lowered into the boat which did not carry much and must be rowed for half a mile across angry waves near the beach an anchor was dropped and when she swung head to sea her crew jumped over and carried the iron through the surf sometimes they were forced to wait and sometimes to haul off the boat  all hands were needed and after a day or two kits muscles ached and his bruised hands bled when his limbs were cramped by crawling among the timbers in the hold he went off in the boat and clasping a fiftysixpound lump of iron laboured up the hammered beach sometimes a roller frothing round his waist urged him on and sometimes he stopped and braced himself against the backwash the bottom was not firm gravel and sand rolled up and down and buried his sinking feet moreover he knew the iron he laboriously carried up must all be carried back  when the ballast was out the captain hesitated on the moorish coast sheltered ports are not numerous and for the most part cayman landed and shipped cargo from anchorages behind the sands and reefs in consequence her main anchor and cable were very large and heavy but the captain thought the vessel must be further lightened in order to float across the shoals now the iron was landed she rolled violently and one hot afternoon kit holding on by a runner leaned against the bulwarks macallister and miguel occupied the hatch coaming the captain the grating by the tiller  if we do not land the anchor she may strike when we kedge her across the sand he said if she gets across and it blows hard we will need the big anchor and all the chain to hold her we must run one of two risks  if she strikes on the high sand she will stop for good miguel remarked in two or three tides the surf would break her up  i think that is so the captain agreed in the pool she might ride to the small anchor and the kedge it depends on the wind i do not know if we will get much wind or not  miguel shrugged and used the castilian rejoinder quien sabe which implies that nobody knows  the captain lighted a cigarette he was obviously irresolute and kit sympathised one could not weigh the risks and the choice was hard  when you cannot see your way you trust your luck and drive ahead macallister remarked in uncouth castilian if you do not get to the spot you want you get somewhere and the hardest road is often shortest land your anchor and let us start  bueno said the captain who got up and went to the windlass  at high tide when cayman floated they carried out the kedge and hove the main anchor and put it in the boat kit went with the landing party and doubted if they could have got out the anchor had not miguel been on board they had no mechanical help while the boat plunged in the foaming surf the ponderous lump of iron must be lifted by muscular effort and when one struggles against an angry backwash one cannot lift much kit was exhausted his hands bled and miguels arm was torn but they got the anchor over and returning to the ketch were fronted by another obstacle  in broken water the boat would not carry all the chain they must take it by fifteenfathom lengths and the connecting shackles had rusted fast kit thought nobody but macallister could have knocked out the pins but at length the cable was divided and they resumed their labour in the surf     chapter vi  betty demands help   on the evening of austins return to las palmas he and jefferson smoked and talked on the veranda steps mrs austin and mrs jefferson were occupied with some sewing at a table near the lamp but olivia was not about she had gone to a concert at the metropole with a young english tourist whom mrs austin approved for all that mrs austin did not know how far olivia approved and she was bothered about kit he had been longer than she had expected and to some extent perhaps she was accountable for him mrs austin generally meant well and as a rule her plans to help people worked but kit was headstrong and had not left much to her  she wondered what austin thought about her sending off the cayman harry did not say much and he had been occupied since his return jefferson had no doubt talked to muriel but muriel was sometimes reserved now jefferson and harry were together mrs austin thought she might if she were cautious get a useful hint  i would rather like to get up an excursion to the mountains for mrs gardners party she was muriels friend in england and we have not done much to amuse her she said however i expect you could not join us  you mustnt count on jake and me austin replied we have let things go long enough  yet the business kept going in fact i imagine it went pretty well  that is so austin agreed with a smile we know where you got your talents and things do go well when don pancho resumes control all the same hes had enough and i am needed  mrs austin was baffled she had not learned much from harry and she tried jefferson  you have not a useful fatherinlaw did you find a bad tangle when you got back  i have known a worse tangle when i was about jefferson replied anyhow ive a pretty good spanish clerk and miss jordans a wonder he paused and gave mrs austin a thoughtful glance shes a girl to reckon on but she was glad to slacken up and let me get to work struck me she was quiet somethings bothering her i guess  mrs austin let it go if they would not talk about cayman she would not talk about betty but she listened after all she had given them a lead  jefferson lighted a cigarette and turned to austin you met don ramon were his remarks illuminating  don ramon is sometimes discreet i didnt get much from him the commandancia people are his friends and so far i reckon they have not made trouble about the men musgrave left in africa however he stated that don arturo would shortly arrive from liverpool to see if he could settle the coaling dispute and i imagine don ramon would sooner leave the thing to his chief  do you think revillon lodged a formal complaint  on the whole i think not revillons a cautious fellow and didnt get on board mossamedes in fact he hasnt very much to go upon and its possible the french foreign office dont want a dispute about the moorish atlantic coast but i dont know and the situations interesting my notion is it will be handled pretty cautiously when musgrave comes back don arturos not a fool and when a light touch is indicated you can trust don ramon  jefferson smiled in a sense musgraves not important his parts to put across an awkward job the spanish officers would sooner leave alone and when the logrolling begins he drops out if it pays the others may use his exploit but we must try to see he does not get hurt anyhow i hope he has not piled up the boat well want her soon  that is so austin agreed ive been closely engaged and havent yet bothered about the ketch but are you going  mrs jefferson said they had promised to meet some people at the catalina and austin went with them for a short distance the night was dark but soon after they left the gate they met a girl going towards the house with a quick resolute step it was not olivia and when she vanished in the gloom jefferson smiled  miss jordan i think he said and his voice was rather dry  a few minutes afterwards mrs austin looking up with some surprise saw betty on the steps  if mr jefferson is wanted you have missed him mrs austin said  i did not want mr jefferson i met him and the others in the road and knew you were alone  then you wished to see me said mrs austin in a careless voice although she would sooner austin had turned back she indicated a chair and resumed very well tell me what it is about  betty sat down her clothes were plain but very neat she looked businesslike and resolute mrs austin thought her calm cost her something but her mouth was very firm  kit has not come back she said after a moment or two i waited until a fishing schooner returned from the african coast the lucia arrived this afternoon but her crew had not seen the cayman the next boat is not expected for some time and i saw i must come to you  mrs austin noted that betty had informed herself about the sailing of the fishing fleet she would sooner have sent the girl off but since she saw no way of doing so politely resolved to give her a lead  i wonder why you came to me  dont you know said betty who gave her a searching look for one thing when you persuaded mr jefferson to engage me you had an object you often have an object when people think you kind  then you imagine i am accountable for your getting the post  of course said betty with a touch of impatience kit told me about his giving you his mothers letter i rather forced him to tell me kit is trustful and he trusted you well i expect you knew that when he left liverpool he wanted me to marry him its plain you thought i might take him from your sister  perhaps i did so mrs austin admitted kits an attractive fellow and when i was young i fought for my lover in fact i fought pretty hard was it strange that i imagined you might take my line we are all human but perhaps you were proud and felt that kit must fight for you  betty agreed that mrs austins humanity was obvious in a way she was a great lady an acknowledged leader of fashionable people but she so to speak put off her dignity betty was a clerk but the other talked to her as if it were important that both were flesh and blood  you dont altogether understand betty rejoined at the beginning i did not want to keep kit away from your sister  at the beginning you imply you would have liked to keep him away afterwards  something like that said betty quietly i saw miss brown was not the girl for kit  mrs austin used some control for bettys frankness was embarrassing  yet you refused kit musgrave at liverpool  that is so said betty and the blood came to her skin im a clerk and not beautiful like miss brown i have no advantages and knew nothing but my business until mrs jefferson began to teach me kits pay was small i thought it might be long before he got more and our poverty would keep him down a young man who marries on very small pay is badly handicapped kit has some talent i thought if he was free and lucky he might go far well i saw i mustnt stop him and i let him go  mrs austin was moved betty like kit was naively sincere and her unselfishness was plain it looked as if she loved kit but her love was marked by something motherly and protective in spite of this however she was now sternly resolute  since you do not approve olivia you ought to have been satisfied when i helped kit to get a post on board a ship that was not often at las palmas like the correillo mrs austin remarked  i was not satisfied all your thought was for your sister you did not trust wolf but you saw kit trusted you and you let him run a risk so long as he was not at las palmas the risk did not matter wolf was the cheat you thought when hed done with kit he sold him and the others to the french captain  mrs austin was surprised that betty knew so much moreover she was beginning to get angry because the girls accusation was just  what do you know about wolfs selling them you did not see kit before he went off she rejoined  i did not said betty and coloured he saw miss brown and did not bother about me but mrs jefferson told me why he wanted the boat and i went to don erminios  she was quiet for a few moments and mrs austin saw her shot had reached its mark her mood changed and she was sorry for the girl betty had pluck and was very frank  but you did not know where to stop betty resumed and her eyes sparkled when kit wanted to go back you lent him the cayman you knew he was rash but this did not count you thought the moors might carry him off and you would get rid of him for good kit took the boat and thanked you perhaps its strange but he had not found you out  mrs austins face got red and to keep her selfcontrol cost her something she was however calm  perhaps i cant persuade you i am not as selfish as you think but you are not altogether just she said at the beginning i did send kit to wolf although i doubted the fellow but i did not know the risk he ran afterwards when kit wanted the cayman he had found me out  she stopped for a moment and smiled when she resumed in fact kit was very angry and his statements were like yours he declared i had planned to get rid of him if it is much comfort he will not trust me again well i did not want him at las palmas but i did want to help i liked kit i liked his honesty the young fellow is good stuff we will let this go i did not willingly let him take the cayman he was resolved to get the boat and kit is obstinate he talked about my plotting against him because he meant to force me to agree and when i saw his losing his men weighed on him i did agree that was all i had no object then but to see him out  betty was persuaded it looked as if she had exaggerated mrs austins unscrupulousness but this was not important she had come to fight for kit and the battle was not won  anyhow you are accountable she urged you let kit go and he has not come back perhaps hes wrecked and hiding on the coast perhaps the moors have carried him off we must find out you must send another boat  she stopped for austin came up the steps and leaned against a post looking about with a smile he noted that mrs austins colour was rather high betty was white and highly strung she was obviously embarrassed by his arrival but looked resolute  you want us to send another boat to africa miss jordan he remarked well on the whole i think we must try to indulge you if you will wait a few minutes i will go back with you and see jefferson about it  he went into the house and mrs austin went after him when he sat down at a writing table she stood opposite  were you long in the garden she asked  not long but perhaps long enough he replied i wanted to go round by the back but to pass through the kitchen might have excited the servants curiosity to feel i must steal into my house was rather ridiculous  mrs austin gave him a searching look then you know the situation its awkward and ill own my trust in my cleverness has received a nasty knock you see what i have done i liked kit and he thinks i cheated him i like betty and she hates me  perhaps miss jordan has some grounds for annoyance but i wouldnt exaggerate  i did want to keep kit from olivia mrs austin resumed now hes gone back shell think him a hero his going was rather fine to leave things alone would have been very much better  meddling is sometimes risky austin agreed on the other hand olivia is really not romantic and i imagine she is weighing young lockwoods advantages  after all olivias not very important and perhaps bettys argument was justified i am accountable for kits sailing on board cayman and its possible the moors have carried him off im not as hard as people think he must not get hurt  austin smiled soothingly exactly somebody must go to look for him and ill try to engage a fishing schooner the lucias fast well ill talk to jefferson  mrs austin put her hand on his arm youre a very good sort harry ive done some foolish things but you havent yet let me down     chapter vii  the lucia arrives   jefferson sitting under a lamp in his office smoked a cigarette and studied austin with quiet amusement he knew his partner rather well and thought him embarrassed in fact he thought harry had some grounds for embarrassment jacinta austin was clever and jefferson admitted he owed her much for one thing he might not have married muriel had not jacinta helped unfortunately however meddling was her habit and sometimes her clever plans made trouble jefferson thought she was sorry she had not left kit musgrave alone  i guess we had better send the lucia across he said when austin stopped cayman cost a pretty good sum and since she has not returned its possible she has driven ashore id expect the moors to get busy about a stranded vessel and on the south coast theyre not friends of ours  your arguments plausible jake austin remarked for all that i imagine you really dont want to let me down  jefferson smiled sometimes your imaginations pretty fierce were merchants and when youre up against a possible loss to spend a small sum in order to get your money back is a useful plan theres another thing the patron of the lucia knows all about catching baccalao but he stops there you wouldnt leave him to handle an awkward job and the moors are a treacherous lot then revillon may blow in you see where i lead  its obvious one of us ought to go and the job is mine  i think not you know the sea but youre a steamboat man im a sailor  austin had from the beginning seen that jefferson knew the part jacinta had played and knew he himself was accountable for his wife and meant to pay her debts jake however would not admit this and had taken another line he was a very good sort in fact he was the best anyhow he was a sailor and somebody must stop at las palmas  very well said austin don erminios house is shut and i understand his friends dont know where hes gone don ramon has no doubt sent him off sometimes the captain talks and i expect the commandancia folks are getting busy don ramon doesnt want any complications before his chief arrives well suppose you bring musgrave back  i reckon you can leave it to don arturo jefferson replied if musgrave has got the men the spaniards will be glad hes put across an awkward job political jealousies are pretty keen and they have no use for sending spanish soldiers outside spanish soil however if kit has put it across don arturo will soon fix up things with the commandante id back don arturo and his manager to bluff revillon  austin agreed and to agree was some relief cayman was his and jeffersons boat and he had thought kits using her might involve them in some trouble with the government officers nevertheless he must support jacinta and jake would support him  a few moments afterwards the door opened and betty came in jefferson got up as if he meant to fetch a chair but betty did not advance she stood by the door looking very slender straight and white her face was quiet and her mouth was firm but her hands moved nervously jefferson stood by his desk and waited his manner was the manner he would have used had a great lady come in and austin thought that after all betty owed jacinta much  are you going to send off a schooner in the morning she asked  its possible we were talking about it jefferson replied  you must send a boat said betty firmly  jefferson said nothing but looked at austin who knew he must be quiet  i dont know if im much use and perhaps im not betty resumed however if a boat does not sail im going back to liverpool she paused and added with a hint of strain i dont want to go  thank you said jefferson well i allow we want you to stop theres another thing i understand my partner kind of promised a boat would go sometimes hes rash but i feel ive got to see him out  for a moment betty turned her head but when she looked up again she was calm and businesslike  i am sorry i disturbed you she said if you think i took a line your clerk ought not to take i will give up my post however you are occupied with mr austin and we can talk about this again  she hesitated and the blood came to her skin i ought to have known you would not refuse i really did know but speeds important she added and went off  i reckon i ought not to have kept her in suspense jefferson remarked miss jordans modest but she has grit and grit like hers is fine muriel is fond of her and i think she is happy with us at liverpool her luck was pretty bad but if she couldnt bluff me she was going back well if kit musgrave  he stopped and austin understanding his embarrassment smiled olivia was his relation but he agreed that if kit for her sake let betty go he was a fool austin thought he saw what bettys staunchness cost the girl was proud but when she imagined kit was in danger she conquered her pride she knew jefferson knew something about kits infatuation and that her demand for help indicated that she loved him but she did not count this important austin thought that after all bettys sense of values was just  for a few minutes he and jefferson resumed their talk and then started for the port they found the lucias captain on board and before long all was ready for her departure in the morning  in the meantime kit and caymans crew were strenuously occupied after they had landed the ballast cable and all heavy stores they took careful soundings in the boat and marked the best line to the pool by bearings from the shore then when the moon was new and high water at about twelve oclock one hot morning they launched the boat for about two hours there would be water enough to float cayman across the highest sands but if she did not reach the pool before the tide ebbed much she would strike and stop for good since the ballast was landed sail could not be used and she must if possible be towed by the boat kit however doubted there was some wind and towing would be hard he thought they would soon be forced to kedge to carry out a small anchor and heave the vessel forward by the rope perhaps the worst was the sun was nearly overhead  the windlass clanked until the cable ran nearly straight up and down and kit jumped into the boat it was not his business but flesh and blood could not long bear the strain and all must work by turns for a minute or two they waited and he looked about the light on the sea was dazzling and one saw nothing but glittering lines of foam that marked the turmoil on the sands to tow cayman across the belt of broken water looked impossible but they must try since kedging is slow and time was short moreover the shoals beyond the pool to some extent broke the sea  the patron signalled they got out the oars and the boat went ahead she did not go far the tightening rope jerked her back under caymans bowsprit and when they pulled ahead again fouled the oars then the boat sheered off at an angle and they struggled savagely to get her in line cayman floated high above water exposing her side to the wind and the steep swell rolled her about her progress was not even she advanced by awkward leaps running up on the boat and a few moments afterwards dragging her back when her bows swung up kit saw her copper sparkle with reflections of green and gold but one did not see it long the bows went down the boat ran back and the plunging bowsprit was over his head he heard the others laboured breath and set his mouth and rowed  cayman was moving but her progress was horribly slow the mens bodies were tense with effort and the muscles on their arms swelled in knots their legs were braced like iron and the sweat glistened on their brown skin kit could not see properly and was conscious of a salt taste in his mouth in the desert his lips had cracked and he thought they bled perhaps he had torn them when he clenched his teeth the others rowed stubbornly but he knew they could not keep it up  they did not keep it up the tightening rope fouled the steering oar the boat was drawn back and when she struck caymans bow a man fell off his thwart  his oar went in the water and when it was recovered the patron signed them to come on board miguel and two or three more jumped down and kit leaned slackly against the bulwarks there was no shade the hold and cabin were unthinkably hot but he saw the short thin shadow the mainmast threw across the deck had moved this meant the sun had passed its highest point and the tide was ebbing he could not judge the progress they had made astern all was dazzling white and yellow foam and sand melted in a blaze of colour the patron stood on the steering gratings and his brows were knit he said nothing but kit thought he knew they could not tow her across  after a time the patron signalled a small anchor plunged the boat came alongside and kit helped a fresh crew to put the kedge anchor on board to carry it ahead was easier than towing but when they got back they must break out the other anchor and then heave cayman up to the kedge to heave by hand was fastest and for a few minutes the row of men singing hoarsely strained and swung then the singing stopped their bodies got upright and went no farther back the veins stood out on their brown foreheads but the rope would not come in they hung on tense and rigid unwilling to own that they were beaten  perhaps the wind had freshed for caymans plunges were sharper without her ballast she rolled and jumped ridiculously like a cork and now and then her heavy masts lengthened the swing until it looked as if she were rolling over there was not much sea but on the sands its movement was horizontal it rolled across the bottom and for the ketch to advance she must overcome its backward impulse  the men took the rope to the windlass and laboriously hove the levers up and down sometimes the drum would not turn and then the sharp clink of the pawls indicated that the rope came in when she was over the kedge all were exhausted but the anchor must be dropped to hold the ground they had won while the boat took the kedge another cables length ahead  when the mast was for a moment upright kit looked at the shadow and saw it had moved across another plank he doubted if they could get across the sand although the men were doing all men could do the strange thing was they held out in the scorching heat but if they did get across their labour would not be finished and kit owned he shrank from reloading the ballast when they landed the iron the sea carried the boat ashore when they brought it off she must be driven against the rollers moreover the work must be done with speed because the anchorage was unsafe cayman had driven ashore and if it blew hard might drive ashore again she could not without her ballast beat for open sea  somebody shouted and kit saw an object on the horizon it was like a sail but he was dull and his satisfaction was not keen the other boat would not arrive for some time and if they did not reach the pool before her the ebbing tide would strand them on the bank although help was perhaps coming it might come too late they must concentrate on getting across and trying to brace himself he jumped into the boat  the wind freshened and progress was slower but the heat did not get less kits head swam his arms were cramped and the backward swing with the oar badly hurt his side to heave at the windlass levers was worse and he did not bother about the sail time was going and he thought he felt caymans keel touch bottom perhaps the sand was uneven and she had crossed a hummock he laboured mechanically seeing nothing but the lever he pulled up and down all the same he knew the kedge warp came in because the pawls clinked if they stopped the men were beaten and cayman would soon strike kit did not know the depth of water the patron got but the sea was smoother and this indicated that the tide had sunk behind the shoals in fact kit thought he saw shining sand in the foam all must brace up for a last effort  the rope came in faster as if the resistance slackened and when the kedge was carried out the men left the windlass and walked aft along the deck with the rope somebody said there was good water under the keel the long pole the captain used for sounding hardly touched bottom and then did not touch  basta he shouted they made the rope fast and kit sat down on deck  a twomasted vessel came up the channel the sweep of her slanted green hull outlined by curling foam and her high shining canvas were beautiful but kit hardly glanced at her he was exhausted and leaning against the bulwarks he shut his eyes  soon afterwards jefferson jumped on board and stopped by kit kits skin was burned and crusted by salt and sand where the spray had dried his lips were cracked and his torn hands bled getting an anchor out of a plunging boat is awkward work  hallo said jefferson you look as if you had got up against it hard  kit opened his eyes and smiled i think we have had enough  jefferson nodded well put you on board lucia they have rigged an awning under the mainboom weve got some ice and pepe knows how to mix a long cool drink he turned to the patron if there is much sea next high water you cannot ride to the kedge i see you have landed the best anchor  the patron said he had done so and jefferson ordered his boat to the bow  let your men rest the lucias are fresh but what about miguel and juan the mate  they are in the forecastle getting up another warp  jefferson gave kit a smile you brought them back well talk about it again i must get the anchor while theres water across the sand and will put you on board lucia before i start  kit went on board and got into a hammock under the awning he thought jeffersons getting to work typical jeffersons habit was to work and talk afterwards now he had arrived kit was not going to bother his job was finished and things went smoothly when jefferson took control pepe brought him a cool drink and soon after he drained the glass he went to sleep     chapter viii  caymans return   don arturo and his party occupied a corner of the glassroofed patio at the metropole for the most part the tourists had gone when las palmas got hot and the big hotel was nearly empty but the cook and manager had given the partys ten oclock breakfast careful thought the companys cold stores were searched and the finest fruit in the island was ordered don arturos hospitality was famous at las palmas london and liverpool and people talk about the feasts he gave pioneers of colonial industry imperialist politicians and leaders of commerce met at the table  his guests at the metropole were a high civil officer don ramon austin and the commandante de marina the coffee and cigars carefully sealed in glass were brought from the caribbean coast in the companys steamers and grown for the presidents of south american republics the wine was made for the rulers of central europe as a rule don arturos hospitality was extravagant perhaps he found it paid for he himself was a plain business man and had known poverty yet although a merchant he was something of a prince when famous shipbuilders and financiers crowded his waitingroom he would stop to weigh a ships cooks complaint his humblest servant might appeal direct to him he gave all audience and his knowledge and justice were rather like haroun a raschids  now he looked thoughtful and gave austin a quiet glance to some extent wolf was your antagonist but i dont see why you took a part in my pursers african adventure  at the beginning i dont know that i did take a part austin said with a smile mr musgrave demanded my boat and since i was not at home my wife indulged him when i sent off the other vessel my object was mainly to get my money back  you imagine musgraves resolve to go was so to speak spontaneous  i dont think he was prompted losing his menin a sense they were your menweighed on him all the same if he brings them back i imagine his going was lucky  it is lucky the civil officer agreed the men are spaniards and we cannot leave them in the hands of the moors but to rescue them might be difficult expeditions to africa are not popular just now and to send a gunboat would embarrass the government  the commandante nodded one must reckon on the opposition newspapers and the catalan radicals are very keen fresh trouble about morocco would start an outcry if one could send a small party to negotiate it would be easier but this might be dangerous the moors are disturbed and threatening to land an armed force would mean fighting and the force must be strong besides the moors are cunning it is possible they have retired across our border  i understand the french captain has not lodged a formal complaint don arturo remarked  captain revillon is discreet said the civil officer had he seized your ship with the guns on board it would have been another thing  well i suppose you are satisfied that i was cheated you take it for granted that when my ship was chartered i did not know she would be used for smuggling  we know you and we know your manager the officer replied with a polite bow we doubted the man who chartered the ship but until she came back and he vanished we did not see his plan  on the surface his plan was obvious don arturo remarked rather dryly for a time he carried on a risky business and then when he saw the risks were greater than he thought resolved to get a quantity of goods without proper payment when he had got the goods and knew he must soon be found out he intrigued with the french and tried to get some money from them the ship was not his and i imagine the last lot of guns were worthless it looks plausible  yet you think this was not all the commandante suggested  i am a merchant not a politician don arturo rejoined i have got back my ship and am satisfied  you have some grounds for satisfaction the ship carried guns for rebels and señor musgrave was your servant as well as wolfs i think this was a mistake but don ramon has used much discretion and we do not doubt your honesty  in the meantime my purser and the spanish sailors have not returned what are you going to do about it  the commandante lighted a cigar you must use patience i think you see the situation is awkward and wolf is not a common cheat your manager knows much about our politics  i imagine wolfs object was not altogether to earn money by smuggling and robbing the moors don ramon agreed meaningly  the officer shrugged it is possible one cannot be altogether frank but there is some jealousy about the african coast and a country we know feels she is shut out well we will imagine a ship flying the spanish flag is seized by a foreign gunboat and french subjects are killed by the guns she landed perhaps spanish subjects are killed it is not important which then the ship is really british picture for yourself the complications when a dispute begins who knows where it will end  in spain we are oldfashioned and our justice is not british justice said the commandante whose face got very stern one is given some discretion if i could find señor wolf  for a few days we must wait the civil officer resumed perhaps the english sobrecargo and our sailors will return if they do not we must think but we will talk about something else  they talked for some time and then a messenger arrived and gave don ramon a note  it is from the office he remarked the signals on the isleta are going a schooner and a ketch come from the east  ah said austin with a smile i reckoned on something like this i think the situation has arranged itself  you mean the ketch is yours said don arturo  i expect she is the cayman and the other is the lucia it looks as if musgrave had got the men shall we cross the harbour and see the boats arrive  the others agreed for all were keen to get the news and soon afterwards they landed on the long mole which built of ponderous concrete blocks runs for some distance out to sea the morning was bright the tradebreeze fresh and outside the shelter of the isleta head big foamtipped combers rolled south shining spray blew about the mole and one felt the surges beat the massive blocks the echoes of the measured shocks rolled among the coal wharfs across the harbour  some distance off two sails broke the dazzling sweep of blue they slanted plunged and almost vanished but they got larger and at times when they crossed a combers top austin saw a dark line of hull he knew cayman no other boat about the islands carried a mizzen like hers moreover he thought he knew kit musgrave and since kit was coming back was persuaded he had brought the men he admitted that jacinta had used kit rather shabbily and he meant if possible to make some amends  what are you going to do about musgrave he asked don arturo  if he is willing he can stop with us are you interested in the young fellow  musgrave is rather a friend of ours and has some useful qualities austin replied for example he undertook a very awkward job because he felt he ought then its important that he has carried out the job one trusts a man like that and my business is growing  austin knew when to stop since he had indicated that he knew kits value and was willing to engage him he had perhaps gone far enough don arturo smiled  if musgrave has straightened out the tangle that bothers our spanish friends he deserves a reward however i must think about it and study the fellow sometimes to push on a young man fast is not an advantage  austin agreed and when they reached the end of the mole noted that betty occupied the last large block the spray tossed about her and her dress streamed in the wind she did not see austin her eyes were fixed upon the boats austin was not surprised that she was there when vessels approached the port the lookout on the isleta signalled to the town and clerks at the shipping office knew the flags advancing carefully he touched bettys arm  the smaller boat is cayman i expect kits on board  she turned and austin saw her look was strained you dont know yet unless the men are with him kit is not on board  i know jefferson said austin smiling he went to look for kit and the larger boats the lucia you see what this implies im using your argument  in the meantime a crowd had begun to gather men from the fishing vessels and women with black clothes and black shawls pushed towards the end of the mole some talked and gesticulated some were quiet and their dark faces were inscrutable like the moors all kept back a little from don arturos party and the commandante studied them with languid interest  if their friends do not arrive i think we shall have a demonstration he remarked to the civil officer we know don ramon is discreet and i gave the diario a useful hint but it looks as if the people knew the story we meant to keep dark  at las palmas nothing is long kept dark don ramon replied i have used some caution but one cannot stop don erminio talking it is frankly impossible  the officer shrugged he was a peninsular from madrid in a few minutes perhaps your islanders will curse the government and throw stones at us but a demonstration is not important and at barcelona they use bombs and knives  he stopped for the vessels were not far from the mole lucia led her high white canvas was sharply inclined and her hull listed until the foam leaped about her rail one saw her keen bows swing and cleave the frothy seas she was beautiful and strangely swift for there are no finer schooners than the canary coasting fleet three or four small figures began to run about her deck the big gafftopsail tilted fluttered and came down a jib was lowered and the ketch behind her forged ahead austin smiled and left the others for he was now altogether satisfied jefferson was on board jake was a chivalrous fellow  all has gone well he said to betty  but you cannot see the people yet its too far  we saw lucias topsail hauled down austin rejoined  bettys eyes sparkled you mean they want to let kit make the harbour first well thats like mr jefferson  jeffersons a good sort austin agreed anyhow i rather think kit deserves his triumph  cayman did not shorten sail her topmast bent to leeward her outer jib was wet and when she plunged her straining bowsprit sank into the sea ahead her deck was sharply slanted one saw her copper glimmer green and now and then a fathom of the metal swung out of the foam a tattered red and yellow flag hard like a board blew from her mizzen gaff she leaped across the white seas as if her patron felt he carried important news  the news was important on the mole people who did not know kit and jefferson waited with keen suspense they could not yet see the faces of the crew and tried to count the figures but the men moved about some got the anchor ready and some threw down coils of rope then listing to a gust that buried her lee rail cayman drove past the end of the mole and the crowd began to shout  ambos los veo they have brought them both  betty thrilled her heart beat and her eyes were wet she was moved by keen emotion and for a moment she had seen kit then cayman went about and he was hidden by the swinging canvas she came up to the wind again jibs and topsail ran down she stopped and the anchor splashed people shouted and pushed towards the landing steps  caymans boat was lowered betty saw kit macallister and some others jump on board the boat pulled for the steps and the crowd surged along the edge of the mole when the boat stopped hats were thrown up and betty knew in spain one throws ones hat to the maestro after a great exploit in the bullring hoarse shouts pierced the rumble of the sea  viva el yngles buen muchacho viva el señor jefferson     chapter ix  kits reward   on the morning after their arrival kit and macallister went to the metropole macallister wore a neat blue uniform a cap with the companys badge and spotless white deckshoes his talk was careless and now and then his eyes twinkled kits look was moody and he wore plain duck clothes he did not know if he was the companys servant and rather thought he was not don arturo had sent for him and he was probably going to be dismissed  when they went up the drive to the big square hotel macallister looked about  don arturos a great man but he has no much eye for beauty he remarked when his architect built the metropole his model was a block maybe the cube styles economical we get the maist room inside wi the least span o wall but if i was a spaniard id make a bomb and blow up the ugly thing  he stopped and putting his head on one side studied the hotel bulk has value if its properly relieved the old greeks kenned they used the square but they broke the line wi pillars and cornices maybe if ye worked in two three mouldings and ran a loggia along the front  i didnt know you were an architect kit said impatiently  ye dinna ken a old peters talents macallister rejoined with a grin architectures useful and man has done fine work in stone but for a pattern o lightness strength and beauty yell need to take a modern steel steamship she must bear strains and stresses ye dinna bother aboot on land a town hall for example is no designed for plunging through a steep head sea man wi a rule and a scriber id design ye a better building than yon hotel  kit frowned and pulled out his watch don arturo is waiting for us  just that he stated eleeven oclock there was no inquiry aboot my convenience maybe the head o a big steamship line likes to command and deck officers touch their hats and run but when ye send for an engineer ye use some manners  kit said nothing and started for the hotel he was not an engineer and at the liverpool shipping office had been drilled to prompt obedience the clerk however told him to wait and sent a page with macallister to a room above  you are some minutes late said don arturo indicating a chair  macallister noted that the open window commanded the front of the hotel in fact when he stopped to criticise its architecture he imagined his stopping might be remarked  three minutes sir he admitted pulling out a blackmetal watch on board a spanish ship breakfasts no very punctual  don arturo knew something about macallister moreover he knew his type sometimes one may bully a merchant captain but not a scots engineer  you left your ship without leave he said are you willing to state your grounds for breaking the companys and the british board of trades rules  to begin with the ship was spanish for the time macallister rejoined had there been work for me on board i might have stopped but the captain was sick and the office had no use for the boat then i reckoned mr musgrave might need me in africa in a sense his business was the companys  don arturo pondered it looked as if musgrave had staunch friends but this was not important he saw the engineer was not at all embarrassed  mr musgrave has pairs macallister resumed for a that hes young and had undertaken a verra awkward job i thought he needed a man o sound judgment in fact a man like me  so you stole away and went with him if this is an example i dont know that your judgment is very good but im curious about your adventures  macallister instinctively felt for his pipe don arturo glanced at the pipe and pushed across a cigar box the cigars were packed in glass but don arturo was a great merchant and sometimes indulged his humour it was plain the other rather thought himself his guest than a servant who deserved a reprimand  thank you said macallister coolly weel if yell no be bored  he narrated his journey up the wady and the encounter with the moors but gave kit the leading part macallister had some talent for storytelling and used no reserve when he talked about their interview with the chief don arturo stopped him  your carelessness with the pistol might have cost your party much he said  macallister smiled it might have cost the headman mair  thats obvious said don arturo with a touch of impatience but suppose the bullet had struck him you dont imagine his people would have let you go  its no altogether obvious until ye understand when she exploded i put my finger on the magazine there was another cartridge had the headman moved when i went up til him he didna move he was wooden im thinking he kenned the magazine wasna empty  but you gave him the pistol  just that said macallister maybe the experiment was rash but i was justified yon moor was proud and his nerve was good  don arturo thought the engineers was better and allowing for the strain his judgment was strangely quick and accurate he did not doubt the tale he knew much about his servants and when some boiler tubes had burst  for all that i dont see how you persuaded him to release the men he said  mr musgrave persuaded him his argument was good though it wasna altogether his argument but himself the lads honesty was plain the moor couldna doubt him although he might ha doubted you or me  sometimes frankness pays don arturo remarked with a twinkle what argument did musgrave use  his master had gone naebody would ransom us and the ithers and we had naething worth the stealing it carried weight but no a the weight the moor was a robber but in the desert he was a kin of prince and a prince cannot be shabby mr musgrave wi two three ragged sailors and a very old gun had come seeking him the thing was a joke but i reckon the moor saw the joke was fine he was a proud man and he let the sailors go  don arturo mused he was not romantic but like the moor he was sometimes generous he pictured the little drama in the sands the english lads naïve honesty and the dark moors reserve the tale was moving and he was forced to approve the part his servants had played but other business waited  well he said you have talked about musgrave but i dont know that you have yet justified your leaving your ship  i dinna ken i tried macallister rejoined when im wanting it i can get anither post but i doubt if ye could get an engineer like me  its possible i could not don arturo admitted with some dryness well if you can satisfy don ramon you may go back on board and now you might send up mr musgrave  macallister went off smiling but when kit entered he was highly strung since he expected to be told he must give up his post he looked worn for fatigue and strain had left their mark don arturo looked very businesslike and his watch was on the table  mr macallister has given me some particulars about your exploits and i have not much to ask he said to begin with when the french gunboat chased you why did you resolve to land the guns  i dont altogether know sir kit replied it was plain wolfs agent had sold us and it looked as if he had cheated the moors they had paid for goods they would not get and although yusuf made the bargain in a sense they dealt with me  you felt your business was to deliver the goods  something like that sir kit said awkwardly then since wolf had engaged to land the guns i thought we could best baffle him by carrying out his engagement  don arturo saw the ironical justice that marked kits counterplot but he said dryly i expect you knew you risked my ship  i knew this afterwards when the gunboat steamed up i couldnt weigh the risk i didnt know how much captain revillon knew and if he could seize the ship had we thrown the guns overboard it was obvious he could not seize her if we crossed the shoals the water was not deep enough for him  well let it go why did you return for the men  i thought the job was mine sir i was the companys servant and the captain was injured if id told my story at the office and the commandancia but you can see the obstacles  don arturo nodded i imagine i do see you thought you could handle the thing better than don ramon and the spanish officers rather a bold claim was it not  theyd have been embarrassed by difficulties that did not bother me kit replied with some hesitation i thought speed and quietness important the plan was to steal off and get to work  he had stood in front of the table but don arturo now indicated a chair  on the whole i think your plan was good all the same if you stop with us you must run no more risks like that your business is to carry out the companys orders  kits heart beat for his relief was keen then i may go back sir  you will not go back on board the correillo but don ramon is sending mossamedes to cuba and has a post for you at sea your duties will be a pursers at the cuban ports you will be the companys agent all the cargo is not sold and you will negotiate with the merchants the post carries better pay but don ramon will give you particulars i believe mr macallister will join the ship and the correillos captain takes command  kit had not thought don arturo meant to promote him and the blood came to his skin  thank you sir he said ill try  don arturo smiled and looked at his watch  if you carry out your new duties with the resolution and honesty that marked your dealings with the moors i expect we shall be satisfied in the meantime they want you at the office  kit started for the office he was promoted and although his promotion was perhaps not marked he thought the head of the line had studied him and meant to help his progress moreover his supposition was accurate  soon after kit had gone a page brought up austin and don arturo remarked i have just given musgrave rather a better post  then i expect he will make good if he had joined me id have given him the best post id got  musgraves friends believe in him don arturo replied but we must remember that caution is sometimes useful and the lad is young i would sooner his promotion was gradual but we have something else to talk about  in the meantime kit went to the office and afterwards to a bench in the alameda his post was better than he had thought and he felt he had so to speak made a start if he satisfied the company he might go ahead fast and this was important because it was bound up with something else since he saw olivia he had pondered and now he reviewed his efforts and ambitions it was getting plain that when he fell in love with olivia and tried to force himself above his proper level he was rash she had refused him and from her point of view she was justified but in a sense his proposal was not regular and he had declared if his fortunes mended he would renew it in proper form he owed olivia this the strange thing was he was rather conscious of his duty than keen  to begin with he must see mrs austin since he now meant to keep the rules she was at home and when she received him he said you know we got the men and i must thank you for lending me cayman and sending the schooner if she had not arrived i doubt if we could have brought cayman home  oh well said mrs austin to find you have forgiven me is some relief but after all i dont deserve your thanks you see miss jordan sent the other boat  betty sent the lucia kit exclaimed  she bullied me and declared i had not used you well while we talked about it my husband arrived and rather agreed with bettys argument nevertheless i imagine she doubted us because soon afterwards she bullied jefferson she stated that if he did not go to your rescue she would give up her post  kit coloured and mrs austin was amused by his embarrassment  perhaps i did not use you well she resumed  from the beginning you were very kind kit broke out when i last saw you i talked like a hottempered fool i didnt see all i owed you i meant to force you to lend me the boat the strange thing is i hadnt thought about betty but it was really she who helped betty is like that  he was quiet for a moment or two but mrs austin waited and he went on well i have done what i undertook and don arturo has given me a better post perhaps the post is not very good but i am going to ask olivia if when i have made some progress she will marry me  do you expect me to approve or do you feel i ought to know your plans mrs austin asked  i think i want to be honest kit replied rather dryly  mrs austin smiled your honesty is obvious well i dont know that i would approve but if you can persuade olivia ill try to be resigned  you dont expect i can persuade her  perhaps i dont do you  i do not said kit for all that im going to use some effort  you are an obstinate fellow mrs austin rejoined however you will understand my not wishing you good luck in fact i rather think you dont know your luck  kit went off he was puzzled sometimes mrs austins remarks did puzzle him but he began to see a light but the light was dim full illumination had not yet come     chapter x  olivias refusal   after the five oclock comida kit went to jeffersons office there was no use in returning to mrs austins because it was an evening she received her friends and olivia would be surrounded by the guests besides he wanted to see betty he had not seen her yet for when he went to the office she was occupied with jefferson and he did not know she had watched his arrival from the mole  the room behind the arch was shady a little cool breeze shook the curtain and one smelt heliotrope kit noted the smooth polished floor the even rows of black boxes and the neatlysorted documents on the big writing table tidiness is not the rule in spain but all was neat where betty was about betty herself wore a plain white dress and kit thought she looked cool and businesslike turning her revolving chair she gave him her hand with a friendly smile  i was very glad to know you had got back she said  if you had not sent jefferson we might not have got back yet  i expect you have seen mrs austin but you mustnt exaggerate betty said calmly when you forced her to lend you cayman she knew she was doing what she ought  i imagined i forced her now i doubt she is kind and it looks as if im not as clever as i thought anyhow i didnt force her to send the other boat if force was needed you did that when the lucia arrived we were worn out but all the ballast must be brought off through the surf it had been calm unusually long we knew the wind would soon come and if it blew fresh before we got the big anchor on board cayman would be wrecked i hardly durst think about the job  you had a bad time kit  perhaps i got as good a time as i deserved when i arrived from liverpool i was very raw but didnt know my rawness people indulged me and i went ahead satisfied i could pull off all i undertook i didnt know i was used and cheated no doubt wolf and yusuf laughed theyd got a dull selfconfident simpleton to play their crooked game well in a way perhaps it was lucky i lost the men i began to see my level  betty mused she rather liked kits humiliation perhaps it was extravagant for his rash return to africa was very fine although his venture looked hopeless he had gone the strange thing was when at length he saw wolf had cheated him he did not see another had done so betty wanted to warn him but knew she must not  you were sincere and nothing you did was shabby she said perhaps your luck was bad but this is not important you didnt think about yourself you were not daunted  i was daunted kit declared when i landed from cayman and started for the desert with three or four sailors i wanted to run back to the boats you see the thing was ridiculous all my fine romantic plans had led to this however well let it go youre staunch and you helped me out now when im hipped and moody you let me talk i doubt if you know what a very good sort you are  betty gave him a level glance she was moved and calm was rather hard but calm was plainly indicated  come in again when im not engaged because i must send you off she said jefferson goes to orotava with mrs jefferson in the morning and some accounts must be made up before he starts she paused and added i think mrs austin and miss brown mean to join mrs jefferson  kit went off it was strange but bettys news was something of a relief after all if he did not see olivia in the morning he need not for some time resign himself to her refusal she would no doubt refuse him and he wondered whether his shrinking from the jolt accounted for his moodiness perhaps the moodiness was not logical but he was moody it would have been much better had betty not refused him at liverpool betty was his sort and had she loved him he would not have been carried away by olivia of course betty was justified she knew his drawbacks but from olivias point of view he had others but in spite of this after his rash talk in the alameda he must ask her to marry him mrs austin knew he was going to do so and she had smiled  in the morning he was forced to go to the office and when don ramon sent him off he saw the correillo start for teneriffe a clerk told him mrs austin and miss brown were on board but a few days afterwards kit thought his luck was good mossamedes cargo arrived slowly and don ramon resolved to send a schooner to orotava for a load kit got leave to go and one evening landed on the lava mole  the evening was calm and light mist floated about the shoulders of the peak the long swell broke in sheets of foam but its beat was slow and languid echoes rolled about the valley one smelt oleanders and orange flowers when kit went up the path to the hotel his look was thoughtful he wondered whether mrs austin had an object for leaving las palmas but he was going to see olivia to know he was refused was better than suspense anyhow he must ask her in proper form and she must decide if she would not frankly acknowledge him her lover she must let him go  his luck held good for he found her on a bench behind a tall geranium hedge olivia wore a black evening dress with yellow bands and in the background the red geraniums shone kit knew she liked colour but somehow he was jarred olivia was strangely beautiful one could not see her a poor mans wife  she looked up and a touch of red came to her skin kit thought her surprised and perhaps a little startled but this was all he himself was very sober and looked rather grim  kit she said when did you arrive  i landed not long since from a schooner the company sent me to buy onions  olivia laughed you are dreadfully unromantic but perhaps you thought you had better state your object have you bought the onions  not yet i wanted to see you first sometimes i am romantic it might be better if i were not  well perhaps romance cheats one now and then olivia rejoined smiling but we wont philosophise if you had arrived two or three minutes since you would have seen jacinta  i saw mrs austin the afternoon before you sailed said kit i told her i was going to ask if you would marry me  olivia turned rather quickly and gave him a level glance oh well i knew your pluck but what did jacinta remark  she laughed kit replied with some dryness nevertheless she declared if you were willing  jacinta is not often rash i expect you doubted my willingness but after your extravagant talk in the alameda you felt you ought to ask  kit coloured but his mouth was rather hard and his look was steady i did feel something like that in the alameda you were amused and your amusement hurt i was carried away but i wanted you well i said if i brought back the men and got another post i did bring back the men and have got a better post  olivia stopped him but her look was gentler your venture was very fine kit i was proud of you and if anything could have moved me but im not your sort  you are the most beautiful girl i have known kit declared  yet youre a puritan and ought to know beauty isnt all i think you really do know well i wont marry you kit we would risk too much people think me romantic but im not in fact im cold and very practical it looks as if we had changed parts and you were the sentimentalist  i loved you kit said quietly  i know olivia admitted it counted for much perhaps i liked you to love me i own im selfish but your poverty wasnt altogether the drawback youre sober and quiet im theatrical i like the middle of the stage i want colour movement and the leading part its plain that we would jar  kit frowned he saw olivia was firm and saw rather vaguely that her firmness was wise in a sense she was theatrical red geraniums oleanders and scented orange flowers were her proper background olivia belonged to the south perhaps it was strange but he pictured betty in her neat cool office betty wore white clothes sometimes with a touch of the soft virgin blue she stood for the reserve and staunchness of the bracing north but he had asked olivia to marry him  if you were persuaded we would jar he said and stopped  olivia smiled but her smile was kind you are trying to be nice but you want to know why i let you go on well you were a new type you were fresh and sincere and sometimes very obstinate the others indulged me you did not you had qualities i liked perhaps because they were not mine then romance called and sometimes i began to think i might take the plunge but i hesitated i valued all i must give up and i have not your pluck  she paused and gave kit a quiet glance well im sorry but you ought to be grateful i was not rash although youre a very good sort you are not my sort i could not use your rules and you would not use mine you must let me go and marry somebody brave and honest  she got up and kit heard steps on the path  some of the people from the hotel she said will you come and see jacinta  i think not kit replied and forced a smile my business is to buy onions and i must get to work  olivia gave him her hand perhaps i was shabby in all you do i wish you good luck  she went to meet the others and kit went down the path he was hurt but he had braced himself beforehand and the hurt was less than he had thought moreover he knew olivias arguments were good he loaded the schooner and soon after he returned to las palmas jefferson came to look for him on board mossamedes  if youre not altogether satisfied with the post don arturo gave you another could be got he said a spanish company is going to run two or three small fast boats to the islands and wants an agent ive been asked to find out if you would undertake the duties  im not a spaniard kit replied why do they offer me the job  i rather think it is a reward in spain government approval pays and perhaps the new company got a hint its possible the las palmas officials feel they owe you something but cant openly acknowledge your services however id better state the duties and pay  when kit knew the pay he lighted a cigarette and pondered then he said the offers good but i cant take the post for one thing ive engaged to go to cuba for don arturo  the office would release you  i think that is so kit agreed all the same i undertook the job and theres another thing im young and begin to see im rawer than i thought in fact ive begun to know my proper level and where i really belong not long since i got a nasty knock and for a time im going slow perhaps i may go higher but when my chance comes i mean to be fit for the better job  jefferson nodded on the whole i reckon your plan is good and well let the agency offer go he paused and resumed you were across at teneriffe did you make orotava  i did said kit with a smile i saw miss brown and asked her to marry me she would not but now i can think about it calmly i see she took a very proper line  jefferson said nothing and soon afterwards went to his boat for all that he approved kits philosophy musgrave could take a knock and was good stuff jefferson thought the head of the line knew his value and kit would presently find his sticking to the post he took would pay     chapter xi  daybreak   mossamedes sailed from cuba for buenos ayres and on the ocean voyage kit enjoyed more leisure than he had known for long when the sea was calm and the ship steamed steadily across the shining swell he lounged under the awnings and gave himself to thought perhaps it was strange but he began to see that at las palmas he had hardly thought at all events so to speak had followed each other fast he had let himself go and was carried along  now he could ponder quietly he sometimes frowned he had not done much that he had meant to do and had no grounds for satisfaction but when he thought about olivia he was calm olivia did not belong to his circle and he now admitted that he could not enter hers even if he became rich the thing was impossible she liked and in fact demanded excitement power and a leading part he liked to go soberly and do something useful when she refused him she took the proper line and he owed her and mrs austin much they had given him a wider view and helped him to conquer his aggressive priggishness then perhaps he had captured something of their cultivation anyhow they had taught him to tolerate people who jarred  for the most part however his thoughts dwelt on betty betty in the primrose wood and in the shady office with the blue curtains betty was sober and quiet when one was with her ones mean ambitions vanished yet she was hopeful and never daunted she looked ahead with steady eyes and held fast to all she knew was good like olivia she had refused him but while he was resigned to olivias refusal he knew he was a fool to let betty go sometimes he wondered and then got up impatiently and went off to study his manifests there was no use in brooding and he durst not look forward yet in the meantime his job was to see all was ready for unloading cargo when mossamedes reached port  at buenos ayres he and don erminio stopped one hot afternoon in front of an italian café in a quiet square small tables occupied the pavement in the shade and don erminio ordering wine and ice and aerated waters mixed them in a bowl  it is not like tinto granadilla and snow from the peak when one has eaten much salt fish he said however to a seaman all wine is good and if don pedro were with us we would dance but let us be happy and if i go to sleep you will carry me on board  kit was satisfied macallister had not joined them he was strenuously occupied scaling the boilers and when kit left mossamedes strange bilingual threats and exclamations echoed about her stokehold by and by don erminio began to glance about  vaya he said look at him now perhaps we can amuse ourselves i will talk to the animal  he got up and carrying the bowl of wine crossed the pavement a man in white clothes occupied a chair at another table and when he looked up kit saw it was captain revillon kit had noted a small french cruiser at anchor in the roads  ola señor all sailors are friends said don erminio besides this bowl is large and my companion is sober and very dull the wine is not spanish but it will go and when i drink your wormwood in the morning my throat is bad  revillon bowed and let him fill his glass and don erminio resumed in uncouth french we took you my friend that time on the morocco coast  it looks like that revillon replied with a touch of dryness still i do not see why you risked crossing the shoals you had no doubt thrown the guns overboard  don erminio indicated kit who had joined him he is a boy but very obstinate the english are obstinate and the scots are worse me i know well his bargain was to land the guns and they were landed  then i think you did take me revillon remarked with a quick surprised glance had i known  kit was intrigued he had sometimes wondered why revillon had not looked for mossamedes in the morning the coast was dangerous and the gale was fresh but he had thought this did not account for all  the animal who loaded the ship sold us said don erminio if you paid him you did not get much for your money  revillon drained his glass and smiled your betrayer did not demand a large reward perhaps he expected to be paid in another way however now it is done with i may tell you something to begin with i did not trust señor wolf although i knew the guns were on board and must not be landed to force you to throw them overboard would satisfy me  was it not your duty to stop and search our ship kit asked  in a sense it was so in fact i think the man who sold you expected me to seize her revillon agreed with some dryness well i followed you and steered a course that would pin you against the shoals i had studied the chart and pilot book and nothing indicated that a vessel could get across he paused and shrugged well what would you have i imagined the guns were overboard and you had run aground my duty was not to wreck my ship i hauled off the coast  they have given you a larger vessel don erminio remarked meaningly i wish you luck all sailors are honest but not many are discreet the politicians are animals and i would drown the lot well it is not important now and the wine is gone  kit began to understand revillon had not been cheated he was not very keen about seizing mossamedes it looked as if wolf had engaged in dark political intrigue and meant to use the french officer in his plot revillon however had seen his object but the thing was done with and kit went off to the office of a merchant who was loading mossamedes with grain  when her cargo was on board she sailed for teneriffe and anchored at santa cruz to land a few bargeloads kit going to the agents in the evening met jefferson in the plaza  mrs jefferson and miss jordan are at the golden pine he said they went to laguna for a holiday and i came over to bring them back will you walk up to the hotel with me  kit wanted to go but said he could not mossamedes would start for las palmas when they had landed another load of maize santa cruz sheltered by the volcanic range that cuts off the tradebreeze was very hot and he asked why mrs jefferson had left laguna which occupies a cool tableland behind the town  we meant to go back on board campeador this morning jefferson replied the company however have altered the sailing bill and don maccario doesnt expect the boat to arrive for some days  if mrs jefferson can get ready soon well take you across said kit we ought to make las palmas about daybreak and can give you good rooms on deck  jefferson agreed and an hour afterwards his party arrived kits boat was waiting at the mole and when they got on board mossamedes went to sea for some time kit was occupied with his dispatch box but as soon as he had sorted his manifests he went on deck  there was no moon the sea was phosphorescent and the wind was light mossamedes rolled languidly and the foam that ran back from her bows sparkled green and gold mrs jefferson jefferson and don erminio occupied canvas chairs on the upper deck but at first kit could not find betty then he saw a white dress in the gloom by a boat and heard macallisters voice kit turned back and betty laughed he thought her laugh had a note of protest and wondered what macallister had said  you must really stop betty exclaimed  macallisters reply was not distinct but kit heard part weel its for your ain good maybe ye might get better but ye might get waur  im going said betty firmly and light steps indicated that she left the boat  kit meeting her across the deck thought her embarrassed and when they joined the others she did not talk much he however was satisfied to sit on the deck and smoke knowing betty was about after a time macallister returned and leaned against the rails he chuckled and kit noted that betty did not look up  were a humorous lot though a o us dinna see the joke he said noo im getting old i look on and laugh when ye meddle ye get no thanks for a that philosophy is sometimes hard ye meet folks who dinna ken their luck  its possible but i dont see where your remarks lead mrs jefferson rejoined and turned to the captain do you see  i am a sailor said don erminio sailors are not philosophers they are honest people and some are fools if they were not fools they would not go to sea but perhaps it is better to be a fool than an animal like the men who own the ships  mrs jefferson laughed and they talked about something else until she got up and glanced at betty who went with her to her room by the bridge when the others went off kit stopped and smoked betty had kept close to mrs jefferson it looked as if she did not mean to be left alone with him  at daybreak he went on deck there was not much wind and mossamedes went steadily through the dim blue water her mastheads swung but one felt no motion the engines throbbed with an even rhythm to starboard dark rocks pierced a bank of mist ahead a thicker bank indicated the isleta hill and kit looked at his watch it was six oclock in half an hour mossamedes would steam into the harbour and his chance of talking to betty would be gone  kit wanted to talk to betty but was daunted on the ocean voyage he had seen a light perhaps it was strange but he knew now the light had begun to burn one april day in the primrose wood and then for a time he had lost it because olivia had dazzled him betty knew he thought she knew all his follies but she was kind  coming down from the bridge he saw her by the rail her look was thoughtful her brows were knit and putting her hand on a stanchion she fixed her eyes ahead  the mist was thinner and the sky above it began to gleam like an opal soon the haze would roll back and the sun leap up kit advanced quietly but betty turned as if she knew his step somehow kit knew she had been thinking about him a touch of colour came to his skin and his heart beat but he was calm when one talked to betty one was not moved by strange disturbing thrills she did not dazzle one her light was clear and steady and kit knew it had after all been his guide  betty he said why did you refuse me at liverpool  she gave him a quick glance and for a moment turned her head when she looked up her colour was rather high  we were very young kit  you mean i was very young and rashly confident you dont think about yourself it was for my sake you let me go  arent you taking something for granted  i think not said kit im dull but sometimes i do understand and i now see all i lost you wanted me to have my chance you thought to be tied to you might keep me back yet i believe you loved me lets be frank  suppose i did love you said betty with a blush although her voice was quiet  to begin with you know how i used my freedom you know my ridiculous ambitions  you mean you were ridiculous when you fell in love with olivia brown  yes said kit anyhow it was ridiculous for me to imagine i could marry her  betty gave him a keen glance for she was human she liked kits staunchness but nevertheless sometimes it jarred  nevertheless you did not feel you were ridiculous when you thought you could marry me  i was a fool my wanting you was all the sense i had the strange thing was from the beginning you were my guide and i tried to use your rules when i lost the men in africa i went back to look for them because i felt you would have me go i was accountable the job was mine but i would not have known this had i not known you it was like that before and afterwards  betty was moved but she thought kit was not altogether just to himself his honesty was instinctive and he paid his debts  but thats not all he resumed at liverpool you sometimes puzzled me you saw and followed a light i did not once when i talked about climbing above the crowd you said perhaps one need not climb one ought to stop at ones proper level and try to make things better well when the spaniards offered me a good post i remembered id had enough of shabby ambitions and knew my level in fact so to speak the light was breaking  he was quiet for a few moments and looked about knitting his brows the surf was louder the sky was red and the mists glimmered as if a glow shone through betty waited and said nothing she had waited long but kit had returned to her  i was a fool he broke out but you know all dear and are very kind somehow i think you will take me back  betty gave him a gentle smile it looks as if i had never quite let you go  kit took her in his arms and when he looked up a warm beam touched them and moved across the deck the mists were rolling back day had broken and all ahead was bright
