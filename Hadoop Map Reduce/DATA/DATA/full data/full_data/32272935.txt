are now in the course of publication and many thoughts unpublished are going on in every reflective head is justly regarded as one of the most ominous and withal one of the strangest ever seen in this world england is full of wealth of multifarious produce supply for human want in every kind yet england is dying of inanition with unabated bounty the land of england blooms and grows waving with yellow harvests thickstudded with workshops industrial implements with fifteen millions of workers understood to be the strongest the cunningest and the willingest our earth ever had these men are here the work they have done the fruit they have realised is here abundant exuberant on every hand of us and behold some baleful fiat as of enchantment has gone forth saying touch it not ye workers ye masterworkers ye masteridlers none of you can touch it no man of you shall be the better for it this is enchanted fruit on the poor workers such fiat falls first in its rudest shape but on the rich masterworkers too it falls neither can the rich masteridlers nor any richest or highest man escape but all are like to be brought low with it and made poor enough in the money sense or a far fataler one  of these successful skilful workers some two millions it is now counted sit in workhouses poorlaw prisons or have outdoor relief flung over the wall to themthe workhouse bastille being filled to bursting and the strong poorlaw broken asunder by a stronger1 they sit there these many months now their hope of deliverance as yet small in workhouses pleasantly sonamed because work cannot be done in them twelvehundredthousand workers in england alone their cunning righthand lamed lying idle in their sorrowful bosom their hopes outlooks share of this fair world shutin by narrow walls they sit there pent up as in a kind of horrid enchantment glad to be imprisoned and enchanted that they may not perish starved the picturesque tourist in a sunny autumn day through this bounteous realm of england descries the union workhouse on his path passing by the workhouse of st ives in huntingdonshire on a bright day last autumn says the picturesque tourist i saw sitting on wooden benches in front of their bastille and within their ringwall and its railings some halfhundred or more of these men tall robust figures young mostly or of middle age of honest countenance many of them thoughtful and even intelligentlooking men they sat there near by one another but in a kind of torpor especially in a silence which was very striking in silence for alas what word was to be said an earth all lying round crying come and till me come and reap meyet we here sit enchanted in the eyes and brows of these men hung the gloomiest expression not of anger but of grief and shame and manifold inarticulate distress and weariness they returned my glance with a glance that seemed to say do not look at us we sit enchanted here we know not why the sun shines and the earth calls and by the governing powers and impotences of this england we are forbidden to obey it is impossible they tell us there was something that reminded me of dantes hell in the look of all this and i rode swiftly away  so many hundred thousands sit in workhouses and other hundred thousands have not yet got even workhouses and in thrifty scotland itself in glasgow or edinburgh city in their dark lanes hidden from all but the eye of god and of rare benevolence the minister of god there are scenes of woe and destitution and desolation such as one may hope the sun never saw before in the most barbarous regions where men dwelt competent witnesses the brave and humane dr alison who speaks what he knows whose noble healing art in his charitable hands becomes once more a truly sacred one report these things for us these things are not of this year or of last year have no reference to our present state of commercial stagnation but only to the common state not in sharp feverfits but in chronic gangrene of this kind is scotland suffering a poorlaw any and every poorlaw it may be observed is but a temporary measure an anodyne not a remedy rich and poor when once the naked facts of their condition have come into collision cannot long subsist together on a mere poorlaw true enoughand yet human beings cannot be left to die scotland too till something better come must have a poorlaw if scotland is not to be a byword among the nations o what a waste is there of noble and thricenoble national virtues peasant stoicisms heroisms valiant manful habits soul of a nations worthwhich all the metal of potosi cannot purchase back to which the metal of potosi and all you can buy with it is dross and dust  why dwell on this aspect of the matter it is too indisputable not doubtful now to any one descend where you will into the lower class in town or country by what avenue you will by factory inquiries agricultural inquiries by revenue returns by mininglabourer committees by opening your own eyes and looking the same sorrowful result discloses itself you have to admit that the working body of this rich english nation has sunk or is fast sinking into a state to which all sides of it considered there was literally never any parallel at stockport assizesand this too has no reference to the present state of trade being of date prior to thata mother and a father are arraigned and found guilty of poisoning three of their children to defraud a burialsociety of some 3l 8s due on the death of each child they are arraigned found guilty and the official authorities it is whispered hint that perhaps the case is not solitary that perhaps you had better not probe farther into that department of things this is in the autumn of 1841 the crime itself is of the previous year or season brutal savages degraded irish mutters the idle reader of newspapers hardly lingering on this incident yet it is an incident worth lingering on the depravity savagery and degraded irishism being never so well admitted in the british land a human mother and father of white skin and professing the christian religion had done this thing they with their irishism and necessity and savagery had been driven to do it such instances are like the highest mountain apex emerged into view under which lies a whole mountain region and land not yet emerged a human mother and father had said to themselves what shall we do to escape starvation we are deep sunk here in our dark cellar and help is faryes in the ugolino hungertower stern things happen bestloved little gaddo fallen dead on his fathers kneesthe stockport mother and father think and hint our poor little starveling tom who cries all day for victuals who will see only evil and not good in this world if he were out of misery at once he well dead and the rest of us perhaps kept alive it is thought and hinted at last it is done and now tom being killed and all spent and eaten is it poor little starveling jack that must go or poor little starveling willwhat a committee of ways and means  in starved sieged cities in the uttermost doomed ruin of old jerusalem fallen under the wrath of god it was prophesied and said the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children the stern hebrew imagination could conceive no blacker gulf of wretchedness that was the ultimatum of degraded godpunished man and we here in modern england exuberant with supply of all kinds besieged by nothing if it be not by invisible enchantments are we reaching thathow come these things wherefore are they wherefore should they be                                       nor are they of the st ives workhouses of the glasgow lanes and stockport cellars the only unblessed among us this successful industry of england with its plethoric wealth has as yet made nobody rich it is an enchanted wealth and belongs yet to nobody we might ask which of us has it enriched we can spend thousands where we once spent hundreds but can purchase nothing good with them in poor and rich instead of noble thrift and plenty there is idle luxury alternating with mean scarcity and inability we have sumptuous garnitures for our life but have forgotten to live in the middle of them it is an enchanted wealth no man of us can yet touch it the class of men who feel that they are truly better off by means of it let them give us their name  many men eat finer cookery drink dearer liquorswith what advantage they can report and their doctors can but in the heart of them if we go out of the dyspeptic stomach what increase of blessedness is there are they better beautifuler stronger braver are they even what they call happier do they look with satisfaction on more things and human faces in this godsearth do more things and human faces look with satisfaction on them not so human faces gloom discordantly disloyally on one another things if it be not mere cotton and iron things are growing disobedient to man the master worker is enchanted for the present like his workhouse workman clamours in vain hitherto for a very simple sort of liberty the liberty to buy where he finds it cheapest to sell where he finds it dearest with guineas jingling in every pocket he was no whit richer but now the very guineas threatening to vanish he feels that he is poor indeed poor master worker and the master unworker is not he in a still fataler situation pausing amid his gamepreserves with awful eyeas he well may coercing fiftypound tenants coercing bribing cajoling doing what he likes with his own his mouth full of loud futilities and arguments to prove the excellence of his cornlaw and in his heart the blackest misgiving a desperate halfconsciousness that his excellent cornlaw is indefensible that his loud arguments for it are of a kind to strike men too literally dumb  to whom then is this wealth of england wealth who is it that it blesses makes happier wiser beautifuler in any way better who has got hold of it to make it fetch and carry for him like a true servant not like a false mockservant to do him any real service whatsoever as yet no one we have more riches than any nation ever had before we have less good of them than any nation ever had before our successful industry is hitherto unsuccessful a strange success if we stop here in the midst of plethoric plenty the people perish with gold walls and full barns no man feels himself safe or satisfied workers master workers unworkers all men come to a pause stand fixed and cannot farther fatal paralysis spreading inwards from the extremities in st ives workhouses in stockport cellars through all limbs as if towards the heart itself have we actually got enchanted then accursed by some god                                       midas longed for gold and insulted the olympians he got gold so that whatsoever he touched became goldand he with his long ears was little the better for it midas had misjudged the celestial musictones midas had insulted apollo and the gods the gods gave him his wish and a pair of long ears which also were a good appendage to it what a truth in these old fables  footnotes  1 the return of paupers for england and wales at ladyday 1842 is indoor 221687 outdoor 1207402 total 1429089 official report     chapter ii  the sphinx   how true for example is that other old fable of the sphinx who sat by the wayside propounding her riddle to the passengers which if they could not answer she destroyed them such a sphinx is this life of ours to all men and societies of men nature like the sphinx is of womanly celestial loveliness and tenderness the face and bosom of a goddess but ending in claws and the body of a lioness there is in her a celestial beautywhich means celestial order pliancy to wisdom but there is also a darkness a ferocity fatality which are infernal she is a goddess but one not yet disimprisoned one still halfimprisonedthe articulate lovely still encased in the inarticulate chaotic how true and does she not propound her riddles to us of each man she asks daily in mild voice yet with a terrible significance knowest thou the meaning of this day what thou canst do today wisely attempt to do nature universe destiny existence howsoever we name this grand unnamable fact in the midst of which we live and struggle is as a heavenly bride and conquest to the wise and brave to them who can discern her behests and do them a destroying fiend to them who cannot answer her riddle it is well with thee answer it not pass on regarding it not it will answer itself the solution for thee is a thing of teeth and claws nature is a dumb lioness deaf to thy pleadings fiercely devouring thou art not now her victorious bridegroom thou art her mangled victim scattered on the precipices as a slave found treacherous recreant ought to be and must  with nations it is as with individuals can they rede the riddle of destiny this english nation will it get to know the meaning of its strange new today is there sense enough extant discoverable anywhere or anyhow in our united twentyseven million heads to discern the same valour enough in our twentyseven million hearts to dare and do the bidding thereof it will be seen  the secret of gold midas which he with his long ears never could discover was that he had offended the supreme powersthat he had parted company with the eternal inner facts of this universe and followed the transient outer appearances thereof and so was arrived here properly it is the secret of all unhappy men and unhappy nations had they known natures right truth natures right truth would have made them free they have become enchanted stagger spellbound reeling on the brink of huge peril because they were not wise enough they have forgotten the right inner true and taken up with the outer shamtrue they answer the sphinxs question wrong foolish men cannot answer it aright foolish men mistake transitory semblance for eternal fact and go astray more and more  foolish men imagine that because judgment for an evil thing is delayed there is no justice but an accidental one here below judgment for an evil thing is many times delayed some day or two some century or two but it is sure as life it is sure as death in the centre of the worldwhirlwind verily now as in the oldest days dwells and speaks a god the great soul of the world is just o brother can it be needful now at this late epoch of experience after eighteen centuries of christian preaching for one thing to remind thee of such a fact which all manner of mahometans old pagan romans jews scythians and heathen greeks and indeed more or less all men that god made have managed at one time to see into nay which thou thyself till redtape strangled the inner life of thee hadst once some inkling of that there is justice here below and even at bottom that there is nothing else but justice forget that thou hast forgotten all success will never more attend thee how can it now thou hast the whole universe against thee no more success mere shamsuccess for a day and days rising ever highertowards its tarpeian rock alas how in thy softhung longacre vehicle of polished leather to the bodily eye of redtape philosophy of expediences clubroom moralities parliamentary majorities to the minds eye thou beautifully rollest but knowest thou whitherward it is towards the roads end old useandwont established methods habitudes once true and wise mans noblest tendency his perseverance and mans ignoblest his inertia whatsoever of noble and ignoble conservatism there is in men and nations strongest always in the strongest men and nations all this is as a road to thee paved smooth through the abysstill all this end till mens bitter necessities can endure thee no more till natures patience with thee is done and there is no road or footing any farther and the abyss yawns sheer  parliament and the courts of westminster are venerable to me how venerable gray with a thousand years of honourable age for a thousand years and more wisdom and faithful valour struggling amid much folly and greedy baseness not without most sad distortions in the struggle have built them up and they are as we see for a thousand years this english nation has found them useful or supportable they have served this english nations want been a road to it through the abyss of time they are venerable they are great and strong and yet it is good to remember always that they are not the venerablest nor the greatest nor the strongest acts of parliament are venerable but if they correspond not with the writing on the adamant tablet what are they properly their one element of venerableness of strength or greatness is that they at all times correspond therewith as near as by human possibility they can they are cherishing destruction in their bosom every hour that they continue otherwise  alas how many causes that can plead well for themselves in the courts of westminster and yet in the general court of the universe and free soul of man have no word to utter honourable gentlemen may find this worth considering in times like ours and truly the din of triumphant lawlogic and all shaking of horsehair wigs and learnedserjeant gowns having comfortably ended we shall do well to ask ourselves withal what says that high and highest court to the verdict for it is the court of courts that same where the universal soul of fact and very truth sits presidentand thitherward more and more swiftly with a really terrible increase of swiftness all causes do in these days crowd for revisalfor confirmation for modification for reversal with costs dost thou know that court hast thou had any lawpractice there what didst thou never enter never file any petition of redress reclaimer disclaimer or demurrer written as in thy hearts blood for thy own behoof or anothers and silently await the issue thou knowest not such a court hast merely heard of it by faint tradition as a thing that was or had been of thee i think we shall get little benefit  for the gowns of learnedserjeants are good parchment records fixed forms and poor terrestrial justice with or without horsehair what sane man will not reverence these and yet behold the man is not sane but insane who considers these alone as venerable oceans of horsehair continents of parchment and learnedserjeant eloquence were it continued till the learned tongue wore itself small in the indefatigable learned mouth cannot make unjust just the grand question still remains was the judgment just if unjust it will not and cannot get harbour for itself or continue to have footing in this universe which was made by other than one unjust enforce it by never such statuting three readings royal assents blow it to the four winds with all manner of quilted trumpeters and pursuivants in the rear of them never so many gibbets and hangmen it will not stand it cannot stand from all souls of men from all ends of nature from the throne of god above there are voices bidding it away away does it take no warning does it stand strong in its three readings in its gibbets and artilleryparks the more woe is to it the frightfuler woe it will continue standing for its day for its year for its century doing evil all the while but it has one enemy who is almighty dissolution explosion and the everlasting laws of nature incessantly advance towards it and the deeper its rooting more obstinate its continuing the deeper also and huger will its ruin and overturn be  in this godsworld with its wildwhirling eddies and mad foamoceans where men and nations perish as if without law and judgment for an unjust thing is sternly delayed dost thou think that there is therefore no justice it is what the fool hath said in his heart it is what the wise in all times were wise because they denied and knew forever not to be i tell thee again there is nothing else but justice one strong thing i find here below the just thing the true thing my friend if thou hadst all the artillery of woolwich trundling at thy back in support of an unjust thing and infinite bonfires visibly waiting ahead of thee to blaze centuries long for thy victory on behalf of iti would advise thee to call halt to fling down thy baton and say in gods name no thy success poor devil what will thy success amount to if the thing is unjust thou hast not succeeded no not though bonfires blazed from north to south and bells rang and editors wrote leadingarticles and the just thing lay trampled out of sight to all mortal eyes an abolished and annihilated thing success in few years thou wilt be dead and darkall cold eyeless deaf no blaze of bonfires dingdong of bells or leadingarticles visible or audible to thee again at all forever what kind of success is that                                       it is true all goes by approximation in this world with any not insupportable approximation we must be patient there is a noble conservatism as well as an ignoble would to heaven for the sake of conservatism itself the noble alone were left and the ignoble by some kind severe hand were ruthlessly lopped away forbidden evermore to show itself for it is the right and noble alone that will have victory in this struggle the rest is wholly an obstruction a postponement and fearful imperilment of the victory towards an eternal centre of right and nobleness and of that only is all this confusion tending we already know whither it is all tending what will have victory what will have none the heaviest will reach the centre the heaviest sinking through complex fluctuating media and vortices has its deflexions its obstructions nay at times its resiliences its reboundings whereupon some blockhead shall be heard jubilating see your heaviest ascendsbut at all moments it is moving centreward fast as is convenient for it sinking sinking and by laws older than the world old as the makers first plan of the world it has to arrive there  await the issue in all battles if you await the issue each fighter has prospered according to his right his right and his might at the close of the account were one and the same he has fought with all his might and in exact proportion to all his right he has prevailed his very death is no victory over him he dies indeed but his work lives very truly lives a heroic wallace quartered on the scaffold cannot hinder that his scotland become one day a part of england but he does hinder that it become on tyrannous unfair terms a part of it commands still as with a gods voice from his old valhalla and temple of the brave that there be a just real union as of brother and brother not a false and merely semblant one as of slave and master if the union with england be in fact one of scotlands chief blessings we thank wallace withal that it was not the chief curse scotland is not ireland no because brave men rose there and said behold ye must not tread us down like slaves and ye shall notand cannot fight on thou brave true heart and falter not through dark fortune and through bright the cause thou fightest for so far as it is true no farther yet precisely so far is very sure of victory the falsehood alone of it will be conquered will be abolished as it ought to be but the truth of it is part of natures own laws cooperates with the worlds eternal tendencies and cannot be conquered  the dust of controversy what is it but the falsehood flying off from all manner of conflicting true forces and making such a loud dustwhirlwindthat so the truths alone may remain and embrace brotherlike in some true resultingforce it is ever so savage fighting heptarchies their fighting is an ascertainment who has the right to rule over whom that out of such wastebickering saxondom a peacefully coöperating england may arise seek through this universe if with other than owls eyes thou wilt find nothing nourished there nothing kept in life but what has right to nourishment and life the rest look at it with other than owls eyes is not living is all dying all as good as dead justice was ordained from the foundations of the world and will last with the world and longer                                       from which i infer that the inner sphere of fact in this present england as elsewhere differs infinitely from the outer sphere and spheres of semblance that the temporary here as elsewhere is too apt to carry it over the eternal that he who dwells in the temporary semblances and does not penetrate into the eternal substance will not answer the sphinxriddle of today or of any day for the substance alone is substantial that is the law of fact if you discover not that fact who already knows it will let you also know it by and by  what is justice that on the whole is the question of the sphinx to us the law of fact is that justice must and will be done the sooner the better for the time grows stringent frightfully pressing what is justice ask many to whom cruel fact alone will be able to prove responsive it is like jesting pilate asking what is truth jesting pilate had not the smallest chance to ascertain what was truth he could not have known it had a god shown it to him thick serene opacity thicker than amaurosis veiled those smiling eyes of his to truth the inner retina of them was gone paralytic dead he looked at truth and discerned her not there where she stood what is justice the clothed embodied justice that sits in westminster hall with penalties parchments tipstaves is very visible but the unembodied justice whereof that other is either an emblem or else is a fearful indescribability is not so visible for the unembodied justice is of heaven a spirit and divinity of heaveninvisible to all but the noble and pure of soul the impure ignoble gaze with eyes and she is not there they will prove it to you by logic by endless hansard debatings by bursts of parliamentary eloquence it is not consolatory to behold for properly as many men as there are in a nation who can withal see heavens invisible justice and know it to be on earth also omnipotent so many men are there who stand between a nation and perdition so many and no more heavyladen england how many hast thou in this hour the supreme power sends new and ever new all born at least with hearts of flesh and not of stoneand heavy misery itself once heavy enough will prove didactic     chapter iii  manchester insurrection   blusterowski colacorde and other editorial prophets of the continentaldemocratic movement have in their leadingarticles shown themselves disposed to vilipend the late manchester insurrection as evincing in the rioters an extreme backwardness to battle nay as betokening in the english people itself perhaps a want of the proper animal courage indispensable in these ages a million hungry operative men started up in utmost paroxysm of desperate protest against their lot and ask colacorde and company how many shots were fired very few in comparison certain hundreds of drilled soldiers sufficed to suppress this millionheaded hydra and tread it down without the smallest appeasement or hope of such into its subterranean settlements again there to reconsider itself compared with our revolts in lyons in warsaw and elsewhere to say nothing of incomparable paris city past or present what a lamblike insurrection  the present editor is not here with his readers to vindicate the character of insurrections nor does it matter to us whether blusterowski and the rest may think the english a courageous people or not courageous in passing however let us mention that to our view this was not an unsuccessful insurrection that as insurrections go we have not heard lately of any that succeeded so well  a million of hungry operative men as blusterowski says rose all up came all out into the streets andstood there what other could they do their wrongs and griefs were bitter insupportable their rage against the same was just but who are they that cause these wrongs who that will honestly make effort to redress them our enemies are we know not who or what our friends are we know not where how shall we attack any one shoot or be shot by any one oh if the accursed invisible nightmare that is crushing out the life of us and ours would take a shape approach us like the hyrcanian tiger the behemoth of chaos the archfiend himself in any shape that we could see and fasten ona man can have himself shot with cheerfulness but it needs first that he see clearly for what show him the divine face of justice then the diabolic monster which is eclipsing that he will fly at the throat of such monster never so monstrous and need no bidding to do it woolwich grapeshot will sweep clear all streets blast into invisibility so many thousand men but if your woolwich grapeshot be but eclipsing divine justice and the godsradiance itself gleam recognisable athwart such grapeshotthen yes then is the time come for fighting and attacking all artilleryparks have become weak and are about to dissipate in the godsthunder their poor thunder slackens ceases finding that it is in all senses of the term a brute one  that the manchester insurrection stood still on the streets with an indisposition to fire and bloodshed was wisdom for it even as an insurrection insurrection never so necessary is a most sad necessity and governors who wait for that to instruct them are surely getting into the fatalest coursesproving themselves sons of nox and chaos of blind cowardice not of seeing valour how can there be any remedy in insurrection it is a mere announcement of the diseasevisible now even to sons of night insurrection usually gains little usually wastes how much one of its worst kinds of waste to say nothing of the rest is that of irritating and exasperating men against each other by violence done which is always sure to be injustice done for violence does even justice unjustly  who shall compute the waste and loss the obstruction of every sort that was produced in the manchester region by peterloo alone some thirteen unarmed men and women cut downthe number of the slain and maimed is very countable but the treasury of rage burning hidden or visible in all hearts ever since more or less perverting the effort and aim of all hearts ever since is of unknown extent how ye came among us in your cruel armed blindness ye unspeakable county yeomanry sabres flourishing hoofs prancing and slashed us down at your brute pleasure deaf blind to all our claims and woes and wrongs of quick sight and sense to your own claims only there lie poor sallow workworn weavers and complain no more now women themselves are slashed and sabred howling terror fills the air and ye ride prosperous very victoriousye unspeakable give us sabres too and then comeon a little such are peterloos in all hearts that witnessed peterloo stands written as in firecharacters or smokecharacters prompt to become fire again a legible balanceaccount of grim vengeance very unjustly balanced much exaggerated as is the way with such accounts but payable readily at sight in full with compound interest such things should be avoided as the very pestilence for mens hearts ought not to be set against one another but set with one another and all against the evil thing only mens souls ought to be left to see clearly not jaundiced blinded twisted all awry by revenge mutual abhorrence and the like an insurrection that can announce the disease and then retire with no such balanceaccount opened anywhere has attained the highest success possible for it  and this was what these poor manchester operatives with all the darkness that was in them and round them did manage to perform they put their huge inarticulate question what do you mean to do with us in a manner audible to every reflective soul in this kingdom exciting deep pity in all good men deep anxiety in all men whatever and no conflagration or outburst of madness came to cloud that feeling anywhere but everywhere it operates unclouded all england heard the question it is the first practical form of our sphinxriddle england will answer it or on the whole england will perishone does not yet expect the latter result  for the rest that the manchester insurrection could yet discern no radiance of heaven on any side of its horizon but feared that all lights of the oconnor or other sorts hitherto kindled were but deceptive fishoil transparencies or bog willowisp lights and no dayspring from on high for this also we will honour the poor manchester insurrection and augur well of it a deep unspoken sense lies in these strong meninconsiderable almost stupid as all they can articulate of it is amid all violent stupidity of speech a right noble instinct of what is doable and what is not doable never forsakes them the strong inarticulate men and workers whom fact patronises of whom in all difficulty and work whatsoever there is good augury this work too is to be done governors and governing classes that can articulate and utter in any measure what the law of fact and justice is may calculate that here is a governed class who will listen  and truly this first practical form of the sphinxquestion inarticulately and so audibly put there is one of the most impressive ever asked in the world behold us here so many thousands millions and increasing at the rate of fifty every hour we are right willing and able to work and on the planet earth is plenty of work and wages for a million times as many we ask if you mean to lead us towards work to try to lead usby ways new never yet heard of till this new unheardof time or if you declare that you cannot lead us and expect that we are to remain quietly unled and in a composed manner perish of starvation what is it you expect of us what is it you mean to do with us this question i say has been put in the hearing of all britain and will be again put and ever again till some answer be given it  unhappy workers unhappier idlers unhappy men and women of this actual england we are yet very far from an answer and there will be no existence for us without finding one a fair dayswages for a fair dayswork it is as just a demand as governed men ever made of governing it is the everlasting right of man indisputable as gospels as arithmetical multiplicationtables it must and will have itself fulfilledand yet in these times of ours with what enormous difficulty nextdoor to impossibility for the times are really strange of a complexity intricate with all the new width of the everwidening world times here of halffrantic velocity of impetus there of the deadestlooking stillness and paralysis times definable as showing two qualities dilettantism and mammonismmost intricate obstructed times nay if there were not a heavens radiance of justice prophetic clearly of heaven discernible behind all these confused worldwide entanglements of landlord interests manufacturing interests torywhig interests and who knows what other interests expediencies vested interests established possessions inveterate dilettantisms midaseared mammonismsit would seem to every one a flat impossibility which all wise men might as well at once abandon if you do not know eternal justice from momentary expediency and understand in your heart of hearts how justice radiant beneficent as the allvictorious lightelement is also in essence if need be an allvictorious fireelement and melts all manner of vested interests and the hardest iron cannon as if they were soft wax and does ever in the longrun rule and reign and allows nothing else to rule and reignyou also would talk of impossibility but it is only difficult it is not impossible possible it is with whatever difficulty very clearly inevitable                                       fair dayswages for fair dayswork exclaims a sarcastic man alas in what corner of this planet since adam first awoke on it was that ever realised the dayswages of john miltons dayswork named paradise lost and miltons works were ten pounds paid by instalments and a rather close escape from death on the gallows consider that it is no rhetorical flourish it is an authentic altogether quiet factemblematic quietly documentary of a whole world of such ever since human history began oliver cromwell quitted his farming undertook a hercules labour and lifelong wrestle with that lernean hydracoil wide as england hissing heavenhigh through its thousand crowned coroneted shovelhatted quackheads and he did wrestle with it the truest and terriblest wrestle i have heard of and he wrestled it and mowed and cut it down a good many stages so that its hissing is ever since pitiful in comparison and one can walk abroad in comparative peace from itand his wages as i understand were burial under the gallowstree near tyburn turnpike with his head on the gable of westminster hall and two centuries now of mixed cursing and ridicule from all manner of men his dust lies under the edgware road near tyburn turnpike at this hour and his memory isnay what matters what his memory is his memory at bottom is or yet shall be as that of a god a terror and horror to all quacks and cowards and insincere persons an everlasting encouragement new memento battleword and pledge of victory to all the brave it is the natural course and history of the godlike in every place in every time what god ever carried it with the tenpound franchisers in open vestry or with any sanhedrim of considerable standing when was a god found agreeable to everybody the regular way is to hang kill crucify your gods and execrate and trample them under your stupid hoofs for a century or two till you discover that they are godsand then take to braying over them still in a very longeared mannerso speaks the sarcastic man in his wild way very mournful truths  dayswages for dayswork continues he the progress of human society consists even in this same the better and better apportioning of wages to work give me this you have given me all pay to every man accurately what he has worked for what he has earned and done and deservedto this man broad lands and honours to that man high gibbets and treadmills what more have i to ask heavens kingdom which we daily pray for has come gods will is done on earth even as it is in heaven this is the radiance of celestial justice in the light or in the fire of which all impediments vested interests and iron cannon are more and more melting like wax and disappearing from the pathways of men a thing ever struggling forward irrepressible advancing inevitable perfecting itself all days more and morenever to be perfect till that general doomsday the ultimate consummation and last of earthly days  true as to perfection and so forth answer we true enough and yet withal we have to remark that imperfect human society holds itself together and finds place under the sun in virtue simply of some approximation to perfection being actually made and put in practice we remark farther that there are supportable approximations and then likewise insupportable with some almost with any supportable approximation men are apt perhaps too apt to rest indolently patient and say it will do thus these poor manchester manual workers mean only by dayswages for dayswork certain coins of money adequate to keep them livingin return for their work such modicum of food clothes and fuel as will enable them to continue their work itself they as yet clamour for no more the rest still inarticulate cannot yet shape itself into a demand at all and only lies in them as a dumb wish perhaps only still more inarticulate as a dumb altogether unconscious want this is the supportable approximation they would rest patient with that by their work they might be kept alive to work morethis once grown unattainable i think your approximation may consider itself to have reached the insupportable stage and may prepare with whatever difficulty reluctance and astonishment for one of two things for changing or perishing with the millions no longer able to live how can the units keep living it is too clear the nation itself is on the way to suicidal death  shall we say then the world has retrograded in its talent of apportioning wages to work in late days the world had always a talent of that sort better or worse time was when the mere handworker needed not announce his claim to the world by manchester insurrectionsthe world with its wealth of nations supplyanddemand and suchlike has of late days been terribly inattentive to that question of work and wages we will not say the poor world has retrograded even here we will say rather the world has been rushing on with such fiery animation to get work and ever more work done it has had no time to think of dividing the wages and has merely left them to be scrambled for by the law of the stronger law of supplyanddemand law of laissezfaire and other idle laws and unlawssaying in its dire haste to get the work done that is well enough  and now the world will have to pause a little and take up that other side of the problem and in right earnest strive for some solution of that for it has become pressing what is the use of your spun shirts they hang there by the million unsaleable and here by the million are diligent bare backs that can get no hold of them shirts are useful for covering human backs useless otherwise an unbearable mockery otherwise you have fallen terribly behind with that side of the problem manchester insurrections french revolutions and thousandfold phenomena great and small announce loudly that you must bring it forward a little again never till now in the history of an earth which to this hour nowhere refuses to grow corn if you will plough it to yield shirts if you will spin and weave in it did the mere manual twohanded worker however it might fare with other workers cry in vain for such wages as he means by fair wages namely food and warmth the godlike could not and cannot be paid but the earthly always could gurth a mere swineherd born thrall of cedric the saxon tended pigs in the wood and did get some parings of the pork why the fourfooted worker has already got all that this twohanded one is clamouring for how often must i remind you there is not a horse in england able and willing to work but has due food and lodging and goes about sleekcoated satisfied in heart and you say it is impossible brothers i answer if for you it be impossible what is to become of you it is impossible for us to believe it to be impossible the human brain looking at these sleek english horses refuses to believe in such impossibility for english men do you depart quickly clear the ways soon lest worse befall we for our share do purpose with full view of the enormous difficulty with total disbelief in the impossibility to endeavour while life is in us and to die endeavouring we and our sons till we attain it or have all died and ended  such a platitude of a world in which all working horses could be well fed and innumerable working men should die starved were it not best to end it to have done with it and restore it once for all to the jötuns mudgiants frostgiants and chaotic brutegods of the beginning for the old anarchic brutegods it may be well enough but it is a platitude which men should be above countenancing by their presence in it we pray you let the word impossible disappear from your vocabulary in this matter it is of awful omen to all of us and to yourselves first of all     chapter iv  morrisons pill   what is to be done what would you have us do asks many a one with a tone of impatience almost of reproach and then if you mention some one thing some two things twenty things that might be done turns round with a satirical tehee and these are your remedies the state of mind indicated by such question and such rejoinder is worth reflecting on  it seems to be taken for granted by these interrogative philosophers that there is some thing or handful of things which could be done some act of parliament remedial measure or the like which could be passed whereby the social malady were fairly fronted conquered put an end to so that with your remedial measure in your pocket you could then go on triumphant and be troubled no farther you tell us the evil cry such persons as if justly aggrieved and do not tell us how it is to be cured  how it is to be cured brothers i am sorry i have got no morrisons pill for curing the maladies of society it were infinitely handier if we had a morrisons pill act of parliament or remedial measure which men could swallow one good time and then go on in their old courses cleared from all miseries and mischiefs unluckily we have none such unluckily the heavens themselves in their rich pharmacopoeia contain none such there will no thing be done that will cure you there will a radical universal alteration of your regimen and way of life take place there will a most agonising divorce between you and your chimeras luxuries and falsities take place a most toilsome allbut impossible return to nature and her veracities and her integrities take place that so the inner fountains of life may again begin like eternal lightfountains to irradiate and purify your bloated swollen foul existence drawing nigh as at present to nameless death either death or else all this will take place judge if with such diagnosis any morrisons pill is like to be discoverable  but the lifefountain within you once again set flowing what innumerable things whole sets and classes and continents of things year after year and decade after decade and century after century will then be doable and done not emigration education cornlaw abrogation sanitary regulation land propertytax not these alone nor a thousand times as much as these good heavens there will then be light in the inner heart of here and there a man to discern what is just what is commanded by the most high god what must be done were it never so impossible vain jargon in favour of the palpably unjust will then abridge itself within limits vain jargon on hustings in parliaments or wherever else when here and there a man has vision for the essential godstruth of the things jargoned of will become very vain indeed the silence of here and there such a man how eloquent in answer to such jargon such jargon frightened at its own gaunt echo will unspeakably abate nay for a while may almost in a manner disappearthe wise answering it in silence and even the simple taking cue from them to hoot it down wherever heard it will be a blessed time and many things will become doableand when the brains are out an absurdity will die not easily again shall a cornlaw argue ten years for itself and still talk and argue when impartial persons have to say with a sigh that for so long back they have heard no argument advanced for it but such as might make the angels and almost the very jackasses weep  wholly a blessed time when jargon might abate and here and there some genuine speech begin when to the noble opened heart as to such heart they alone do all noble things began to grow visible and the difference between just and unjust between true and false between work and shamwork between speech and jargon was once more what to our happier fathers it used to be infiniteas between a heavenly thing and an infernal the one a thing which you were not to do which you were wise not to attempt doing which it were better for you to have a millstone tied round your neck and be cast into the sea than concern yourself with doingbrothers it will not be a morrisons pill or remedial measure that will bring all this about for us                                       and yet very literally till in some shape or other it be brought about we remain cureless till it begin to be brought about the cure does not begin for nature and fact not redtape and semblance are to this hour the basis of mans life and on those through never such strata of these man and his life and all his interests do sooner or later infallibly come to restand to be supported or be swallowed according as they agree with

laws if we walk according to the law the lawmaker will befriend us if not not alas by no reform bill ballotbox fivepoint charter by no boxes or bills or charters can you perform this alchemy given a

plausibility and also is falsity and fatuity to which nature says and must say when it comes to her to speak eternally no nations cease to be befriended of the lawmaker when they walk not according to the law the sphinxquestion remains unsolved by them becomes ever more insoluble  if thou ask again therefore on the morrisonspill hypothesis what is to be done allow me to reply by thee for the

endless host of things that can be done do the first of these do it the second will already have become clearer doabler the second third and threethousandth will then have begun to be possible for us

chapter v  aristocracy of talent   when an individual is miserable what does it most of all behove him to do to complain of this man or of that of this thing or of that to fill the world and the street with lamentation objurgation not so at all the reverse of so all moralists advise him not to complain of any person or of any thing but of himself only he is to know of a truth that being miserable he has been unwise he had he faithfully followed nature and her laws nature ever true to her laws would have yielded fruit and increase and felicity to him but he has followed other than natures laws and now nature her patience with him being ended leaves him desolate answers with very emphatic significance to him no not by this road my son by another road shalt thou attain wellbeing this thou perceivest is the road to illbeing quit thisso do all moralists advise that the man penitently say to himself first of all behold i was not wise enough i quitted the laws of fact which are also called the laws of god and mistook for them the laws of sham and semblance which are called the devils laws therefore am i here  neither with nations that become miserable is it fundamentally otherwise the ancient guides of nations prophets priests or whatever their name were well aware of this and down to a late epoch impressively taught and inculcated it the modern guides of nations who also go under a great variety of names journalists political economists politicians pamphleteers have entirely forgotten this and are ready to deny this but it nevertheless remains eternally undeniable nor is there any doubt but we shall all be taught it yet and made again to confess it we shall all be striped and scourged till we do learn it and shall at last either get to know it or be striped to death in the process for it is undeniable when a nation is unhappy the old prophet was right and not wrong in saying to it ye have forgotten god ye have quitted the ways of god or ye would not have been unhappy it is not according to the laws of fact that ye have lived and guided yourselves but according to the laws of delusion imposture and wilful and unwilful mistake of fact behold therefore the unveracity is worn out natures longsuffering with you is exhausted and ye are here  surely there is nothing very inconceivable in this even to the journalist to the political economist modern pamphleteer or any twolegged animal without feathers if a country finds itself wretched sure enough that country has been misguided it is with the wretched twentyseven millions fallen wretched as with the unit fallen wretched they as he have quitted the course prescribed by nature and the supreme powers and so are fallen into scarcity disaster infelicity and pausing to consider themselves have to lament and say alas we were not wise enough we took transient superficial semblance for everlasting central substance we have departed far away from the laws of this universe and behold now lawless chaos and inane chimera is ready to devour usnature in late centuries says sauerteig was universally supposed to be dead an old eightday clock made many thousand years ago and still ticking but dead as brasswhich the maker at most sat looking at in a distant singular and indeed incredible manner but now i am happy to observe she is everywhere asserting herself to be not dead and brass at all but alive and miraculous celestialinfernal with an emphasis that will again penetrate the thickest head of this planet by and by  indisputable enough to all mortals now the guidance of this country has not been sufficiently wise men too foolish have been set to the guiding and governing of it and have guided it hither we must find wiserwiser or else we perish to this length of insight all england has now advanced but as yet no farther all england stands wringing its hands asking itself nigh desperate what farther reform bill proves to be a failure benthamee radicalism the gospel of

in these modern days  we must have more wisdom to govern us we must be governed by the wisest we must have an aristocracy of talent cry many true most true but how to get it the following extract from our young friend of the houndsditch indicator is worth perusing at this time says he while there is a cry everywhere articulate or inarticulate for an aristocracy of talent a governing class namely which did govern not merely which took the wages of governing and could not with all our industry be kept from misgoverning cornlawing and playing the very deuce with usit may not be altogether useless to remind some of the greenerheaded sort what a dreadfully difficult affair the getting of such an aristocracy is do you expect my friends that your indispensable aristocracy of talent is to be enlisted straightway by some sort of recruitment aforethought out of the general population arranged in supreme regimental order and set to rule over us that it will be got sifted like wheat out of chaff from the twentyseven million british subjects that any ballotbox reform bill or other political machine with force of public opinion never so active on it is likely to perform said process of sifting would to heaven that we had a sieve that we could so much as fancy any kind of sieve windfanners or neplusultra of machinery devisable by man that would do it  done nevertheless sure enough it must be it shall and will be we are rushing swiftly on the road to destruction every hour bringing us nearer until it be in some measure done the doing of it is not doubtful only the method and the costs nay i will even mention to you an infallible sifting process whereby he that has ability will be sifted out to rule among us and that same blessed aristocracy of talent be verily in an approximate degree vouchsafed us by and by an infallible siftingprocess to which however no soul can help his neighbour but each must with devout prayer to heaven endeavour to help himself it is o friends that all of us that many of us should acquire the true eye for talent which is dreadfully wanting at present the true eye for talent presupposes the true reverence for ito heavens presupposes so many things  for example you bobus higgins sausagemaker on the great scale who are raising such a clamour for this aristocracy of talent what is it that you do in that big heart of yours chiefly in very fact pay reverence to is it to talent intrinsic manly worth of any kind you unfortunate bobus the manliest man that you saw going in a ragged coat did you ever reverence him did you so much as know that he was a manly man at all till his coat grew better talent i understand you to be able to worship the fame of talent the power cash celebrity or other success of talent but the talent itself is a thing you never saw with eyes nay what is it in yourself that you are proudest of that you take most pleasure in surveying meditatively in thoughtful moments speak now is it the bare bobus stript of his very name and shirt and turned loose upon society that you admire and thank heaven for or bobus with his cashaccounts and larders dropping fatness with his respectabilities warm garnitures and ponychaise admirable in some measure to certain of the flunky species your own degree of worth and talent is it of infinite value to you or only of finitemeasurable by the degree of currency and conquest of praise or pudding it has brought you to bobus you are in a vicious circle rounder than one of your own sausages and will never vote for or promote any talent except what talent or shamtalent has already got itself voted forwe here cut short the indicator all readers perceiving whither he now tends                                       more wisdom indeed but where to find more wisdom we have already a collective wisdom after its kindthough classlegislation and another thing or two affect it somewhat on the whole as they say like people like priest so we may say like people like king the man gets himself appointed and elected who is ablestto be appointed and elected what can the incorruptiblest bobuses elect if it be not some bobissimus should they find such  or again perhaps there is not in the whole nation wisdom enough collect it as we may to make an adequate collective that too is a case which may befall a ruined man staggers down to ruin because there was not wisdom enough in him so clearly also may twentyseven million collective menbut indeed one of the infalliblest fruits of unwisdom in a nation is that it cannot get the use of what wisdom is actually in it that it is not governed by the wisest it has who alone have a divine right to govern in all nations but by the shamwisest or even by the openly notsowise if they are handiest otherwise this is the infalliblest result of unwisdom and also the balefulest immeasurablestnot so much what we can call a poisonfruit as a universal deathdisease and poisoning of the whole tree for hereby are fostered fed into gigantic bulk all manner of unwisdoms poisonfruits till as we say the lifetree everywhere is made a upastree deadly unwisdom overshadowing all things and there is done what lies in human skill to stifle all wisdom everywhere in the birth to smite our poor world barren of wisdomand make your utmost collective wisdom were it collected and elected by rhadamanthus Æacus and minos not to speak of drunken tenpound franchisers with their ballotboxes an inadequate collective the wisdom is not now there how will you collect it as well wash thames mud by improved methods to find more gold in it  truly the first condition is indispensable that wisdom be there but the second is like unto it is properly one with it these two conditions act and react through every fibre of them and go inseparably together if you have much wisdom in your nation you will get it faithfully collected for the wise love wisdom and will search for it as for life and salvation if you have little wisdom you will get even that little illcollected trampled under foot reduced as near as possible to annihilation for fools do not love wisdom they are foolish first of all because they have never loved wisdombut have loved their own appetites ambitions their coroneted coaches tankards of heavywet thus is your candle lighted at both ends and the progress towards consummation is swift thus is fulfilled that saying in the gospel to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath very literally in a very fatal manner that saying is here fulfilled  our aristocracy of talent seems at a considerable distance yet does it not o bobus     chapter vi  heroworship   to the present editor not less than to bobus a government of the wisest what bobus calls an aristocracy of talent seems the one healing remedy but he is not so sanguine as bobus with respect to the means of realising it he thinks that we have at once missed realising it and come to need it so pressingly by departing far from the inner eternal laws and takingup with the temporary outer semblances of laws he thinks that enlightened egoism never so luminous is not the rule by which mans life can be led that laissezfaire supplyanddemand cashpayment for the sole nexus and so forth were not are not and will never be a practicable law of union for a society of men that poor and rich that governed and governing cannot long live together on any such law of union alas he thinks that man has a soul in him different from the stomach in any sense of this word that if said soul be asphyxied and lie quietly forgotten the man and his affairs are in a bad way he thinks that said soul will have to be resuscitated from its asphyxia that if it prove irresuscitable the man is not long for this world in brief that midaseared mammonism doublebarrelled dilettantism and their thousand adjuncts and corollaries are not the law by which god almighty has appointed this his universe to go that once for all these are not the law and then farther that we shall have to return to what is the lawnot by smooth flowery paths it is like and with tremendous cheers in our throat but over steep untrodden places through stormclad chasms waste oceans and the bosom of tornadoes thank heaven if not through very chaos and the abyss the resuscitating of a soul that has gone to asphyxia is no momentary or pleasant process but a long and terrible one                                       to the present editor heroworship as he has elsewhere named it means much more than an elected parliament or stated aristocracy of the wisest for in his dialect it is the summary ultimate essence and supreme practical perfection of all manner of worship and true worthships and noblenesses whatsoever such blessed parliament and were it once in perfection blessed aristocracy of the wisest godhonoured and manhonoured he does look for more and more perfectedas the topmost blessed practical apex of a whole world reformed from shamworship informed anew with worship with truth and blessedness he thinks that heroworship done differently in every different epoch of the world is the soul of all social business among men that the doing of it well or the doing of it ill measures accurately what degree of wellbeing or of illbeing there is in the worlds affairs he thinks that we on the whole do our heroworship worse than any nation in this world ever did it before that the burns an exciseman the byron a literary lion are intrinsically all things considered a baser and falser phenomenon than the odin a god the mahomet a prophet of god it is this editors clear opinion accordingly that we must learn to do our heroworship better that to do it better and better means the awakening of the nations soul from its asphyxia and the return of blessed life to usheavens blessed life not mammons galvanic accursed one to resuscitate the asphyxied apparently now moribund and in the last agony if not resuscitated such and no other seems the consummation  heroworship if you willyes friends but first of all by being ourselves of heroic mind a whole world of heroes a world not of flunkies where no heroking can reign that is what we aim at we for our share will put away all flunkyism baseness unveracity from us we shall then hope to have noblenesses and veracities set over us never till then let bobus and company sneer that is your reform yes bobus that is our reform and except in that and what will follow out of that we have no hope at all reform like charity o bobus must begin at home once well at home how will it radiate outwards irrepressible into all that we touch and handle speak and work kindling ever new light by incalculable contagion spreading in geometric ratio far and widedoing good only wheresoever it spreads and not evil  by reform bills anticornlaw bills and thousand other bills and methods we will demand of our governors with emphasis and for the first time not without effect that they cease to be quacks or else depart that they set no quackeries and blockheadisms anywhere to rule over us that they utter or act no cant to usit will be better if they do not for we shall now know quacks when we see them cant when we hear it shall be horrible to us we will say with the poor frenchman at the bar of the convention though in wiser style than he and for the space not of an hour but of a lifetime je demande larrestation des coquins et des lâches arrestment of the knaves and dastards ah we know what a work that is how long it will be before they are all or mostly got arrestedbut here is one arrest him in gods name it is one fewer we will in all practicable ways by word and silence by act and refusal to act energetically demand that arrestmentje demande cette arrestationlàand by degrees infallibly attain it infallibly for light spreads all human souls never so bedarkened love light light once kindled spreads till all is luminoustill the cry arrest your knaves and dastards rises imperative from millions of hearts and rings and reigns from sea to sea nay how many of them may we not arrest with our own hands even now we do not countenance them thou there turn away from their lacquered sumptuosities their belauded sophistries their serpent graciosities their spoken and acted cant with a sacred horror with an apage satanasbobus and company and all men will gradually join us we demand arrestment of the knaves and dastards and begin by arresting our own poor selves out of that fraternity there is no other reform conceivable thou and i my friend can in the most flunky world make each of us one nonflunky one hero if we like that will be two heroes to begin withcourage even that is a whole world of heroes to end with or what we poor two can do in furtherance thereof  yes friends herokings and a whole world not unheroicthere lies the port and happy haven towards which through all these stormtost seas french revolutions chartisms manchester insurrections that make the heart sick in these bad days the supreme powers are driving us on the whole blessed be the supreme powers stern as they are towards that haven will we o friends let all true men with what of faculty is in them bend valiantly incessantly with thousandfold endeavour thither thither there or else in the oceanabysses it is very clear to me we shall arrive  well here

brakelond   we will in this second portion of our work strive to penetrate a little by means of certain confused papers printed and other into a somewhat remote century and to look face to face on it in hope of perhaps illustrating our own poor century thereby it seems a circuitous way but it may prove a way nevertheless for man has ever been a striving struggling and in spite of widespread calumnies to the contrary a veracious creature the centuries too are all lineal children of one another and often in the portrait of early grandfathers this and the other enigmatic feature of the newest grandson shall disclose itself to mutual elucidation this editor will venture on such a thing  besides in editors books and indeed everywhere else in the world of today a certain latitude of movement grows more and more becoming for the practical man salvation lies not in tight lacing in these timeshow far from that in any province whatsoever readers and men generally are getting into strange habits of asking all persons and things from poor editors books up to church bishops and state potentates not by what designation art thou called in what wig and black triangle dost thou walk

permissible the kind that has nothing in it le genre ennuyeux and go on his way accordingly                                       a certain jocelinus de brakelonda a naturalborn englishman has left us an extremely foreign book3 which the labours of the camden society have brought to light in these days jocelins book the chronicle or private boswellean notebook of jocelin a certain old st edmundsbury monk and boswell now seven centuries old how remote is it from us exotic extraneous in all ways coming from far abroad the language of it is not foreign only but dead monklatin lies across not the british channel but the ninefold stygian marshes stream of lethe and one knows not where roman latin itself still alive for us in the elysian fields of memory is domestic in comparison and then the ideas lifefurniture whole workings and ways of this worthy jocelin covered deeper than pompeii with the lavaashes and inarticulate wreck of seven hundred years  jocelin of brakelond cannot be called a conspicuous literary character indeed few mortals that have left so visible a work or footmark behind them can be more obscure one other of those vanished existences whose work has not yet vanishedalmost a pathetic phenomenon were not the whole world full of such the builders of stonehenge for exampleor alas what say we stonehenge and builders the writers of the universal review and homers iliad the paviors of london streetssooner or later the entire posterity of adam it is a pathetic phenomenon but an irremediable nay if well meditated a consoling one  by his dialect of monklatin and indeed by his name this jocelin seems to have been a norman englishman the surname de brakelonda indicates a native of st edmundsbury itself brakelond being the known old name of a street or quarter in that venerable town then farther sure enough our jocelin was a monk of st edmundsbury convent held some obedientia subaltern officiality there or rather in succession several was for one thing chaplain to my lord abbot living beside him night and day for the space of six yearswhich last indeed is the grand fact of jocelins existence and properly the origin of this present book and of the chief meaning it has for us now he was as we have hinted a kind of born boswell though an infinitesimally small one neither did he altogether want his johnson even there and then johnsons are rare yet as has been asserted boswells perhaps still rarerthe more is the pity on both sides this jocelin as we can discern well was an ingenious and ingenuous a cheeryhearted innocent yet withal shrewd noticing quickwitted man and from under his monks cowl has looked out on that narrow section of the world in a really human manner not in any simial canine ovine or otherwise inhuman mannerafflictive to all that have humanity the man is of patient peaceable loving clearsmiling nature open for this and that a wise simplicity is in him much natural sense a veracity that goes deeper than words veracity it is the basis of all and some say means genius itself the prime essence of all genius whatsoever our jocelin for the rest has read his classical manuscripts his virgilius his flaccus ovidius naso of course still more his homilies and breviaries and if not the bible considerable extracts of the bible then also he has a pleasant wit and loves a timely joke though in mild subdued manner very amiable to see a learned grown man yet with the heart as of a good child whose whole life indeed has been that of a childst edmundsbury monastery a larger kind of cradle for him in which his whole prescribed duty was to sleep kindly and love his mother well this is the biography of jocelin a man of excellent religion says one of his contemporary brother monks eximiæ religionis potens sermone et opere  for one thing he had learned to write a kind of monk or doglatin still readable to mankind and by good luck for us had bethought him of noting down thereby what things seemed notablest to him hence gradually resulted a chronica jocelini new manuscript in the liber albus of st edmundsbury which chronicle once written in its childlike transparency in its innocent goodhumour not without touches of ready pleasant wit and many kinds of worth other men liked naturally to read whereby it failed not to be copied to be multiplied to be inserted in the liber albus and so surviving henry the eighth putney cromwell the dissolution of monasteries and all accidents of malice and neglect for six centuries or so it got into the harleian collectionand has now therefrom by mr rokewood of the camden society been deciphered into clear print and lies before us a dainty thin quarto to interest for a few minutes whomsoever it can  here too it will behove a just historian gratefully to say that mr rokewood jocelins editor has done his editorial function well not only has he deciphered his crabbed manuscript into clear print but he has attended what his fellow editors are not always in the habit of doing to the important truth that the manuscript so deciphered ought to have a meaning for the reader standing faithfully by his text and printing its very errors in spelling in grammar or otherwise he has taken care by some note to indicate that they are errors and what the correction of them ought to be jocelins monklatin is generally transparent as shallow limpid water but at any stop that may occur of which there are a few and only a very few we have the comfortable assurance that a meaning does lie in the passage and may by industry be got at that a faithful editors industry had already got at it before passing on a compendious useful glossary is given nearly adequate to help the uninitiated through sometimes one wishes it had been a trifle larger but with a spelman and ducange at your elbow how easy to have made it far too large notes are added generally brief sufficiently explanatory of most points lastly a copious correct index which no such book should want and which unluckily very few possess and so in a word the chronicle of jocelin is as it professes to be unwrapped from its thick cerements and fairly brought forth into the common daylight so that he who runs and has a smattering of grammar may read                                       we have heard so much of monks everywhere in real and fictitious history from muratori annals to radcliffe romances these singular twolegged animals with their rosaries and breviaries with their shaven crowns haircilities and vows of poverty masquerade so strangely through our fancy and they are in fact so very strange an extinct species of the human familya veritable monk of bury st edmunds is worth attending to if by chance made visible and audible here he is and in his hand a magical speculum much gone to rust indeed yet in fragments still clear wherein the marvellous image of his existence does still shadow itself though fitfully and as with an intermittent light will not the reader peep with us into this singular camera lucida where an extinct species though fitfully can still be seen alive extinct species we say for the live specimens which still go about under that character are too evidently to be classed as spurious in natural history the gospel of richard arkwright once promulgated no monk of the old sort is any longer possible in this world but fancy a deepburied mastodon some fossil megatherion ichthyosaurus were to begin to speak from amid its rockswathings never so indistinctly the most extinct fossil species of men or monks can do and does this miraclethanks to the letters of the alphabet good for so many things  jocelin we said was somewhat of a boswell but unfortunately by nature he is none of the largest and distance has now dwarfed him to an extreme degree his light is most feeble intermittent and requires the intensest kindest inspection otherwise it will disclose mere vacant haze it must be owned the good jocelin spite of his beautiful childlike character is but an altogether imperfect mirror of these oldworld things the good man he looks on us so clear and cheery and in his neighbourly softsmiling eyes we see so well our own shadowwe have a longing always to crossquestion him to force from him an explanation of much but no jocelin though he talks with such clear familiarity like a nextdoor neighbour will not answer any question that is the peculiarity of him dead these six hundred and fifty years and quite deaf to us though still so audible the good man he cannot help it nor can we  but truly it is a strange consideration this simple one as we go on with him or indeed with any lucid simplehearted soul like him behold therefore this england of the year 1200 was no chimerical vacuity or dreamland peopled with mere vaporous fantasms rymers foedera and doctrines of the constitution but a green solid place that grew corn and several other things the sun shone on it the vicissitude of seasons and human fortunes cloth was woven and worn ditches were dug furrowfields ploughed and houses built day by day all men and cattle rose to labour and night by night returned home weary to their several lairs in wondrous dualism then as now lived nations of breathing men alternating in all ways between light and dark between joy and sorrow between rest and toilbetween hope hope reaching high as heaven and fear deep as very hell not vapour fantasms rymers foedera at all coeurdelion was not a theatrical popinjay with greaves and steelcap on it but a man living upon victualsnot imported by peels tariff coeurdelion came palpably athwart this jocelin at st edmundsbury and had almost peeled the sacred gold feretrum or st edmund shrine itself to ransom him out of the danube jail  these clear eyes of neighbour jocelin looked on the bodily presence of king john the very john sansterre or lackland who signed magna charta afterwards in runnymead lackland with a great retinue boarded once for the matter of a fortnight in st edmundsbury convent daily in the very eyesight palpable to the very fingers of our jocelin o jocelin what did he say what did he do how looked he lived heat the very lowest what coat or breeches had he on jocelin is obstinately silent jocelin marks down what interests him entirely deaf to us with jocelins eyes we discern almost nothing of john lackland as through a glass darkly we with our own eyes and appliances intensely looking discern at most a blustering dissipated human figure with a kind of blackguard quality air in cramoisy velvet or other uncertain texture uncertain cut with much plumage and fringing amid numerous other human figures of the like riding abroad with hawks talking noisy nonsensetearing out the bowels of st edmundsbury convent its larders namely and cellars in the most ruinous way by living at rack and manger there jocelin notes only with a slight subacidity of manner that the kings majesty dominus rex did leave as gift for our st edmund shrine a handsome enough silk cloakor rather pretended to leave for one of his retinue borrowed it of us and we never got sight of it again and on the whole that the dominus rex at departing gave us thirteen sterlingii one shilling and one penny to say a mass for him and so departedlike a shabby lackland as he was thirteen pence sterling this was what the convent got from lackland for all the victuals he and his had made away with we of course said our mass for him having covenanted to do itbut let impartial posterity judge with what degree of fervour  and in this manner vanishes king lackland traverses swiftly our strange intermittent magicmirror jingling the shabby thirteen pence merely and rides with his hawks into egyptian night again it is jocelins manner with all things and it is mens manner and mens necessity how intermittent is our good jocelin marking down without eye to us what he finds interesting how much in jocelin as in all history and indeed in all nature is at once inscrutable and certain so dim yet so indubitable exciting us to endless considerations for king lackland was there verily he and did leave these tredecim sterlingii if nothing more and did live and look in one way or the other and a whole world was living and looking along with him there we say is the grand peculiarity the immeasurable one distinguishing to a really infinite degree the poorest historical fact from all fiction whatsoever fiction imagination imaginative poetry c c except as the vehicle for truth or fact of some sortwhich surely a man should first try various other ways of vehiculating and conveying safewhat is it let the minerva and other presses respond  but it is time we were in st edmundsbury monastery and seven good centuries off if indeed it be possible by any aid of jocelin by any human art to get thither with a reader or two still following us  footnotes  3 chronica jocelini de brakelonda de rebus gestis samsonis abbatis monasterii sancti edmundi nunc primum typis mandata curante johanne gage rokewood camden society london 1840     chapter ii  st edmundsbury   the burg bury or berry as they call it of st edmund is still a prosperous brisk town beautifully diversifying with its clear brick houses ancient clean streets and twenty or fifteen thousand busy souls the general grassy face of suffolk looking out right pleasantly from its hillslope towards the rising sun and on the eastern edge of it still runs long black and massive a range of monastic ruins into the wide internal spaces of which the stranger is admitted on payment of one shilling internal spaces laid out at present as a botanic garden here stranger or townsman sauntering at his leisure amid these vast grim venerable ruins may persuade himself that an abbey of st edmundsbury did once exist nay there is no doubt of it see here the ancient massive gateway of architecture interesting to the eye of dilettantism and farther on that other ancient gateway now about to tumble unless dilettantism in these very months can subscribe money to cramp it and prop it  here sure enough is an abbey beautiful in the eye of dilettantism giant pedantry also will step in with its huge dugdale and other enormous monasticons under its arm and cheerfully apprise you that this was a very great abbey owner and indeed creator of st edmunds town itself owner of wide lands and revenues nay that its lands were once a county of themselves that indeed king canute or knut was very kind to it and gave st edmund his own gold crown off his head on one occasion for the rest that the monks were of such and such a genus such and such a number that they had so many carucates of land in this hundred and so many in that and then farther that the large tower or belfry was built by such a one and the smaller belfry was built by c ctill human nature can stand no more of it till human nature desperately take refuge in forgetfulness almost in flat disbelief of the whole business monks monastery belfries carucates and all alas what mountains of dead ashes wreck and burnt bones does assiduous pedantry dig up from the past time and name it history and philosophy of history till as we say the human soul sinks wearied and bewildered till the past time seems all one infinite incredible gray void without sun stars hearthfires or candlelight dim offensive dustwhirlwinds filling universal nature and over your historical library it is as if all the titans had written for themselves dry rubbish shot here  and yet these grim old walls are not a dilettantism and dubiety they are an earnest fact it was a most real and serious purpose they were built for yes another world it was when these black ruins white in their new mortar and fresh chiselling first saw the sun as walls long ago gauge not with thy dilettante compasses with that placid dilettante simper the heavenswatchtower of our fathers the fallen godshouses the golgotha of true souls departed  their architecture belfries landcarucates yesand that is but a small item of the matter does it never give thee pause this other strange item of it that men then had a soulnot by hearsay alone and as a figure of speech but as a truth that they knew and practically went upon verily it was another world then their missals have become incredible a sheer platitude sayest thou yes a most poor platitude and even if thou wilt an idolatry and blasphemy should any one persuade thee to believe them to pretend praying by them but yet it is pity we had lost tidings of our soulsactually we shall have to go in quest of them again or worse in all ways will befall a certain degree of soul as ben jonson reminds us is indispensable to keep the very body from destruction of the frightfulest sort to save us says he the expense of salt ben has known men who had soul enough to keep their body and five senses from becoming carrion and save saltmen and also nations you may look in manchester hungermobs and cornlaw commons houses and various other quarters and say whether either soul or else salt is not somewhat wanted at present  another world truly and this present poor distressed world might get some profit by looking wisely into it instead of foolishly but at lowest o dilettante friend let us know always that it was a world and not a void infinite of gray haze with fantasms swimming in it these old st edmundsbury walls i say were not peopled with fantasms but with men of flesh and blood made altogether as we are had thou and i then been who knows but we ourselves had taken refuge from an evil time and fled to dwell here and meditate on an eternity in such fashion as we could alas how like an old osseous fragment a broken blackened shinbone of the old dead ages this black ruin looks out not yet covered by the soil still indicating what a once gigantic life lies buried there it is dead now and dumb but was alive once and spake for twenty generations here was the earthly arena where painful living men worked out their lifewrestlelooked at by earth by heaven and hell bells tolled to prayers and men of many humours various thoughts chanted vespers matinsand round the little islet of their life rolled forever as round ours still rolls though we are blind and deaf the illimitable ocean tinting all things with its eternal hues and reflexes making strange prophetic music how silent now all departed clean gone the worlddramaturgist has written exeunt the devouring timedemons have made away with it all and in its stead there is either nothing or what is worse offensive universal dustclouds and gray eclipse of earth and heaven from dry rubbish shot here                                       truly it is no easy matter to get across the chasm of seven centuries filled with such material but here of all helps is not a boswell the welcomest even a small boswell veracity true simplicity of heart how valuable are these always he that speaks what is really in him will find men to listen though under never such impediments even gossip springing free and cheery from a human heart this too is a kind of veracity and speechmuch preferable to pedantry and inane gray haze jocelin is weak and garrulous but he is human through the thin watery gossip of our jocelin we do get some glimpses of that deepburied time discern veritably though in a fitful intermittent manner these antique figures and their lifemethod face to face beautifully in our earnest loving glance the old centuries melt from opaque to partially translucent transparent here and there and the void black night one finds is but the summingup of innumerable peopled luminous days not parchment chartularies doctrines of the constitution o dryasdust not altogether my erudite friend  readers who please to go along with us into this poor jocelini chronica shall wander inconveniently enough as in wintry twilight through some poor stript hazelgrove rustling with foolish noises and perpetually hindering the eyesight but across which here and there some real human figure is seen moving very strange whom we could hail if he would answerand we look into a pair of eyes deep as our own imaging our own but all unconscious of us to whom we for the time are become as spirits and invisible     chapter iii  landlord edmund   some three centuries or so had elapsed since beodricsworth4 became st edmunds stow st edmunds town and monastery before jocelin entered himself a novice there it was says he the year after the flemings were defeated at fornham st genevieve  much passes away into oblivion this glorious victory over the flemings at fornham has at the present date greatly dimmed itself out of the minds of men a victory and battle nevertheless it was in its time some thricerenowned earl of leicester not of the de montfort breed as may be read in philosophical and other histories could any human memory retain such things had quarrelled with his sovereign henry second of the name had been worsted it is like and maltreated and obliged to fly to foreign parts but had rallied there into new vigour and so in the year 1173 returns across the german sea with a vengeful army of flemings returns to the coast of suffolk to framlingham castle where he is welcomed westward towards st edmundsbury and fornham church where he is met by the constituted authorities with posse comitatus and swiftly cut in pieces he and his or laid by the heels on the right bank of the obscure river larkas traces still existing will verify  for the river lark though not very discoverably still runs or stagnates in that country and the battleground is there serving at present as a pleasureground to his grace of northumberland copper pennies of henry ii are still found thererotted out from the pouches of poor slain soldiers who had not had time to buy liquor with them in the river lark itself was fished up within mans memory an antique gold ring which fond dilettantism can almost believe may have been the very ring countess leicester threw away in her flight into that same lark river or ditch5 nay few years ago in tearing out an enormous superannuated ashtree now grown quite corpulent bursten superfluous but long a fixture in the soil and not to be dislodged without revolutionthere was laid bare under its roots a circular mound of skeletons wonderfully complete all radiating from a centre faces upwards feet inwards a radiation not of light but of the nether darkness rather and evidently the fruit of battle for many of the heads were cleft or had arrowholes in them the battle of fornham therefore is a fact though a forgotten one no less obscure than undeniablelike so many other facts                                       like the st edmunds monastery itself who can doubt after what we have said that there was a monastery here at one time no doubt at all there was a monastery here no doubt some three centuries prior to this fornham battle there dwelt a man in these parts of the name of edmund king landlord duke or whatever his title was of the eastern countiesand a very singular man and landlord he must have been  for his tenants it would appear did not in the least complain of him his labourers did not think of burning his wheatstacks breaking into his gamepreserves very far the reverse of all that clear evidence satisfactory even to my friend dryasdust exists that on the contrary they honoured loved admired this ancient landlord to a quite astonishing degreeand indeed at last to an immeasurable and inexpressible degree for finding no limits or utterable words for their sense of his worth they took to beatifying and adoring him infinite admiration we are taught means worship  very singularcould we discover it what edmunds specific duties were above all what his method of discharging them with such results was would surely be interesting to know but are not very discoverable now his life has become a poetic nay a religious mythus though undeniably enough it was once a prose fact as our poor lives are and even a very rugged unmanageable one this landlord edmund did go about in leather shoes with femoralia and bodycoat of some sort on him and daily had his breakfast to procure and daily had contradictory speeches and most contradictory facts not a few to reconcile with himself no man becomes a saint in his sleep edmund for instance instead of reconciling those same contradictory facts and speeches to himselfwhich means subduing and in a manlike and godlike manner conquering them to himselfmight have merely thrown new contention into them new unwisdom into them and so been conquered by them much the commoner case in that way he had proved no saint or divinelooking man but a mere sinner and unfortunate blameable more or less diaboliclooking man no landlord edmund becomes infinitely admirable in his sleep  with what degree of wholesome rigour his rents were collected we hear not still less by what methods he preserved his game whether by bushing or howand if the partridgeseasons were excellent or were indifferent neither do we ascertain what kind of cornbill he passed or wiselyadjusted slidingscalebut indeed there were few spinners in those days and the nuisance of spinning and other dusty labour was not yet so glaring a one  how then it may be asked did this edmund rise into favour become to such astonishing extent a recognised farmers friend really except it were by doing justly and loving mercy to an unprecedented extent one does not know the man it would seem had walked as they say humbly with god humbly and valiantly with god struggling to make the earth heavenly as he could instead of walking sumptuously and pridefully with mammon leaving the earth to grow hellish as it liked not sumptuously with mammon how then could he encourage tradecause howel and james and many winemerchants to bless him and the tailors heart though in a very shortsighted manner to sing for joy much in this edmunds life is mysterious  that he could on occasion do what he liked with his own is meanwhile evident enough certain heathen physicalforce ultrachartists danes as they were then called coming into his territory with their five points or rather with their fiveandtwenty thousand points and edges too of pikes namely and battleaxes and proposing mere heathenism confiscation spoliation and fire and swordedmund answered that he would oppose to the utmost such savagery they took him prisoner again required his sanction to said proposals edmund again refused cannot we kill you cried theycannot i die answered he my life i think is my own to do what i like with and he died under barbarous tortures refusing to the last breath and the ultrachartist danes lost their propositionsand went with their points and other apparatus as is supposed to the devil the father of them some say indeed these danes were not ultrachartists but ultratories demanding to reap where they had not sown and live in this world without working though all the world should starve for it which likewise seems a possible hypothesis be what they might they went as we say to the devil and edmund doing what he liked with his own the earth was got cleared of them  another version is that edmund on this and the like occasions stood by his order the oldest and indeed only true order of nobility known under the stars that of just men and sons of god in opposition to unjust and sons of belialwhich latter indeed are secondoldest but yet a very unvenerable order this truly seems the likeliest hypothesis of all names and appearances alter so strangely in some halfscore centuries and all fluctuates chameleonlike taking now this hue now that thus much is very plain and does not change hue landlord edmund was seen and felt by all men to have done verily a mans part in this lifepilgrimage of his and benedictions and outflowing love and admiration from the universal heart were his meed welldone welldone cried the hearts of all men they raised his slain and martyred body washed its wounds with fastflowing universal tears tears of endless pity and yet of a sacred joy and triumph the beautifulest kind of tearsindeed perhaps the beautifulest kind of thing like a sky all flashing diamonds and prismatic radiance all weeping yet shone on by the everlasting sunand this is not a sky it is a soul and living face nothing liker the temple of the highest bright with some real effulgence of the highest is seen in this world  oh if all yankeeland follow a small good schnüspel the distinguished novelist with blazing torches dinnerinvitations universal hephephurrah feeling that he though small is something how might all angleland once follow a heromartyr and great true son of heaven it is the very joy of mans heart to admire where he can nothing so lifts him from all his mean imprisonments were it but for moments as true admiration thus it has been said all men especially all women are born worshippers and will worship if it be but possible possible to worship a something even a small one not so possible a mere loudblaring nothing what sight is more pathetic than that of poor multitudes of persons met to gaze at kings progresses lord mayors shows and other giltgingerbread phenomena of the worshipful sort in these times each so eager to worship each with a dim fatal sense of disappointment finding that he cannot rightly here these be thy gods o israel and thou art so willing to worshippoor israel  in this manner however did the men of the eastern counties take up the slain body of their edmund where it lay cast forth in the village of hoxne seek out the severed head and reverently reunite the same they embalmed him with myrrh and sweet spices with love pity and all high and awful thoughts consecrating him with a very storm of melodious adoring admiration and sundyed showers of tearsjoyfully yet with awe as all deep joy has something of the awful in it commemorating his noble deeds and godlike walk and conversation while on earth till at length the very pope and cardinals at rome were forced to hear of it and they summing up as correctly as they well could with advocatusdiaboli pleadings and their other forms of process the general verdict of mankind declared that he had in very fact led a heros life in this world and being now gone was gone as they conceived to god above and reaping his reward there such they said was the best judgment they could form of the caseand truly not a bad judgment acquiesced in zealously adopted with full assent of private judgment by all mortals                                       the rest of st edmunds history for the reader sees he has now become a saint is easily conceivable pious munificence provided him a loculus a feretrum or shrine built for him a wooden chapel a stone temple ever widening and growing by new pious giftssuch the overflowing heart feels it a blessedness to solace itself by giving st edmunds shrine glitters now with diamond flowerages with a plating of wrought gold the wooden chapel as we say has become a stone temple stately masonries longdrawn arches cloisters sounding aisles buttress it begirdle it far and wide regimented companies of men of whom our jocelin is one devote themselves in every generation to meditate here on mans nobleness and awfulness and celebrate and show forth the same as they best canthinking they will do it better here in presence of god the maker and of the so awful and so noble made by him in one word st edmunds body has raised a monastery round it to such length in such manner has the spirit of the time visibly taken body and crystallised itself here new gifts houses farms

and noble loyal women let dryasdust and divine silence be the record beodricsworth has become st edmunds buryand lasts visible to this hour all this that thou now seest and namest bury town is properly the funeral monument of saint or landlord edmund the present respectable mayor of bury may be said like a fakeer little as he thinks of it to have his dwelling in the extensive manysculptured

singularly cattle says my erudite friend     chapter iv  abbot hugo   it is true all things have two faces a light one and a dark it is true in three centuries much imperfection accumulates many an ideal monastic or other shooting forth into practice as it can grows to a strange enough reality and we have to ask with amazement is this your ideal for alas the ideal always has to grow in the real and to seek out its bed and board there often in a very sorry way no beautifulest poet is a birdofparadise living on perfumes sleeping in the æther with outspread wings the heroic independent of bed and board is found in drurylane theatre only to avoid disappointments let us bear this in mind  by the law of nature too all manner of ideals have their fatal limits and lot their appointed periods of youth of maturity or perfection of decline degradation and final death and disappearance there is nothing born but has to die ideal monasteries once grown real do seek bed and board in this world do find it more and more successfully do get at length too intent on finding it exclusively intent on that they are then like diseased corpulent bodies fallen idiotic which merely eat and sleep ready for dissolution by a henry the eighth or some other jocelins st edmundsbury is still far from this last dreadful state but here too the reader will prepare himself to see an ideal not sleeping in the æther like a birdofparadise but roosting as the common woodfowl do in an imperfect uncomfortable more or less contemptible manner                                       abbot hugo as jocelin breaking at once into the heart of the business apprises us had in those days grown old grown rather blind and his eyes were somewhat darkened aliquantulum caligaverunt oculi ejus he dwelt apart very much in his talamus or peculiar chamber got into the hands of flatterers a set of mealymouthed persons who strove to make the passing hour easy for himfor him easy and for themselves profitable accumulating in the distance mere mountains of confusion old dominus hugo sat inaccessible in this way far in the interior wrapt in his warm flannels and delusions inaccessible to all voice of fact and bad grew ever worse with us not that our worthy old dominus abbas was inattentive to the divine offices or to the maintenance of a devout spirit in us or in himself but the accountbooks of the convent fell into the frightfulest state and hugos annual budget grew yearly emptier or filled with futile expectations fatal deficit wind and debts  his one worldly care was to raise ready money sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and how he raised it from usurious insatiable jews every fresh jew sticking on him like a fresh horseleech sucking his and our life out crying continually give give take one example instead of scores our camera having fallen into ruin william the sacristan received charge to repair it strict charge but no money abbot hugo would and indeed could give him no fraction of money the camera in ruins and hugo penniless and inaccessible willelmus sacrista borrowed forty marcs some sevenandtwenty pounds of benedict the jew and patchedup our camera again but the means of repaying him there were no means hardly could sacrista cellerarius or any public officer get ends to meet on the indispensablest scale with their shrunk allowances ready money had vanished  benedicts twentyseven pounds grew rapidly at compoundinterest and at length when it had amounted to a hundred pounds he on a day of settlement presents the account to hugo himself hugo already owed him another hundred of his own and so here it has become two hundred hugo in a fine frenzy threatens to depose the sacristan to do this and do that but in the mean while how to quiet your insatiable jew hugo for this couple of hundreds grants the jew his bond for four hundred payable at the end of four years at the end of four years there is of course still no money and the jew now gets a bond for eight hundred and eighty pounds to be paid by instalments fourscore pounds every year here was a way of doing business  neither yet is this insatiable jew satisfied or settled with he had papers against us of small debts fourteen years old his modest claim amounts finally to twelve hundred pounds besides interestand one hopes he never got satisfied in this world one almost hopes he was one of those beleaguered jews who hanged themselves in york castle shortly afterwards and had his usances and quittances and horseleech papers summarily set fire to for approximate justice will strive to accomplish itself if not in one way then in another jews and also christians and heathens who accumulate in this manner though furnished with never so many parchments do at times get their grinderteeth successively pulled out of their head each day a new grinder till they consent to disgorge again a sad factworth reflecting on  jocelin we see is not without secularity our dominus abbas was intent enough on the divine offices but then his accountbooksone of the things that strike us most throughout in jocelins chronicle and indeed in eadmers anselm and other old monastic books written evidently by pious men is this that there is almost no mention whatever of personal religion in them that the whole gist of their thinking and speculation seems to be the privileges of our order strict exaction of our dues gods honour meaning the honour of our saint and so forth is not this singular a body of men set apart for perfecting and purifying their own souls do not seem disturbed about that in any measure the ideal says nothing about its idea says much about finding bed and board for itself how is this  why for one thing bed and board are a matter very apt to come to speech it is much easier to speak of them than of ideas and they are sometimes much more pressing with some nay for another thing may not this religious reticence in these devout good souls be perhaps a merit and sign of health in them jocelin eadmer and such religious men have as yet nothing of methodism no doubt or even root of doubt religion is not a diseased selfintrospection an agonising inquiry their duties are clear to them the way of supreme good plain indisputable and they are travelling on it religion lies over them like an allembracing heavenly canopy like an atmosphere and lifeelement which is not spoken of which in all things is presupposed without speech is not serene or complete religion the highest aspect of human nature as serene cant or complete noreligion is the lowest and miserablest between which two all manner of earnest methodisms introspections agonising inquiries never so morbid shall play their respective parts not without approbation                                       but let any reader fancy himself one of the brethren in st edmundsbury monastery under such circumstances how can a lord abbot all stuckover with horseleeches of this nature front the world he is fast losing his lifeblood and the convent will be as one of pharaohs lean kine old monks of experience draw their hoods deeper down careful what they say the monks first duty is obedience our lord the king hearing of such work sends down his almoner to make investigations but what boots it abbot hugo assembles us in chapter asks if there is any complaint not a soul of us dare answer yes thousands but we all stand silent and the prior even says that things are in a very comfortable condition whereupon old abbot hugo turning to the royal messenger says you seeand the business terminates in that way i as a briskeyed noticing youth and novice could not help asking of the elders asking of magister samson in particular why he wellinstructed and a knowing man had not spoken out and brought matters to a bearing magister samson was teacher of the novices appointed to breed us up to the rules and i loved him well fili mi answered samson the burnt child shuns the fire dost thou not know our lord the abbot sent me once to acre in norfolk to solitary confinement and breadandwater already the hinghams hugo and robert have just got home from banishment for speaking this is the hour of darkness the hour when flatterers rule and are believed videat dominus let the lord see and judge  in very truth what could poor old abbot hugo do a frail old man and the philistines were upon himthat is to say the hebrews he had nothing for it but to shrink away from them get back into his warm flannels into his warm delusions again happily before it was quite too late he bethought him of pilgriming to st thomas of canterbury he set out with a fit train in the autumn days of the year 1180 near rochester city his mule threw him dislocated his poor kneepan raised incurable inflammatory fever and the poor old man got his dismissal from the whole coil at once st thomas à becket though in a circuitous way had brought deliverance neither jew usurers nor grumbling monks nor other importunate despicability of men or mudelements afflicted abbot hugo any more but he dropt his rosaries closed his accountbooks closed his old eyes and lay down into the long sleep heavyladen hoary old dominus hugo fare thee well  one thing we cannot mention without a due thrill of horror namely that in the empty exchequer of dominus hugo there was not found one penny to distribute to the poor that they might pray for his soul by a kind of godsend fifty shillings did in the very nick of time fall due or seem to fall due from one of his farmers the firmarius de palegrava and he paid it and the poor had it though alas this too only seemed to fall due and we had it to pay again afterwards dominus hugos apartments were plundered by his servants to the last portable stool in a few minutes after the breath was out of his body forlorn old hugo fare thee well forever     chapter v  twelfth century   our abbot being dead the dominus rex henry ii or ranulf de glanvill justiciarius of england for him set inspectors or custodiars over usnot in any breathless haste to appoint a new abbot our revenues coming into his own scaccarium or royal exchequer in the

memory thanks to thee jocelin boswell jerusalem was taken by the crusaders and again lost by them and richard coeurdelion veiled his face as he passed in sight of it but how many other things went on the while  thus too our trouble with the lakenheath eels is very great king knut namely or rather his queen who also did herself honour by honouring st edmund decreed by authentic deed yet extant on parchment that the holders of the town fields once beodrics should for one thing go yearly and catch us four thousand eels in the marshpools of lakenheath well they went they continued to go but in later times got into the way of returning with a most short account of eels not the due sixscore apiece no here are twoscore here are twenty tensometimes here are none at all heaven help us we could catch no more they were not there what is a distressed cellerarius to do we agree that each holder of so many acres shall pay one penny yearly and letgo the eels as too slippery but alas neither is this quite effectual the fields in my time have got divided among so many hands there is no catching of them either i have known our cellarer get sevenandtwenty pence formerly and now it is much if he get ten pence farthing vix decem denarios et obolum and then their sheep which they are bound to fold nightly in our pens for the manures sake and i fear do not always fold and their averpennies and their avragiums and their fodercorns and millandmarket dues thus in its undeniable but dim manner does old st edmundsbury spin and till and laboriously keep its pot boiling and st edmunds shrine

peoplehardly conceivable in the arkwright cornlaw ages of mere spinningmills and joemantons there is yet no methodism among us and we speak much of secularities no methodism our religion is not yet a horrible restless doubt still less a far horribler composed cant but a great heavenhigh unquestionability encompassing interpenetrating the whole of life imperfect as we may be we are here with our litanies shaven crowns vows of poverty to testify incessantly and indisputably to every heart that this earthly life and its riches and possessions and good and evil hap are not intrinsically a reality at all but are a shadow of realities eternal infinite that this timeworld as an airimage fearfully emblematic plays and flickers in the grand still mirror of eternity and mans little life has duties that are great that are alone great and go up to heaven and down to hell this with our poor litanies we testify and struggle to testify  which testified or not remembered by all men or forgotten by all men does verily remain the fact even in arkwright joemanton ages but it is incalculable when litanies have grown obsolete when fodercorns avragiums and all human dues and reciprocities have been fully changed into one great due of cash payment and mans duty to man reduces itself to handing him certain metal coins or covenanted moneywages and then shoving him out of doors and mans duty to god becomes a cant a doubt a dim inanity a pleasure of virtue or suchlike and the thing a man does infinitely fear the real hell of a man is that he do not make money and advance himselfi say it is incalculable what a change has introduced itself everywhere into human affairs how human affairs shall now circulate everywhere not healthy lifeblood in them but as it were a detestable copperas bankers ink and all is grown acrid divisive threatening dissolution and the huge tumultuous life of society is galvanic devilridden too truly possessed by a devil for in short mammon is not a god at all but a devil and even a very despicable devil follow the devil faithfully you are sure enough to go to the devil whither else can you goin such situations men look back with a kind of mournful recognition even on poor limited monkfigures with their poor litanies and reflect with ben jonson that soul is indispensable some degree of soul even to save you the expense of salt  for the rest it must be owned we monks of st edmundsbury are but a limited class of creatures and seem to have a somewhat dull life of it much given to idle gossip having indeed no other work when our chanting is over listless gossip for most part and a mitigated slander the fruit of idleness not of spleen we are dull insipid men many of us easyminded whom prayer and digestion of food will avail for a life we have to receive all strangers in our convent and lodge them gratis such and such sorts go by rule to the lord abbot and his special revenues such and such to us and our poor cellarer however straitened jews themselves send their wives and little ones hither in wartime into our pitanceria where they abide safe with due pittancesfor a consideration we have the fairest chances for collecting news some of us have a turn for reading books for meditation silence at times we even write books some of us can preach in englishsaxon in normanfrench and even in monklatin others cannot in any language or jargon being stupid  failing all else what gossip about one another this is a perennial resource how one hooded head applies itself to the ear of another and whisperstacenda willelmus sacrista for instance what does he nightly over in that sacristy of his frequent bibations frequentes bibationes et quædam tacendaeheu we have tempora minutionis stated seasons of bloodletting when we are all let blood together and then there is a general freeconference a sanhedrim of clatter notwithstanding our vow of poverty we can by rule amass to the extent of two shillings but it is to be given to our necessitous kindred or in charity poor monks thus too a certain canterbury monk was in the habit of slipping clanculo from his sleeve five shillings into the hand of his mother when she came to see him at the divine offices every two months once slipping the money clandestinely just in the act of taking leave he slipt it not into her hand but on the floor and another had it whereupon the poor monk coming to know it looked mere despair for some days till lanfranc the noble archbishop questioning his secret from him nobly made the sum seven shillings7 and said never mind                                       one monk of a taciturn nature distinguishes himself among these babbling ones the name of him samson he that answered jocelin fili mi a burnt child shuns the fire they call him norfolk barrator or litigious person for indeed being of grave taciturn ways he is not universally a favourite he has been in trouble more than once the reader is desired to mark this monk a personable man of sevenandforty stoutmade stands erect as a pillar with bushy eyebrows the eyes of him beaming into you in a really strange way the face massive grave with a very eminent nose his head almost bald its auburn remnants of hair and the copious ruddy beard getting slightly streaked with gray this is brother samson a man worth looking at  he is from norfolk as the nickname indicates from tottington in norfolk as we guess the son of poor parents there he has told me jocelin for i loved him much that once in his ninth year he had an alarming dreamas indeed we are all somewhat given to dreaming here little samson lying uneasily in his crib at tottington dreamed that he saw the arch enemy in person just alighted in front of some grand building with outspread batwings and stretching forth detestable clawed hands to grip him little samson and flyoff with him whereupon the little dreamer shrieked desperate to st edmund for help shrieked and again shrieked and st edmund a reverend heavenly figure did comeand indeed poor little samsons mother awakened by his shrieking did come and the devil and the dream both fled away fruitless on the morrow his mother pondering such an awful dream thought it were good to take him over to st edmunds own shrine and pray with him there see said little samson at sight of the abbeygate see mother this is the building i dreamed of his poor mother dedicated him to st edmundleft him there with prayers and tears what better could she do the exposition of the dream brother samson used to say was this diabolus with outspread batwings shadowed forth the pleasures of this world voluptates hujus sæculi which were about to snatch and fly away with me had not st edmund flung his arms round me that is to say made me a monk of his a monk accordingly brother samson is and here to this day where his mother left him a learned man of devout grave nature has studied at paris has taught in the town schools here and done much else can preach in three languages and like dr caius has had losses in his time a thoughtful firmstanding man much loved by some not loved by all his clear eyes flashing into you in an almost inconvenient way  abbot hugo as we said had his own difficulties with him abbot hugo had him in prison once to teach him what authority was and how to dread the fire in future for brother samson in the time of the antipopes had been sent to rome on business and returning successful was too latethe business had all misgone in the interim as tours to rome are still frequent with us english perhaps the reader will not grudge to look at the method of travelling thither in those remote ages we happily have in small compass a personal narrative of it through the clear eyes and memory of brother samson one peeps direct into the very bosom of that twelfth century and finds it rather curious the actual papa father or universal president of christendom as yet not grown chimerical sat there think of that only brother samson went to rome as to the real lightfountain of this lower world we nowbut let us hear brother samson as to his mode of travelling  you know what trouble i had for that church of woolpit how i was despatched to rome in the time of the schism between pope alexander and octavian and passed through italy at that season when all clergy carrying letters for our lord pope alexander were laid hold of and some were clapt in prison some hanged and some with nose and lips cut off were sent forward to our lord the pope for the disgrace and confusion of him in dedecus et confusionem ejus i however pretended to be scotch and putting on the garb of a scotchman and taking the gesture of one walked along and when anybody mocked at me i would brandish my staff in the manner of that weapon they call gaveloc8 uttering comminatory words after the way of the scotch to those that met and questioned me who i was i made no answer but ride ride rome turne cantwereberei9 thus did i to conceal myself and my errand and get safer to rome under the guise of a scotchman  having at last obtained a letter from our lord the pope according to my wishes i turned homewards again i had to pass through a certain strong town on my road and lo the soldiers thereof surrounded me seizing me and saying this vagabond iste solivagus who pretends to be scotch is either a spy or has letters from the false pope alexander and whilst they examined every stitch and rag of me my leggings caligas breeches and even the old shoes that i carried over my shoulder in the way of the scotchi put my hand into the leather scrip i wore wherein our lord the popes letter lay close by a little jug ciffus i had for drinking out of and the lord god so pleasing and st edmund i got out both the letter and the jug together in such a way that extending my arm aloft i held the letter hidden between jug and hand they saw the jug but the letter they saw not and thus i escaped out of their hands in the name of the lord whatever money i had they took from me wherefore i had to beg from door to door without any payment sine omni expensa till i came to england again but hearing that the woolpit church was already given to geoffry ridell my soul was struck with sorrow because i had laboured in vain coming home therefore i sat me down secretly under the shrine of st edmund fearing lest our lord abbot should seize and imprison me though i had done no mischief nor was there a monk who durst speak to me nor a laic who durst bring me food except by stealth10  such resting and welcoming found brother samson with his worn soles and strong heart he sits silent revolving many thoughts at the foot of st edmunds shrine in the wide earth if it be not saint edmund what friend or refuge has he our lord abbot hearing of him sent the proper officer to lead him down to prison and clap footgyves on him there another poor official furtively brought him a cup of wine bade him be comforted in the lord samson utters no complaint obeys in silence our lord abbot taking counsel of it banished me to acre and there i had to stay long  our lord abbot next tried samson with promotions made him subsacristan made him librarian which he liked best of all being passionately fond of books samson with many thoughts in him again obeyed in silence discharged his offices to perfection but never thanked our lord abbotseemed rather as if looking into him with those clear eyes of his whereupon abbot hugo said se nunquam vidisse he had never seen such a man whom no severity would break to complain and no kindness soften into smiles or thanksa questionable kind of man  in this way not without troubles but still in an erect clearstanding manner has brother samson reached his fortyseventh year and his ruddy beard is getting slightly grizzled he is endeavouring in these days to have various broken things thatched in nay perhaps to have the choir itself completed for he can bear nothing ruinous he has gathered heaps of lime and sand has masons slaters working he and warinus monachus noster who are joint keepers of the shrine paying out the money dulyfurnished by charitable burghers of st edmundsbury they say charitable burghers of st edmundsbury to me jocelin it seems rather samson and warinus whom he leads have privily hoarded the oblations at the shrine itself in these late years of indolent dilapidation while abbot hugo sat wrapt inaccessible and are struggling in this prudent way to have the rain kept out11under what conditions sometimes has wisdom to struggle with folly get folly persuaded to so much as thatch out the rain from itself for indeed if the infant govern the nurse what dextrous practice on the nurses part will not be necessary  it is a new regret to us that in these circumstances our lord the kings custodiars interfering prohibited all building or thatching from whatever source and no choir shall be completed and rain and time for the present shall have their way willelmus sacrista he of the frequent bibations and some things not be spoken of he with his red nose i am of opinion had made complaint to the custodiars wishing to do samson an ill turnsamson his subsacristan with those clear eyes could not be a prime favourite of his samson again obeys in silence  footnotes  7 eadmeri hist

widowed state had we prayed to the lord and st edmund singing weekly a matter of oneandtwenty penitential psalms on our knees in the choir that a fit pastor might be vouchsafed us and says jocelin had some known what abbot we were to get they had not been so devout i believebozzy jocelin opens to mankind the floodgates of authentic convent gossip we listen as in a dionysius ear to the inanest hubbub like the voices at virgils horngate of dreams even gossip seven centuries off has significance list list how like men are to one another in all centuries  dixit quidam de quodam a certain person said of a certain person he that frater is a good monk probabilis persona knows much of the order and customs of the church and though not so perfect a philosopher as some others would make a very good abbot old abbot ording still famed among us knew little of letters besides as we read in fables it is better to choose a log for king than a serpent never so wise that will venomously hiss and bite his subjectsimpossible answered the other how can such a man make a sermon in the chapter or to the people on festivaldays when he is without letters how can he have the skill to bind and to loose he who does not understand the scriptures how  and then another said of another alius de alio that frater is a homo literatus eloquent sagacious vigorous in discipline loves the convent much has suffered much for its sake to which a third party answers from all your great clerks good lord deliver us from norfolk barrators and surly persons that it would please thee to preserve us we beseech thee to hear us good lord then another quidam said of another quodam that frater is a good manager husebondus but was swiftly answered god forbid that a man who can neither read nor chant nor celebrate the divine offices an unjust person withal and grinder of the faces of the poor should ever be abbot one man it appears is nice in his victuals another is indeed wise but apt to slight inferiors hardly at the pains to answer if they argue with him too foolishly and so each aliquis concerning his aliquothrough whole pages of electioneering babble for says jocelin so many men as many minds our monks at time of bloodletting tempore minutionis holding their sanhedrim of babble would talk in this manner brother samson i remarked never said anything sat silent sometimes smiling but he took good note of what others said and would bring it up on occasion twenty years after as for me jocelin i was of opinion that some skill in dialectics to distinguish true from false would be good in an abbot i spake as a rash novice in those days some conscientious words of a certain benefactor of mine and behold one of those sons of belial ran and reported them to him so that he never after looked at me with the same face again poor bozzy  such is the buzz and frothy simmering ferment of the general mind and nomind struggling to make itself up as the phrase is or ascertain what it does really want no easy matter in most cases st edmundsbury in that candlemas season of the year 1182 is a busily fermenting place the very clothmakers sit meditative at their looms asking who shall be abbot the sochemanni speak of it driving their oxteams afield the old women with their spindles and none yet knows what the days will bring forth                                       the prior

social act nay at bottom the one important social act given the men a people choose the people itself in its exact worth and worthlessness is given a heroic people chooses heroes and is happy a valet or flunky people chooses shamheroes what are called quacks thinking them heroes and is not happy the grand summary of a mans spiritual condition what brings out all his herohood and insight or all his flunkyhood and horneyed dimness is this question put to him what man dost thou honour which is thy ideal of a man or nearest that so too of a people for a people too every people speaks its choicewere it only by silently obeying and not revoltingin the course of a century or so nor are electoral methods reform bills and suchlike unimportant a peoples electoral methods are in the longrun the express image of its electoral talent tending and gravitating perpetually irresistibly to a conformity with that and are at all stages very significant of the people judicious readers of these times are not disinclined to see how monks elect their abbot in the twelfth century how the st edmundsbury mountain manages its midwifery and what mouse or man the outcome is     chapter viii  the election   accordingly our prior assembles us in chapter and we adjuring him before god to do justly nominates not by our selection yet with our assent twelve monks moderately satisfactory of whom are hugo thirdprior brother dennis a venerable man walter the medicus samson subsacrista and other esteemed charactersthough willelmus sacrista of the red nose too is one these shall proceed straightway to waltham and there elect the abbot as they may and can monks are sworn to obedience must not speak too loud under penalty of footgyves limbo and breadandwater yet monks too would know what it is they are obeying the st edmundsbury community has no hustings ballotbox indeed no open voting yet by various vague manipulations pulsefeelings we struggle to ascertain what its virtual aim is and succeed better or worse  this question however rises alas a quite preliminary question will the dominus rex allow us to choose freely it is to be hoped well if so we agree to choose one of our own convent if not if the dominus rex will force a stranger on us we decide on demurring the prior and his twelve shall demur we can appeal plead remonstrate appeal even to the pope but trust it will not be necessary then there is this other question raised by brother samson what if the thirteen should not themselves be able to agree brother samson subsacrista one remarks is ready oftenest with some question some suggestion that has wisdom in it though a servant of servants and saying little his words all tell having sense in them it seems by his light mainly that we steer ourselves in this great dimness  what if the thirteen should not themselves be able to agree speak samson and advisecould not hints samson six of our venerablest elders be chosen by us a kind of electoral committee here and now of these with their hand on the gospels with their eye on the sacrosancta we take oath that they will do faithfully let these in secret and as before god agree on three whom they reckon fittest write their names in a paper and deliver the same sealed forthwith to the thirteen one of those three the thirteen shall fix on if permitted if not permitted that is to say if the dominus rex force us to demurthe paper shall be brought back unopened and publicly burned that no mans secret bring him into trouble  so samson advises so we act wisely in this and in other crises of the business our electoral committee its eye on the sacrosancta is soon named soon sworn and we strikingup the fifth psalm verba mea      give ear unto my words o lord     my meditation weigh  march out chanting and leave the six to their work in the chapter here their work before long they announce as finished they with their eye on the sacrosancta imprecating the lord to weigh and witness their meditation have fixed on three names and written them in this sealed paper let samson subsacrista general servant of the party take charge of it on the morrow morning our prior and his twelve will be ready to get under way  this then is the ballotbox and electoral winnowingmachine they have at st edmundsbury a mind fixed on the thrice holy an appeal to god on high to witness their meditation by far the best and indeed the only good electoral winnowingmachineif men have souls in them totally worthless it is true and even hideous and poisonous if men have no souls but without soul alas what winnowingmachine in human elections can be of avail we cannot get along without soul we stick fast the mournfulest spectacle and salt itself will not save us                                       on the morrow morning accordingly our thirteen set forth or rather our prior and eleven for samson as general servant of the party has to linger settling many things at length he too gets upon the road and carrying the sealed paper in a leather pouch hung round his neck and froccum bajulans in ulnis thanks to thee bozzy jocelin his frockskirts looped over his elbow showing substantial sternworks tramps stoutly along away across the heath not yet of newmarket and horsejockeying across your fleamdike and devilsdike no longer useful as a mercian eastanglian boundary or bulwark continually towards waltham and the bishop of winchesters house there for his majesty is in that brother samson as pursebearer has the reckoning always when there is one to pay delays are numerous progress none of the swiftest  but in the solitude of the convent destiny thus big and in her birthtime what gossiping what babbling what dreaming of dreams the secret of the three our electoral elders alone know some abbot we shall have to govern us but which abbot oh which one monk discerns in a vision of the nightwatches that we shall get an abbot of our own body without needing to demur a prophet appeared to him clad all in white and said ye shall have one of yours and he will rage among you like a wolf sæviet ut lupus verilythen which of ours another monk now dreams he has seen clearly which a certain figure taller by head and shoulders than the other two dressed in alb and pallium and with the attitude of one about to fightwhich tall figure a wise editor would rather not name at this stage of the business enough that the vision is true that saint edmund himself pale and awful seemed to rise from his shrine with naked feet and say audibly he ille shall veil my feet which part of the vision also proves true such guessing visioning dim perscrutation of the momentous future the very clothmakers old women all townsfolk speak of it and more than once it is reported in st edmundsbury this one is elected and then this one and that other who knows                                       but now sure enough at waltham on the second sunday of quadragesima which dryasdust declares to mean the 22d day of february year 1182 thirteen st edmundsbury monks are at last seen processioning towards the winchester manorhouse and in some high presencechamber and hall of state get access to henry ii in all his glory what a hallnot imaginary in the least but entirely real and indisputable though so extremely dim to us sunk in the deep distances of night the winchester manorhouse has fled bodily like a dream of the old night not dryasdust himself can show a wreck of it house and people royal and episcopal lords and varlets where are they why there i say seven centuries off sunk so far in the night there they are peep through the blankets of the old night and thou wilt see king henry himself is visibly there a vivid noblelooking man with grizzled beard in glittering uncertain costume with earls round him and bishops and dignitaries in the like the hall is large and has for one thing an altar near itchapel and altar adjoining it but what gilt seats carved tables carpeting of rushcloth what arrashangings and huge fire of logsalas it has human life in it and is not that the grand miracle in what hangings or costume soever  the dominus rex benignantly receiving our thirteen with their obeisance and graciously declaring that he will strive to act for gods honour and the churchs good commands by the bishop of winchester and geoffrey the chancellorgalfridus cancellarius henrys and the fair rosamonds authentic son present herecommands that they the said thirteen do now withdraw and fix upon three from their own monastery a work soon done the three hanging ready round samsons neck in that leather pouch of his breaking the seal we find the nameswhat think ye of it ye higher dignitaries thou indolent prior thou willelmus sacrista with the red bottlenosethe names in this order of samson subsacrista of roger the distressed cellarer of hugo tertiusprior  the higher dignitaries all omitted here flush suddenly red in the face but have nothing to say one curious fact and question certainly is how hugo thirdprior who was of the electoral committee came to nominate himself as one of the three a curious fact which hugo thirdprior has never yet entirely explained that i know ofhowever we return and report to the king our three names merely altering the order putting samson last as lowest of all the king at recitation of our three asks us who are they were they born in my domain totally unknown to me you must nominate three others whereupon willelmus sacrista says our prior must be named quia caput nostrum est being already our head and the prior responds willelmus sacrista is a fit man bonus vir estfor all his red nose tickle me toby and ill tickle thee venerable dennis too is named none in his conscience can say nay there are now six on our list well said the king they have done it swiftly they deus est cum eis the monks withdraw again and majesty revolves for a little with his pares and episcopi lords or lawwards and souloverseers the thoughts of the royal breast the monks wait silent in an outer room  in short while they are next ordered to add yet another three but not from their own convent from other convents for the honour of my kingdom herewhat is to be done here we will demur if need be we do name three however for the nonce the prior of st faiths a good monk of st neots a good monk of st albans good men all all made abbots and dignitaries since at this hour there are now nine upon our list what the thoughts of the dominus rex may be farther the dominus rex thanking graciously sends out word that we shall now strike off three the three strangers are instantly struck off willelmus sacrista adds that he will of his own accord declinea touch of grace and respect for the sacrosancta even in willelmus the king then orders us to strike off a couple more then yet one more hugo thirdprior goes and roger cellerarius and venerable monk dennisand now there remain on our list two only samson subsacrista and the prior  which of these two it were hard to sayby monks who may get themselves footgyved and thrown into limbo for speaking we humbly request that the bishop of winchester and geoffrey the chancellor may again enter and help us to decide which do you want asks the bishop venerable dennis made a speech commending the persons of the prior and samson but always in the corner of his discourse in angulo sui sermonis brought samson in i see said the bishop we are to understand that your prior is somewhat remiss that you want to have him you call samson for abbot either of them is good said venerable dennis almost trembling but we would have the better if it pleased god which of the two do you want inquires the bishop pointedly samson answered dennis samson echoed all of the rest that durst speak or echo anything and samson is reported to the king accordingly his majesty advising of it for a moment orders that samson be brought in with the other twelve  the kings majesty looking at us somewhat sternly then says you present to me samson i do not know him had it been your prior whom i do know i should have accepted him however i will now do as you wish but have a care of yourselves by the true eyes of god per veros oculos dei if you manage badly i will be upon you samson therefore steps forward kisses the kings feet but swiftly rises erect again swiftly turns towards the altar uplifting with the other twelve in clear tenornote the fiftyfirst psalm miserere mei deus      after thy lovingkindness lord     have mercy upon me  with firm voice firm step and head no change in his countenance whatever by gods eyes said the king that one i think will govern the abbey well by the same oath charged to your majestys account i too am precisely of that opinion it is some while since i fell in with a likelier man anywhere than this new abbot samson long life to him and may the lord have mercy on him as abbot                                       thus then have the st edmundsbury monks without express ballotbox or other good winnowingmachine contrived to accomplish the most important social feat a body of men can do to winnowout the man that is to govern them and truly one sees not that by any winnowingmachine whatever they could have done it better o ye kind heavens there is in every nation and community a fittest a wisest bravest best whom could we find and make king over us all were in very truth wellthe best that god and nature had permitted us to make it by what art discover him will the heavens in their pity teach us no art for our need of him is great  ballotboxes reform bills winnowingmachines all these are good or are not so goodalas brethren how can these i say be other than inadequate be other than failures melancholy to behold dim all souls of men to the divine the high and awful meaning of human worth and truth we shall never by all the machinery in birmingham discover the true and worthy it is written if we are ourselves valets there shall exist no hero for us we shall not know the hero when we see himwe shall take the quack for a hero and cry audibly through all ballotboxes and machinery whatsoever thou art he be thou king over us  what boots it seek only deceitful speciosity money with gilt carriages fame with newspaperparagraphs whatever name it bear you will find only deceitful speciosity godlike reality will be forever far from you the quack shall be legitimate inevitable king of you no earthly machinery able to exclude the quack ye shall be born thralls of the quack and suffer under him till your hearts are near broken and no french revolution or manchester insurrection or partial or universal volcanic combustions and explosions never so many can do more than change the figure of your quack the essence of him remaining for a time and timeshow long o prophet say some with a rather melancholy sneer alas ye unprophetic ever till this come about till deep misery if nothing softer will have driven you out of your speciosities into your sincerities and you find that there either is a godlike in the world or else ye are an unintelligible madness that there is a god as well as a mammon and a devil and a genius of luxuries and canting dilettantisms and vain shows how long that will be compute for yourselves my unhappy brothers     chapter ix  abbot samson   so then the bells of st edmundsbury clang out one and all and in church and chapel the organs go convent and town and all the west side of suffolk are in gala knights viscounts weavers spinners the entire population male and female young and old the very sockmen with their chubby infantsout to have a holiday and see the lord abbot arrive and there is stripping barefoot of the lord abbot at the gate and solemn leading of him in to the high altar and shrine with sudden silence of all the bells and organs as we kneel in deep prayer there and again with outburst of all the bells and organs and loud te deum from the general human windpipe and speeches by the leading viscount and giving of the kiss of brotherhood the whole woundup with popular games and dinner within doors of more than a thousand strong plus quam mille comedentibus in gaudio magno  in such manner is the selfsame samson once again returning to us welcomed on this occasion he that went away with his frockskirts looped over his arm comes back riding high suddenly made one of the dignitaries of this world reflective readers will admit that here was a trial for a man yesterday a poor mendicant allowed to possess not above two shillings of money and without authority to bid a dog run for himthis man today finds himself a dominus abbas mitred peer of parliament lord of manorhouses farms manors and wide lands a man with fifty knights under him and dependent swiftly obedient multitudes of men it is a change greater than napoleons so sudden withal as if one of the chandos daydrudges had on awakening some morning found that he overnight was become duke let samson with his clearbeaming eyes see into that and discern it if he can we shall now get the measure of him by a new scale of inches considerably more rigorous than the former was for if a noble soul is rendered tenfold beautifuler by victory and prosperity springing now radiant as into his own due element and sunthrone an ignoble one is rendered tenfold and hundredfold uglier pitifuler whatsoever vices whatsoever weaknesses were in the man the parvenu will show us them enlarged as in the solar microscope into frightful distortion nay how many mere seminal principles of vice hitherto all wholesomely kept latent may we now see unfolded as in the solar hothouse into growth into huge universallyconspicuous luxuriance and development                                       but is not this at any rate a singular aspect of what political and social capabilities nay let us say what depth and opulence of true social vitality lay in those old barbarous ages that the fit governor could be met with under such disguises could be recognised and laid hold of under such here he is discovered with a maximum of two shillings in his pocket and a leather scrip round his neck trudging along the highway his frockskirts looped over his arm they think this is he nevertheless the true governor and he proves to be so brethren have we no need of discovering true governors but will sham ones forever do for us these were absurd superstitious blockheads of monks and we are enlightened tenpound franchisers without taxes on knowledge where i say are our superior are our similar or at all comparable discoveries we also have eyes or ought to have we have hustings telescopes we have lights linklights and rushlights of an enlightened free press burning and dancing everywhere as in a universal torchdance singeing your whiskers as you traverse the public thoroughfares in town and country great souls true governors go about under all manner of disguises now as then such telescopes such enlightenmentand such discovery how comes it i say how comes it is it not lamentable is it not even in some sense amazing  alas the defect as we must often urge and again urge is less a defect of telescopes than of some eyesight those superstitious blockheads of the twelfth century had no telescopes but they had still an eye not ballotboxes only reverence for worth abhorrence of unworth it is the way with all barbarians thus mr sale informs me the old arab tribes would gather in liveliest gaudeamus and sing and kindle bonfires and wreathe crowns of honour and solemnly thank the gods that in their tribe too a poet had shown himself as indeed they well might for what usefuler i say not nobler and heavenlier thing could the gods doing their very kindest send to any tribe or nation in any time or circumstances i declare to thee my afflicted quackridden brother in spite of thy astonishment it is very lamentable we english find a poet as brave a man as has been made for a hundred years or so anywhere under the sun and do we kindle bonfires or thank the gods not at all we taking due counsel of it set the man to gauge alebarrels in the burgh of dumfries and pique ourselves on our patronage of genius  genius poet do we know what these words mean an inspired soul once more vouchsafed us direct from natures own great fireheart to see the truth and speak it and do it natures own sacred voice heard once more athwart the dreary boundless element of hearsaying and canting of twaddle and poltroonery in which the bewildered earth nigh perishing has lost its way hear once more ye bewildered benighted mortals listen once again to a voice from the inner lightsea and flamesea natures and truths own heart know the fact of your existence what it is put away the cant of it which it is not and knowing do and let it be well with you  george the third is defender of something we call the faith in those years george the third is head charioteer of the destinies of england to guide them through the gulf of french revolutions american independences and robert burns is gauger of ale in dumfries it is an iliad in a nutshell the physiognomy of a world now verging towards dissolution reduced now to spasms and deaththroes lies pictured in that one factwhich astonishes nobody except at me for being astonished at it the fruit of long ages of confirmed valethood entirely confirmed as into a law of nature clothworship and quackworship entirely confirmed valethoodwhich will have to unconfirm itself again god knows with difficulty enough                                       abbot samson had found a convent all in dilapidation rain beating through it material rain and metaphorical from all quarters of the compass willelmus sacrista sits drinking nightly and doing mere tacenda our larders are reduced to leanness jew harpies and unclean creatures our purveyors in our basket is no bread old women with their distaffs rush out on a distressed cellarer in shrill chartism you cannot stir abroad but jews and christians pounce upon you with unsettled bonds debts boundless seemingly as the national debt of england for four years our new lord abbot never went abroad but jew creditors and christian and all manner of creditors were about him driving him to very despair our prior is remiss our cellarers officials are remiss our monks are remiss what man is not remiss front this samson thou alone art there to front it it is thy task to front and fight this and to die or kill it may the lord have mercy on thee  to our antiquarian interest in poor jocelin and his convent where the whole aspect of existence the whole dialect of thought of speech of activity is so obsolete strange longvanished there now superadds itself a mild glow of human interest for abbot samson a real pleasure as at sight of mans work especially of governing which is mans highest work done well abbot samson had no experience in governing had served no apprenticeship to the trade of governingalas only the hardest apprenticeship to that of obeying he had never in any court given vadium or plegium says jocelin hardly ever seen a court when he was set to preside in one but it is astonishing continues jocelin how soon he learned the ways of business and in all sort of affairs became expert beyond others of the many persons offering him their service he retained one knight skilled in taking vadia and plegia and within the year was himself well skilled nay by and by the pope appoints him justiciary in certain causes the king one of his new circuit judges official osbert is heard saying that abbot is one of your shrewd ones disputator est if he go on as he begins he will cut out every lawyer of us12  why not what is to hinder this samson from governing there is in him what far transcends all apprenticeships in the man himself there exists a model of governing something to govern by there exists in him a heartabhorrence of whatever is incoherent pusillanimous unveraciousthat is to say chaotic ungoverned of the devil not of god a man of this kind cannot help governing he has the living ideal of a governor in him and the incessant necessity of struggling to unfold the same out of him not the devil or chaos for any wages will he serve no this man is the born servant of another than them alas how little avail all apprenticeships when there is in your governor himself what we may well call nothing to govern by nothinga general gray twilight looming with shapes of expediencies parliamentary traditions divisionlists electionfunds leadingarticles this with what of vulpine alertness and adroitness soever is not much  but indeed what say we apprenticeship had not this samson served in his way a right good apprenticeship to governing namely the harshest slaveapprenticeship to obeying walk this world with no friend in it but god and st edmund you will either fall into the ditch or learn a good many things to learn obeying is the fundamental art of governing how much would many a serene highness have learned had he travelled through the world with waterjug and empty wallet sine omni expensa and at his victorious return sat down not to newspaperparagraphs and cityilluminations but at the foot of st edmunds shrine to shackles and breadandwater he that cannot be servant of many will never be master true guide and deliverer of manythat is the meaning of true mastership had not the monklife extraordinary political capabilities in it if not imitable by us yet enviable heavens had a duke of logwood now rolling sumptuously to his place in the collective wisdom but himself happened to plough daily at one time on sevenandsixpence a week with no outdoor reliefwhat a light unquenchable by logic and statistic and arithmetic would it have thrown on several things for him  in all cases therefore we will agree with the judicious mrs glass first catch your hare first get your man all is got he can learn to do all things from making boots to decreeing judgments governing communities and will do them like a man catch your nomanalas have you not caught the terriblest tartar in the world perhaps all the terribler the quieter and gentler he looks for the mischief that one blockhead that every blockhead does in a world so feracious teeming with endless results as ours no ciphering will sum up the quack bootmaker is considerable as corncutters can testify and desperate men reduced to buckskin and listshoes but the quack priest quack highpriest the quack king why do not all just citizens rush halffrantic to stop him as they would a conflagration surely a just citizen is admonished by god and his own soul by all silent and articulate voices of this universe to do what in him lies towards relief of this poor blockheadquack and of a world that groans under him run swiftly relieve himwere it even by extinguishing him for all things have grown so old tinderdry combustible and he is more ruinous than conflagration sweep him down at least keep him strictly within the hearth he will then cease to be conflagration he will then become useful more or less as culinary fire fire is the best of servants but what a master this poor blockhead too is born for uses why elevating him to mastership will you make a conflagration a parishcurse or worldcurse of him  footnotes  12 jocelini chronica p 25     chapter x  government   how abbot samson giving his new subjects seriatim the kiss of fatherhood in the st edmundsbury chapterhouse proceeded with cautious energy to set about reforming their disjointed distracted way of life how he managed with his fifty rough milites feudal knights with his lazy farmers remiss refractory monks with popes legates viscounts bishops kings how on all sides he laid about him like a man and putting consequence on premiss and everywhere the saddle on the right horse struggled incessantly to educe organic method out of lazily fermenting wreckthe careful reader will discern not without true interest in these pages of jocelin boswell in most antiquarian quaint costume not of garments alone but of thought word action outlook and position the substantial figure of a man with eminent nose bushy brows and clearflashing eyes his russet beard growing daily grayer is visible engaged in true governing of men it is beautiful how the chrysalis governingsoul shaking off its dusty slough and prison starts forth winged a true royal soul our new abbot has a right honest unconscious feeling without insolence as without fear or flutter of what he is and what others are a courage to quell the proudest an honest pity to encourage the humblest withal there is a noble reticence in this lord abbot much vain unreason he hears lays up without response he is not there to expect reason and nobleness of others he is there to give them of his own reason and nobleness is he not their servant as we said who can suffer from them and for them bear the burden their poor spindlelimbs totter and stagger under and in virtue of being their servant govern them lead them out of weakness into strength out of defeat into victory                                       one of the first herculean labours abbot samson undertook or the very first was to institute a strenuous review and radical reform of his economics it is the first labour of every governing man from paterfamilias to dominus rex to get the rain thatched out from you is the preliminary of whatever farther in the way of speculation or of action you may mean to do old abbot hugos budget as we saw had become empty filled with deficit and wind to see his accountbooks clear be delivered from those ravening flights of jew and christian creditors pouncing on him like obscene harpies wherever he showed face was a necessity for abbot samson  on the morrow after his instalment he brings in a load of moneybonds all duly stamped sealed with this or the other convent seal frightful unmanageable a bottomless confusion of convent finance there they arebut there at least they all are all that shall be of them our lord abbot demands that all the official seals in use among us be now produced and delivered to him threeandthirty seals turn up are straightway broken and shall seal no more the abbot only and those duly authorised by him shall seal any bond there are but two ways of paying debt increase of industry in raising income increase of thrift in laying it out with iron energy in slow but steady undeviating perseverance abbot samson sets to work in both directions his troubles are manifold cunning milites unjust bailiffs lazy sockmen he an inexperienced abbot relaxed lazy monks not disinclined to mutiny in mass but continued vigilance rigorous method what we call the eye of the master work wonders the clearbeaming eyesight of abbot samson steadfast severe allpenetratingit is like fiat lux in that inorganic waste whirlpool penetrates gradually to all nooks and of the chaos makes a kosmos or ordered world  he arranges everywhere struggles unweariedly to arrange and place on some intelligible footing the affairs and dues res ac redditus of his dominion the lakenheath eels cease to breed squabbles between human beings the penny of reapsilver to explode into the streets the female chartism of st edmundsbury these and innumerable greater things wheresoever disorder may stand or lie let it have a care here is the man that has declared war with it that never will make peace with it man is the missionary of order he is the servant not of the devil and chaos but of god and the universe let all sluggards and cowards remiss falsespoken unjust and otherwise diabolic persons have a care this is a dangerous man for them he has a mild grave face a thoughtful sternness a sorrowful pity but there is a terrible flash of anger in him too lazy monks often have to murmur sævit ut lupus he rages like a wolf was not our dream true to repress and holdin such sudden anger he was continually careful and succeeded wellright samson that it may become in thee as noble central heat fruitful strong beneficent not blaze out or the seldomest possible blaze out as wasteful volcanoism to scorch and consume                                       we must first creep and gradually learn to walk had abbot samson said of himself at starting in four years he has become a great walker striding prosperously along driving much before him in less than four years says jocelin the convent debts were all liquidated the harpy jews not only settled with but banished bag and baggage out of the bannaleuca liberties banlieue of st edmundsburyso has the kings majesty been persuaded to permit farewell to you at any rate let us in no extremity apply again to you armed men march them over the borders dismiss them under stern penaltiessentence of excommunication on all that shall again harbour them here there were many dry eyes at their departure  new life enters everywhere springs up beneficent the incubus of debt once rolled away samson hastes not but neither does he pause to rest this of the finance is a lifelong business with himjocelins anecdotes are filled to weariness with it as indeed to jocelin it was of very primary interest  but we have to record also with a lively satisfaction that spiritual rubbish is as little tolerated in samsons monastery as material with due rigour willelmus sacrista and his bibations and tacenda are at the earliest opportunity softly yet irrevocably put an end to the bibations namely had to end even the building where they used to be carried on was razed from the soil of st edmundsbury and on its place grow rows of beans willelmus himself deposed from the sacristy and all offices retires into obscurity into absolute taciturnity unbroken thenceforth to this hour whether the poor willelmus did not still by secret channels occasionally get some slight wetting of vinous or alcoholic liquornow grown in a manner indispensable to the poor man jocelin hints not one knows not how to hope what to hope but if he did it was in silence and darkness with an everpresent feeling that teetotalism was his only true course drunken dissolute monks are a class of persons who had better keep out of abbot samsons way sævit ut lupus was not the dream true murmured many a monk nay ranulf de glanvill justiciary in chief took umbrage at him seeing these strict ways and watched farther with suspicion but discerned gradually that there was nothing wrong that there was much the opposite of wrong     chapter xi  the abbots ways   abbot samson showed no extraordinary favour to the monks who had been his familiars of old did not promote them to officesnisi essent idonei unless they chanced to be fit men whence great discontent among certain of these who had contributed to make him abbot reproaches open and secret of his being ungrateful hardtempered unsocial a norfolk barrator and paltenerius  indeed except it were for idonei fit men in all kinds it was hard to say for whom abbot samson had much favour he loved his kindred well and tenderly enough acknowledged the poor part of them with the rich part who in old days had never acknowledged him he totally refused to have any business but even the former he did not promote into offices finding none of them idonei some whom he thought suitable he put into situations in his own household or made keepers of his country places if they behaved ill he dismissed them without hope of return in his promotions nay almost in his benefits you would have said there was a certain impartiality the official person who had by abbot hugos order put the fetters on him at his return from italy was now supported with food and clothes to the end of his days at abbot samsons expense  yet he did not forget benefits far the reverse when an opportunity occurred of paying them at his own cost how pay them at the public costhow above all by setting fire to the public as we said clapping conflagrations on the public which the services of blockheads nonidonei intrinsically are he was right willing to remember friends when it could be done take these instances a certain chaplain who had maintained him at the schools of paris by the sale of holy water quæstu aquæ benedictæto this good chaplain he did give a vicarage adequate to the comfortable sustenance of him the son of elias too that is of old abbot hugos cupbearer coming to do homage for his fathers land our lord abbot said to him in full court i have for these seven years put off taking thy homage for the land which abbot hugo gave thy father because that gift was to the damage of elmswell and a questionable one but now i must profess myself overcome mindful of the kindness thy father did me when i was in bonds because he sent me a cup of the very wine his master had been drinking and bade me be comforted in god  to magister walter son of magister william de dice who wanted the vicarage of chevington he answered thy father was master of the schools and when i was an indigent clericus he granted me freely and in charity an entrance to his school and opportunity of learning wherefore i now for the sake of god grant to thee what thou askest or lastly take this good instanceand a glimpse along with it into longobsolete times two milites of risby willelm and norman being adjudged in court to come under his mercy in misericordia ejus for a certain very considerable fine of twenty shillings he thus addressed them publicly on the spot when i was a cloistermonk i was once sent to durham on business of our church and coming home again the dark night caught me at risby and i had to beg a lodging there i went to dominus normans and he gave me a flat refusal going then to dominus willelms and begging hospitality i was by him honourably received the twenty shillings therefore of mercy i without mercy will exact from dominus norman to dominus willelm on the other hand i with thanks will wholly remit the said sum men know not always to whom they refuse lodgings men have lodged angels unawares                                       it is clear abbot samson had a talent he had learned to judge better than lawyers to manage better than bred bailiffsa talent shining out indisputable on whatever side you took him an eloquent man he was says jocelin both in french and latin but intent more on the substance and method of what was to be said than on the ornamental way of saying it he could read english manuscripts very elegantly elegantissime he was wont to preach to the people in the english tongue though according to the dialect of norfolk where he had been brought up wherefore indeed he had caused a pulpit to be erected in our church both for ornament of the same and for the use of his audiences there preached he according to the dialect of norfolk a man worth going to hear  that he was a just clearhearted man this as the basis of all true talent is presupposed how can a man without clear vision in his heart first of all have any clear vision in the head it is impossible abbot samson was one of the justest of judges insisted on understanding the case to the bottom and then swiftly decided without feud or favour for which reason indeed the dominus rex searching for such men as for hidden treasure and healing to his distressed realm had made him one of the new itinerant judgessuch as continue to this day my curse on that abbots court a suitor was heard imprecating maledicta sit curia istius abbatis where neither gold nor silver can help me to confound my enemy and old friendships and all connexions forgotten when you go to seek an office from him a kinless loon as the scotch said of cromwells new judgesintent on mere indifferent fairplay  eloquence in three languages is good but it is not the best to us as already hinted the lord abbots eloquence is less admirable than his ineloquence his great invaluable talent of silence deus deus said the lord abbot to me once when he heard the convent were murmuring at some act of his i have much need to remember that dream they had of me that i was to rage among them like a wolf above all earthly things i dread their driving me to do it how much do i hold in and wink at raging and shuddering in my own secret mind and not outwardly at all he would boast to me at other times this and that i have seen this and that i have heard yet patiently stood it he had this way too which i have never seen in any other man that he affectionately loved many persons to whom he never or hardly ever showed a countenance of love once on my venturing to expostulate with him on the subject he reminded me of solomon many sons i have it is not fit that i should smile on them he would suffer faults damage from his servants and know what he suffered and not speak of it but i think the reason was he waited a good time for speaking of it and in a wise way amending it he intimated openly in chapter to us all that he would have no eavesdropping let none said he come to me secretly accusing another unless he will publicly stand to the same if he come otherwise i will openly proclaim the name of him i wish too that every monk of you have free access to me to speak of your needs or grievances when you will  the kinds of people abbot samson liked worst were these three mendaces ebriosi verbosi liars drunkards and wordy or windy personsnot good kinds any of them he also much condemned persons given to murmur at their meat or drink especially monks of that disposition we remark from the very first his strict anxious order to his servants to provide handsomely for hospitality to guard above all things that there be no shabbiness in the matter of meat and drink no look of mean parsimony in novitate meâ at the beginning of my abbotship and to the last he maintains a due opulence of table and equipment for others but he is himself in the highest degree indifferent to all such things  sweet milk honey and other naturally sweet kinds of food were what he preferred to eat but he had this virtue says jocelin he never changed the dish ferculum you set before him be what it might once when i still a novice happened to be waiting table in the refectory it came into my head rogue that i was to try if this were true and i thought i would place before him a ferculum that would have displeased any other person the very platter being black and broken but he seeing it was as one that saw it not and now some little delay taking place my heart smote me that i had done this and so snatching up the platter discus i changed both it and its contents for a better and put down that instead which emendation he was angry at and rebuked me forthe stoical monastic man for the first seven years he had commonly four sorts of dishes on his table afterwards only three except it might be presents or venison from his own parks or fishes from his ponds and if at any time he had guests living in his house at the request of some great person or of some friend or had public messengers or had harpers citharoedos or any one of that sort he took the first opportunity of shifting to another of his manorhouses and so got rid of such superfluous individuals13very prudently i think  as to his parks of these in the general repair of buildings general improvement and adornment of the st edmund domains he had laid out several and stocked them with animals retaining a proper huntsman with hounds and if any guest of great quality were there our lord abbot with his monks would sit in some opening of the woods and see the dogs run but he himself never meddled with hunting that i saw14                                       in an opening of the woodsfor the country was still dark with wood in those days and scotland itself still rustled shaggy and leafy like a damp black american forest with cleared spots and spaces here and there dryasdust advances several absurd hypotheses as to the insensible but almost total disappearance of these woods the thick wreck of which now lies as peat sometimes with huge heartofoak timberlogs imbedded in it on many a height and hollow the simplest reason doubtless is that by increase of husbandry there was increase of cattle increase of hunger for green spring food and so more and more the new seedlings got yearly eaten out in april and the old trees having only a certain length of life in them died gradually no man heeding it and disappeared into peat  a sorrowful waste of noble wood and umbrage yesbut a very common one the course of most things in this world monachism itself so rich and fruitful once is now all rotted into peat lies sleek and buriedand a most feeble boggrass of dilettantism

rest no more double double toil and trouble that is the life of all governors that really govern not the spoil of victory only the glorious toil of battle can be theirs abbot samson found all men more or less headstrong irrational prone to disorder continually threatening to prove ungovernable  his lazy monks gave him most trouble my heart is tortured said he till we get out of debt cor meum cruciatum est your heart indeedbut not altogether ours by no devisable method or none of three or four that he devised could abbot samson get these monks of his to keep their accounts straight but always do as he might the cellerarius at the end of the term is in a coil in a flat deficitverging again towards debt and jews the lord abbot at last declares sternly he will keep our accounts too himself will appoint an officer of his own to see our cellerarius keep them murmurs thereupon among us was the like ever heard our cellerarius a cipher the very townsfolk know it subsannatio et derisio sumus we have become a laughingstock to mankind the norfolk barrator and paltener  and consider if the abbot found such difficulty in the mere economic department how much in more complex ones in spiritual ones perhaps he wears a stern calm face raging and gnashing teeth fremens and frendens many times in the secret of his mind withal however there is a noble slow perseverance in him a strength of subdued rage calculated to subdue most things always in the longrun he contrives to gain his point                                       murmurs from the monks meanwhile cannot fail ever

only by messengers the awful report circulates through st edmundsbury that the abbot is in danger of being murdered by the monks with their knives how wilt thou appease this abbot samson return for

footshackles on him all day and three more our abbot has gyved with the lesser sentence to strike fear into the others let the others think with whom they have to do the others think and fear enters into them on the morrow morning we decide on humbling ourselves before the abbot by word and gesture in order to mitigate his mind and so accordingly was done he on the other side replying with much humility yet always alleging his own justice and turning the blame on us when he saw that we were conquered became himself conquered and bursting into tears perfusus lachrymis he swore that he had never grieved so much for anything in the world as for this first on his own account and then secondly and chiefly for the public scandal which had gone abroad that st edmunds monks were going to kill their abbot and when he had narrated how he went away on purpose till his anger should cool repeating this word of the philosopher i would have taken vengeance on thee had not i been angry he arose weeping and embraced each and all of us with the kiss of peace he wept we all wept15what a picture behave better ye remiss monks and thank heaven for such an abbot or know at least that ye must and shall obey him                                       worn down in this manner with incessant toil and tribulation abbot samson had a sore time of it his grizzled hair and beard grew daily grayer those jews in the first four years had visibly emaciated him time jews and the task of governing will make a mans beard very gray in twelve years says jocelin our lord abbot had grown wholly white as snow totus efficitur albus sicut nix white atop like the granite mountainsbut his clearbeaming eyes still look out in their stern clearness in their sorrow and pity the heart within him remains unconquered  nay sometimes there are gleams of hilarity too little snatches of encouragement granted even to a governor once my lord abbot and i coming down from london through the forest i inquired of an old woman whom we came up to whose wood this was and of what manor who the master who the keeperall this i knew very well beforehand and my lord abbot too bozzy that i was but the old woman answered the wood belonged to the new abbot of st edmunds was of the manor of harlow and the keeper of it was one arnald how did he behave to the people of the manor i asked farther she answered that he used to be a devil incarnate dæmon vivus an enemy of god and flayer of the peasants skinsskinning them like live eels as the manner of some is but that now he dreads the new abbot knowing him to be a wise and sharp man and so treats the people reasonably tractat homines pacifice whereat the lord abbot factus est hilariscould not but take a triumphant laugh for himself and determines to leave that harlow manor yet unmeddled with for a while16  a brave man strenuously fighting fails not of a little triumph now and then to keep him in heart everywhere we try at least to give the adversary as good as he brings and with swift force or slow watchful manoeuvre extinguish this and the other solecism leave one solecism less in gods creation and so proceed with our battle not slacken or surrender in it the fifty feudal knights for example were of unjust greedy temper and cheated us in the installationday of ten knightsfeesbut they know now whether that has profited them aught and i jocelin know our lord abbot for the moment had to endure it and say nothing but he watched his time  look also how my lord of clare coming to claim his undue debt in the court of witham with barons and apparatus gets a roland for his oliver jocelin shall report the earl crowded round constipatus with many barons and menatarms earl alberic and others standing by him said that his bailiffs had given him to understand they were wont annually to receive for his behoof from the hundred of risebridge and the bailiffs thereof a sum of five shillings which sum was now unjustly held back and he alleged farther that his predecessors had been infeft at the conquest in the lands of alfric son of wisgar who was lord of that hundred as may be read in domesday book by all personsthe abbot reflecting for a moment without stirring from his place made answer a wonderful deficit my lord earl this that thou mentionest king edward gave to st edmund that entire hundred and confirmed the same with his charter nor is there any mention there of those five shillings it will behove thee to say for what service or on what ground thou exactest those five shillings whereupon the earl consulting with his followers replied that he had to carry the banner of st edmund in wartime and for this duty the five shillings were his to which the abbot certainly it seems inglorious if so great a man earl of clare no less receive so small a gift for such a service to the abbot of st edmunds it is no unbearable burden to give five shillings but roger earl bigot holds himself duly seised and asserts that he by such seisin has the office of carrying st edmunds banner and he did carry it when the earl of leicester and his flemings were beaten at fornham then again thomas de mendham says that the right is his when you have made out with one another that this right is thine come then and claim the five shillings and i will promptly pay them whereupon the earl said he would speak with earl roger his relative and so the matter

got five or six marcs of income some threepound ten of yearly revenue whereby to support himself in the schools he would never have been monk nor abbot another time he said with an oath if he had known what a business it was to govern the abbey he would rather have been almoner how much rather keeper of the books than abbot and lord that latter office he said he had always longed for beyond

he also attended duly in his place in parliament de arduis regni attended especially as in arduissimo when the news reached london that king richard was a captive in germany here while all the barons sat to consult and many of them looked blank enough the abbot started forth prosiliit coram omnibus in his place in parliament and said that he was ready to go and seek his lord the king either clandestinely by subterfuge in tapinagio or by any other method and search till he found him and got certain notice of him he for one by which word says jocelin he acquired great praise for himselfunfeigned commendation from the able editors of that age  by which wordand also by which deed for the abbot actually went with rich gifts to the king in germany17 usurper lackland being first rooted out from windsor and the kings peace somewhat settled                                       as to these rich gifts however we have to note one thing in all england as appeared to the collective wisdom there was not like to be treasure enough for ransoming king richard in which extremity certain lords of the treasury justiciarii ad scaccarium suggested that st edmunds shrine covered with thick gold was still untouched could not it in this extremity be peeled off at least in part under condition of course of its being replaced when times mended the abbot starting plumb up se erigens answered know ye for certain that i will in nowise do this thing nor is there any man who could force me to consent thereto but i will open the doors of the church let him that likes enter let him

the once proud henry earl of essex and discern how st edmund punishes terribly yet with mercy this narrative is too significant to be omitted as a document of the time our lord abbot once on a visit at reading heard the particulars from henrys own mouth and thereupon charged one of his monks to write it downas accordingly the monk has done in ambitious rhetorical latin inserting the same as

emoluments had a haughty high soul yet with various flaws or rather with one manybranched flaw and crack running through the texture of it for example did he not treat gilbert de cereville in the most shocking manner he cast gilbert into prison and with chains and slow torments wore the life out of him there and gilberts crime was understood to be only that of innocent joseph the lady essex was a potiphars wife and had accused poor gilbert other cracks and branches of that widespread flaw in the standardbearers soul we could point out but indeed the main stem and trunk of all is too visible in this that he had no right reverence for the heavenly in manthat far from showing due reverence to st edmund he did not even show him common justice while others in the eastern counties were adorning and enlarging with rich gifts st edmunds restingplace which had become a city of refuge for many things this earl of essex flatly defrauded him by violence or quirk of law of five shillings yearly and converted said sum to his own poor uses nay in another case of litigation the unjust standardbearer for his own profit asserting that the cause belonged not to st edmunds court but to his in lailand hundred involved us in travellings and innumerable expenses vexing the servants of st edmund for a long tract of time in short he is without reverence for the heavenly this standardbearer reveres only the earthly goldcoined and has a most morbid lamentable flaw in the texture of him it cannot come to good  accordingly the same flaw or stvitus tic manifests itself ere long in another way in the year 1157 he went with his standard to attend king henry our blessed sovereign whom we saw afterwards at waltham in his war with the welsh a somewhat disastrous war in which while king henry and his force were struggling to retreat parthianlike endless clouds of exasperated welshmen hemming them in and now we had come to the difficult pass of coleshill and as it were to the nick of destructionhenry earl of essex shrieks out on a sudden blinded doubtless by his inner flaw or evil genius as some name it that king henry is killed that all is lostand flings down his standard to shift for itself there and certainly enough all had been lost had all men been as hehad not brave men without such miserable jerking ticdouloureux in the souls of them come dashing up with blazing swords and looks and

the business takes this bad issue in our monks own words faithfully rendered  and it came to pass while robert de montfort thundered on him manfully viriliter intonâsset with hard and frequent strokes and a valiant beginning promised the fruit of victory henry of essex rather giving way glanced round on all sides and lo at the rim of the horizon on the confines of the river and land he discerned the glorious king and martyr edmund in shining armour and as if hovering in the air looking towards him with severe countenance nodding his head with a mien and motion of austere anger at st edmunds hand there stood also another knight gilbert de cereville whose armour was not so splendid whose stature was less gigantic casting vengeful looks at him this he seeing with his eyes remembered that old crime brings new shame and now wholly desperate and changing reason into violence he took the part of one blindly attacking not skilfully defending who while he struck fiercely was more fiercely struck and so in short fell down vanquished and it was thought slain as he lay there for dead his kinsmen magnates of england besought the king that the monks of reading might have leave to bury him however he proved not to be dead but got well again among them and now with recovered health assuming the regular habit he strove to wipe out the stain of his former life to cleanse the long week of his dissolute history by at least a purifying sabbath and cultivate the studies of virtue into fruits of eternal felicity20                                       thus does the conscience of man

fightingmen of england that a tournament was proclaimed in the abbots domain between thetford and st edmundsburyperhaps in the euston region on fakenham heights midway between these two localities that it was publicly prohibited by our lord abbot and nevertheless was held in spite of himand by the parties as would seem considered a gentle and free passage of arms  nay next year there came to the same spot fourandtwenty young men sons of nobles for another passage of arms who having completed the same all rode into st edmundsbury to lodge for the night here is modesty our lord abbot being instructed of it ordered the gates to be closed the whole party shut in the morrow was the vigil of the apostles peter and paul no outgate on the morrow giving their promise not to depart without permission those fourandtwenty young bloods dieted all that day manducaverunt with the lord abbot waiting for trial on the morrow but after dinnermark it posteritythe lord abbot retiring into his talamus they all started up and began carolling and singing carolare et cantare sending into the town for wine drinking and afterwards howling ululantestotally depriving the abbot and convent of their afternoons nap doing all this in derision of the lord abbot and spending in such fashion the whole day till evening nor would they desist at the lord abbots order night coming on they broke the bolts of the towngates and went off by violence21 was the like ever heard of the roysterous young dogs carolling howling breaking the lord abbots sleepafter that sinful chivalry cockfight of theirs they too are a feature of distant centuries as of near ones st edmund on the edge of your horizon or whatever else there young scamps in the dandy state whether cased in iron or in whalebone begin to caper and carol on the green earth our lord abbot excommunicated most of them and they gradually came in for repentance  excommunication is a great recipe with our lord abbot the prevailing purifier in those ages thus when the townsfolk and monks menials quarrelled once at the christmas mysteries in st edmunds churchyard and from words it came to cuffs and from cuffs to cutting and the effusion of bloodour lord abbot excommunicates sixty of the rioters with bell book and candle accensis candelis at one stroke22 whereupon they all come suppliant indeed nearly naked nothing on but their breeches omnino nudi præter femoralia and prostrate themselves at the churchdoor figure that  in fact by excommunication or persuasion by impetuosity of driving or adroitness in leading this abbot it is now becoming plain everywhere is a man that generally remains master at last he tempers his medicine to the malady now hot now cool prudent though fiery an eminently practical man nay sometimes in his adroit practice there are swift turns almost of a surprising nature once for example it chanced that geoffrey riddell bishop of ely a prelate rather troublesome to our abbot made a request of him for timber from his woods towards certain edifices going on at glemsford the abbot a great builder himself disliked the request could not however give it a negative while he lay therefore at his manorhouse of melford not long after there comes to him one of the lord bishops men or monks with a message from his lordship that he now begged permission to cut down the requisite trees in elmswell woodso said the monk elmswell where there are no trees but scrubs and shrubs instead of elmset our true nemus and hightowering oakwood here on melford manor elmswell the lord abbot in surprise inquires privily of richard his forester richard answers that my lord of ely has already had his carpentarii in elmset and marked out for his own use all the best trees in the compass of it abbot samson thereupon answers the monk elmswell yes surely be it as my lord bishop wishes the successful monk on the morrow morning hastens home to ely but on the morrow morning directly after mass abbot samson too was busy the successful monk arriving at ely is rated for a goose and an owl is ordered back to say that elmset was the place meant alas on arriving at elmset he finds the bishops trees they and a hundred more all felled and piled and the stamp of st edmunds monastery burnt into themfor roofing of the great tower we are building there your importunate bishop must seek wood for glemsford edifices in some other nemus than this a practical abbot  we said withal there was a terrible flash of anger in him witness his address to old herbert the dean who in a too thrifty manner has erected a windmill for himself on his glebelands at haberdon on the morrow after mass our lord abbott orders the cellerarius to send off his carpenters to demolish the said structure brevi manu and lay up the wood in safe keeping old dean herbert hearing what was toward comes tottering along hither to plead humbly for himself and his mill the abbot answers i am obliged to thee as if thou hadst cut off both my feet by gods face per os dei i will not eat bread till that fabric be torn in pieces thou art an old man and shouldst have known that neither the king nor his justiciary dare change aught within the liberties without consent of abbot and convent and thou hast presumed on such a thing i tell thee it will not be without damage to my mills for the townsfolk will go to thy mill and grind their corn bladum suum at their own good pleasure nor can i hinder them since they are free men i will allow no new mills on such principle away away before thou gettest home again thou shalt see what thy mill has grown to23the very reverend the old dean totters home again in all haste tears the mill in pieces by his own carpentarii to save at least the timber and abbot samsons workmen coming up find the ground already clear of it                                       easy to bullydown poor old rural deans and blow their windmills away but who is the man that dare abide king richards anger cross the lion in his path and take him by the whiskers abbot samson too he is that man with justice on his side the case was this adam de cokefield one of the chief feudatories of st edmund and a principal man in the eastern counties died leaving large possessions and for heiress a daughter of three months who by clear law as all men know became thus abbot samsons ward whom accordingly he proceeded to dispose of to such person as seemed fittest but now king richard has another person in view to whom the little ward and her great possessions were a suitable thing he by letter requests that abbot samson will have the goodness to give her to this person abbot samson with deep humility replies that she is already given new letters from richard of severer tenor answered with new deep humilities with gifts and entreaties with no promise of obedience king richards ire is kindled messengers arrive at st edmundsbury with emphatic message to obey or tremble abbot samson wisely silent as to the kings threats makes answer the king can send if he will and seize the ward force and power he has to do his pleasure and abolish the whole abbey but i for my part never can be bent to wish this that he seeks nor shall it by me be ever done for there is danger lest such things be made a precedent of to the prejudice of my successors videat altissimus let the most high look on it whatsoever thing shall befall i will patiently endure  such was abbot samsons deliberate decision why not coeurdelion is very dreadful but not the dreadfulest videat altissimus i reverence coeurdelion to the marrow of my bones and will in all right things be homo suus but it is not properly speaking with terror with any fear at all on the whole have i not looked on the face of satan with outspread wings steadily into hellfire these sevenandforty yearsand was not melted into terror even at that such the lords goodness to me coeurdelion  richard swore tornado oaths worse than our armies in flanders to be revenged on that proud priest but in the end he discovered that the priest was right and forgave him and even loved him king richard wrote soon after to abbot samson that he wanted one or two of the st edmundsbury dogs which he heard were good abbot samson sent him dogs of the best richard replied by the present of a ring which pope innocent the third had given him thou brave richard thou brave samson richard too i suppose loved a man and knew one when he saw him                                       no one will accuse our lord abbot of wanting worldly wisdom due interest in worldly things a skilful man full of cunning insight lively interests always discerning the road to his object be it circuit be it shortcut and victoriously travelling forward thereon nay rather it might seem from jocelins narrative as if he had his eye all but exclusively directed on terrestrial matters and was much too secular for a devout man but this too if we examine it was right for it is in the world that a man devout or other has his life to lead his work waiting to be done the basis of abbot samsons we shall discover was truly religion after all returning from his dusty pilgrimage with such welcome as we saw he sat down at the foot of st edmunds shrine not a talking theory that no a silent practice thou st edmund with what lies in thee thou now must help me or none will  this also is a significant fact the zealous interest our abbot took in the crusades to all noble christian hearts of that era what earthly enterprise so noble when henry ii having taken the cross came to st edmunds to pay his devotions before setting out the abbot secretly made for himself a cross of linen cloth and holding this in one hand and a threaded needle in the other asked leave of the king to assume it the king could not spare samson out of englandthe king himself indeed never went but the abbots eye was set on the holy sepulchre as on the spot of this earth where the true cause of heaven was deciding itself at the retaking of jerusalem by the pagans abbot samson put on a cilice and hairshirt and wore undergarments of haircloth ever after he abstained also from flesh and fleshmeats carne et carneis thenceforth to the end of his life like a dark cloud eclipsing the hopes of christendom those tidings cast their shadow over st edmundsbury too shall samson abbas take pleasure while christs tomb is in the hands of the infidel samson in pain of body shall daily be reminded of it daily be admonished to grieve for it  the great antique heart how like a childs in its simplicity like a mans in its earnest solemnity and depth heaven lies over him wheresoever he goes or stands on the earth making all the earth a mystic temple to him the earths business all a kind of worship glimpses of bright creatures flash in the common sunlight angels yet hover doing gods messages among men that rainbow was set in the clouds by the hand of god wonder miracle encompass the man he lives in an element of miracle heavens splendour over his head hells darkness under his feet a great law of duty high as these two infinitudes dwarfing all else annihilating all elsemaking royal richard as small as peasant samson smaller if need bethe imaginative faculties rude poetic ages the primeval poetic element oh for gods sake good reader talk no more of all that it was not a dilettantism this of abbot samson it was a reality and it is one the garment only of it is dead the essence of it lives through all time and all eternity                                       and truly as we said above is not this comparative silence of abbot samson as to his religion precisely the healthiest sign of him and of it the unconscious is the alone complete abbot samson all along a busy working man as all men are bound to be his religion his worship was like his daily bread to himwhich he did not take the trouble to talk much about which he merely ate at stated intervals and lived and did his work upon this is abbot samsons catholicism of the twelfth centurysomething like the ism of all true men in all true centuries i fancy alas compared with any of the isms current in these poor days what a thing compared with the respectablest morbid struggling methodism never so earnest with the respectablest ghastly dead or galvanised dilettantism never so spasmodic  methodism with its eye forever turned on its own navel asking itself with torturing anxiety of hope and fear am i right am i wrong shall i be saved shall i not be damnedwhat is this at bottom but a new phasis of egoism stretched out into the infinite not always the heavenlier for its infinitude brother so soon as possible endeavour to rise above all that thou art wrong thou art like to be damned consider that as the fact reconcile thyself even to that if thou be a manthen first is the devouring universe subdued under thee and from the black murk of midnight and noise of greedy acheron dawn as of an everlasting morning how far above all hope and all fear springs for thee enlightening thy steep path awakening in thy heart celestial memnons music  but of our dilettantisms and galvanised dilettantisms of puseyismo heavens what shall we say of puseyism in comparison to twelfthcentury catholicism little or nothing for indeed it is a matter to strike one dumb      the builder of this universe was wise     he plannd all souls all systems planets particles     the plan he shapd all worlds and Æons by     washeavenswas thy small nineandthirty articles  that certain human souls living on this practical earth should think to save themselves and a ruined world by noisy theoretic demonstrations and laudations of the church instead of some unnoisy unconscious but practical total heartandsoul demonstration of a church this in the circle of revolving ages this also was a thing we were to see a kind of penultimate thing precursor of very strange consummations last thing but one if there is no atmosphere what will it serve a man to demonstrate the excellence of lungs how much profitabler when you can like abbot samson breathe and go along your way  footnotes  21 jocelini

vanished but useful while they stood he built and endowed the hospital of babwell built fit houses for the st edmundsbury schools many are the roofs once thatched with reeds which he caused to be covered with tiles or if they were churches probably with lead for all ruinous incomplete things buildings or other were an eyesorrow to the man we saw his great tower of st edmunds or at least the rooftimbers of it lying cut and stamped in elmset wood to change combustible decaying reedthatch into tile or lead and material still more moral wreck into raintight order what a comfort to samson                                       one of the things he could not in any wise but rebuild was the great altar aloft on which stood the shrine itself the great altar which had been damaged by fire by the careless rubbish and careless candle of two somnolent monks one nightthe shrine escaping almost as if by miracle abbot samson read his monks a severe lecture a dream one of us had that he saw st edmund naked and in lamentable plight know ye the interpretation of that dream st edmund proclaims himself naked because ye defraud the naked poor of your old clothes and give with reluctance what ye are bound to give them of meat and drink the idleness moreover and negligence of the sacristan and his people is too evident from the late misfortune by fire well might our holy martyr seem to lie cast out from his shrine and say with groans that he was stript of his garments and wasted with hunger and thirst  this is abbot samsons interpretation of the dreamdiametrically the reverse of that given by the monks themselves who scruple not to say privily it is we that are the naked and famished limbs of the martyr we whom the abbot curtails of all our privileges setting his own official to control our very cellarer abbot samson adds that this judgment by fire has fallen upon them for murmuring about their meat and drink  clearly enough meanwhile the altar whatever the burning of it mean or foreshadow must needs be reëdified abbot samson reëdifies it all of polished marble with the highest stretch of art and sumptuosity reëmbellishes the shrine for which it is to serve as pediment nay farther as had ever been among his prayers he enjoys he sinner a glimpse of the glorious martyrs very body in the process having solemnly opened the loculus chest or sacred coffin for that purpose it is the culminating moment of abbot samsons life bozzy jocelin himself rises into a kind of psalmist solemnity on this occasion the laziest monk weeps warm tears as te deum is sung  very strangehow far vanished from us in these unworshipping ages of ours the patriot hampden best beatified man we have had lain in like manner some two centuries in his narrow home when certain dignitaries of us and twelve gravediggers with pulleys raised him also up under cloud of night cut off his arm with penknives pulled the scalp off his headand otherwise worshipped our hero saint in the most amazing manner24 let the modern eye look earnestly on that old midnight hour in st edmundsbury church shining yet on us ruddybright through the depths of seven hundred years and consider mournfully what our heroworship once was and what it now is we translate with all the fidelity we can  the festival of st edmund now approaching the marble blocks are polished and all things are in readiness for lifting of the shrine to its new place a fast of three days was held by all the people the cause and meaning thereof being publicly set forth to them the abbot announces to the convent that all must prepare themselves for transferring of the shrine and appoints time and way for the work coming therefore that night to matins we found the great shrine feretrum magnum raised upon the altar but empty covered all over with white doeskin leather fixed to the wood with silver nails but one pannel of the shrine was left down below and resting thereon beside its old column of the church the loculus with the sacred body yet lay where it was wont praises being sung we all proceeded to commence our disciplines ad disciplinas suscipiendas these finished the abbot and certain with him are clothed in their albs and approaching reverently set about uncovering the loculus there was an outer cloth of linen enwrapping the loculus and all this we found tied on the upper side with strings of its own within this was a cloth of silk and then another linen cloth and then a third and so at last the loculus was uncovered and seen resting on a little tray of wood that the bottom of it might not be injured by the stone over the breast of the martyr there lay fixed to the surface of the loculus a golden angel about the length of a human foot holding in one hand a golden sword and in the other a banner under this there was a hole in the lid of the loculus on which the ancient servants of the martyr had been wont to lay their hands for touching the sacred body and over the figure of the angel was this verse inscribed      martiris ecce zoma servat michaelis agalma25  at the head and foot of the loculus were iron rings whereby it could be lifted  lifting the loculus and body therefore they carried it to the altar and i putto my sinful hand to help in carrying though the abbot had commanded that none should approach except called and the loculus was placed in the shrine and the pannel it had stood on was put in its place and the shrine for the present closed we all thought that the abbot would show the loculus to the people and bring out the sacred body again at a certain period of the festival but in this we were wofully mistaken as the sequel shows  for in the fourth holiday of the festival while the convent were all singing completorium our lord abbot spoke privily with the sacristan and walter the medicus and order was taken that twelve of the brethren should be appointed against midnight who were strong for carrying the pannelplanks of the shrine and skilful in unfixing them and putting them together again the abbot then said that it was among his prayers to look once upon the body of his patron and that he wished the sacristan and walter the medicus to be with him the twelve appointed brethren were these the abbots two chaplains the two keepers of the shrine the two masters of the vestry and six more namely the sacristan hugo walter the medicus augustin william of dice robert and richard i alas was not of the number  the convent therefore being all asleep these twelve clothed in their albs with the abbot assembled at the altar and opening a pannel of the shrine they took out the loculus laid it on a table near where the shrine used to be and made ready for unfastening the lid which was joined and fixed to the loculus with sixteen very long nails which when with difficulty they had done all except the two forenamed associates are ordered to draw back the abbot and they two were alone privileged to look in the loculus was so filled with the sacred body that you could scarcely put a needle between the head and the wood or between the feet and the wood the head lay united to the body a little raised with a small pillow but the abbot looking close found now a silk cloth veiling the whole body and then a linen cloth of wondrous whiteness and upon the head was spread a small linen cloth and then another small and most fine silk cloth as if it were the veil of a nun these coverings being lifted off they found now the sacred body all wrapt in linen and so at length the lineaments of the same appeared but here the abbot stopped saying he durst not proceed farther or look at the sacred flesh naked taking the head between his hands he thus spake groaning glorious martyr holy edmund blessed be the hour when thou wert born glorious martyr turn it not to my perdition that i have so dared to touch thee i miserable and sinful thou knowest my devout love and the intention of my mind and proceeding he touched the eyes and the nose which was very massive and prominent valde grossum et valde eminentem and then he touched the breast and arms and raising the left arm he touched the fingers and placed his own fingers between the sacred fingers and proceeding he found the feet standing stiff up like the feet of a man dead yesterday and he touched the toes and counted them tangendo numeravit  and now it was agreed that the other brethren should be called forward to see the miracles and accordingly those ten now advanced and along with them six others who had stolen in without the abbots assent namely walter of st albans hugh the infirmirarius gilbert brother of the prior richard of henham jocellus our cellarer and turstan the little and all these saw the sacred body but turstan alone of them put forth his hand and touched the saints knees and feet and that there might be abundance of witnesses one of our brethren john of dice sitting on the roof of the church with the servants of the vestry and looking through clearly saw all these things                                       what a scene shining luminous effulgent as the lamps of st edmund do through the dark night john of dice with vestrymen clambering on the roof to look through the convent all asleep and the earth all asleepand since then seven centuries of time mostly gone to sleep yes there sure enough is the martyred body of edmund landlord of the eastern counties who nobly doing what he liked with his own was slain three hundred years ago and a noble awe surrounds the memory of him symbol and promoter of many other right noble things  but have not we now advanced to strange new stages of heroworship now in the little church of hampden with our penknives out and twelve gravediggers with pulleys the manner of mens heroworship verily it is the innermost fact of their existence and determines all the restat public hustings in private drawingrooms in church in market and wherever else have true reverence and what indeed is inseparable therefrom reverence the right man all is well have shamreverence and what also follows greet with it the wrong man then all is ill and there is nothing well alas if heroworship become dilettantism and all except mammonism be a vain grimace how much in this most earnest earth has gone and is evermore going to fatal destruction and lies wasting in quiet lazy ruin no man regarding it till at length no heavenly ism any longer coming down upon us isms from the other quarter have to mount up for the earth i say is an earnest place life is no grimace but a most serious fact and so under universal dilettantism much having been stript bare not the souls of men only but their very bodies and breadcupboards having been stript bare and life now no longer possibleall is reduced to desperation to the iron law of necessity and very fact again and to temper dilettantism and astonish it and burn it up with infernal fire arises chartism barebackism sansculottism socalled may the gods and what of unworshipped heroes still remain among us avert the omen                                       but however this may be st edmunds loculus we find has the veils of silk and linen reverently replaced the lid fastened down again with its sixteen ancient nails is wrapt in a new costly covering of silk the gift of hubert archbishop of canterbury and through the skywindow john of dice sees it lifted to its place in the shrine the pannels of this latter duly refixed fit parchment documents being introduced withaland now john and his vestrymen can slide down from the roof for all is over and the convent wholly awakens to matins when we assembled to sing matins says jocelin and understood what had been done grief took hold of all that had not seen these things each saying to himself alas i was deceived matins over the abbot called the convent to the great altar and briefly recounting the matter alleged that it had not been in his power nor was it permissible or fit to invite us all to the sight of such things at hearing of which we all wept and with tears sang te deum laudamus and hastened to toll the bells in the choir  stupid blockheads to reverence their st edmunds dead body in this manner yes brotherand yet on the whole who knows how to reverence the body of a man it is the most reverend phenomenon under this sun for the highest god dwells visible in that mystic unfathomable visibility which calls itself i on the earth bending before men says novalis is a reverence done to this revelation in the flesh we touch heaven when we lay our hand on a human body and the body of one deada temple where the herosoul once was and now is not oh all mystery all pity all mute awe and wonder supernaturalism brought home to the very dullest eternity laid

the world under the cope of heaven is any man or demon that dare question the right of this king under the cope of heaven no man makes intelligible answeras several men ought already to have done does not this champion too know the world that it is a huge imposture and bottomless inanity thatched over with bright cloth and other ingenious tissues him let us leave there questioning all men and demons  him we have left to his destiny but whom else have we found from this the highest apex of things downwards through all strata and breadths how many fully awakened realities have we fallen in withalas on the contrary what troops and populations of phantasms not godveracities but devilfalsities down to the very lowest stratumwhich now by such superincumbent weight of unveracities lies enchanted in st ives workhouses broad enough helpless enough you will walk in no public thoroughfare or remotest byway of english existence but you will meet a man an interest of men that has given up

very paper i now write on is made it seems partly of plasterlime well smoothed and obstructs my writing you are lucky if you can find now any good paperany work really done search where you will from highest phantasm apex to lowest enchanted basis  consider for example that great hat sevenfeet high which now perambulates london streets which my friend sauerteig regarded justly as one of our english notabilities the topmost point as yet said he would it were your culminating and returning point to which english puffery has been observed to reachthe hatter in the strand of london instead of making better felthats than another mounts a huge lathandplaster hat sevenfeet high upon wheels sends a man to drive it through the streets hoping to be saved thereby he has not attempted to make better hats as he was appointed by the universe to do and as with this ingenuity of his he could very probably have done but his whole industry is turned to persuade us that he has made such he too knows that the quack has become god laugh not at him o reader or do not laugh only he has ceased to be comic he is fast becoming tragic to me this alldeafening blast of puffery of poor falsehood grown necessitous of poor heartatheism fallen now into enchanted workhouses sounds too surely like a doomsblast i have to say to myself in old dialect gods blessing is not written on all this his curse is written on all this unless perhaps the universe be a chimerasome old totally deranged eightday clock dead as brass which the maker if there ever was any maker has long ceased to meddle withto my friend sauerteig this poor sevenfeet hatmanufacturer as the topstone of english puffery was very notable  alas that we natives note him little that we view him as a thing of course is the very burden of the misery we take it for granted the most rigorous of us that all men who have made anything are expected and entitled to make the loudest possible proclamation of it and call on a discerning public to reward them for it every man his own trumpeter that is to a really alarming extent the accepted rule make loudest possible proclamation of your hat true proclamation if that will do if that will not do then false proclamationto such extent of falsity as will serve your purpose as will not seem too false to be crediblei answer once for all that the fact is not so nature requires no man to make proclamation of his doings and hatmakings nature forbids all men to make such there is not a man or hatmaker born into the world but feels or has felt that he is degrading himself if he speak of his excellencies and prowesses and supremacy in his craft his inmost heart says to him leave thy friends to speak of these if possible thy enemies to speak of these but at all events thy friends he feels that he is already a poor braggart fast hastening to be a falsity and speaker of the untruth  natures laws i must repeat are eternal her small still voice speaking from the inmost heart of us shall not under terrible penalties be disregarded no one man can depart from the truth without damage to himself no one million of men no twentyseven millions of men show me a nation fallen everywhere into this course so that each expects it permits it to others and himself i will show you a nation travelling with one assent on the broad way the broad way however many banks of england cottonmills and dukes palaces it may have not at happy elysian fields and everlasting crowns of victory earned by silent valour will this nation arrive but at precipices devouring gulfs if it pause not nature has appointed happy fields victorious laurelcrowns but only to the brave and true unnature what we call chaos holds nothing in it but vacuities devouring gulfs what are twentyseven millions and their unanimity believe them not the worlds and the ages god and nature and all men say otherwise  rhetoric all this no my brother very singular to say it is fact all this cockers arithmetic is not truer

but it will be brought to mind againunless indeed the law of gravitation chance to cease and men find that they can walk on vacancy unanimity of the twentyseven millions will do nothing walk not thou

helps yet to carry them forward life is still possible to them because all is not yet puffery falsity mammonworship and unnature because somewhat is yet faithfulness veracity and valour with a certain

mammonism   reader even christian reader as thy title goes hast thou any notion of heaven and hell i rather apprehend not often as the words are on our tongue they have got a fabulous or semifabulous character for most of us and pass on like a kind of transient similitude like a sound signifying little  yet it is well worth while for us to know once and always that they are not a similitude nor a fable nor semifable that they are an everlasting highest fact no lake of sicilian or other sulphur burns now anywhere in these ages sayest thou well and if there did not believe that there does not believe it if thou wilt nay hold by it as a real increase a rise to higher stages to wider horizons and empires all this has vanished or has not vanished believe as thou wilt as to all this but that an infinite of practical importance speaking with strict arithmetical exactness an infinite has vanished or can vanish from the life of any man this thou shalt not believe o brother the infinite of terror of hope of pity did it not at any moment disclose itself to thee indubitable unnameable came it never like the gleam of preternatural eternal oceans like the voice of old eternities farsounding through thy heart of hearts never alas it was not thy liberalism then it was thy animalism the infinite is more sure than any other fact but only men can discern it mere building beavers spinning arachnes much more the predatory vulturous and vulpine species do not discern it well  the word hell says sauerteig is still frequently in use among the english people but i could not without difficulty ascertain what they meant by it hell generally signifies the infinite terror the thing a man is infinitely afraid of and shudders and shrinks from struggling with his whole soul to escape from it there is a hell therefore if you will consider which accompanies man in all stages of his history and religious or other development but the hells of men and peoples differ notably with christians it is the infinite terror of being found guilty before the just judge with old romans i conjecture it was the terror not of pluto for whom probably they cared little but of doing unworthily doing unvirtuously which was their word for unmanfully and now what is it if you pierce through his cants his oftrepeated hearsays what he calls his worships and so forthwhat is it that the modern english soul does in very truth dread infinitely and contemplate with entire despair what is his hell after all these reputable oftrepeated hearsays what is it with hesitation with astonishment i pronounce it to be the terror of not succeeding of not making money fame or some other figure in the worldchiefly of not making money is not that a somewhat singular hell  yes o sauerteig it is very singular if we do not succeed where is the use of us we had better never have been born tremble intensely as our friend the emperor of china says there is the black bottomless of terror what sauerteig calls the hell of the englishbut indeed this hell belongs naturally to the gospel of mammonism which also has its corresponding heaven for there is one reality among so many phantasms about one thing we are entirely in earnest the making of money working mammonism does divide the world with idle gamepreserving dilettantismthank heaven that there is even a mammonism anything we are in earnest about idleness is worst idleness alone is without hope work earnestly at anything you will by degrees learn to work at almost all things there is endless hope in work were it even work at making money  true it must be owned we for the present with our mammongospel have come to strange conclusions we call it a society and go about professing openly the totalest separation isolation our life is not a mutual helpfulness but rather cloaked under due lawsofwar named fair competition and so forth it is a mutual hostility we have profoundly forgotten everywhere that cashpayment is not the sole relation of human beings we think nothing doubting that it absolves and liquidates all engagements of man my starving workers answers the rich millowner did not i hire them fairly in the market did i not pay them to the last sixpence the sum covenanted for what have i to do with them moreverily mammonworship is a melancholy creed when cain for his own behoof had killed abel and was questioned where is thy brother he too made answer am i my brothers keeper did i not pay my brother his wages the thing he had merited from me  o sumptuous merchantprince illustrious gamepreserving duke is there no way of killing thy brother but cains rude way a good man by the very look of him by his very presence with us as a fellow wayfarer in this lifepilgrimage promises so much woe to him if he forget all such promises if he never know that they were given to a deadened soul seared with the brute idolatry of sense to whom going to hell is equivalent to not making money all promises and moral duties that cannot be pleaded for in courts of requests address themselves in vain money he can be ordered to pay but nothing more i have not heard in all past history and expect not to hear in all future history of any society anywhere under gods heaven supporting itself on such philosophy the universe is not made so it is made otherwise than so the man or nation of men that thinks it is made so marches forward nothing doubting step after step but marcheswhither we know in these last two centuries of atheistic government near two centuries now since the blessed restoration of his sacred majesty and defender of the faith charles second i reckon that we have pretty well exhausted what of firm earth there was for us to march onand are now very ominously shuddering reeling and let us hope trying to recoil on the cliffs edge  for out of this that we call atheism come so many other isms and falsities each falsity with its misery at its heelsa soul is not like wind spiritus or breath contained within a capsule the almighty maker is not like a clockmaker that once in old immemorial ages having made his horologe of a universe sits ever since and sees it go not at all hence comes atheism come as we say many other isms and as the sum of all comes valetism the reverse of heroism sad root of all woes whatsoever for indeed as no man ever saw the abovesaid windelement enclosed within its capsule and finds it at bottom more deniable than conceivable so too he finds in spite of bridgwater bequests your clockmaker almighty an entirely questionable affair a deniable affairand accordingly denies it and along with it so much else alas one knows not what and how much else for the faith in an invisible unnameable godlike present everywhere in all that we see and work and suffer is the essence of all faith whatsoever and that once denied or still worse asserted with lips only and out of bound prayerbooks only what other thing remains believable that cant wellordered is marketable cant that heroism means gaslighted histrionism that seen with clear eyes as they call valeteyes no man is a hero or ever was a hero but all men are valets and varlets the accursed practical quintessence of all sorts of unbelief for if there be now no hero and the histrio himself begin to be seen into what hope is there for the seed of adam here below we are the doomed everlasting prey of the quack who now in this guise now in that is to filch us to pluck and eat us by such modes as are convenient for him for the modes and guises i care little the quack once inevitable let him come swiftly let him pluck and eat meswiftly that i may at least have done with him for in his quackworld i can have no wish to linger though he slay me yet will i not trust in him though he conquer nations and have all the flunkies of the universe shouting at his heels yet will i know well that he is an inanity that for him and his there is no continuance appointed save only in gehenna and the

and indispensable but i doubt you will never get even bacon by aiming only at that you are men not animals of prey wellused or illused your greatesthappiness principle seems to me fast becoming a rather unhappy onewhat if we should cease babbling about happiness and leave it resting on its own basis as it used to do  a gifted byron rises in his wrath and feeling too surely that he for his part is not happy declares the same in very violent language as a piece of news that may be interesting it evidently has surprised him much one dislikes to see a man and poet reduced to proclaim on the streets such tidings but on the whole as matters go that is not the most dislikable byron speaks the truth in this matter byrons large audience indicates how true it is felt to be  happy my brother first of all what difference is it whether thou art happy or not today becomes yesterday so fast all tomorrows become yesterdays and then there is no question whatever of the happiness but quite another question nay thou hast such a sacred pity left at least for thyself thy very pains once gone over into yesterday become joys to thee besides thou knowest not what heavenly blessedness and indispensable sanative virtue was in them thou shalt only know it after many days when thou art wisera benevolent old surgeon sat once in our company with a patient fallen sick by gourmandising whom he had just too briefly in the patients judgment been examining the foolish patient still at intervals continued to break in on our discourse which rather promised to take a philosophic turn but i have lost my appetite said he objurgatively with a tone of irritated pathos i have no appetite i cant eatmy dear fellow answered the doctor in mildest tone it isnt of the slightest consequenceand continued his philosophical discoursings with us  or does the reader not know the history of that scottish iron misanthrope the inmates of some townmansion in those northern parts were thrown into the fearfulest alarm by indubitable symptoms of a ghost inhabiting the next house or perhaps even the partitionwall ever at a certain hour with preternatural gnarring growling and screeching which attended as running bass there began in a horrid semiarticulate unearthly voice this song once i was haphaphappy but now im meeserable clackclackclack gnarrrr whuzz once i was haphaphappy but now im meeserablerest rest perturbed spiritor indeed as the good old doctor said my dear fellow it isnt of the slightest consequence but no the perturbed spirit could not rest and to the neighbours fretted affrighted or at least insufferably bored by him it was of such consequence that they had to go and examine in his haunted chamber in his haunted chamber they find that the perturbed spirit is an unfortunateimitator of byron no is an unfortunate rusty meatjack gnarring and creaking with rust and work and this in scottish dialect is its byronian musical lifephilosophy sung according to ability                                       truly i think the man who goes about pothering and uproaring for his happinesspothering and were it ballotboxing poemmaking or in what way soever fussing and exerting himselfhe is not the man that will help us to get our knaves and dastards arrested no he rather is on the way to increase the numberby at least one unit and his tail observe too that this is all a modern affair belongs not to the old heroic times but to these dastard new times happiness our beings end and aim all that very paltry speculation is at bottom if we will count well not yet two centuries old in the world  the only happiness a brave man ever troubled himself with asking much about was happiness enough to get his work done not i cant eat but i cant work that was the burden of all wise complaining among men it is after all the one unhappiness of a man that he cannot work that he cannot get his destiny as a man fulfilled behold the day is passing swiftly over our life is passing swiftly over and the night cometh wherein no man can work the night once come our happiness our unhappinessit is all abolished vanished clean gone a thing that has been not of the slightest consequence whether we were happy as eupeptic curtis as the fattest pig of epicurus or unhappy as job with potsherds as musical byron with giaours and sensibilities of the heart as the unmusical meatjack with hard labour and rust but our workbehold that is not abolished that has not vanished our work behold it remains or the want of it remainsfor endless times and eternities remains and that is now the sole question with us forevermore brief brawling day with its noisy phantasms its poor papercrowns tinselgilt is gone and divine everlasting night with her stardiadems with her silences and her veracities is come what hast thou done and how happiness unhappiness all that was but the wages thou hadst thou hast spent all that in sustaining thyself hitherward not a coin of it remains with thee it is all spent eaten and now thy work where is thy work swift out with it let us see thy work                                       of a truth if man were not a poor hungry dastard and even much of a blockhead withal he would cease criticising his victuals to such extent and criticise himself rather what he does with his victuals     chapter v  the english   and yet with all thy theoretic platitudes what a depth of practical sense in thee great england a depth of sense of justice and courage in which under all emergencies and worldbewilderments and under this most complex of emergencies we now live in there is still hope there is still assurance  the english are a dumb people they can do great acts but not describe them like the old romans and some few others their epic poem is written on the earths surface england her mark it is complained that they have no artists one shakspeare indeed but for raphael only a reynolds for mozart nothing but a mr bishop not a picture not a song and yet they did produce one shakspeare consider how the element of shakspearean melody does lie imprisoned in their nature reduced to unfold itself in mere cottonmills constitutional governments and suchlikeall the more interesting when it does become visible as even in such unexpected shapes it succeeds in doing goethe spoke of the horse how impressive almost affecting it was that an animal of such qualities should stand obstructed so its speech nothing but an inarticulate neighing its handiness mere hoofiness the fingers all constricted tied together the fingernails coagulated into a mere hoof shod with iron the more significant thinks he are those eyeflashings of the generous noble quadruped those prancings curvings of the neck clothed with thunder  a dog of knowledge has free utterance but the warhorse is almost mute very far from free it is even so truly your freest utterances are not by any means always the best they are the worst rather the feeblest trivialest their meaning prompt but small ephemeral commend me to the silent english to the silent romans nay the silent russians too i believe to be worth something are they not even now drilling under much obloquy an immense semibarbarous halfworld from finland to kamtschatka into rule subordination civilisationreally in an old roman fashion speaking no word about it quietly hearing all manner of vituperative able editors speak while your evertalking evergesticulating french for example what are they at this moment drillingnay of all animals the freest of utterance i should judge is the genus simia go into the indian woods say all travellers and look what a brisk adroit unresting apepopulation it is                                       the spoken word the written poem is said to be an epitome of the man how much more the done work whatsoever of morality and of intelligence what of patience perseverance faithfulness of method insight ingenuity energy in a word whatsoever of strength the man had in him will lie written in the work he does to work why it is to try himself against nature and her everlasting unerring laws these will tell a true verdict as to the man so much of virtue and of faculty did we find in him so much and no more he had such capacity of harmonising himself with me and my unalterable eververacious laws of coöperating and working as i bade himand has prospered and has not prospered as you seeworking as great nature bade him does not that mean virtue of a kind nay of all kinds cotton can be spun and sold lancashire operatives can be got to spin it and at length one has the woven webs and sells them by following natures regulations in that matter by not following natures regulations you have them not you have them notthere is no cottonweb to sell nature finds a bill against you your strength is not strength but futility let faculty be honoured so far as it is faculty a man that can succeed in working is to me always a man  how one loves to see the burly figure of him this thickskinned seemingly opaque perhaps sulky almost stupid man of practice pitted against some light adroit man of theory all equipt with clear logic and able anywhere to give you why for wherefore the adroit man of theory so light of movement clear of utterance with his bow fullbent and quiver full of arrowargumentssurely he will strike down the game transfix everywhere the heart of the matter triumph everywhere as he proves that he shall and must do to your astonishment it turns out oftenest no the cloudybrowed thicksoled opaque practicality with no logic utterance in silence mainly with here and there a low grunt or growl has in him what transcends all logicutterance a congruity with the unuttered the speakable which lies atop as a superficial film or outer skin is his or is not his but the doable which reaches down to the worlds centre you find him there  the rugged brindley has little to say for himself the rugged brindley when difficulties accumulate on him retires silent generally to his bed retires sometimes for three days together to his bed that he may be in perfect privacy there and ascertain in his rough head how the difficulties can be overcome the ineloquent brindley behold he has chained seas together his ships do visibly float over valleys invisibly through the hearts of mountains the mersey and the thames the humber and the severn have shaken hands nature most audibly answers yea the man of theory twangs his fullbent bow natures fact ought to fall stricken but does not his logicarrow glances from it as from a scaly dragon and the obstinate fact keeps walking its way how singular at bottom you will have to grapple closer with the dragon take it home to you by real faculty not by seeming faculty try whether you are stronger or it is stronger close with it wrestle it sheer obstinate toughness of muscle but much more what we call toughness of heart which will mean persistence hopeful and even desperate unsubduable patience composed candid openness clearness of mind all this shall be strength in wrestling your dragon the whole mans real strength is in this work we shall get the measure of him here  of all the nations in the world at present the english are the stupidest in speech the wisest in action as good as a dumb nation i say who cannot speak and have never yet spokenspite of the shakspeares and miltons who show us what possibilities there areo mr bull i look in that surly face of thine with a mixture of pity and laughter yet also with wonder and veneration thou complainest not my illustrious friend and yet i believe the heart of thee is full of sorrow of unspoken sadness seriousnessprofound melancholy as some have said the basis of thy being unconsciously for thou speakest of nothing this great universe is great to thee not by levity of floating but by stubborn force of swimming shalt thou make thy way the fates sing of thee that thou shalt many times be thought an ass and a dull ox and shalt with a godlike indifference believe it my friendand it is all untrue nothing ever falser in point of fact thou art of those great ones whose greatness the small passerby does not discern thy very stupidity is wiser than their wisdom a grand vis inertiæ is in thee how many grand qualities unknown to small men nature alone knows thee acknowledges the bulk and strength of thee thy epic unsung in words is written in huge characters on the face of this planetseamoles cottontrades railways fleets and cities indian empires americas new hollands legible throughout the solar system  but the dumb russians too as i said they drilling all wild asia and wild europe into military rank and file a terrible yet hitherto a prospering enterprise are still dumber the old romans also could not speak for many centuriesnot till the world was theirs and so many speaking greekdoms their logicarrows all spent had been absorbed and abolished the logicarrows how they glanced futile from obdurate thickskinned facts facts to be wrestled down only by the real vigour of roman thewsas for me i honour in these loudbabbling days all the silent rather a grand silence that of romansnay the grandest of all is it not that of the gods even triviality imbecility that can sit silent how respectable is it in comparison the talent of silence is our fundamental one great honour to him whose epic is a melodious hexameter iliad not a jingling shamiliad nothing true in it but the hexameters and forms merely but still greater honour if his epic be a mighty empire slowly built together a mighty series of heroic deedsa mighty conquest over chaos which epic the eternal melodies have and must have informed and dwelt in as it sung itself there is no mistaking that latter epic deeds are greater than words deeds have such a life mute but undeniable and grow as living trees and fruittrees do they people the vacuity of time and make it green and worthy why should the oak prove logically that it ought to grow and will grow plant it try it what gifts of diligent judicious assimilation and secretion it has of progress and resistance of force to grow will then declare themselves my muchhonoured illustrious extremely inarticulate mr bull  ask bull his spoken opinion of any matteroftentimes the force of dullness can no farther go you stand silent incredulous as over a platitude that borders on the infinite the mans churchisms dissenterisms puseyisms benthamisms college philosophies fashionable literatures are unexampled in this world fates prophecy is fulfilled you call the man an ox and an ass but set him once to workrespectable man his spoken sense is next to nothing ninetenths of it palpable nonsense but his unspoken sense his inner silent feeling of what is true what does agree with fact what is doable and what is not doablethis seeks its fellow in the world a terrible worker irresistible against marshes mountains impediments disorder incivilisation everywhere vanquishing disorder leaving it behind him as method and order he retires to his bed three days and considers  nay withal stupid as he is our dear johnever after infinite tumblings and spoken platitudes innumerable from barrelheads and parliamentbenches he does settle down somewhere about the just conclusion you are certain that his jumblings and tumblings will end after years or centuries in the stable equilibrium stable equilibrium i say centreofgravity lowestnot the unstable with centreofgravity highest as i have known it done by quicker people for indeed do but jumble and tumble sufficiently you avoid that worst fault of settling with your centreofgravity highest your centreofgravity is certain to come lowest and to stay there if slowness what we in our impatience call stupidity be the price of stable equilibrium over unstable shall we grudge a little slowness not the least admirable quality of bull is after all that of remaining insensible to logic holding out for considerable periods ten years or more as in this of the cornlaws after all arguments and shadow of arguments have faded away from him till the very urchins on the street titter at the arguments he brings logicgreek logikê the art of speechdoes indeed speak so and so clear enough nevertheless bull still shakes his head will see whether nothing else illogical not yet spoken not yet able to be spoken do not lie in the business as there so often doesmy firm belief is that finding himself now enchanted handshackled footshackled in poorlaw bastilles and elsewhere he will retire three days to his bed and arrive at a conclusion or two his threeyears total stagnation of trade alas is not that a painful enough lying in bed to consider himself poor bull  bull is a born conservative for this too i inexpressibly honour him all great peoples are conservative slow to believe in novelties patient of much error in actualities deeply and forever certain of the greatness that is in law in custom once solemnly established and now long recognised as just and finaltrue o radical reformer there is no custom that can properly speaking be final none and yet thou seest customs which in all civilised countries are accounted final nay under the oldroman name of mores are accounted morality virtue laws of god himself such i assure thee not a few of them are such almost all of them once were and greatly do i respect the solid charactera blockhead thou wilt say yes but a wellconditioned blockhead and the bestconditionedwho esteems all customs once solemnly

no longer with it the most conservative english people thickestskinned most patient of peoples is driven alike by its logic and its unlogic by things spoken and by things not yet spoken or very speakable but only felt and very unendurable to be wholly a reforming people their life as it is has ceased to be longer possible for them  urge not this noble silent people rouse not the berserkir rage that lies in them do you know their cromwells hampdens their pyms and bradshaws men very peaceable but men that can be made very terrible men who like their old teutsch fathers in agrippas days have a soul that despises death to whom death compared with falsehoods and injustices is lightin whom there is a rage unconquerable by the immortal gods before this the english people have taken very preternaturallooking spectres by the beard saying virtually and if thou wert preternatural thou with thy divinerights grown diabolicwrongs thounot even natural decapitable totally extinguishableyes just so godlike as this peoples patience was even so godlike will and must its impatience be away ye scandalous practical solecisms children actually of the prince of darkness ye have near broken our hearts we can and will endure you no longer begone we say depart while the play is good by the most high god whose sons and born missionaries true men are ye shall not continue here you and we have become incompatible can inhabit one house no longer either you must go or we are ye ambitious to try which it shall be  o my conservative friends who still specially name and struggle to approve yourselves conservative would to heaven i could persuade you of this worldold fact than which fate is not surer that truth and justice alone are capable of being conserved and preserved the thing which is unjust which is not according to gods law will you in a gods universe try to conserve that it is so old say you yes and the hotter haste ought you of all others to be in to let it grow no older if but the faintest whisper in your hearts intimate to you that it is not fairhasten for the sake of conservatism itself to probe it rigorously to cast it forth at once and forever if guilty how will or can you preserve it the thing that is not fair impossibility a thousandfold is marked on that and ye call yourselves conservatives aristocraciesought not honour and nobleness of mind if they had departed from all the earth elsewhere to find their last refuge with you ye unfortunate  the bough that is dead shall be cut away for the sake of the tree itself old yes it is too old many a weary winter has it swung and creaked there and gnawed and fretted with its dead wood the organic substance and still living fibre of this good tree many a long summer has its ugly naked brown defaced the fair green umbrage every day it has done mischief and that only off with it for the trees sake if for nothing more let the conservatism that would preserve cut it away did no woodforester apprise you that a dead bough with its dead root left sticking there is extraneous poisonous is as a dead iron spike some horrid rusty ploughshare driven into the living substancenay is far worse for in every windstorm commercial crisis or the like it frets and creaks jolts itself to and fro and cannot lie quiet as your dead iron spike would  if i were the conservative party of england which is another bold figure of speech i would not for a hundred thousand pounds an hour allow those cornlaws to continue potosi and golconda put together would not purchase my assent to them do you count what treasuries of bitter indignation they are laying up for you in every just english heart do you know what questions not as to cornprices and slidingscales alone they are forcing every reflective englishman to ask himself questions insoluble or hitherto unsolved deeper than any of our logicplummets hitherto will sound questions deep enoughwhich it were better that we did not name even in thought you are forcing us to think of them to begin uttering them the utterance of them is begun and where will it be ended think you when two millions of ones brothermen sit in workhouses and five millions as is insolently said rejoice in potatoes there are various things that must be begun let them end where they can     chapter vi  two centuries   the settlement effected by our healing parliament in the year of grace 1660 though accomplished under universal acclamations from the four corners of the british dominions turns out to have been one of the mournfulest that ever took place in this land of ours it called and thought itself a settlement of brightest hope and fulfilment bright as the blaze of universal tarbarrels and bonfires could make it and we find it now on looking back on it with the insight which trial has yielded a settlement as of despair considered well it was a settlement to govern henceforth without god with only some decent pretence of god  governing by the christian law of god had been found a thing of battle convulsion confusion an infinitely difficult thing wherefore let us now abandon it and govern only by so much of gods christian law asas may prove quiet and convenient for us what is the end of government to guide men in the way wherein they should go towards their true good in this life the portal of infinite good in a life to come to guide men in such way and ourselves in such way as the maker of men whose eye is upon us will sanction at the great dayor alas perhaps at bottom is there no great day no sure outlook of any life to come but only this poor life and what of taxes felicities nellgwyns and entertainments we can manage to muster here in that case the end of government will be to suppress all noise and disturbance whether of puritan preaching cameronian psalmsinging thievesriot murder arson or what noise soever andbe careful that supplies do not fail a very notable conclusion if we will think of it and not without an abundance of fruits for us oliver cromwells body hung on the tyburn gallows as the type of puritanism found futile inexecutable execrableyes that gallowstree has been a fingerpost into very strange country indeed let earnest puritanism die let decent formalism whatsoever cant it be or grow to live we have had a pleasant journey in that direction and arearriving at our inn  to support the four pleas of the crown and keep taxes coming in in very sad seriousness has not this been ever since even in the best times almost the one admitted end and aim of government religion christian church moral duty the fact that man had a soul at all that in mans life there was any eternal truth or justice at allhas been as good as left quietly out of sight church indeedalas the endless talk and struggle we have had of highchurch lowchurch churchextension churchindanger we invite the christian reader to think whether it has not been a too miserable screechowl phantasm of talk and struggle as for a churchwhich one had rather not define at present  but now in these godless two centuries looking at england and her efforts and doings if we ask what of englands doings the law of nature had accepted natures king had actually furthered and pronounced to have truth in themwhere is our answer neither the church of hurd and warburton nor the antichurch of hume and paine not in any shape the spiritualism of england all this is already seen or beginning to be seen for what it is a thing that nature does not own on the one side is dreary cant with a reminiscence of things noble and divine on the other is but acrid candour with a prophecy of things brutal infernal hurd and warburton are sunk into the sere and yellow leaf no considerable body of trueseeing men looks thitherward for healing the paineandhume atheistic theory of things well let alone with liberty equality and the like is also in these days declaring itself nought unable to keep the world from taking fire  the theories and speculations of both these parties and we may say of all intermediate parties and persons prove to be things which the eternal veracity did not accept things superficial ephemeral which already a near posterity finding them already dead and brownleafed is about to suppress and forget the spiritualism of england for those godless years is as it were all forgettable much has been written but the perennial scriptures of mankind have had small accession from all english books in rhyme or prose in leather binding or in paper wrappage how many verses have been added to these our most melodious singers have sung as from the throat outwards from the inner heart of man from the great heart of nature through no pope or philips has there come any tone the oracles have been dumb in brief the spoken word of england has not been true the spoken word of england turns out to have been trivial of short endurance not valuable not available as a word except for the passing day it has been accordant with transitory semblance discordant with eternal fact it has been unfortunately not a word but a cant a helpless involuntary cant nay too often a cunning voluntary one either way a very mournful cant the voice not of nature and fact but of something other than these  with all its miserable shortcomings with its wars controversies with its tradesunions famineinsurrectionsit is her practical material work alone that england has to show for herself this and hitherto almost nothing more yet actually this the grim inarticulate veracity of the english people unable to speak its meaning in words has turned itself silently on things and the dark powers of material nature have answered yes this at least is true this is not false so answers nature waste desertshrubs of the tropical swamps have become cottontrees and here under my furtherance are verily woven shirtshanging unsold undistributed but capable to be distributed capable to cover the bare backs of my children of men mountains old as the creation i have permitted to be bored through bituminous fuelstores the wreck of forests that were green a million years agoi have opened them from my secret rockchambers and they are yours ye english your huge fleets steamships do sail the sea huge indias do obey you from huge new englands and antipodal australias comes profit and traffic to this old england of mine so answers nature the practical labour of england is not a chimerical triviality it is a fact acknowledged by all the worlds which no man and no demon will contradict it is very audibly though very inarticulately as yet the one gods voice we have heard in these two atheistic centuries                                       and now to observe with what bewildering obscurations and impediments all this as yet stands entangled and is yet intelligible to no man how with our gross atheism we hear it not to be the voice of god to us but regard it merely as a voice of earthly profitandloss and have a hell in englandthe hell of not making money and coldly see the allconquering valiant sons of toil sit enchanted by the million in their poorlaw bastille as if this were natures lawmumbling to ourselves some vague janglement of laissezfaire supplyanddemand cashpayment the one nexus of man to man freetrade competition and devil take the hindmost our latest gospel yet preached  as if in truth there were no god of labour as if godlike labour and brutal mammonism were convertible terms a serious most earnest mammonism grown midaseared an unserious dilettantism earnest about nothing grinning with inarticulate incredulous incredible jargon about all things as the enchanted dilettanti do by the dead sea it is mournful enough for the present hour were there not an endless hope in it withal giant labour truest emblem there is of god the worldworker demiurgus and eternal maker noble labour which is yet to be the king of this earth and sit on the highest thronestaggering hitherto like a blind irrational giant hardly allowed to have his common place on the streetpavements idle dilettantism deadsea apism crying out down with him he is dangerous  labour must become a seeing rational giant with a soul in the body of him and take his place on the throne of thingsleaving his mammonism and several other adjuncts on the lower steps of said throne     chapter vii  overproduction   but what will reflective readers say of a governing class such as ours addressing its workers with an indictment of overproduction overproduction runs it not so ye miscellaneous ignoble manufacturing individuals ye have produced too much we accuse you of making above twohundred thousand shirts for the bare backs of mankind your trousers too which you have made of fustian of cassimere of scotchplaid of jane nankeen and woollen broadcloth are they not manifold of hats for the human head of shoes for the human foot of stools to sit on spoons to eat withnay what say we hats or shoes you produce goldwatches jewelries silverforks and epergnes commodes chiffoniers stuffed sofasheavens the commercial bazaar and multitudinous howelandjameses cannot contain you you have produced producedhe that seeks your indictment let him look around millions of shirts and empty pairs of breeches hang there in judgment against you we accuse you of overproducing you are criminally guilty of producing shirts breeches hats shoes and commodities in a frightful overabundance and now there is a glut and your operatives cannot be fed  never surely against an earnest working mammonism was there brought by gamepreserving aristocratic dilettantism a stranger accusation since this world began my lords and gentlemenwhy it was you that were appointed by the fact and by the theory of your position on the earth to make and administer lawsthat is to say in a world such as ours to guard against gluts against honest operatives who had done their work remaining unfed i say you were appointed to preside over the distribution and apportionment of the wages of work done and to see well that there went no labourer without his hire were it of moneycoins were it of hemp gallowsropes that function was yours and from immemorial time has been yours and as yet no others these poor shirtspinners have forgotten much which by the virtual unwritten law of their position they should have remembered but by any written recognised law of their position what have they forgotten they were set to make shirts the community with all its voices commanded them saying make shirtsand there the shirts are too many shirts well that is a novelty in this intemperate earth with its ninehundred millions of bare backs but the community commanded you saying see that the shirts are well apportioned that our human laws be emblem of gods lawsand where is the apportionment two million shirtless or illshirted workers sit enchanted in workhouse bastilles five million more according to some in ugolino hungercellars and for remedy you saywhat say youraise our rents i have not in my time heard any stranger speech not even on the shores of the dead sea you continue addressing those poor shirtspinners and overproducers in really a too triumphant manner  will you bandy accusations will you accuse us of overproduction we take the heavens and the earth to witness that we have produced nothing at all not from us proceeds this frightful overplus of shirts in the wide domains of created nature circulates no shirt or thing of our producing certain foxbrushes nailed upon our stabledoor the fruit of fair audacity at melton mowbray these we have produced and they are openly nailed up there he that accuses us of producing let him show himself let him name what and when we are innocent of producingye ungrateful what mountains of things have we not on the contrary had to consume and make away with mountains of those your heaped manufactures wheresoever edible or wearable have they not disappeared before us as if we had the talent of ostriches of cormorants and a kind of divine faculty to eat ye ungratefuland did you not grow under the shadow of our wings are not your filthy mills built on these fields of ours on this soil of england which belongs towhom think you and we shall not offer you our own wheat at the price that pleases us but that partly pleases you a precious notion what would become of you if we chose at any time to decide on growing no wheat more  yes truly here is the ultimate rockbasis of all cornlaws whereon at the bottom of much arguing they rest as securely as they can what would become of you if we decided some day on growing no more wheat at all if we chose to grow only partridges henceforth and a modicum of wheat for our own uses cannot we do what we like with our ownyes indeed for my share if i could melt gneiss rock and create law of gravitation if i could stride out to the doggerbank some morning and striking down my trident there into the mudwaves say be land be fields meadows mountains and freshrolling streams by heaven i should incline to have the letting of that land in perpetuity and sell the wheat of it or burn the wheat of it according to my own good judgment my cornlawing friends you affright me  to the millocracy socalled to the working aristocracy steeped too deep in mere ignoble mammonism and as yet all unconscious of its noble destinies as yet but an irrational or semirational giant struggling to awake some soul in itselfthe world will have much to say reproachfully reprovingly admonishingly but to the idle aristocracy what will the world have to say things painful and not pleasant  to the man who works who attempts in never so ungracious barbarous a way to get forward with some work you will hasten out with furtherances with encouragements corrections you will say to him welcome thou art ours our care shall be of thee to the idler again never so gracefully going idle coming forward with never so many parchments you will not hasten out you will sit still and be disinclined to rise you will say to him not welcome o complex anomaly would thou hadst stayed out of doors for who of mortals knows what to do with thee thy parchments yes they are old of venerable yellowness and we too honour parchment oldestablished settlements and venerable useandwont old parchments in very truthyet on the whole if thou wilt remark they are young to the granite rocks to the groundplan of gods universe we advise thee to put up thy parchments to go home to thy place and make no needless noise whatever our hearts wish is to save thee yet there as thou art hapless anomaly with nothing but thy yellow parchments noisy futilities and shotbelts and foxbrushes who of gods or men can avert dark fate be counselled ascertain if no work exist for thee on gods earth if thou find no commandedduty there but that of going gracefully idle ask inquire earnestly with a halffrantic earnestness for the answer means existence or annihilation to thee we apprise thee of the worldold fact becoming sternly disclosed again in these days that he who cannot work in this universe cannot get existed in it had he parchments to thatch the face of the world these combustible fallible sheepskin cannot avail him home thou unfortunate and let us have at least no noise from thee  suppose the unfortunate idle aristocracy as the unfortunate working one has done were to retire three days to its bed and consider itself there what oclock it had become  how have we to regret not only that men have no religion but that they have next to no reflection and go about with heads full of mere extraneous noises with eyes wideopen but visionlessfor most part in the somnambulist state     chapter viii  unworking aristocracy   it is well said land is the right basis of an aristocracy whoever possesses the land he more emphatically than any other is the governor viceking of the people on the land it is in these days as it was in those of henry plantagenet and abbot samson as it will in all days be the land is mother of us all nourishes shelters gladdens lovingly enriches us all in how many ways from our first wakening to our last sleep on her blessed motherbosom does she as with blessed motherarms enfold us all  the hill i first saw the sun rise over when the sun and i and all things were yet in their auroral hour who can divorce me from it mystic deep as the worlds centre are the roots i have struck into my native soil no tree that grows is rooted so from noblest patriotism to humblest industrial mechanism from highest dying for your country to lowest quarrying and coalboring for it a nations life depends upon its land again and again we have to say there can be no true aristocracy but must possess the land  men talk of selling land land it is true like epic poems and even higher things in such a trading world has to be presented in the market for what it will bring and as we say be sold but the notion of selling for certain bits of metal the iliad of homer how much more the land of the worldcreator is a ridiculous impossibility we buy what is saleable of it nothing more was ever buyable who can or could sell it to us properly speaking the land belongs to these two to the almighty god and to all his children of men that have ever worked well on it or that shall ever work well on it no generation of men can or could with never such solemnity and effort sell land on any other principle it is not the property of any generation we say but that of all the past generations that have worked on it and of all the future ones that shall work on it  again we hear it said the soil of england or of any country is properly worth nothing except the labour bestowed on it this speaking even in the language of eastcheap is not correct the rudest space of country equal in extent to england could a whole english nation with all their habitudes arrangements skills with whatsoever they do carry within the skins of them and cannot be stript of suddenly take wing and alight on itwould be worth a very considerable thing swiftly within year and day this english nation with its multiplex talents of ploughing spinning hammering mining roadmaking and trafficking would bring a handsome value out of such a space of country on the other hand fancy what an english nation once on the wing could have done with itself had there been simply no soil not even an inarable one to alight on vain all its talents for ploughing hammering and whatever else there is no earthroom for this nation with its talents this nation will have to keep hovering on the wing dolefully shrieking to and fro and perish piecemeal burying itself down to the last soul of it in the waste unfirmamented seas ah yes soil with or without ploughing is the gift of god the soil of all countries belongs evermore in a very considerable degree to the almighty maker the last stroke of labour bestowed on it is not the making of its value but only the increasing thereof  it is very strange the degree to which these truisms are forgotten in our days how in the everwhirling chaos of formulas we have quietly lost sight of factwhich it is so perilous not to keep forever in sight fact if we do not see it will make us feel it by and byfrom much loud controversy and cornlaw debating there rises loud though inarticulate once more in these years this very question among others who made the land of england who made it this respectable english land wheatgrowing metalliferous carboniferous which will let readily hand over head for seventy millions or upwards as it here lies who did make itwe answer the muchconsuming aristocracy we as they ride in moist with the sweat of melton mowbray it is we that made it or are the heirs assigns and representatives of those who didmy brothers you everlasting honour to you then and cornlaws as many as you will till your own deep stomachs cry enough or some voice of human pity for our famine bids you hold ye are as gods that can create soil soilcreating gods there is no withstanding they have the might to sell wheat at what price they list and the right to all lengths and faminelengthsif they be pitiless infernal gods celestial gods i think would stop short of the famineprice but no infernal nor any kind of god can be bidden stopinfatuated mortals into what questions are you driving every thinking man in england  i say you did not make the land of england and by the possession of it you are bound to furnish guidance and governance to england that is the law of your position on this godsearth an everlasting act of heavens parliament not repealable in st stephens or elsewhere true government and guidance not nogovernment and laissezfaire how much less misgovernment and cornlaw there is not an imprisoned worker looking out from these bastilles but appeals very audibly in heavens high courts against you and me and everyone who is not imprisoned why am i here his appeal is audible in heaven and will become audible enough on earth too if it remain unheeded here his appeal is against you foremost of all you stand in the frontrank of the accused you by the very place you hold have first of all to answer him and heaven                                       what looks maddest miserablest in these mad and miserable cornlaws is independent altogether of their effect on wages their effect on increase of trade or any other such effect it is the continual maddening proof they protrude into the faces of all men that our governing class called by god and nature and the inflexible law of fact either to do something towards governing or to die and be abolishedhave not yet learned even to sit still and do no mischief for no anticornlaw league yet asks more of them than thisnature and fact very imperatively asking so much more of them anticornlaw league asks not do something but cease your destructive misdoing do ye nothing  natures message will have itself obeyed messages of mere freetrade anticornlaw league and laissezfaire will then need small obeyingye fools in name of heaven work work at the ark of deliverance for yourselves and us while hours are still granted you no instead of working at the ark they say we cannot get our hands kept rightly warm and sit obstinately burning the planks no madder spectacle at present exhibits itself under this sun  the working aristocracy millowners manufacturers commanders of working men alas against them also much shall be brought in accusation muchand the freest trade in corn total abolition of tariffs and uttermost increase of manufactures and prosperity of commerce will permanently mend no jot of it the working aristocracy must strike into a new path must understand that money alone is not the representative either of mans success in the world or of mans duties to man and reform their own selves from top to bottom if they wish england reformed england will not be habitable long unreformed  the working aristocracyyes but on the threshold of all this it is again and again to be asked what of the idle aristocracy again and again what shall we say of the idle aristocracy the owners of the soil of england whose recognised function is that of handsomely consuming the rents of england shooting the partridges of england and as an agreeable amusement if the purchasemoney and other conveniences serve dilettanteing in parliament and quartersessions for england we will say mournfully in the presence of heaven and earththat we stand speechless stupent and know not what to say that a class of men entitled to live sumptuously on the marrow of the earth permitted simply nay entreated and as yet entreated in vain to do nothing at all in return was never heretofore seen on the face of this planet that such a class is transitory exceptional and unless natures laws fall dead cannot continue that it has continued now a moderate while has for the last fifty years been rapidly attaining its state of perfection that it will have to find its duties and do them or else that it must and will cease to be seen on the face of this planet which is a working one not an idle one  alas alas the working aristocracy admonished by tradesunions chartist conflagrations above all by their own shrewd sense kept in perpetual communion with the fact of things will assuredly reform themselves and a working world will still be possiblebut the fate of the idle aristocracy as one reads its horoscope hitherto in cornlaws and suchlike is an abyss that fills one with despair yes my rosy foxhunting brothers a terrible hippocratic look reveals itself god knows not to my joy through those fresh buxom countenances of yours through your cornlaw majorities slidingscales protectingduties briberyelections and triumphant kentishfire a thinking eye discerns ghastly images of ruin too ghastly for words a handwriting as of mene mene men and brothers on your slidingscale you seem sliding and to have slidyou little know whither good god did not a french donothing aristocracy hardly above half a century ago declare in like manner and in its featherhead believe in like manner we cannot exist and continue to dress and parade ourselves on the just rent of the soil of france but we must have farther payment than rent of the soil we must be exempted from taxes toowe must have a cornlaw to extend our rent this was in 1789 in four years moredid you look into the tanneries of meudon and the longnaked making for themselves breeches of human skins may the merciful heavens avert the omen may we be wiser that so we be less wretched                                       a high class without duties to do is like a tree planted on precipices from the roots of which all the earth has been crumbling nature owns no man who is not a martyr withal is there a man who pretends to live luxuriously housed up screened from all work from want danger hardship the victory over which is what we name workhe himself to sit serene amid downbolsters and appliances and have all his work and battling done by other men and such man calls himself a nobleman his fathers worked for him he says or successfully gambled for him here he sits professes not in sorrow but in pride that he and his have done no work time out of mind it is the law of the land and is thought to be the law of the universe that he alone of recorded men shall have no task laid on him except that of eating his cooked victuals and not flinging himself out of window once more i will say there was no stranger spectacle ever shown under this sun a veritable fact in our england of the nineteenth century his victuals he does eat but as for keeping in the inside of the windowhave not his friends like me enough to do truly looking at his cornlaws gamelaws chandosclauses briberyelections and much else you do shudder over the tumbling and plunging he makes held back by the lapels and coatskirts only a thin fence of windowglass before himand in the street mere horrid iron spikes my sick brother as in hospitalmaladies men do thou dreamest of paradises and eldorados which are far from thee cannot i

glasswindow i tell thee so many stories from the street where are iron spikes and the law of gravitation  what is the meaning of nobleness if this be noble in a valiant suffering for others not in a slothful making others suffer for us did nobleness ever lie the chief of men is he who stands in the van of men fronting the peril which frightens back all others which if it be not vanquished will devour the others every noble crown is and on earth will forever be a crown of thorns the pagan hercules why was he accounted a hero because he had slain nemean lions cleansed augean stables undergone twelve labours only not too heavy for a god in modern as in ancient and all societies the aristocracy they that assume the functions of an aristocracy doing them or not have taken the post of honour which is the post of difficulty the post of dangerof death if the difficulty be not overcome il faut payer de sa vie why was our life given us if not that we should manfully give it descend o

law everywhere and everywhen a man has to pay with his life to do his work as a soldier does at the expense of life in no piepowder earthly court can you sue an aristocracy to do its work at this moment but in the higher court which even it calls court of honour and which is the court of necessity withal and the eternal court of the universe in which all fact comes to plead and every human

the cornlaws in this place the cornlaws are too mad to have a chapter there is a certain immorality when there is not a necessity in speaking about things finished in chopping into small pieces the already slashed and slain when the brains are out why does not a solecism die it is at its own peril if it refuse to die it ought to make all conceivable haste to die and get itself buried the trade of anticornlaw lecturer in these days still an indispensable is a highly tragic one  the cornlaws will go and even soon go would we were all as sure of the millennium as they are of going they go swiftly in these present months with an increase of velocity an everdeepening everwidening sweep of momentum truly notable it is at the aristocracys own damage and peril still more than at any others whatsoever that the aristocracy maintains themat a damage say only as above computed of a hundred thousand pounds an hour the cornlaws keep all the air hot fostered by their feverwarmth much that is evil but much also how much that is good and indispensable is rapidly coming to life among us     chapter ix  working aristocracy   a poor working mammonism getting itself strangled in the partridgenets of an unworking dilettantism and bellowing dreadfully and already black in the face is surely a disastrous spectacle but of a midaseared mammonism which indeed at bottom all pure mammonisms are what better can you expect no betterif not this then something other equally disastrous if not still more disastrous mammonisms grown asinine have to become human again and rational they have on the whole to cease to be mammonisms were it even on compulsion and pressure of the hemp round their neckmy friends of the working aristocracy there are now a great many things which you also in your extreme need will have to consider                                       the continental people it would seem are exporting our machinery beginning to spin cotton and manufacture for themselves to cut us out of this market and then out of that sad news indeed but irremediableby no means the saddest news the saddest news is that we should find our national existence as i sometimes hear it said depend on selling manufactured cotton at a farthing an ell cheaper than any other people a most narrow stand for a great nation to base itself on a stand which with all the cornlaw abrogations conceivable i do not think will be capable of enduring  my friends suppose we quitted that stand suppose we came honestly down from it and said this is our minimum of cottonprices we care not for the present to make cotton any cheaper do you if it seem so blessed to you make cotton cheaper fill your lungs with cottonfuzz your hearts with copperasfumes with rage and mutiny become ye the general gnomes of europe slaves of the lampi admire a nation which fancies it will die if it do not undersell all other nations to the end of the world brothers we will cease to undersell them we will be content to equalsell them to be happy selling equally with them i do not see the use of underselling them cottoncloth is already twopence a yard or lower and yet bare backs were never more numerous among us let inventive men cease to spend their existence incessantly contriving how cotton can be made cheaper and try to invent a little how cotton at its present cheapness could be somewhat justlier divided among us let inventive men consider whether the secret of this universe and of mans life there does after all as we rashly fancy it consist in making money there is one god just supreme almighty but is mammon the name of himwith a hell which means failing to make money i do not think there is any heaven possible that would suit one well nor so much as an earth that can be habitable long in brief all this mammongospel of supplyanddemand competition laissezfaire and devil take the hindmost begins to be one of the shabbiest gospels ever preached or altogether the shabbiest even with dilettante partridgenets and at a horrible expenditure of pain who shall regret to see the entirely transient and at best somewhat despicable life strangled out of it at the best as we say a somewhat despicable unvenerable thing this same laissezfaire and now at the worst fast growing an altogether detestable one  but what is to be done with our manufacturing population with our agricultural with our everincreasing population cry manyay what many things can be done with them a hundred things and a thousand thingshad we once got a soul and begun to try this one thing of doing for them by underselling all people and filling our own bursten pockets and appetites by the road and turning over all care for any population or human or divine consideration except cash only to the winds with a laissezfaire and the rest of it this is evidently not the thing farthing cheaper per yard no great nation can stand on the apex of such a pyramid screwing itself higher and higher balancing itself on its greattoe can england not subsist without being above all people in working england never deliberately purposed such a thing if england work better than all people it shall be well england like an honest worker will work as well as she can and hope the gods may allow her to live on that basis laissezfaire and much else being once well dead how many impossibles will become possible they are impossible as cottoncloth at twopence an ell wastill men set about making it the inventive genius of great england will not forever sit patient with mere wheels and pinions bobbins straps and billyrollers whirring in the head of it the inventive genius of england is not a beavers or a spinners or spiders genius it is a mans genius i hope with a god over him  laissezfaire supplyanddemandone begins to be weary of all that leave all to egoism to ravenous greed of money of pleasure of applauseit is the gospel of despair man is a patentdigester then only give him free trade free digestingroom and each of us digest what he can come at leaving the rest to fate my unhappy brethren of the working mammonism my unhappier brethren of the idle dilettantism no world was ever held together in that way for long a world of mere patentdigesters will soon have nothing to digest such world ends and by law of nature must end in overpopulation in howling universal famine impossibility and suicidal madness as of endless dogkennels run rabid supplyanddemand shall do its full part and free trade shall be free as airthou of the shotbelts see thou forbid it not with those paltry worse than mammonish swindleries and slidingscales of thine which are seen to be swindleries for all thy canting which in times like ours are very scandalous to see and trade never so well freed and all tariffs settled or abolished and supplyanddemand in full operationlet us all know that we have yet done nothing that we have merely cleared the ground for doing  yes were the cornlaws ended tomorrow there is nothing yet ended there is only room made for all manner of things beginning the cornlaws gone and trade made free it is as good as certain this paralysis of industry will pass away we shall have another period of commercial enterprise of victory and prosperity during which it is likely much money will again be made and all the people may by the extant methods still for a space of years be kept alive and physically fed the strangling band of famine will be loosened from our necks we shall have room again to breathe time to bethink ourselves to repent and consider a precious and thriceprecious space of years wherein to struggle as for life in reforming our foul ways in alleviating instructing regulating our people seeking as for life that something like spiritual food be imparted them some real governance and guidance be provided them it will be a priceless time for our new period or paroxysm of commercial prosperity will and can on the old methods of competition and devil take the hindmost prove but a paroxysm a new paroxysmlikely enough if we do not use it better to be our last in this of itself is no salvation if our trade in twenty years flourishing as never trade flourished could double itself yet then also by the old laissezfaire method our population is doubled we shall then be as we are only twice as many of us twice and ten times as unmanageable                                       all this dire misery therefore all this of our poor workhouse workmen of our chartisms tradesstrikes cornlaws toryisms and the general downbreak of laissezfaire in these daysmay we not regard it as a voice from the dumb bosom of nature saying to us behold supplyanddemand is not the one law of nature cashpayment is not the sole nexus of man with manhow far from it deep far deeper than supplyanddemand are laws obligations sacred as mans life itself these also if you will continue to do work you shall now learn and obey he that will learn them behold nature is on his side he shall yet work and prosper with noble rewards he that will not learn them nature is against him he shall not be able to do work in natures empirenot in hers perpetual mutiny contention hatred isolation execration shall wait on his footsteps till all men discern that the thing which he attains however golden it look or be is not success but the want of success  supplyanddemandalas for what noble work was there ever yet any audible demand in that poor sense the man of macedonia speaking in vision to an apostle paul come over and help us did not specify what rate of wages he would give or was the christian religion itself accomplished by prizeessays bridgwater bequests and a minimum of four thousand five hundred a year no demand that i heard of was made then audible in any labourmarket manchester chamber of commerce or other the like emporium and hiring establishment silent were all these from any whisper of such demandpowerless were all these to supply it had the demand been in thunder and earthquake with gold eldorados and mahometan paradises for the reward ah me into what waste latitudes in this timevoyage have we wandered like adventurous sindbadswhere the men go about as if by galvanism with meaningless glaring eyes and have no soul but only a beaverfaculty and stomach the haggard despair of cottonfactory coalmine operatives chandos farmlabourers in these days is painful to behold but not so painful hideous to the inner sense as that brutish godforgetting profitandloss philosophy and lifetheory which we hear jangled on all hands of us in senatehouses spoutingclubs leadingarticles pulpits and platforms everywhere as the ultimate gospel and candid plainenglish of mans life from the throats and pens and thoughts of allbut all men  enlightened philosophies like molière doctors will tell you enthusiasms selfsacrifice heaven hell and suchlike yes all that was true enough for old stupid times all that used to be true but we have changed all that nous avons changé tout cela well if the heart be got round now into the right side and the liver to the left if man have no heroism in him deeper than the wish to eat and in his soul there dwell now no infinite of hope and awe and no divine silence can become imperative because it is not sinai thunder and no tie will bind if it be not that of tyburn gallowsropesthen verily you have changed all that and for it and for you and for me behold the abyss and nameless annihilation is ready so scandalous a beggarly universe deserves indeed nothing else i cannot say i would save it from annihilation vacuum and the serene blue will be much handsomer easier too for all of us i for one decline living as a patentdigester patentdigester spinningmule mayfair clotheshorse many thanks but your chaosships will have the goodness to excuse me     chapter x  plugson of undershot   one thing i do know never on this earth was the relation of man to man long carried on by cashpayment alone if at any time a philosophy of laissezfaire competition and supplyanddemand start up as the exponent of human relations expect that it will soon end  such philosophies will arise for mans philosophies are usually the supplement of his practice some ornamental logicvarnish some outer skin of articulate intelligence with which he strives to render his dumb instinctive doings presentable when they are done such philosophies will arise be preached as mammongospels the ultimate evangel of the world be believed with what is called belief with much superficial bluster and a kind of shallow satisfaction real in its waybut they are ominous gospels they are the sure and even swift forerunner of great changes expect that the old system of society is done is dying and fallen into dotage when it begins to rave in that fashion most systems that i have watched the death of for the last three thousand years have gone just so the ideal the true and noble that was in them having faded out and nothing now remaining but naked egoism vulturous greediness they cannot live they are bound and inexorably ordained by the oldest destinies mothers of the universe to die curious enough they thereupon as i have pretty generally noticed devise some light comfortable kind of wineandwalnuts philosophy for themselves this of supplyanddemand or another and keep saying during hours of mastication and rumination which they call hours of meditation soul take thy ease it is all well that thou art a vulturesouland pangs of dissolution come upon them oftenest before they are aware  cashpayment never was or could except for a few years be the unionbond of man to man cash never yet paid one man fully his deserts to another nor could it nor can it now or henceforth to the end of the world i invite his grace of castlerackrent to reflect on thisdoes he think that a land aristocracy when it becomes a land auctioneership can have long to live or that slidingscales will increase the vital stamina of it the indomitable plugson too of the respected firm of plugson hunks and company in st dolly undershot is invited to reflect on this for to him also it will be new perhaps even newer bookkeeping by double entry is admirable and records several things in an exact manner but the motherdestinies also keep their tablets in heavens chancery also there goes on a recording and things as my moslem friends say are written on the iron leaf  your grace and plugson it is like go to church occasionally did you never in vacant moments with perhaps a dull parson droning to you glance into your new testament and the cashaccount stated four times over by a kind of quadruple entryin the four gospels there i consider that a cashaccount and balancestatement of work done and wages paid worth attending to precisely such though on a smaller scale go on at all moments under this sun and the statement and balance of them in the plugson ledgers and on the tablets of heavens chancery are discrepant exceedinglywhich ought really to teach and to have long since taught an indomitable commonsense plugson of undershot much more an unattackable uncommonsense grace of rackrent a thing or twoin brief we shall have to dismiss the cashgospel rigorously into its own place we shall have to know on the threshold that either there is some infinitely deeper gospel subsidiary explanatory and daily and hourly corrective to the cash one or else that the cash one itself and all others are fast travelling                                       for all human things do require to have an ideal in them to have some soul in them as we said were it only to keep the body unputrefied and wonderful it is to see how the ideal or soul place it in what ugliest body you may will irradiate said body with its own nobleness will gradually incessantly mould modify newform or reform said ugliest body and make it at last beautiful and to a certain degree divineoh if you could dethrone that brutegod mammon and put a spiritgod in his place one way or other he must and will have to be dethroned  fighting for example as i often say to myself fighting with steel murdertools is surely a much uglier operation than working take it how you will yet even of fighting in religious abbot samsons days see what a feudalism there had growna glorious chivalry much besung down to the present day was not that one of the impossiblest things under the sky is no uglier spectacle than two men with clenched teeth and hellfire eyes hacking one anothers flesh converting precious living bodies and priceless living souls into nameless masses of putrescence useful only for turnipmanure how did a chivalry ever come out of that how anything that was not hideous scandalous infernal it will be a question worth considering by and by  i remark for the present only two things first that the fighting itself was not as we rashly suppose it a fighting without cause but more or less with cause man is created to fight he is perhaps best of all definable as a born soldier his life a battle and a march under the right general it is forever indispensable for a man to fight now with necessity with barrenness scarcity with puddles bogs tangled forests unkempt cottonnow also with the hallucinations of his poor fellow men hallucinatory visions rise in the head of my poor fellow man make him claim over me rights which are not his all fighting as we noticed long ago is the dusty conflict of strengths each thinking itself the strongest or in other words the justestof mights which do in the longrun and forever will in this just universe in the longrun mean rights in conflict the perishable part of them beaten sufficiently flies off into dust this process ended appears the imperishable the true and exact  and now let us remark a second thing how in these baleful operations a noble devouthearted chevalier will comport himself and an ignoble godless bucanier and chactaw indian victory is the aim of each but deep in the heart of the noble man it lies forever legible that as an invisible just god made him so will and must gods justice and this only were it never so invisible ultimately prosper in all controversies and enterprises and battles whatsoever what an influence everpresentlike a soul in the rudest caliban of a body like a ray of heaven and illuminative creative fiatlux in the wastest terrestrial chaos blessed divine influence traceable even in the horror of battlefields and garments rolled in blood how it ennobles even the battlefield and in place of a chactaw massacre makes it a field of honour a battlefield too is great considered well it is a kind of quintessence of labour labour distilled into its utmost concentration the significance of years of it compressed into an hour here too thou shalt be strong and not in muscle only if thou wouldst prevail here too thou shalt be strong of heart noble of soul thou shalt dread no pain or death thou shalt not love ease or life in rage thou shalt remember mercy justicethou shalt be a knight and not a chactaw if thou wouldst prevail it is the rule of all battles against hallucinating fellow men against unkempt cotton or whatsoever battles they may be which a man in this world has to fight  howel davies dyes the westindian seas with blood piles his decks with plunder approves himself the expertest seaman the daringest seafighter but he gains no lasting victory lasting victory is not possible for him not had he fleets larger than the combined british navy all united with him in bucaniering he once for all cannot prosper in his duel he strikes down his man yes but his man or his mans representative has no notion to lie struck down neither though slain ten times will he keep so lyingnor has the universe any notion to keep him so lying on the contrary the universe and he have at all moments all manner of motives to start up again and desperately fight again your napoleon is flung out at last to st helena the latter end of him sternly compensating the beginning the bucanier strikes down a man a hundred or a million men but what profits it he has one enemy never to be struck down nay two enemies mankind and the maker of men on the great scale or on the small in fighting of men or fighting of difficulties i will not embark my venture with howel davies it is not the bucanier it is the hero only that can gain victory that can do more than seem to succeed these things will deserve meditating for they apply to all battle and soldiership all struggle and effort whatsoever in this fight of life it is a poor gospel cashgospel or whatever name it have that does not with clear tone uncontradictable carrying conviction to all hearts forever keep men in mind of these things  unhappily my indomitable friend plugson of undershot has in a great degree forgotten themas alas all the world has as alas our very dukes and souloverseers have whose special trade it was to remember them hence these tearsplugson who has indomitably spun cotton merely to gain thousands of pounds i have to call as yet a bucanier and chactaw till there come something better still more indomitable from him his hundred thousandpound notes if there be nothing other are to me but as the hundred scalps in a chactaw wigwam the blind plugson he was a captain of industry born member of the ultimate genuine aristocracy of this universe could he have known it these thousand men that span and toiled round him they were a regiment whom he had enlisted man by man to make war on a very genuine enemy bareness of back and disobedient cottonfibre which will not unless forced to it consent to cover bare backs here is a most genuine enemy over whom all creatures will wish him victory he enlisted his thousand men said to them come brothers let us have a dash at cotton they follow with cheerful shout they gain such a victory over cotton as the earth has to admire and clap hands at but alas it is yet only of the bucanier or chactaw sortas good as no victory foolish plugson of st dolly undershot does he hope to become illustrious by hanging up the scalps in his wigwam the hundred thousands at his bankers and saying behold my scalps why plugson even thy own host is all in mutiny cotton is conquered but the bare backsare worse covered than ever indomitable plugson thou must cease to be a chactaw thou and others thou thyself if no other  did william the norman bastard or any of his taillefers ironcutters manage so ironcutter at the end of the campaign did not turnoff his thousand fighters but said to them noble fighters this is the land we have gained be i lord in itwhat we will call lawward maintainer and keeper of heavens laws be i lawward or in brief orthoepy lord in it and be ye loyal men around me in it and we will stand by one another as soldiers round a captain for again we shall have need of one another plugson bucanierlike says to them noble spinners this is the hundred thousand we have gained wherein i mean to dwell and plant vineyards the hundred thousand is mine the three and sixpence daily was yours adieu noble spinners drink my health with this groat each which i give you over and above the entirely unjust captain of industry say i not chevalier but bucanier commercial law does indeed acquit him asks with wide eyes what else so too howel davies asks was it not according to the strictest bucanier custom did i depart in any jot or tittle from the laws of the bucaniers  after all money as they say is miraculous plugson wanted victory as chevaliers and bucaniers and all men alike do he found money recognised by the whole world with one assent as the true symbol exact equivalent and synonym of victoryand here we have him a grimbrowed indomitable bucanier coming home to us with a victory which the whole world is ceasing to clap hands at the whole world taught somewhat impressively is beginning to recognise that such victory is but half a victory and that now if it please the powers we musthave the other half  money is miraculous what miraculous facilities has it yielded will it yield us but also what neverimagined confusions obscurations has it brought in down almost to total extinction of the moralsense in large masses of mankind protection of property of what is mine means with most men protection of moneythe thing which had i a thousand padlocks over it is least of all mine is in a manner scarcely worth calling mine the symbol shall be held sacred defended everywhere with tipstaves ropes and gibbets the thing signified shall be composedly cast to the dogs a human being who has worked with human beings clears all scores with them cuts himself with triumphant completeness forever loose from them by paying down certain shillings and pounds was it not the wages i promised you there they are to the last sixpenceaccording to the laws of the bucaniersyes indeedand at such times it becomes imperatively necessary to ask all persons bucaniers and others whether these same respectable laws of the bucaniers are written on gods eternal heavens at all on the inner heart of man at all or on the respectable bucanier logbook merely for the convenience of bucaniering merely what a questionwhereat westminster hall shudders to its driest parchment and on the dead wigs each particular horsehair stands on end  the laws of laissezfaire o westminster the laws of industrial captain and industrial soldier how much more of idle captain and industrial soldier will need to be remodelled and modified and rectified in a hundred and a hundred waysand not in the slidingscale direction but in the totally opposite one with two million industrial soldiers already sitting in bastilles and five million pining on potatoes methinks westminster cannot begin too soona man has other obligations laid on him in gods universe than the payment of cash these also westminster if it will continue to exist and have boardwages must contrive to take some charge ofby westminster or by another they must and will be taken charge of be with whatever difficulty got articulated got enforced and to a certain approximate extent put in practice and as i say it cannot be too soon for mammonism left to itself has become midaseared and with all its gold mountains sits starving for want of bread and dilettantism with its partridgenets in this extremely earnest universe of ours is playing somewhat too high a game a man by the very look of him promises so much yes and by the rentroll of him does he promise nothing                                       alas what a business will this be which our continental friends groping this long while somewhat absurdly about it and about it call organisation of labourwhich must be taken out of the hands of absurd windy persons and put into the hands of wise laborious modest and valiant men to begin with it straightway to proceed with it and succeed in it more and more if europe at any rate if england is to continue habitable much longer looking at the kind of most noble cornlaw dukes or practical duces we have and also of right reverend souloverseers christian spiritual duces on a minimum of four thousand five hundred ones hopes are a little chilled courage nevertheless there are many brave men in england my indomitable plugsonnay is there not even in thee some hope thou art hitherto a bucanier as it was written and prescribed for thee by an evil world but in that grim brow in that indomitable heart which can conquer cotton do there not perhaps lie other tentimes nobler conquests     chapter xi  labour   for there is a perennial nobleness and even sacredness in work were he never so benighted forgetful of his high calling there is always hope in a man that actually and earnestly works in idleness alone is there perpetual despair work never so mammonish mean is in communication with nature the real desire to get work done will itself lead one more and more to truth to natures appointments and regulations which are truth  the latest gospel in this world is know thy work and do it know thyself long enough has that poor self of thine tormented thee thou wilt never get to know it i believe think it not thy business this of knowing thyself thou art an unknowable individual know what thou canst work at and work at it like a hercules that will be thy better plan  it has been written an endless significance lies in work a man perfects himself by working foul jungles are cleared away fair seedfields rise instead and stately cities and withal the man himself first ceases to be a jungle and foul unwholesome desert thereby consider how even in the meanest sorts of labour the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work doubt desire sorrow remorse indignation despair itself all these like helldogs lie beleaguering the soul of the poor dayworker as of every man but he bends himself with free valour against his task and all these are stilled all these shrink murmuring far off into their caves the man is now a man the blessed glow of labour in him is it not as purifying fire wherein all poison is burnt up and of sour smoke itself there is made bright blessed flame  destiny on the whole has no other way of cultivating us a formless chaos once set it revolving grows round and ever rounder ranges itself by mere force of gravity into strata spherical courses is no longer a chaos but a round compacted world what would become of the earth did she cease to revolve in the poor old earth so long as she revolves all inequalities irregularities disperse themselves all irregularities are incessantly becoming regular hast thou looked on the potters wheelone of the venerablest objects old as the prophet ezechiel and far older rude lumps of clay how they spin themselves up by mere quick whirling into beautiful circular dishes and fancy the most assiduous potter but without his wheel reduced to make dishes or rather amorphous botches by mere kneading and baking even such a potter were destiny with a human soul that would rest and lie at ease that would not work and spin of an idle unrevolving man the kindest destiny like the most assiduous potter without wheel can bake and knead nothing other than a botch let her spend on him what expensive colouring what gilding and enamelling she will he is but a botch not a dish no a bulging kneaded crooked shambling squintcornered amorphous botcha mere enamelled vessel of dishonour let the idle think of this  blessed is he who has found his work let him ask no other blessedness he has a work a lifepurpose he has found it and will follow it how as a freeflowing channel dug and torn by noble force through the sour mudswamp of ones existence like an everdeepening river there it runs and flowsdrainingoff the sour festering water gradually from the root of the remotest grassblade making instead of pestilential swamp a green fruitful meadow with its clearflowing stream how blessed for the meadow itself let the stream and its value be great or small labour is life from the inmost heart of the worker rises his godgiven force the sacred celestial lifeessence breathed into him by almighty god from his inmost heart awakens him to all noblenessto all knowledge selfknowledge and much else so soon as work fitly begins knowledge the knowledge that will hold good in working cleave thou to that for nature herself accredits that says yea to that properly thou hast no other knowledge but what thou hast got by working the rest is yet all a hypothesis of knowledge a thing to be argued of in schools a thing floating in the clouds in endless logicvortices till we try it and fix it doubt of whatever kind can be ended by action alone                                       and again hast thou valued patience courage perseverance openness to light readiness to own thyself mistaken to do better next time all these all virtues in wrestling with the dim brute powers of fact in ordering of thy fellows in such wrestle there and elsewhere not at all thou wilt continually learn set down a brave sir christopher in the middle of black ruined stoneheaps of foolish unarchitectural bishops redtape officials idle nellgwyn defenders of the faith and see whether he will ever raise a pauls cathedral out of all that yea or

that can say i have worked the faithfulest of us are unprofitable servants the faithfulest of us know that best the faithfulest of us may say with sad and true old samuel much of my life has been trifled away but he that has and except on public occasions professes to have no function but that of going idle in a graceful or graceless manner and of begetting sons to go idle and to address chief

gravitation are ye rushing                                       as to the wages of work there might innumerable things be said there will and must yet innumerable things be said and spoken in st stephens and out of st stephens and gradually not a few things be ascertained and written on lawparchment concerning this very matterfair dayswages for a fair dayswork is the most unrefusable demand moneywages to the extent of keeping your worker alive that he may work more these unless you mean to dismiss him straightway out of this world are indispensable alike to the noblest worker and to the least noble  one thing only i will say here in special reference to the former class the noble and noblest but throwing light on all the other classes and their arrangements of this difficult matter the wages of every noble work do yet lie in heaven or else nowhere not in bankofengland bills in owens labourbank or any the most improved establishment of banking and moneychanging needest thou heroic soul present thy account of earnings human banks and labourbanks know thee not or know thee after generations and centuries have passed away and thou art clean gone from rewardingall manner of bankdrafts shoptills and downingstreet exchequers lying very invisible so far from thee nay at bottom dost thou need any reward was it thy aim and lifepurpose to be filled with good things for thy heroism to have a life of pomp and ease and be what men call happy in this world or in any other world i answer for thee deliberately no the whole spiritual secret of the new epoch lies in this that thou canst answer for thyself with thy whole clearness of head and heart deliberately no  my brother the brave man has to give his life away give it i advise theethou dost not expect to sell thy life in an adequate manner what price for example would content thee the just price of thy life to theewhy gods entire creation to thyself the whole universe of space the whole eternity of time and what they hold that is the price which would content thee that and if thou wilt be candid nothing short of that it is thy all and for it thou wouldst have all thou art an unreasonable mortalor rather thou art a poor infinite mortal who in thy narrow clayprison here seemest so unreasonable thou wilt never sell thy life or any part of thy life in a satisfactory manner give it like a royal heart let the price be nothing thou hast then in a certain sense got all for it the heroic manand is not every man god be thanked a potential herohas to do so in all times and circumstances in the most heroic age as in the most unheroic he will have to say as burns said proudly and humbly of his little scottish songs little dewdrops of celestial melody in an age when so much was unmelodious by heaven they shall either be invaluable or of no value i do not need your guineas for them it is an element which should and must enter deeply into all settlements of wages here below they never will be satisfactory otherwise they cannot o mammon gospel they never can money for my little piece of work to the extent that will allow me to keep working yes thisunless you mean that i shall go my ways before the work is all taken out of me but as to wages  on the whole we do entirely agree with those old monks laborare est orare in a thousand senses from one end of it to the other true work is worship he that works whatsoever be his work he bodies forth the form of things unseen a small poet every worker is the idea were it but of his poor delf platter how much more of his epic poem is as yet seen halfseen only by himself to all others it is a thing unseen impossible to nature herself it is a thing unseen a thing which never hitherto wasvery impossible for it is as yet a nothing the unseen powers had need to watch over such a man he works in and for the unseen alas if he look to the seen powers only he may as well quit the business his nothing will never rightly issue as a thing but as a deceptivity a shamthingwhich it had better not do  thy nothing of an intended poem o poet who hast looked merely to reviewers copyrights booksellers popularities behold it has not yet become

threeheaded cerberusesnot without sympathy of their sort eccovi l uom ch è stato all inferno for in fine as poet dryden says you do walk hand in hand with sheer madness all the waywho is by no means pleasant company you look fixedly into madness and her undiscovered boundless bottomless nightempire that you may extort new wisdom out of it as an eurydice from tartarus the higher the wisdom the closer was its neighbourhood and kindred with mere insanity literally soand thou wilt with a speechless feeling observe how highest wisdom struggling up into this world has oftentimes carried such tinctures and adhesions of insanity still cleaving to it hither  all works each in their degree are a making of madness sanetruly enough a religious operation which cannot be carried on without religion you have not work otherwise you have eyeservice greedy grasping of wages swift and ever swifter manufacture of semblances to get hold of wages instead of better felthats to cover your head you have bigger lathandplaster hats set travelling the streets on wheels instead of heavenly and earthly guidance for the souls of men you have black or white surplice controversies stuffed

accursed of god and man no man has worked or can work except religiously not even the poor daylabourer the weaver of your coat the sewer of your shoes all men if they work not as in a great taskmasters eye will work wrong work unhappily for themselves and you                                       industrial work still under bondage to mammon the rational soul of it not yet awakened is a tragic spectacle men in the rapidest motion and selfmotion restless with convulsive energy as if driven by galvanism as if possessed by a devil tearing asunder mountainsto no purpose for mammonism is always midaseared this is sad on the face of it yet courage the beneficent destinies kind in their sternness are apprising us that this cannot continue labour is not a devil even while encased in mammonism labour is ever an imprisoned god writhing unconsciously or consciously to escape out of mammonism plugson of undershot like taillefer of normandy wants victory how much happier will even plugson be to have a chivalrous victory than a chactaw one the unredeemed ugliness is that of a slothful people show me a people energetically busy heaving struggling all shoulders at the wheel their heart pulsing every muscle swelling with mans energy and willi show you a people of whom great good is already predicable to whom all manner of good is yet certain if their energy endure by very working they will learn they have antæuslike their foot on mother fact how can they but learn  the vulgarest plugson of a masterworker who can command workers and get work out of them is already a considerable man blessed and thriceblessed symptoms i discern of masterworkers who are not vulgar men who are nobles and begin to feel that they must act as such all speed to these they are englands hope at present but in this plugson himself conscious of almost no nobleness whatever how much is there not without mans faculty insight courage hard energy is this rugged figure his words none of the wisest but his actings cannot be altogether foolish think how were it stoodst thou suddenly in his shoes he has to command a thousand men and not imaginary commanding no it is real incessantly practical the evil passions of so many men with the devil in them as in all of us he has to vanquish by manifold force of speech and of silence to repress or evade what a force of silence to say nothing of the others is in plugson for these his thousand men he has to provide rawmaterial machinery arrangement houseroom and ever at the weeks end wages by due sale no civillist or goulburnbaring budget has he to fall back upon for paying of his regiment he has to pick his supplies from the confused face of the whole earth and contemporaneous history by his dexterity alone there will be dry

giant what sinews of war lie in me untold resources towards the conquest of this planet if instead of hanging me you husband them and help memy indomitable friend it is true and thou shalt and must be helped  this is not a man i would kill and strangle by cornlaws even if i could no i would fling my cornlaws and shotbelts to the devil and try to help this man i would teach him by noble precept and lawprecept by noble example most of all that mammonism was not the essence of his or of my station in gods universe but the adscititious excrescence of it the gross terrene godless embodiment of it which would have to become more or less a godlike one by noble real legislation by true nobleswork by unwearied valiant and were it wageless effort in my parliament and in my parish i would aid constrain encourage him to effect more or less this blessed change i should know that it would have to be effected that unless it were in some measure effected he and i and all of us i first and soonest of all were doomed to perditioneffected it will be unless it were a demon that made this universe which i for my own part do at no moment under no form in the least believe  may it please your serene highnesses your majesties lordships and lawwardships the proper epic of this world is not now arms and the man how much less shirtfrills and the man no it is now tools and the man that henceforth to all time is now our epicand you first of all others i think were wise to take note of that     chapter xiii  democracy   if the serene highnesses and majesties do not take note of that then as i perceive that will take note of itself the time for levity insincerity and idle babble and playacting in all kinds is gone by it is a serious grave time old longvexed questions not yet solved in logical words or parliamentary laws are fast solving themselves in facts somewhat unblessed to behold this largest of questions this question of work and wages which ought had we heeded heavens voice to have begun two generations ago or more cannot be delayed longer without hearing earths voice labour will verily need to be somewhat organised as they saygod knows with what difficulty man will actually need to have his debts and earnings a little better paid by man which let parliaments speak of them or be silent of them are eternally his due from man and cannot without penalty and at length not without deathpenalty be withheld how much ought to cease among us straightway how much ought to begin straightway while the hours yet are  truly they are strange results to which this of leaving all to cash of quietly shuttingup the gods temple and gradually opening wideopen the mammons temple with laissezfaire and every man for himselfhave led us in these days we have upper speaking classes who indeed do speak as never man spake before the withered flimsiness the godless baseness and barrenness of whose speech might of itself indicate what kind of doing and practical governing went on under it for speech is the gaseous element out of which most kinds of practice and performance especially all kinds of moral performance condense themselves and take shape as the one is so will the other be descending accordingly into the dumb class in its stockport cellars and poorlaw bastilles have we not to announce that they also are hitherto unexampled in the history of adams posterity  life was never a maygame for men in all times the lot of the dumb millions born to toil was defaced with manifold sufferings injustices heavy burdens avoidable and unavoidable not play at all but hard work that made the sinews sore and the heart sore as bondslaves villani bordarii sochemanni nay indeed as dukes earls and kings men were oftentimes made weary of their life and had to say in the sweat of their brow and of their soul behold it is not sport it is grim earnest and our back can bear no more who knows not what massacrings and harryings there have been grinding

the lot of those same dumb millions of toilers so entirely unbearable as it is even in the days now passing over us it is not to die or even to die of hunger that makes a man wretched many men have

senior seigneur my elder presbyter or priestif thou art in very deed my wiser may a beneficent instinct lead and impel thee to conquer me to command me if thou do know better than i what is good and right i conjure thee in the name of god force me to do it were it by never such brass collars whips and handcuffs leave me not to walk over precipices that i have been called by all the newspapers a free man will avail me little if my pilgrimage have ended in death and wreck o that the newspapers had called me slave coward fool or what it pleased their sweet voices to name me and i had attained not death but lifeliberty requires new definitions  a conscious abhorrence and intolerance of folly of baseness stupidity poltroonery and all that brood of things dwells deep in some men still deeper in others an unconscious abhorrence and intolerance clothed moreover by the beneficent supreme powers in what stout appetites energies egoisms socalled are suitable to itthese latter are your

of men who are dreadfully exclaimed against by dryasdust of whom nevertheless beneficent nature has oftentimes had need and may alas again have need  when across the hundredfold poor scepticisms trivialisms and constitutional cobwebberies of dryasdust you catch any glimpse of a william the conqueror a tancred of hauteville or suchlikedo you not discern veritably some rude outline of a true godmade king whom not the champion of england cased in tin but all nature and the universe were calling to the throne it is absolutely necessary that he get thither nature does not mean her poor saxon children to perish of obesity stupor or other malady as yet a stern ruler and line of rulers therefore is called ina stern but most beneficent perpetual housesurgeon is by nature herself called in and even the appropriate fees are provided for him dryasdust talks lamentably about hereward and the fen counties fate of earl waltheof yorkshire and the north reduced to ashes all which is undoubtedly lamentable but even dryasdust apprises me of one fact a child in this williams reign might have carried a purse of gold from end to end of england my erudite friend it is a fact which outweighs a thousand sweep away thy constitutional sentimental and other cobwebberies look eye to eye if thou still have any eye in the face of this big burly william bastard thou wilt see a fellow of most flashing discernment of most strong lionheartin whom as it were within a frame of oak and iron the gods have planted the soul of a man of genius dost thou call that nothing i call it an immense thingrage enough was in this willelmus conquæstor rage enough for his occasionsand yet the essential element of him as of all such men is not scorching fire but shining illuminative light fire and light are strangely interchangeable nay at bottom i have found them different forms of the same most godlike elementary substance in our world a thing worth stating in these days the essential element of this conquæstor is first of all the most suneyed perception of what is really what on this godsearthwhich thou wilt find does mean at bottom justice and virtues not a few conformity to what the maker has seen good to make that i suppose will mean justice and a virtue or two  dost thou think willelmus conquæstor would have tolerated ten years jargon one hours jargon on the propriety of killing cottonmanufactures by partridge cornlaws i fancy this was not the man to knock out of his nightsrest with nothing but a noisy bedlamism in your mouth assist us still better to bush the partridges strangle plugson who spins the shirtspar la splendeur de dieudost thou think willelmus conquæstor in this new time with steamengine captains of industry on one hand of him and joemanton captains of idleness on the other would have doubted which was really the best which did deserve strangling and which not  i have a certain indestructible regard for willelmus conquæstor a resident housesurgeon provided by nature for her beloved english people and even furnished with the requisite fees as i said for he by no means felt himself doing natures work this willelmus but his own work exclusively and his own work withal it was informed par la splendeur de dieui say it is necessary to get the work out of such a man however harsh that be when a world not yet doomed for death is rushing down to everdeeper baseness and confusion it is a dire necessity of natures to bring in her aristocracies her best even by forcible methods when their descendants or representatives cease entirely to be the best natures poor world will very soon rush down again to baseness and it becomes a dire necessity of natures to cast them out hence french revolutions fivepoint charters democracies and a mournful list of etceteras in these our afflicted times  to what extent democracy has now reached how it advances irresistible with ominous everincreasing speed he that will open his eyes on any province of human affairs may discern democracy is everywhere the inexorable demand of these ages swiftly fulfilling itself from the thunder of napoleon battles to the jabbering of openvestry in st mary axe all things announce democracy a distinguished man whom some of my readers will hear again with pleasure thus writes to me what in these days he notes from the wahngasse of

you and contented puttingup with the want of themalas thou too mein lieber seest well how close it is of kin to atheism and other sad isms he who discovers no god whatever how shall he discover heroes

the titularherr ritter kauderwälsch von pferdefussquacksalber he our distinguished conservative premier himself and all but the thickerheaded of his party discern democracy to be inevitable as death

ruinous yet a tailor unconsciously symbolising and prophesying with his scissors the reign of equality what now is our fashionable coat a thing of superfinest texture of deeply meditated cut with malineslace cuffs quilted with gold so that a man can carry without difficulty an estate of land on his back keineswegs by no manner of means the sumptuary laws have fallen into such a state of desuetude as was never before seen our fashionable coat is an amphibium between barnsack and draymans doublet the cloth of it is studiously coarse the colour a speckled sootblack or rustbrown gray the nearest approach to a peasants and for shapethou shouldst see it the last consummation of the year now passing over us is definable as three bags a big bag for the body two small bags for the arms and by way of collar a hem the first antique cheruscan who of feltcloth or bearshide with bone or metal needle set about making himself a coat before tailors had yet awakened out of nothingdid not he make it even so a loose wide poke for body with two holes to let out the arms this was his original coat to which holes it was soon visible that two small loose pokes or sleeves easily appended would be an improvement  thus has the tailorart so to speak overset itself like most other things changed its centreofgravity whirled suddenly over from zenith to nadir your stulz with huge somerset vaults from his high shopboard down to the depths of primal savagerycarrying much along with him for i will invite thee to reflect that the tailor as topmost ultimate froth of human society is indeed swiftpassing evanescent slippery to decipher yet significant of much nay of all topmost evanescent froth he is churnedup from the very lees and from all intermediate regions of the liquor the general outcome he visible to the eye of what men aimed to do and were obliged and enabled to do in this one public department of symbolising themselves to each other by covering of their skins a smack of all human life lies in the tailor its wild struggles towards beauty dignity freedom victory and how hemmedin by sedan and huddersfield by nescience dulness prurience and other sad necessities and laws of nature it has attained just to this gray savagery of three sacks with a hem  when the very tailor verges towards sansculottism is it not ominous the last divinity of poor mankind dethroning himself sinking his taper too flame downmost like the genius of sleep or of death admonitory that tailor time shall be no morefor little as one could advise sumptuary laws at the present epoch yet nothing is clearer than that where ranks do actually exist strict division of costumes will also be enforced that if we ever have a new hierarchy and aristocracy acknowledged veritably as such for which i daily pray heaven the tailor will reawaken and be by volunteering and appointment consciously and unconsciously a safeguard of that samecertain farther observations from the same invaluable pen on our neverending changes of mode our perpetual nomadic and even apelike appetite for change and mere change in all the equipments of our existence and the fatal revolutionary character thereby manifested we suppress for the present it may be admitted that democracy in all meanings of the word is in full career irresistible by any ritter kauderwälsch or other son of adam as times go liberty is a thing men are determined to have                                       but truly as i had to remark in the mean while the liberty of not being oppressed by your fellow man is an indispensable yet one of the most insignificant fractional parts of human liberty no man oppresses thee can bid thee fetch or carry come or go without reason shown true from all men thou art emancipated but from thyself and from the devil no man wiser unwiser can make thee come or go but thy own futilities bewilderments thy false appetites for money windsor georges and suchlike no man oppresses thee o free and independent franchiser but does not this stupid porterpot oppress thee no son of adam can bid thee come or go but this absurd pot of heavywet this can and does thou art the thrall not of cedric the saxon but of thy own brutal appetites and this scoured dish of liquor and thou pratest of thy liberty thou entire blockhead  heavywet and gin alas these are not the only kinds of thraldom thou who walkest in a vain show looking out with ornamental dilettante sniff and serene supremacy at all life and all death and amblest jauntily perking up thy poor talk into crotchets thy poor conduct into fatuous somnambulismsand art as an enchanted ape under gods sky where thou mightest have been a man had proper schoolmasters and conquerors and constables with catonine tails been vouchsafed thee dost thou call that liberty or your unreposing mammonworshipper again driven as if by galvanisms by devils and fixedideas who rises early and sits late chasing the impossible straining every faculty to fill himself with the east windhow merciful were it could you by mild persuasion or by the severest tyranny socalled check him in his mad path and turn him into a wiser one all painful tyranny in that case again were but mild surgery the pain of it cheap as health and life instead of galvanism and fixedidea are cheap at any price  sure enough of all paths a man could strike into there is at any given moment a best path for every man a thing which here and now it were of all things wisest for him to dowhich could he be but led or driven to do he were then doing like a man as we phrase it all men and gods agreeing with him the whole universe virtually exclaiming welldone to him his success in such case were complete his felicity a maximum this path to find this path and walk in it is the one thing needful for him whatsoever forwards him in that let it come to him even in the shape of blows and spurnings is liberty whatsoever hinders him were it wardmotes openvestries pollbooths tremendous

national palaver will not all the gods be good to meis one of the pleasantest nature nevertheless is kind at present and puts it into the heads of many almost of all the liberty especially which has to purchase itself by social isolation and each man standing separate from the other having no business with him but a cashaccount this is such a liberty as the earth seldom sawas the earth will not long put up with recommend it how you may this liberty turns out before it have long continued in action with all men flinging up their caps round it to be for the working millions a liberty to die by want of food for the idle thousands and units alas a still more fatal liberty to live in want of work to have no earnest duty to do in this godsworld any more what becomes of a man in such predicament earths laws are silent and heavens speak in a voice which is not heard no work and the ineradicable need of work give rise to new very wondrous lifephilosophies new very wondrous lifepractices

our moslem friends a very strange sabbathday transacting itself therebrethren we know but imperfectly yet after ages of constitutional government what liberty and slavery are  democracy the chase of liberty in that direction shall go its full course unrestrainable by him of pferdefussquacksalber or any of his household the toiling millions of mankind in most vital need and passionate instinctive desire of guidance shall cast away falseguidance and hope for an hour that noguidance will suffice them but it can be for an hour only the smallest item of human slavery is the oppression of man by his mocksuperiors the palpablest but i say at bottom the smallest let him shakeoff such oppression trample it indignantly under his feet i blame him not i pity and commend him but oppression by your mocksuperiors well shaken off the grand problem yet remains to solve that of finding government by your realsuperiors alas how shall we ever learn the solution of that benighted bewildered sniffing sneering godforgetting unfortunates as we are it is a work for centuries to be taught us by tribulations confusions insurrections obstructions who knows if not by conflagration and despair it is a lesson inclusive of all other lessons the hardest of all lessons to learn  one thing i do know those apes chattering on the branches by the dead sea never got it learned but chatter there to this day to them no moses need come a second time a thousand moseses would be but so many painted phantasms interesting fellowapes of new strange aspectwhom they would invite to dinner be glad to meet with in lionsoirées to them the voice of prophecy of heavenly monition is quite ended they chatter there all heaven shut to them to the end of the world the unfortunates oh what is dying of hunger with honest tools in your hand with a manful purpose in your heart and much real labour lying round you done in comparison you honestly quit your tools quit a most muddy confused coil of sore work short rations of sorrows dispiritments and contradictions having now honestly done with it alland await not entirely in a distracted manner what the supreme powers and the silences and the eternities may have to say to you  a second thing i know this lesson will have to be learnedunder penalties england will either learn it or england also will cease to exist among nations england will either learn to reverence its heroes and discriminate them from its shamheroes and valets and gaslighted histrios and to prize them as the audible godsvoice amid all inane jargons and temporary marketcries and say to them with heartloyalty be ye king and priest and gospel and guidance for us or else england will continue to worship new and evernew forms of quackhoodand so with what resiliences and reboundings matters little go down to the father of quacks can i dread such things of england wretched thickeyed grosshearted mortals why will ye worship lies and stuffed clothessuits created by the ninthparts of men it is not your purses that suffer your farmrents your commerces your millrevenues loud as ye lament over these no it is not these alone but a far deeper than these it is your souls that lie dead crushed down under despicable nightmares atheisms brainfumes and are not souls at all but mere succedanea for salt to keep your bodies and their appetites from putrefying your cottonspinning and thricemiraculous mechanism what is this too by itself but a larger kind of animalism spiders can spin beavers can build and show contrivance the ant laysup accumulation of capital and has for aught i know a bank of antland if there is no soul in man higher than all that did it reach to sailing on the cloudrack and spinning seasand then i say man is but an animal a more cunning kind of brute he has no soul but only a succedaneum for salt whereupon seeing himself to be truly of the beasts that perish he ought to admit it i thinkand also straightway universally to kill himself and so in a manlike manner at least end and wave these bruteworlds his dignified farewell     chapter xiv  sir jabesh windbag   oliver cromwell whose body they hung on their tyburn gallows because he had found the christian religion inexecutable in this country remains to me by far the remarkablest governor we have had here for the last five centuries or so for the last five centuries there has been no governor among us with anything like similar talent and for the last two centuries no governor we may say with the possibility of similar talentwith an idea in the heart of him capable of inspiring similar talent capable of coexisting therewith when you consider that oliver believed in a god the difference between olivers position and that of any subsequent governor of this country becomes the more you reflect on it the more immeasurable  oliver no volunteer in public life but plainly a balloted soldier strictly ordered thither enters upon public life comports himself there like a man who carried his own life in his hand like a man whose great commanders eye was always on him not without results oliver welladvanced in years finds now by destiny and his own deservings or as he himself better phrased it by wondrous successive births of providence the government of england put into his hands in senatehouse and battlefield in counsel and in action in private and in public this man has proved himself a man england and the voice of god through waste awful whirlwinds and environments speaking to his great heart summon him to assert formally in the way of solemn public fact and as a new piece of english law what informally and by natures eternal law needed no asserting that he oliver was the ablest man of england the king of england that he oliver would undertake governing england his way of making this same assertion the one way he had of making it has given rise to immense criticism but the assertion itself in what way soever made is it not somewhat of a solemn one somewhat of a tremendous one  and now do but contrast this oliver with my right honourable friend sir jabesh windbag mr facingbothways viscount mealymouth earl of windlestraw or what other cagliostro cagliostrino cagliostraccio the course of fortune and parliamentary majorities has constitutionally guided to that dignity any time during these last sorrowful hundredandfifty years windbag weak in the faith of a god which he believes only at church on sundays if even then strong only in the faith that paragraphs and plausibilities bring votes that force of public opinion as he calls it is the primal necessity of things and highest god we havewindbag if we will consider him has a problem set before him which may be ranged in the impossible class he is a columbus minded to sail to the indistinct country of nowhere to the indistinct country of whitherward by the friendship of those same wastetumbling wateralps and howling waltz of all the winds not by conquest of them and in spite of them but by friendship of them when once they have madeup their mind he is the most original columbus i ever saw nay his problem is not an impossible one he will infallibly arrive at that same country of nowhere his indistinct whitherward will be a thitherward in the ocean abysses and locker of davy jones there certainly enough do he and his ships company and all their cargo and navigatings at last find lodgment  oliver knew that his america lay there westward hoand it was not entirely by friendship of the wateralps and yeasty insane frothoceans that he meant to get thither he sailed accordingly had compasscard and rules of navigationolder and greater than these frothoceans old as the eternal god or again do but think of this windbag in these his probable five years of office has to prosper and get paragraphs the paragraphs of these five years must be his salvation or he is a lost man redemption nowhere in the worlds or in the times discoverable for him oliver too would like his paragraphs successes popularities in these five years are not undesirable to him but mark i say this enormous circumstance after these five years are gone and done comes an eternity for oliver oliver has to appear before the most high judge the utmost flow of paragraphs the utmost ebb of them is now in strictest arithmetic verily no matter at all its exact value zero an account altogether erased enormouswhich a man in these days hardly fancies with an effort olivers paragraphs are all done his battles divisionlists successes all summed and now in that awful unerring court of review the real question first rises whether he has succeeded at all whether he has not been defeated miserably forevermore let him come with worldwide iopæans these avail him not let him come covered over with the worlds execrations gashed with ignominious deathwounds the gallowsrope about his neck what avails that the word is come thou brave and faithful the word is depart thou quack and accursed  o windbag my right honourable friend in very truth i pity thee i say these paragraphs and low or loud votings of thy poor fellowblockheads of mankind will never guide thee in any enterprise at all govern a country on such guidance thou canst not make a pair of shoes sell a pennyworth of tape on such no thy shoes are vamped up falsely to meet the market behold the leather only seemed to be tanned thy shoes melt under me to rubbishy pulp and are not veritable muddefying shoes but plausible vendible similitudes of shoesthou unfortunate and i o my right honourable friend when the paragraphs flowed in who was like sir jabesh on the swelling tide he mounted higher higher triumphant heavenhigh but the paragraphs again ebbed out as unwise paragraphs needs must sir jabesh lies stranded sunk and forever sinking in ignominious ooze the mudnymphs and everdeepening bottomless oblivion his portion to eternal time posterity thou appealest to posterity thou my right honourable friend what will posterity do for thee the voting of posterity were it continued through centuries in thy favour will be quite inaudible extraforensic without any effect whatever posterity can do simply nothing for a man nor even seem to do much if the man be not brainsick besides to tell the truth the bets are a thousand to one posterity will not hear of thee my right honourable friend posterity i have found has generally his own windbags sufficiently trumpeted in all marketplaces and no leisure to attend to ours posterity which has made of norse odin a similitude and of norman william a brute monster what will or can it make of english jabesh o heavens posterity  these poor persecuted scotch covenanters said i to my inquiring frenchman in such stinted french as stood at command ils sen appelaient àa la postérité interrupted he helping me outah monsieur non mille fois non they appealed to the eternal god not to posterity at all cétait différent     chapter xv  morrison again   nevertheless o advancedliberal one cannot promise thee any new religion for some time to say truth i do not think we have the smallest chance of any will the candid reader by way of closing this book third listen to a few transient remarks on that subject  candid readers have not lately met with any man who had less notion to interfere with their thirtynine or other churcharticles wherewith very helplessly as is like they may have struggled to form for themselves some not inconceivable hypothesis about this universe and their own existence there superstition my friend is far from me fanaticism for any fanum likely to arise soon on this earth is far a mans churcharticles are surely articles of price to him and in these times one has to be tolerant of many strange articles and of many still stranger noarticles which go about placarding themselves in a very distracted mannerthe numerous long placardpoles and questionable infirm pastepots interfering with ones peaceable thoroughfare sometimes  fancy a man moreover recommending his fellow men to believe in god that so chartism might abate and the manchester operatives be got to spin peaceably the idea is more distracted than any placardpole seen hitherto in a public thoroughfare of men my friend if thou ever do come to believe in god thou wilt find all chartism manchester riot parliamentary incompetence ministries of windbag and the wildest social dissolutions and the burningup of this entire planet a most small matter in comparison brother this planet i find is but an inconsiderable sandgrain in the continents of being this planets poor temporary interests thy interests and my interests there when i look fixedly into that eternal lightsea and flamesea with its eternal interests dwindle literally into nothing my speech of it issilence for the while i will as soon think of making galaxies and starsystems to guide little herringvessels by as of preaching religion that the constable may continue possible o my advancedliberal friend this new second progress of proceeding to invent god is a very strange one jacobinism unfolded into saintsimonism bodes innumerable blessed things but the thing itself might draw tears from a stoicas for me some twelve or thirteen new religions heavy packets most of them unfranked having arrived here from various parts of the world in a space of six calendar months i have instructed my invaluable friend the stamped postman to introduce no more of them if the charge exceed one penny                                       henry of essex duelling in that thames island near to reading abbey had a religion but was it in virtue of his seeing armed phantasms of st edmund on the rim of the horizon looking minatory on him had that intrinsically anything to do with his religion at all henry of essexs religion was the inner light or moral conscience of his own soul such as is vouchsafed still to all souls of menwhich inner light shone here through such intellectual and other media as there were producing phantasms kircherean visualspectra according to circumstances it is so with all men the clearer my inner light may shine through the less turbid media the fewer phantasms it may producethe gladder surely shall i be and not the sorrier hast thou reflected o serious reader advancedliberal or other that the one end essence use of all religion past present and to come was this only to keep that same moral conscience or inner light of ours alive and shiningwhich certainly the phantasms and the turbid media were not essential for all religion was here to remind us better or worse of what we already know better or worse of the quite infinite difference there is between a good man and a bad to bid us love infinitely the one abhor and avoid infinitely the otherstrive infinitely to be the one and not to be the other all religion issues in due practical heroworship he that has a soul unasphyxied will never want a religion he that has a soul asphyxied reduced to a succedaneum for salt will never find any religion though you rose from the dead to preach him one  but indeed when men and reformers ask for a religion it is analogous to their asking what would you have us to do and suchlike they fancy that their religion too shall be a kind of morrisons pill which they have only to swallow once and all will be well resolutely once gulpdown your religion your morrisons pill you have it all plain sailing now you can follow your affairs your noaffairs go along moneyhunting pleasurehunting dilettanteing dangling and miming and chattering like a deadsea ape your morrison will do your business for you mens notions are very strangebrother i say there is not was not nor will ever be in the wide circle of nature any pill or religion of that character man cannot afford thee such for the very gods it is impossible i advise thee to renounce morrison once for all quit hope of the universal pill for body for soul for individual or society there has not any such article been made non extat in created nature it is not was not will not be in the void imbroglios of chaos only and realms of bedlam does some shadow of it hover to bewilder and bemock the poor inhabitants there  rituals liturgies creeds hierarchies all this is not religion all this were it dead as odinism as fetishism does not kill religion at all it is stupidity alone with never so many rituals that kills religion is not this still a world spinning cotton under arkwright and adam smith founding cities by the fountain of juturna on the janiculum mount tilling canaan under prophet

stupidity itself ought to pause a little and consider that i tell thee through all thy ledgers supplyanddemand philosophies and daily most modern melancholy business and cant there does shine the presence of a primeval unspeakable and thou wert wise to recognise not with lips only that same  the makers laws whether they are promulgated in sinai thunder to the ear or imagination or quite otherwise promulgated are the laws of god transcendent everlasting imperatively demanding obedience from all men this without any thunder or with never so much thunder thou if there be any soul left

this what are all rituals liturgies mythologies masschantings turnings of the rotatory calabash they are as nothing in a good many respects they are as less divorced from this getting halfdivorced from this they are a thing to fill one with a kind of horror with a sacred inexpressible pity and fear the most tragical thing a human eye can look on it was said to the prophet behold i will show thee worse things than these women weeping to thammuz that was the acme of the prophets visionthen as now  rituals liturgies credos sinai thunder i know more or less the history of these the rise progress decline and fall of these can thunder from all the thirtytwo azimuths repeated daily for centuries of years make gods laws more godlike to me brother no perhaps i am grown to be a man now and do not need the thunder and the terror any longer perhaps i am above being frightened perhaps it is not fear but reverence alone that shall now lead merevelations inspirations yes and thy own

greater dastardism i hope my brother thou must pray for a soul struggle as with lifeanddeath energy to get back thy soul know that religion is no morrisons pill from without but a reawakening of thy own self from withinand above all leave me alone of thy religions and new religions here and elsewhere i am weary of this sick croaking for a morrisonspill religion for any and for every such i want none such and discern all such to be impossible the resuscitation of old liturgies fallen dead much more the manufacture of new liturgies that will never be alive how hopeless stylitisms eremite fanaticisms and fakeerisms spasmodic agonistic posturemakings and narrow cramped morbid if forever noble wrestlings all this is not a thing desirable to me it is a thing the world has done oncewhen its beard was not grown as now                                       and yet there is at worst one liturgy which does remain forever unexceptionable that of praying as the old monks did withal by working and indeed the prayer which accomplished itself in special chapels at stated hours and went not with a man rising up from all his work and action at all moments sanctifying the samewhat was it ever good for work is worship yes in a highly considerable sensewhich in the present state of all worship who is there that can unfold he that understands it well understands the prophecy of the whole future the last evangel which has included all others its cathedral the dome of immensityhast thou seen it coped with the stargalaxies paved with the green mosaic of land and ocean and for altar verily the starthrone of the eternal its litany and psalmody the noble acts the heroic work and suffering and true heartutterance of all the valiant of the sons of men its choirmusic the ancient winds and oceans and deeptoned inarticulate but most speaking voices of destiny and historysupernal ever as of old between two great silences      stars silent rest oer us     graves under us silent  between which two great silences do not as we said all human noises in the naturalest times most preternaturally march and roll  i will insert this also in a lower strain from sauerteigs Æsthetische springwurzeln worship says he before that inane tumult of hearsay filled mens heads while the world lay yet silent and the heart true and open many things were worship to the primeval man whatsoever good came descended on him as in mere fact it ever does direct from god whatsoever duty lay visible for him this a supreme god had prescribed to the present hour i ask thee who else for the primeval man in whom dwelt thought this universe was all a temple life everywhere a worship  what worship for example is there not in mere washing perhaps one of the most moral things a man in common cases has it in his power to do strip thyself go into the bath or were it into the limpid pool and running brook and there wash and be clean thou wilt step out again a purer and a better man this consciousness of perfect outer pureness that to thy skin there now adheres no foreign speck of imperfection how it radiates in on thee with cunning symbolic influences to thy very soul thou hast an increase of tendency towards all good things whatsoever the oldest eastern sages with joy and holy gratitude had felt it soand that it was the makers gift and will whose else is it it remains a religious duty from oldest times in the eastnor could herr professor strauss when i put the question deny that for us at present it is still such here in the west to that dingy fuliginous operative emerging from his sootmill what is the first duty i will prescribe and offer help towards that he clean the skin of him can he pray by any ascertained method one knows not entirelybut with soap and a sufficiency of water he can wash even the dull english feel something of this they have a saying cleanliness is near of kin to godlinessyet never in any country saw i operative men worse washed and in a climate drenched with the softest cloudwater such a scarcity of bathsalas sauerteig our operative men are at present short even of potatoes what duty can you prescribe to them  or let us give a glance at china our new friend the emperor there is pontiff of three hundred million men who do all live and work these many centuries now authentically patronised by heaven so far and therefore must have some religion of a kind this emperorpontiff has in fact a religious belief of certain laws of heaven observes with a religious rigour his three thousand punctualities given out by men of insight some sixty generations since as a legible transcript of the samethe heavens do seem to say not totally an incorrect one he has not much of a ritual this pontiffemperor believes it is likest with the old monks that labour is worship his most public act of worship it appears is the drawing solemnly at a certain day on the green bosom of our mother earth when the heavens after dead black winter have again with their vernal radiances awakened her a distinct red furrow with the ploughsignal that all the ploughs of china are to begin ploughing and worshipping it is notable enough he in sight of the seen and unseen powers draws his distinct red furrow there saying and praying in mute symbolism so many most eloquent things  if you ask this pontiff who made him what is to become of him and us he maintains a dignified reserve waves his hand and pontiffeyes over the unfathomable deep of heaven the tsien the azure kingdoms of infinitude as if asking is it doubtful that we are right well made can aught that is wrong become of ushe and his three hundred millions it is their chief punctuality visit yearly the tombs of their fathers each man the tomb of his father and his mother alone there in silence with what of worship or of other thought there may be pauses solemnly each man the divine skies all silent over him the divine graves and this divinest grave all silent under him the pulsings of his own soul if he have any soul alone audible truly it may be a kind of worship truly if a man cannot get some glimpse into the eternities looking through this portalthrough what other need he try it  our friend the pontiffemperor permits cheerfully though with contempt all manner of buddists bonzes talapoins and suchlike to build brick temples on the voluntary principle to worship with what of chantings paperlanterns and tumultuous brayings pleases them and make night hideous since they find some comfort in so doing cheerfully though with contempt he is a wiser pontiff than many persons think he is as yet the one chief potentate or priest in this earth who has made a distinct systematic attempt at what we call the ultimate result of all religion practical heroworship he does incessantly with true anxiety in such way as he can search and sift it would appear his whole enormous population for the wisest born among them by which wisest as by born kings these three hundred million men are governed the heavens to a certain extent do appear to countenance him these three hundred millions actually make porcelain souchong tea with innumerable other things and fight under heavens flag against necessityand have fewer sevenyears wars thirtyyears wars frenchrevolution wars and infernal fightings with each other than certain millions elsewhere have                                       nay in our poor distracted europe itself in these newest times have there not religious voices risenwith a religion new and yet the oldest entirely indisputable to all hearts of men some i do know who did not call or think themselves prophets far enough from that but who were in very truth melodious voices from the eternal heart of nature once again souls forever venerable to all that have a soul a french revolution is one phenomenon as complement and spiritual exponent thereof a poet goethe and german literature is to me another the old secular or practical world so to speak having gone up in fire is not here the prophecy and dawn of a new spiritual world parent of far nobler wider new practical worlds a life of antique devoutness antique veracity and heroism has again become possible is again seen actual there for the most modern man a phenomenon as quiet as it is comparable for greatness to no other the great event for the world is now as always the arrival in it of a new wise man touches there are be the heavens ever thanked of new spheremelody audible once more in the infinite jargoning discords and poor scrannelpipings of the thing called literaturepriceless there as the voice of new heavenly psalms literature like the old prayercollections of the first centuries were it well selected from and burnt contains precious things for literature with all its printingpresses puffingengines and shoreless deafening triviality is yet the thought of thinking souls a sacred religion if you like the name does live in the heart of that strange frothocean not wholly froth which we call literature and will more and more disclose itself therefromnot now as scorching fire the red smoky scorching fire has purified itself into white sunny light is not light grander than fire it is the same element in a state of purity  my ingenuous readers we will march out of this third book with a rhythmic word of goethes on our lips a word which perhaps has already sung itself in dark hours and in bright through many a heart to me finding it devout yet wholly credible and veritable full of piety yet free of cant to me joyfully finding much in it and joyfully missing so much in it this little snatch of music by the greatest german man sounds like a stanza in the grand roadsong and marchingsong of our great teutonic kindred wending wending valiant and victorious through the undiscovered deeps of time he calls it masonlodgenot psalm or hymn      the masons ways are     a type of existence     and his persistence     is as the days are

would not be so impossible had not the past been so sacrilegiously mishandled effaced and what is worse defaced the past cannot be seen the past looked at through the medium of philosophical history in these times cannot even be not seen it is misseen affirmed to have existedand to have been a godless impossibility your norman conquerors true royal souls crowned kings as such were vulturous irrational tyrants your becket was a noisy egoist and hypocrite getting his brains spilt on the floor of canterbury cathedral to secure the main chancesomewhat uncertain how policy fanaticism or say enthusiasm even honest enthusiasmah yes of course      the dog to gain his private ends     went mad and bit the man  for in truth the eye sees in all things what it brought with it the means of seeing a godless century looking back on centuries that were godly produces portraitures more miraculous than any other all was inane discord in the past brute force bore rule everywhere stupidity savage unreason fitter for bedlam than for a human world whereby indeed it becomes sufficiently natural that the like qualities in new sleeker habiliments should continue in our time to rule millions enchanted in bastille workhouses irish widows proving their relationship by typhusfever what would you have it was ever so or worse mans history was it not always even this the cookery and eatingup of imbecile dupedom by successful quackhood the battle with various weapons of vulturous quack and tyrant against vulturous tyrant and quack no god was in the past time nothing but mechanisms and chaotic brutegodshow shall the poor philosophic historian to whom his own century is all godless see any god in other centuries  men believe in bibles and disbelieve in them but of all bibles the frightfulest to disbelieve in is this bible of universal history this is the eternal bible and godsbook which every born man till once the soul and eyesight are extinguished in him can and must with his own eyes see the godsfinger writing to discredit this is an infidelity like no other such infidelity you would punish if not by fire and faggot which are difficult to manage in our times yet by the most peremptory order to hold its peace till it got something wiser to say why should the blessed silence be broken into noises to communicate only the like of this if the past have no godsreason in it nothing but devilsunreason let the past be eternally forgotten mention it no morewe whose ancestors were all hanged why should we talk of ropes  it is in brief not true that men ever lived by delirium hypocrisy injustice or any form of unreason since they came to inhabit this planet it is not true that they ever did or ever will live except by the reverse of these men will again be taught this their acted history will then again be a heroism their written history what it once was an epic nay forever it is either such or else it virtually isnothing were it written in a thousand volumes the unheroic of such volumes hastens incessantly to be forgotten the net content of an alexandrian library of unheroics is and will ultimately show itself to be zero what man is interested to remember it have not all men at all times the liveliest interest to forget itrevelations if not celestial then infernal will teach us that god is we shall then if needful discern without difficulty that he has always been the dryasdust philosophisms and enlightened scepticisms of the eighteenth century historical and other will have to survive for a while with the physiologists as a memorable nightmaredream all this haggard epoch with its ghastly doctrines and deathshead philosophies teaching by example or otherwise will one day have become what to our moslem friends their godless ages are the period of ignorance                                       if the convulsive struggles of the last halfcentury have taught poor struggling convulsed europe any truth it may perhaps be this as the essence of innumerable others that europe requires a real aristocracy a real priesthood or it cannot continue to exist huge french revolutions napoleonisms then bourbonisms with their corollary of three days finishing in very unfinal louisphilippisms all this ought to be didactic all this may have taught us that false aristocracies are insupportable that noaristocracies libertyandequalities are impossible that true aristocracies are at once indispensable and not easily attained  aristocracy and priesthood a governing class and a teaching class these two sometimes separate and endeavouring to harmonise themselves sometimes conjoined as one and the king a pontiffkingthere did no society exist without these two vital elements there will none exist it lies in the very nature of man you will visit no remotest village in the most republican country of the world where virtually or actually you do not find these two powers at work man little as he may suppose it is necessitated to obey superiors he is a social being in virtue of this necessity nay he could not be gregarious otherwise he obeys those whom he esteems better than himself wiser braver and will forever obey such and even be ready and delighted to do it  the wiser braver these a virtual aristocracy everywhere and everywhen do in all societies that reach any articulate shape develop themselves into a ruling class an actual aristocracy with settled modes of operating what are called laws and even privatelaws or privileges and so forth very notable to look upon in this worldaristocracy and priesthood we say are sometimes united for indeed the wiser and the braver are properly but one class no wise man but needed first of all to be a brave man or he never had been wise the noble priest was always a noble aristos to begin with and something more to end with your luther your knox your anselm becket abbot samson samuel johnson if they had not been brave enough by what possibility could they ever have been wiseif from accident or forethought this your actual aristocracy have got discriminated into two classes there can be no doubt but the priest class is the more dignified supreme over the other as governing head is over active hand and yet in practice again it is likeliest the reverse will be found arrangeda sign that the arrangement is already vitiated that a split is introduced into it which will widen and widen till the whole be rent asunder  in england in europe generally we may say that these two virtualities have unfolded themselves into actualities in by far the noblest and richest manner any region of the world ever saw a spiritual guideship a practical governorship fruit of the grand conscious endeavours say rather of the immeasurable unconscious instincts and necessities of men have established themselves very strange to behold everywhere while so much has been forgotten you find the kings palace and the vicekings castle mansion manorhouse till there is not an inch of ground from sea to sea but has both its king and viceking long due series of vicekings its squire earl duke or whatever the title of himto whom you have given the land that he may govern you in it  more touching still there is not a hamlet where poor peasants congregate but by one means and another a churchapparatus has been got togetherroofed edifice with revenues and belfries pulpit readingdesk with books and methods possibility in short and strict prescription that a man stand there and speak of spiritual things to men it is beautifuleven in its great obscuration and decadence it is among the beautifulest most touching objects one sees on the earth this speaking man has indeed in these times wandered terribly from the point has alas as it were totally lost sight of the point yet at bottom whom have we to compare with him of all public functionaries boarded and lodged on the industry of modern europe is there one worthier of the board he has a man even professing and never so languidly making still some endeavour to save the souls of men contrast him with a man professing to do little but shoot the partridges of men i wish he could find the point again this speaking one and stick to it with tenacity with deadly energy for there is need of him yet the speaking function this of truth coming to us with a living voice nay in a living shape and as a concrete practical exemplar this with all our writing and printing functions has a perennial place could he but find the point againtake the old spectacles off his nose and looking up discover almost in contact with him what the real satanas and souldevouring worlddevouring devil now is original sin and suchlike are bad enough i doubt not but distilled gin dark ignorance stupidity dark cornlaw bastille and company what are they will he discover our new real satan whom he has to fight or go on droning through his old nosespectacles about old extinct satans and never see the real one till he feel him at his own throat and ours that is a question for the world let us not intermeddle with it here  sorrowful phantasmal as this same double aristocracy of teachers and governors now looks it is worth all mens while to know that the purport of it is and remains noble and most real dryasdust looking merely at the surface is greatly in error as to those ancient kings william conqueror william rufus or redbeard stephen curthose himself much more henry beauclerc and our brave plantagenet henry the life of these men was not a vulturous fighting it was a valorous governingto which occasionally fighting did and alas must yet though far seldomer now superadd itself as an accident a distressing impedimental adjunct the fighting too was indispensable for ascertaining who had the might over whom the right over whom by much hard fighting as we once said the unrealities beaten into dust flew gradually off and left the plain reality and fact thou stronger than i thou wiser than i thou king and subject i in a somewhat clearer condition  truly we cannot enough admire in those abbotsamson and williamconqueror times the arrangement they had made of their governing classes highly interesting to observe how the sincere insight on their part into what did of primary necessity behove to be accomplished had led them to the way of accomplishing it and in the course of time to get it accomplished no imaginary aristocracy would serve their turn and accordingly they attained a real one the bravest men who it is ever to be repeated and remembered are also on the whole the wisest strongest everyway best had here with a respectable degree of accuracy been got selected seated each on his piece of territory which was lent him then gradually given him that he might govern it these vicekings each on his portion of the common soil of england with a head king over all were a virtuality perfected into an actuality really to an astonishing extent  for those were rugged stalwart ages full of earnestness of a rude godstruthnay at any rate their quilting was so unspeakably thinner than ours fact came swiftly on them if at any time they had yielded to phantasm the knaves and dastards had to be arrested in some measure or the world almost within year and day found that it could not live the knaves and dastards accordingly were got arrested dastards upon the very throne had to be got arrested and taken off the throneby such methods as there were by the roughest method if there chanced to be no smoother one doubtless there was much harshness of operation much severity as indeed government and surgery are often somewhat severe gurth born thrall of cedric it is like got cuffs as often as porkparings if he misdemeaned himself but gurth did belong to cedric no human creature then went about connected with nobody left to go his way into bastilles or worse under laissezfaire reduced to prove his relationship by dying of typhusfeverdays come when there is no king in israel but every man is his own king doing that which is right in his own eyesand tarbarrels are burnt to liberty tenpound franchise and the like with considerable effect in various ways  that feudal aristocracy i say was no imaginary one to a respectable degree its jarls what we now call earls were strongones in fact as well as etymology its dukes leaders its lords lawwards they did all the soldiering and police of the country all the judging lawmaking even the churchextension whatsoever in the way of governing of guiding and protecting could be done it was a land aristocracy it managed the governing of this english people and had the reaping of the soil of england in return it is in many senses the law of nature this same law of feudalismno right aristocracy but a land one the curious are invited to meditate upon it in these days soldiering police and judging churchextension nay real government and guidance all this was actually done by the holders of the land in return for their land how much of it is now done by them done by anybody good heavens laissezfaire do ye nothing eat your wages and sleep is everywhere the passionate halfwise cry of this time and they will not so much as do nothing but must do mere cornlaws we raise fiftytwo millions from the general mass of us to get our governing doneor alas to get ourselves persuaded that it is done and the peculiar burden of the land is to pay not all this but to pay as i learn one twentyfourth part of all this our first chartist parliament or oliver redivivus you would say will know where to lay the new taxes of englandor alas taxes if we made the holders of the land pay every shilling still of the expense of governing the land what were all that the land by mere hired governors cannot be got governed you cannot hire men to govern the land it is by a mission not contracted for in the stockexchange but felt in their own hearts as coming out of heaven that men can govern a land the mission of a land aristocracy is a sacred one in both the senses of that old word the footing it stands on at present might give rise to thoughts other than of cornlaws  but truly a splendour of god as in william conquerors rough oath did dwell in those old rude veracious ages did inform more and more with a heavenly nobleness all departments of their work and life phantasms could not yet walk abroad in mere cloth tailorage they were at least phantasms on the rim of the horizon pencilled there by an eternal lightbeam from within a most practical heroworship went on unconsciously or halfconsciously everywhere a monk samson with a maximum of two shillings in his pocket could without ballotbox be made a viceking of being seen to be worthy the difference between a good man and a bad man was as yet felt to be what it forever is an immeasurable one who durst have elected a pandarus dogdraught in those days to any office carlton club senatorship or place whatsoever it was felt that the arch satanas and no other had a clear right of property in pandarus that it were better for you to have no hand in pandarus to keep out of pandarus his neighbourhood which is to this hour the mere fact though for the present alas the forgotten fact i think they were comparatively blessed times those in their way violence war disorder well what is war and death itself to such a perpetual lifeindeath and peace peace where there is no peace unless some heroworship in its new appropriate form can return this world does not promise to be very habitable long  old anselm exiled archbishop of canterbury one of the purestminded men of genius was travelling to make his appeal to rome against king rufusa man of rough ways in whom the inner lightbeam shone very fitfully it is beautiful to read in monk eadmer how the continental populations welcomed and venerated this anselm as no french population now venerates jeanjacques or giantkilling voltaire as not even an american population now venerates a schnüspel the distinguished novelist they had by phantasy and true insight the intensest conviction that a godsblessing dwelt in this anselmas is my conviction too they crowded round with bent knees and enkindled hearts to receive his blessing to hear his voice to see the light of his face my blessings on them and on himbut the notablest was a certain necessitous or covetous duke of burgundy in straitened circumstances we shall hopewho reflected that in all likelihood this english archbishop going towards rome to appeal must have taken store of cash with him to bribe the cardinals wherefore he of burgundy for his part decided to lie in wait and rob him in an open space of a wood some wood then green and growing eight centuries ago in burgundian landthis fierce duke with fierce steel followers shaggy savage as the russian bear dashes out on the weak old anselm who is riding along there on his small quietgoing pony escorted only by eadmer and another poor monk on ponies and except small modicum of roadmoney not a gold coin in his possession the steelclad russian bear emerges glaring the old whitebearded man starts notpaces on unmoved looking into him with those clear old earnest eyes with that venerable sorrowful timeworn face of whom no man or thing need be afraid and who also is afraid of no created man or thing the fireeyes of his burgundian grace meet these clear eyeglances convey them swift to his heart he bethinks him that probably this feeble fearless hoary figure has in it something of the most high god that probably he shall be damned if he meddle with itthat on the whole he had better not he plunges the rough savage from his warhorse down to his knees embraces the feet of old anselm he too begs his blessing orders men to escort him guard him from being robbed and under dread penalties see him safe on his way per os dei as his majesty was wont to ejaculate  neither is this quarrel of rufus and anselm of henry and becket uninstructive to us it was at bottom a great quarrel for admitting that anselm was full of divine blessing he by no means included in him all forms of divine blessingthere were far other forms withal which he little dreamed of and william redbeard was unconsciously the representative and spokesman of these in truth could your divine anselm your divine pope gregory have had their way the results had been very notable our western world had all become a european thibet with one grand lama sitting at rome our one honourable business that of singing mass all day and all night which would not in the least have suited us the supreme powers willed it not so  it was as if king redbeard unconsciously addressing anselm becket and the others had said right reverend your theory of the universe is indisputable by man or devil to the core of our heart we feel that this divine thing which you call mother church does fill the whole world hitherto known and is and shall be all our salvation and all our desire and yetand yetbehold though it is an unspoken secret the world is wider than any of us think right reverend behold there are yet other immeasurable sacrednesses in this that you call heathenism secularity on the whole i in an obscure but most rooted manner feel that i cannot comply with you western thibet and perpetual masschantingno i am so to speak in the familyway with child of i know not whatcertainly of something far different from this i haveper os dei i have manchester cottontrades bromwicham irontrades american commonwealths indian empires steam mechanisms and shakspeare dramas in my belly and cannot do it right reverendso accordingly it was decided and saxon becket spilt his life in canterbury cathedral as scottish wallace did on towerhill and as generally a noble man and martyr has to donot for nothing no but for a divine something other than he had altogether calculated we will now quit this of the hard organic but limited feudal ages and glance timidly into the immense industrial ages as yet all inorganic and in a quite pulpy condition requiring desperately to harden themselves into some organism  our epic having now become tools and the man it is more than usually impossible to prophesy the future the boundless future does lie there predestined nay already extant though unseen hiding in its continents of darkness gladness and sorrow but the supremest intelligence of man cannot prefigure much of itthe united intelligence and effort of all men in all coming generations this alone will gradually prefigure it and figure and form it into a seen fact straining our eyes hitherto the utmost effort of intelligence sheds but some most glimmering dawn a little way into its dark enormous deeps only huge outlines loom uncertain on the sight and the ray of prophecy at a short distance expires but may we not say here as always sufficient for the day is the evil thereof to shape the whole future is not our problem but only to shape faithfully a small part of it according to rules already known it is perhaps possible for each of us who will with due earnestness inquire to ascertain clearly what he for his own part ought to do this let him with true heart do and continue doing the general issue will as it has always done rest well with a higher intelligence than ours  one grand outline or even two many earnest readers may perhaps at this stage of the business be able to prefigure for themselvesand draw some guidance from one prediction or even two are already possible for the lifetree igdrasil in all its new developments is the selfsame worldold lifetree having found an element or elements there running from the very roots of it in helas realms in the well of mimer and of the three nornas or times up to this present hour of it in our own hearts we conclude that such will have to continue a man has in his own soul an eternal can read something of the eternal there if he will look he already knows what will continue what cannot by any means or appliance whatsoever be made to continue  one wide and widest outline ought really in all ways to be becoming clear to us this namely that a splendour of god in one form or other will have to unfold itself from the heart of these our industrial ages too or they will never get themselves organised but continue chaotic distressed distracted evermore and have to perish in frantic suicidal dissolution a second outline or prophecy narrower but also wide enough seems not less certain that there will again be a king in israel a system of order and government and every man shall in some measure see himself constrained to do that which is right in the kings eyes this too we may call a sure element of the future for this too is of the eternalthis too is of the present though hidden from most and without it no fibre of the past ever was an actual new sovereignty industrial aristocracy real not imaginary aristocracy is indispensable and indubitable for us  but what an aristocracy on what new far more complex and cunningly devised conditions than that old feudal fighting one for we are to bethink us that the epic verily is not arms and the man but tools and the manan infinitely wider kind of epic and again we are to bethink us that men cannot now be bound to men by brasscollarsnot at all that this brasscollar method in all figures of it has vanished out of europe forevermore huge democracy walking the streets everywhere in its sack coat has asserted so much irrevocably brooking no reply true enough man is forever the born thrall of certain men born master of certain other men born equal of certain others let him acknowledge the fact or not it is unblessed for him when he cannot acknowledge this fact he is in the chaotic state ready to perish till he do get the fact acknowledged but no man is or can henceforth be the brasscollar thrall of any man you will have to bind him by other far nobler and cunninger methods once for all he is to be loose of the brasscollar to have a scope as wide as his faculties now arewill he not be all the usefuler to you in that new state let him go abroad as a trusted one as a free one and return home to you with rich earnings at night gurth could only tend pigs this one will build cities conquer waste worldshow in conjunction with inevitable democracy indispensable sovereignty is to exist certainly it is the hugest question ever heretofore propounded to mankind the solution of which is work for long years and centuries years and centuries of one knows not what complexionblessed or unblessed according as they shall with earnest valiant effort make progress therein or in slothful unveracity and dilettantism only talk of making progress for either progress therein or swift and ever swifter progress towards dissolution is henceforth a necessity                                       it is of importance that this grand reformation were begun that cornlaw debatings and other jargon little less than delirious in such a time had fled far away and left us room to begin for the evil has grown practical extremely conspicuous if it be not seen and provided for the blindest fool will have to feel it ere long there is much that can wait but there is something also that cannot wait with millions of eager working men imprisoned in impossibility and poorlaw bastilles it is time that some means of dealing with them were trying to become possible of the government of england of all articulatespeaking functionaries real and imaginary aristocracies of me and of thee it is imperatively demanded how do you mean to manage these men where are they to find a supportable existence what is to become of themand of you     chapter ii  bribery committee   in the case of the late bribery committee it seemed to be the conclusion of the soundest practical minds that bribery could not be put down that pure election was a thing we had seen the last of and must now go on without as we best could a conclusion not a little startling to which it requires a practical mind of some seasoning to reconcile yourself at once it seems then we are henceforth to get ourselves constituted legislators not according to what merit we may have or even what merit we may seem to have but according to the length of our purse and our frankness impudence and dexterity in laying out the contents of the same our theory written down in all books and lawbooks spouted forth from all barrelheads is perfect purity of tenpound franchise absolute sincerity of question put and answer givenand our practice is irremediable bribery irremediable unpunishable which you will do more harm than good by attempting to punish once more a very startling conclusion indeed which whatever the soundest practical minds in parliament may think of it invites all british men to meditations of various kinds  a parliament one would say which proclaims itself elected and eligible by bribery tells the nation that is governed by it a piece of singular news bribery have we reflected what bribery is bribery means not only length of purse which is neither qualification nor the contrary for legislating well but it means dishonesty and even impudent dishonestybrazen insensibility to lying and to making others lie total oblivion and flinging overboard for the nonce of any real thing you can call veracity morality with dextrous puttingon the castclothes of that real thing and strutting about in them what legislating can you get out of a man in that fatal situation none that will profit much one would think a legislator who has left his veracity lying on the doorthreshold he why verily heought to be sent out to seek it again  heavens what an improvement were there once fairly in downingstreet an electionoffice opened with a tariff of boroughs such and such a population amount of propertytax groundrental extent of trade returns two members returns one member for so much money down ipswich so many thousands nottingham so manyas they happened one by one to fall into this new downingstreet schedule a an incalculable improvement in comparison for now at least you have it fairly by length of purse and leave the dishonesty the impudence the unveracity all handsomely aside length of purse and desire to be a legislator ought to get a man into parliament not with but if possible without the unveracity the impudence and the dishonesty length of purse and desire these are as intrinsic qualifications correctly equal to zero but they are not yet less than zeroas the smallest addition of that latter sort will make them  and is it come to this and does our venerable parliament announce itself elected and eligible in this manner surely such a parliament promulgates strange horoscopes of itself what is to become of a parliament elected or eligible in this manner unless belial and beelzebub have got possession of the throne of this universe such parliament is preparing itself for new reformbills we shall have to try it by chartism or any conceivable ism rather than putup with this there is already in england religion enough to get six hundred and fiftyeight consulting men brought together who do not begin work with a lie in their mouth our poor old parliament thousands of years old is still good for something for several thingsthough many are beginning to ask with ominous anxiety in these days for what thing but for whatever thing and things parliament be good indisputably it must start with other than a lie in its mouth on the whole a parliament working with a lie in its mouth will have to take itself away to no parliament or thing that one has heard of did this universe ever long yield harbour on that footing at all hours of the day and night some chartism is advancing some armed cromwell is advancing to apprise such parliament ye are no parliament in the name of godgo  in sad truth once more how is our whole existence in these present days built on cant speciosity falsehood dilettantism with this one serious veracity in it mammonism dig down where you will through the parliamentfloor or elsewhere how infallibly do you at spades depth below the service come upon this universal liarsrock substratum much else is ornamental true on barrelheads in pulpits hustings parliamentary benches but this is forever true and truest money does bring moneys worth put money in your purse here if nowhere else is the human soul still in thorough earnest sincere with a prophets sincerity and the hell of the english as sauerteig said is the infinite terror of not getting on especially of not making money with results  to many persons the horoscope of parliament is more interesting than to me but surely all men with souls must admit that sending members to parliament by bribery is an infamous solecism an act entirely immoral which no man can have to do with more or less but he will soil his fingers more or less no carlton clubs reform clubs nor any sort of clubs or creatures or of accredited opinions or practices can make a lie truth can make bribery a propriety the parliament should really either punish and put away bribery or legalise it by some office in downingstreet as i read the apocalypses a parliament that can do neither of these things is not in a good wayand yet alas what of parliaments and their elections parliamentary elections are but the topmost ultimate outcome of an electioneering which goes on at all hours in all places in every meeting of two or more men it is we that vote wrong and teach the poor ragged freemen of boroughs to vote wrong we pay respect to those worthy of no respect  is not pandarus dogdraught a member of select clubs and admitted into the drawingrooms of men visibly to all persons he is of the offal of creation but he carries money in his purse due lacquer on his dogvisage and it is believed will not steal spoons the human species does not with one voice like the hebrew psalmist shun to sit with dogdraught refuse totally to dine with dogdraught men called of honour are willing enough to dine with him his talk being lively and his champagne excellent we say to ourselves the man is in good societyothers have already voted for him why should not i we forget the indefeasible right of property that satan has in dogdraughtwe are not afraid to be near dogdraught it is we that vote wrong blindly nay with falsity prepense it is we that no longer know the difference between human worth and human unworth or feel that the one is admirable and alone admirable the other detestable damnable how shall we find out a hero and viceking samson with a maximum of two shillings in his pocket we have no chance to do such a thing we have got out of the ages of heroism deep into the ages of flunkyismand must return or die what a noble set of mortals are we who because there is no saint edmund threatening us at the rim of the horizon are not afraid to be whatever for the day and hour is smoothest for us  and now in good sooth why should an indigent discerning freeman give his vote without bribes let us rather honour the poor man that he does discern clearly wherein lies for him the true kernel of the matter what is it to the ragged grimy freeman of a tenpoundfranchise borough whether aristides rigmarole esq of the destructive or the hon alcides dolittle of the conservative party be sent to parliamentmuch more whether the twothousandth part of them be sent for that is the amount of his faculty in it destructive or conservative what will either of them destroy or conserve of vital moment to this freeman has he found either of them care at bottom a sixpence for him or his interests or those of his class or of his cause or of any class or cause that is of much value to god or to man rigmarole and dolittle have alike cared for themselves hitherto and for their own clique and selfconceited crotchetstheir greasy dishonest interests of pudding or windy dishonest interests of praise and not very perceptibly for any other interest whatever neither rigmarole nor dolittle will accomplish any good or any evil for this grimy freeman like giving him a fivepound note or refusing to give it him it will be smoothest to vote according to value received that is the veritable fact and he indigent like others that are not indigent acts conformably thereto  why reader truly if they asked thee or me which way we meant to votewere it not our likeliest answer neither way i as a tenpound franchiser will receive no bribe but also i will not vote for either of these men neither rigmarole nor dolittle shall by furtherance of mine go and make laws for this country i will have no hand in such a mission how dare i if other men cannot be got in england a totally other sort of men different as light is from dark as starfire is from streetmud what is the use of votings or of parliaments in england england ought to resign herself there is no hope or possibility for england if england cannot get her knaves and dastards arrested in some degree but only get them elected what is to become of england                                       i conclude with all confidence that england will verily have to put an end to briberies on her election hustings and elsewhere at what cost soeverand likewise that we electors and eligibles one and all of us for our own behoof and hers cannot too soon begin at what cost soever to put an end to bribeabilities in ourselves the deathleprosy attacked in this manner by purifying lotions from without and by rallying of the vital energies and purities from within will probably abate somewhat it has otherwise no chance to abate     chapter iii  the one institution   what our government can do in this grand problem of the working classes of england yes supposing the insane cornlaws totally abolished all speech of them ended and from ten to twenty years of new possibility to live and find wages conceded us in consequence what the english government might be expected to accomplish or attempt towards rendering the existence of our labouring millions somewhat less anomalous somewhat less impossible in the years that are to follow those ten or twenty if either ten or twenty there be  it is the most momentous question for all this of the cornlaw abrogation and what can follow therefrom is but as the shadow on king hezekiahs dial the shadow has gone back twenty years but will again in spite of freetrades and abrogations travel forward its old fated way with our present system of individual mammonism and government by laissezfaire this nation cannot live and if in the priceless interim some new life and healing be not found there is no second respite to be counted on the shadow on the dial advances thenceforth without pausing what government can do this that they call organising of labour is if well understood the problem of the whole future for all who will in future pretend to govern men but our first preliminary stage of it how to deal with the actual labouring millions of england this is the imperatively pressing problem of the present pressing with a truly fearful intensity and imminence in these very years and days no government can longer neglect it once more what can our government do in it                                       governments are of very various degrees of activity some altogether lazy governments in free countries as they are called seem in these times almost to profess to do if not nothing one knows not at first what to debate in parliament and gain majorities and ascertain who shall be with a toil hardly second to ixions the prime speaker and spokeholder and keep the ixionswheel going if not forward yet round not altogether somuch to the experienced eye is not what it seems chancery and certain other lawcourts seem nothing yet in fact they are the worst of them something chimneys for the devilry and contention of men to escape bya very considerable something parliament too has its tasks if thou wilt look fit to wearout the lives of toughest men the celebrated kilkenny cats through their tumultuous congress cleaving the ear of night could they be said to do nothing hadst thou been of them thou hadst seen the feline heart laboured as with steam upto the bursting point and deathdoing energy nerved every muscle they had a work there and did it on the morrow two tails were found left and peaceable annihilation a neighbourhood delivered from despair  again are not spinningdervishes an eloquent emblem significant of much hast thou noticed him that solemnvisaged turk the eyes shut dingy wool mantle circularly hiding his figurebellshaped like a dingy bell set spinning on the tongue of it by centrifugal force the dingy wool mantle heaves itself spreads more and more like upturned cup widening into upturned saucer thus spins he to the praise of allah and advantage of mankind fast and faster till collapse ensue and sometimes death  a government such as ours consisting of from seven to eight hundred parliamentary talkers with their escort of able editors and public opinion and for head certain lords and servants of the treasury and chief secretaries and others who find themselves at once chiefs and nochiefs and often commanded rather than commandingis doubtless a most complicate entity and none of the alertest for getting on with business clearly enough if the chiefs be not selfmotive and what we call men but mere patient layfigures without selfmotive principle the government will not move anywhither it will tumble disastrously and jumble round its own axis as for many years past we have seen it doand yet a selfmotive man who is not a layfigure place him in the heart of what entity you may will make it move more or less the absurdest in nature he will make a little less absurd he the unwieldiest he will make to movethat is the use of his existing there he will at least have the manfulness to depart out of it if not to say i cannot move in thee and be a man like a wretched driftlog dressed in mans clothes and ministers clothes doomed to a lot baser than belongs to man i will not continue with thee tumbling aimless on the mother of dead dogs hereadieu  for on the whole it is the lot of chiefs everywhere this same no chief in the most despotic country but was a servant withal at once an absolute commanding general and a poor orderlysergeant ordered by the very men in the ranksobliged to collect the vote of the ranks too in some articulate or inarticulate shape and weigh well the same the proper name of all kings is minister servant in no conceivable government can a layfigure get forward this worker surely he above all others has to spread out his gideons fleece and collect the monitions of immensity the poor localities as we said and parishes of palaceyard or elsewhere having no due monition in them a prime minister even here in england who shall dare believe the heavenly omens and address himself like a man and hero to the great dumbstruggling heart of england and speak out for it and act out for it the godsjustice it is writhing to get uttered and perishing for want ofyes he too will see awaken round him in passionate burning alldefiant loyalty the heart of england and such a support as no divisionlist or parliamentary majority was ever yet known to yield a man here as there now as then he who can and dare trust the heavenly immensities all earthly localities are subject to him we will pray for such a man and firstlordyes and far better we will strive and incessantly make ready each of us to be worthy to serve and second such a firstlord we shall then be as good as sure of his arriving sure of many things let him arrive or not                                       who can despair of governments that passes a soldiers guardhouse or meets a redcoated man on the streets that a body of men could be got together to kill other men when you bade them this a priori does it not seem one of the impossiblest things yet look behold it in the stolidest of donothing governments that impossibility is a thing done see it there with buff belts red coats on its back walking sentry at guardhouses brushing white breeches in barracks an indisputable palpable fact out of gray antiquity amid all financedifficulties scaccariumtallies shipmoneys coatandconduct moneys and vicissitudes of chance and time there down to the present blessed hour it is  often in these painfully decadent and painfully nascent times with their distresses inarticulate gaspings and impossibilities meeting a tall lifeguardsman in his snowwhite trousers or seeing those two statuesque lifeguardsmen in their frowning bearskins pipeclayed buckskins on their coalblack sleekfiery quadrupeds riding sentry at the horseguardsit strikes one with a kind of mournful interest how in such universal downrushing and wrecked impotence of almost all old institutions this oldest fighting institution is still so young freshcomplexioned firmlimbed six feet by the standard this fightingman has verily been got up and can fight while so much has not yet got into being while so much has gone gradually out of it and become an empty semblance or clothessuit and highest kingscloaks mere chimeras parading under them so long are getting unsightly to the earnest eye unsightly almost offensive like a costlier kind of scarecrowsblankethere still is a reality  the man in horsehair wig advances promising that he will get me justice he takes me into chancery lawcourts into decades halfcenturies of hubbub of distracted jargon and does get medisappointment almost desperation and one refuge that of dismissing him and his justice altogether out of my head for i have work to do i cannot spend my decades in mere arguing with other men about the exact wages of my work i will work cheerfully with no wages sooner than with a tenyears gangrene or chancery lawsuit in my heart he of the horsehair wig is a sort of failure no substance but a fond imagination of the mind he of the shovelhat again who comes forward professing that he will save my soulo ye eternities of him in this place be absolute silencebut he of the red coat i say is a success and no failure he will veritably if he get orders draw out a long sword and kill me no mistake there he is a fact and not a shadow alive in this year fortythree able and willing to do his work in dim old centuries with william rufus william of ipres or far earlier he began and has come down safe so far catapult has given place to cannon pike has given place to musket iron mailshirt to coat of red cloth saltpetre ropematch to percussioncap equipments circumstances have all changed and again changed but the human battleengine in the inside of any or of each of these ready still to do battle stands there six feet in standard size there are payoffices woolwich arsenals there is a horseguards waroffice captaingeneral persuasive sergeants with tap of drum recruit in markettowns and villagesand on the whole i say here is your actual drilled fightingman here are your actual ninetythousand of such ready to go into any quarter of the world and fight  strange interesting and yet most mournful to reflect on was this then of all the things mankind had some talent for the one thing important to learn well and bring to perfection this of successfully killing one another truly you have learned it well and carried the business to a high perfection it is incalculable what by arranging commanding and regimenting you can make of men these thousand straightstanding firmset individuals who shoulder arms who march wheel advance retreat and are for your behoof a magazine charged with fiery death in the most perfect condition of potential activity few months ago till the persuasive sergeant came what were they multiform ragged losels runaway apprentices starved weavers thievish valets an entirely broken population fast tending towards the treadmill but the persuasive sergeant came by tap of drum enlisted or formed lists of them took heartily to drilling themand he and you have made them this most potent effectual for all work whatsoever is wise planning firm combining and commanding among men let no man despair of governments who looks on these two sentries at the horseguards and our unitedservice clubs i could conceive an emigration service a teaching service considerable varieties of united and separate services of the due thousands strong all effective as this fighting service is all doing their work like itwhich work much more than fighting is henceforth the necessity of these new ages we are got into much lies among us convulsively nigh desperately struggling to be born  but mean governments as meanlimited individuals do have stood by the physically indispensable have realised that and nothing more the soldier is perhaps one of the most difficult things to realise but governments had they not realised him could not have existed accordingly he is here o heavens if we saw an army ninetythousand strong maintained and fully equipt in continual real action and battle against human starvation against chaos necessity stupidity and our real natural enemies what a business were it fighting and molesting not the french who poor men have a hard enough battle of their own in the like kind and need no additional molesting from us but fighting and incessantly spearing down and destroying falsehood nescience delusion disorder and the devil and his angels thou thyself cultivated reader hast done something in that alone true warfare but alas under what circumstances was it thee no beneficent drillsergeant with any effectiveness would rank in line beside thy fellows train like a true didactic artist by the wit of all past experience to do thy soldiering encourage thee when right punish thee when wrong and everywhere with wise wordofcommand say forward on this hand forward on that ah no thou hadst to learn thy smallsword and platoon exercise where and how thou couldst to all mortals but thyself it was indifferent whether thou shouldst ever learn it and the rations and shilling a day were they provided theereduced as i have known brave jeanpauls learning their exercise to live on water without the bread the rations or any furtherance of promotion to corporalship lancecorporalship or due catonine tails with the slightest reference to thy deserts were not provided forethought even as of a pipeclayed drillsergeant did not preside over thee to corporalship lancecorporalship thou didst attain alas also to the halberts and cat but thy rewarder and punisher seemed blind as the deluge neither lancecorporalship nor even drummers cat because both appeared delirious brought thee due profit  it was well all this we knowand yet it was not well forty soldiers i am told will disperse the largest spitalfields mob forty to tenthousand that is the proportion between drilled and undrilled much there is which cannot yet be organised in this world but somewhat also which can somewhat also which must when one thinks for example what books are become and becoming for us what operative lancashires are become what a fourth estate and innumerable virtualities not yet got to be actualities are become and becomingone sees organisms enough in the dim huge future and united services quite other than the redcoat one and much even in these years struggling to be born  of timebill factorybill and other such bills the present editor has no authority to speak he knows not it is for others than he to know in what specific ways it may be feasible to interfere with legislation between the workers and the masterworkersknows only and sees what all men are beginning to see that legislative interference and interferences not a few are indispensable that as a lawless anarchy of supplyanddemand on marketwages alone this province of things cannot longer be left nay interference has begun there are already factory inspectorswho seem to have no lack of work perhaps there might be mineinspectors toomight there not be furrowfield inspectors withal and ascertain for us how on seven and sixpence a week a human family does live interference has begun it must continue must extensively enlarge itself deepen and sharpen itself such things cannot longer be idly lapped in darkness and suffered to go on unseen the heavens do see them the curse not the blessing of the heavens is on an earth that refuses to see them  again are not sanitary regulations possible for a legislature the old romans had their Ædiles who would i think in direct contravention to supplyanddemand have rigorously seen rammed up into total abolition many a foul cellar in our southwarks saintgileses and dark poisonlanes saying sternly shall a roman man dwell there the legislature at whatever cost of consequences would have had to answer god forbidthe legislature even as it now is could order all dingy manufacturing towns to cease from their soot and darkness to letin the blessed sunlight the blue of heaven and become clear and clean to burn their coalsmoke namely and make flame of it baths free air a wholesome temperature ceilings twenty feet high might be ordained by act of parliament in all establishments licensed as mills there are such mills already extanthonour to the builders of them the legislature can say to others go ye and do likewise better if you can  every toiling manchester its smoke and soot all burnt ought it not among so many worldwide conquests to have a hundred acres or so of free greenfield with trees on it conquered for its little children to disport in for its allconquering workers to take a breath of twilight air in you would say so a willing legislature could say so with effect a willing legislature could say very many things and to whatsoever vested interest or suchlike stood up gainsaying merely i shall lose profitsthe willing legislature would answer yes but my sons and daughters will gain health and life and a soulwhat is to become of our cottontrade cried certain spinners when the factory bill was proposed what is to become of our invaluable cottontrade the humanity of england answered steadfastly deliver me these rickety perishing souls of infants and let your cottontrade take its chance god himself commands the one thing not god especially the other thing we cannot have prosperous cottontrades at the expense of keeping the devil a partner in them  bills enough were the cornlaw abrogation bill once passed and a legislature willing nay this one bill which lies yet unenacted a right education bill is not this of itself the sure parent of innumerable wise billswise regulations practical methods and proposals gradually ripening towards the state of bills to irradiate with intelligence that is to say with order arrangement and all blessedness the chaotic unintelligent how except by educating can you accomplish this that thought reflection articulate utterance and understanding be awakened in these individual million heads which are the atoms of your chaos there is no other way of illuminating any chaos the sumtotal of intelligence that is found in it determines the extent of order that is possible for your chaosthe feasibility and rationality of what your chaos will dimly demand from you and will gladly obey when proposed by you it is an exact equation the one accurately measures the otherif the whole english people during these twenty years of respite be not educated with at least schoolmasters educating a tremendous responsibility before god and men will rest somewhere how dare any man especially a man calling himself minister of god stand up in any parliament or place under any pretext or delusion and for a day or an hour forbid gods light to come into the world and bid the devils darkness continue in it one hour more for all light and science under all shapes in all degrees of perfection is of god all darkness nescience is of the enemy of god the schoolmasters creed is somewhat awry yes i have found few creeds entirely correct few lightbeams shining white pure of admixture but of all creeds and religions now or ever before known was not that of thoughtless thriftless animalism of distilled gin and stupor and despair unspeakably the least orthodox we will exchange it even with paganism with fetishism and on the whole must exchange it with something  an effective teaching service i do consider that there must be some education secretary captaingeneral of teachers who will actually contrive to get us taught then again why should there not be an emigration service and secretary with adjuncts with funds forces idle navyships and everincreasing apparatus in fine an effective system of emigration so that at length before our twenty years of respite ended every honest willing workman who found england too strait and the organisation of labour not yet sufficiently advanced might find likewise a bridge built to carry him into new western lands there to organise with more elbowroom some labour for himself there to be a real blessing raising new corn for us purchasing new webs and hatchets from us leaving us at least in peaceinstead of staying here to be a physicalforce chartist unblessed and no blessing is it not scandalous to consider that a prime minister could raise within the year as i have seen it done a hundred and twenty millions sterling to shoot the french and we are stopt short for want of the hundredth part of that to keep the english living the bodies of the english living and the souls of the english livingthese two services an education service and an emigration service these with others will actually have to be organised  a free bridge for emigrants why we should then be on a par with america itself the most favoured of all lands that have no government and we should have besides so many traditions and mementos of priceless things which america has cast away we could proceed deliberately to organise labour not doomed to perish unless we effected it within year and dayevery willing worker that proved superfluous finding a bridge ready for him this verily will have to be done the time is big with this our little isle is grown too narrow for us but the world is wide enough yet for another six thousand years englands sure markets will be among new colonies of englishmen in all quarters of the globe all men trade with all men when mutually convenient and are even bound to do it by the maker of men our friends of china who guiltily refused to trade in these circumstanceshad we not to argue with them in cannonshot at last and convince them that they ought to trade hostile tariffs will arise to shut us out and then again will fall to let us in but the sons of england speakers of the english language were it nothing more will in all times have the ineradicable predisposition to trade with england mycale was the panionian rendezvous of all the tribes of ion for old greece why should not london long continue the allsaxonhome rendezvous of all the children of the harzrock arriving in select samples from the antipodes and elsewhere by steam and otherwise to the season herewhat a future wide as the world if we have the heart and heroism for itwhich by heavens blessing we shall      keep not standing fixed and rooted     briskly venture briskly roam     head and hand whereer thou foot it     and stout heart are still at home      in what land the sun does visit     brisk are we whateer betide     to give space for wandering is it     that the world was made so wide28  fourteen hundred years ago it was by a considerable emigration service never doubt it by much enlistment discussion and apparatus that we ourselves arrived in this remarkable islandand got into our present difficulties among others                                       it is true the english legislature like the english people is of slow temper essentially conservative in our wildest periods of reform in the long parliament itself you notice always the invincible instinct to hold fast by the old to admit the minimum of new to expand if it be possible some old habit or method already found fruitful into new growth for the new need it is an instinct worthy of all honour akin to all strength and all wisdom the future hereby is not dissevered from the past but based continuously on it grows with all the vitalities of the past and is rooted down deep into the beginnings of us the english legislature is entirely repugnant to believe in new epochs the english legislature does not occupy itself with epochs has indeed other business to do than looking at the timehorologe and hearing it tick nevertheless new epochs do actually come and with them new imperious peremptory necessities so that even an english legislature has to look up and admit though with reluctance that the hour has struck the hour having struck let us not say impossibleit will have to be possible contrary to the habits of parliament the habits of government yes but did any parliament or government ever sit in a year fortythree before one of the most original unexampled years and epochs in several important respects totally unlike any other for time alledacious and allferacious does run on and the seven sleepers awakening hungry after a hundred years find that it is not their old nurses who can now give them suck  for the rest let not any parliament aristocracy millocracy or member of the governing class condemn with much triumph this small specimen of remedial measures or ask again with the least anger of this editor what is to be done how that alarming problem of the working classes is to be managed editors are not here foremost of all to say how a certain editor thanks the gods that nobody pays him three hundred thousand pounds a year two hundred thousand twenty thousand or any similar sum of cash for saying howthat his wages are very different his work somewhat fitter for him an editors stipulated work is to apprise thee that it must be done the way to do itis to try it knowing that thou shalt die if it be not done there is the bare back there is the web of cloth thou shalt cut me a coat to cover the bare back thou whose trade it is impossible hapless fraction dost thou discern fate there half unveiling herself in the gloom of the future with her gibbetcords her steelwhips and very authentic tailors hell waiting to see whether it is possible out with thy scissors and cut that cloth or thy own windpipe  footnotes  28 goethe wilhelm meister     chapter iv  captains of industry   if i believed that mammonism with its adjuncts was to continue henceforth the one serious principle of our existence i should reckon it idle to solicit remedial measures from any government the disease being insusceptible of remedy government can do much but it can in no wise do all government as the most conspicuous object in society is called upon to give signal of what shall be done and in many ways to preside over further and command the doing of it but the government cannot do by all its signaling and commanding what the society is radically indisposed to do in the longrun every government is the exact symbol of its people with their wisdom and unwisdom we have to say like people like governmentthe main substance of this immense problem of organising labour and first of all of managing the working classes will it is very clear have to be solved by those who stand practically in the middle of it by those who themselves work and preside over work of all that can be enacted by any parliament in regard to it the germs must already lie potentially extant in those two classes who are to obey such enactment a human chaos in which there is no light you vainly attempt to irradiate by light shed on it order never can arise there  but it is my firm conviction that the hell of england will cease to be that of not making money that we shall get a nobler hell and a nobler heaven i anticipate light in the human chaos glimmering shining more and more under manifold true signals from without that light shall shine our deity no longer being mammono heavens each man will then say to himself why such deadly haste to make money i shall not go to hell even if i do not make money there is another hell i am told competition at railwayspeed in all branches of commerce and work will then abategood felthats for the head in every sense instead of sevenfeet lathandplaster hats on wheels will then be discoverable bubbleperiods with their panics and commercial crises will again become infrequent steady modest industry will take the place of gambling speculation to be a noble master among noble workers will again be the first ambition with some few to be a rich master only the second how the inventive genius of england with the whirr of its bobbins and billyrollers shoved somewhat into the backgrounds of the brain will contrive and devise not cheaper produce exclusively but fairer distribution of the produce at its present cheapness by degrees we shall again have a society with something of heroism in it something of heavens blessing on it we shall again have as my german friend asserts instead of mammonfeudalism with unsold cottonshirts and preservation of the game noble just industrialism and government by the wisest  it is with the hope of awakening here and there a british man to know himself for a man and divine soul that a few words of parting admonition to all persons to whom the heavenly powers have lent power of any kind in this land may now be addressed and first to those same masterworkers leaders of industry who stand nearest and in fact powerfulest though not most prominent being as yet in too many senses a virtuality rather than an actuality                                       the leaders of industry if industry is ever to be led are virtually the captains of the world if there be no nobleness in them there will never be an aristocracy more but let the captains of industry consider once again are they born of other clay than the old captains of slaughter doomed forever to be no chivalry but a mere goldplated doggerywhat the french well name canaille doggery with more or less gold carrion at its disposal captains of industry are the true fighters henceforth recognisable as the only true ones fighters against chaos necessity and the devils and jötuns and lead on mankind in that great and alone true and universal warfare the stars in their courses fighting for them and all heaven and all earth saying audibly well done let the captains of industry retire into their own hearts and ask solemnly if there is nothing but vulturous hunger for fine wines valet reputation and gilt carriages discoverable there of hearts made by the almighty god i will not believe such a thing deephidden under wretchedest godforgetting cants epicurisms deadsea apisms forgotten as under foulest fat lethe mud and weeds there is yet in all hearts born into this godsworld a spark of the godlike slumbering awake o nightmare sleepers awake arise or be forever fallen this is not playhouse poetry it is sober fact our england our world cannot live as it is it will connect itself with a god again or go down with nameless throes and fireconsummation to the devils thou who feelest aught of such a godlike stirring in thee any faintest intimation of it as through heavyladen dreams follow it i conjure thee arise save thyself be one of those that save thy country  bucaniers chactaw indians whose supreme aim in fighting is that they may get the scalps the money that they may amass scalps and money out of such came no chivalry and never will out of such came only gore and wreck infernal rage and misery desperation quenched in annihilation behold it i bid thee behold there and consider what is it that thou have a hundred thousandpound bills laidup in thy strongroom a hundred scalps hungup in thy wigwam i value not them or thee thy scalps and thy thousandpound bills are as yet nothing if no nobleness from within irradiate them if no chivalry in action or in embryo ever struggling towards birth and action be there  love of men cannot be bought by cashpayment and without love men cannot endure to be together you cannot lead a fighting world without having it regimented chivalried the thing in a day becomes impossible all men in it the highest at first the very lowest at last discern consciously or by a noble instinct this necessity and can you any more continue to lead a working world unregimented anarchic i answer and the heavens and earth are now answering no the thing becomes not in a day impossible but in some two generations it does yes when fathers and mothers in stockport hungercellars begin to eat their children and irish widows have to prove their relationship by dying of typhusfever and amid governing corporations of the best and bravest busy to preserve their game by bushing dark millions of gods human creatures start up in mad chartisms impracticable sacredmonths and manchester insurrectionsand there is a virtual industrial aristocracy as yet only halfalive spellbound amid moneybags and ledgers and an actual idle aristocracy seemingly near dead in somnolent delusions in trespasses and doublebarrels sliding as on inclinedplanes which every new year they soap with new hansardsjargon under gods sky and so are sliding ever faster towards a scale and balancescale whereon is written thou art found wantingin such days after a generation or two i say it does become even to the low and simple very palpably impossible no working world any more than a fighting world can be led on without a noble chivalry of work and laws and fixed rules which follow out of thatfar nobler than any chivalry of fighting was as an anarchic multitude on mere

for a hired fighter the feudal baron much morehow could he subsist with mere temporary mercenaries round him at sixpence a day ready to go over to the other side if sevenpence were offered he could not have subsistedand his noble instinct saved him from the necessity of even trying the feudal baron had a mans soul in him to which anarchy mutiny and the other fruits of temporary mercenaries were intolerable he had never been a baron otherwise but had continued a chactaw and bucanier he felt it precious and at last it became habitual and his fruitful enlarged existence included it as a

future which it is to fill with fruitfulness and verdant shade where so much has not yet come even to the rudimental state and all speech of positive enactments were hazardous in those who know this business only by the eyelet us here hint at simply one widest universal principle as the basis from which all organisation hitherto has grown up among men and all henceforth will have to grow the

permanence persistence is the first condition of all fruitfulness in the ways of men the tendency to persevere to persist in spite of hindrances discouragements and impossibilities it is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak the civilised burgher from the nomadic savagethe species man from the genus ape the nomad has his very house set on wheels the nomad and in a still higher degree the ape are all for liberty the privilege to flit continually is indispensable for them alas in how many ways does our humour in this swiftrolling selfabrading time show itself nomadic apelike mournful enough to him that looks on it with eyes this humour will have to abate it is the first element of all fertility in human things that such liberty of apes and nomads do by freewill or constraint abridge itself give place to a better the civilised man lives not in wheeled houses he builds stone castles plants lands makes lifelong marriagecontractshas longdated

marginal incidental note from a practical manufacturing quaker whom as he is anonymous we will call friend prudence prudence keeps a thousand workmen has striven in all ways to attach them to him has provided conversational soirées playgrounds bands of music for the young ones went even the length of buying them a drum all which has turned out to be an excellent investment for a certain person

againin some wise way in any not delirious way                                       a question arises here whether in some ulterior perhaps some not fardistant stage of this chivalry of labour your masterworker may not find it possible and needful to grant his workers permanent interest in his enterprise and theirs so that it become in practical result what in essential fact and justice it ever is a joint enterprise all men from the chief master down to the lowest overseer and operative economically as well as loyally concerned for itwhich question i do not answer the answer near or else far is perhaps yesand yet one knows the difficulties despotism is essential in most enterprises i am told they do not tolerate freedom of debate on board a seventyfour republican senate and plebiscita would not answer well in cottonmills and yet observe there too freedom not nomads or apes freedom but mans freedom this is indispensable we must have it and will have it to reconcile despotism with freedomwell is that such a mystery do you not already know the way it is to make your despotism just rigorous as destiny but just too as destiny and its laws the laws of god all men obey these and have no freedom at all but in obeying them the way is already known part of the wayand courage and some qualities are needed for walking on it  footnotes  29 report on the training of pauper children
