31519968	annajanska the bolshevik empress   by george bernard shaw   annajanska is frankly a bravura piece the modern variety theatre demands for its turns little plays called sketches to last twenty minutes or so and to enable some favorite performer to make a brief but dazzling appearance on some barely passable dramatic pretext miss lillah mccarthy and i as author and actress have helped to make one another famous on many serious occasions from man and superman to androcles and mr charles ricketts has not disdained to snatch moments from his painting and sculpture to design some wonderful dresses for us we three unbent as mrs siddons sir joshua reynolds and dr johnson might have unbent to devise a turn for the coliseum variety theatre not that we would set down the art of the variety theatre as something to be condescended to or our own art as elephantine we should rather crave indulgence as three novices fresh from the awful legitimacy of the highbrow theatre  well miss mccarthy and mr ricketts justified themselves easily in the glamor of the footlights to the strains of tchaikovskys 1812 i fear i did not i have received only one compliment on my share and that was from a friend who said it is the only one of your works that is not too long so i have made it a page or two longer according to my own precept embrace your reproaches they are often glories in disguise  annajanska was first performed at the coliseum theatre in london on the 21st january 1918 with lillah mccarthy as the grand duchess henry miller as schneidekind and randle ayrton as general strammfest     annajanska the bolshevik empress  the generals office in a military station on the east front in beotia an office table with a telephone writing materials official papers etc is set across the room at the end of the table a comfortable chair for the general behind the chair a window facing it at the other end of the table a plain wooden bench at the side of the table with its back to the door a common chair with a typewriter before it beside the door which is opposite the end of the bench a rack for caps and coats there is nobody in the room  general strammfest enters followed by lieutenant schneidekind they hang up their cloaks and caps schneidekind takes a little longer than strammfest who comes to the table  strammfest schneidekind  schneidekind yes sir  strammfest have you sent my report yet to the government he sits down  schneidekind coming to the table not yet sir which government do you wish it sent to he sits down  strammfest that depends whats the latest which of them do you think is most likely to be in power tomorrow morning  schneidekind well the provisional government was going strong yesterday but today they say that the prime minister has shot himself and that the extreme left fellow has shot all the others  strammfest yes thats all very well but these fellows always shoot themselves with blank cartridge  schneidekind still even the blank cartridge means backing down i should send the report to the maximilianists  strammfest theyre no stronger than the oppidoshavians and in my own opinion the moderate red revolutionaries are as likely to come out on top as either of them  schneidekind i can easily put a few carbon sheets in the typewriter and send a copy each to the lot  strammfest waste of paper you might as well send reports to an infant school he throws his head on the table with a groan  schneidekind tired out sir  strammfest o schneidekind schneidekind how can you bear to live  schneidekind at my age sir i ask myself how can i bear to die  strammfest you are young young and heartless you are excited by the revolution you are attached to abstract things like liberty but my family has served the panjandrums of beotia faithfully for seven centuries the panjandrums have kept our place for us at their courts honored us promoted us shed their glory on us made us what we are when i hear you young men declaring that you are fighting for civilization for democracy for the overthrow of militarism i ask myself how can a man shed his blood for empty words used by vulgar tradesmen and common laborers mere wind and stink he rises exalted by his theme a king is a splendid reality a man raised above us like a god you can see him you can kiss his hand you can be cheered by his smile and terrified by his frown i would have died for my panjandrum as my father died for his father your toiling millions were only too honored to receive the toes of our boots in the proper spot for them when they displeased their betters and now what is left in life for me he relapses into his chair discouraged my panjandrum is deposed and transported to herd with convicts the army his pride and glory is paraded to hear seditious speeches from penniless rebels with the colonel actually forced to take the chair and introduce the speaker i myself am made commanderinchief by my own solicitor a jew schneidekind a hebrew jew it seems only yesterday that these things would have been the ravings of a madman today they are the commonplaces of the gutter press i live now for three objects only to defeat the enemy to restore the panjandrum and to hang my solicitor  schneidekind be careful sir these are dangerous views to utter nowadays what if i were to betray you  strammfest what  schneidekind i wont of course my own father goes on just like that but suppose i did  strammfest chuckling i should accuse you of treason to the revolution my lad and they would immediately shoot you unless you cried and asked to see your mother before you died when they would probably change their minds and make you a brigadier enough he rises and expands his chest i feel the better for letting myself go to business he takes up a telegram opens it and is thunderstruck by its contents great heaven he collapses into his chair this is the worst blow of all  schneidekind what has happened are we beaten  strammfest man do you think that a mere defeat could strike me down as this news does i who have been defeated thirteen times since the war began o my master my master my panjandrum he is convulsed with sobs  schneidekind they have killed him  strammfest a dagger has been struck through his heart  schneidekind good god  strammfest and through mine through mine  schneidekind relieved oh a metaphorical dagger i thought you meant a real one what has happened  strammfest his daughter the grand duchess annajanska she whom the panjandrina loved beyond all her other children hashas he cannot finish  schneidekind committed suicide  strammfest no better if she had oh far far better  schneidekind in hushed tones left the church  strammfest shocked certainly not do not blaspheme young man  schneidekind asked for the vote  strammfest i would have given it to her with both hands to save her from this  schneidekind save her from what dash it sir out with it  strammfest she has joined the revolution  schneidekind but so have you sir weve all joined the revolution she doesnt mean it any more than we do  strammfest heaven grant you may be right but that is not the worst she had eloped with a young officer eloped schneidekind eloped  schneidekind not particularly impressed yes sir  strammfest annajanska the beautiful the innocent my masters daughter he buries his face in his hands  the telephone rings  schneidekind taking the receiver yes ghq yes dont bawl im not a general who is it speaking why didnt you say so dont you know your duty next time you will lose your stripe oh

yielding the receiver you are right be civil to him i should choke he sits down  schneidekind into the telephone hullo never mind all that its only a fellow here who has been fooling with the telephone i had to leave the room for a moment wash out and send the girl along well jolly soon teach her to behave herself here oh youve sent her already then why the devil didnt you say so youhe hangs up the telephone angrily just fancy they started her off this morning and all this is because the fellow likes to get on the telephone and hear himself talk now that he is a colonel the telephone rings again he snatches the receiver furiously whats the matter now to the general its our own people downstairs into the receiver here do you suppose ive nothing else to do than to hang on to the telephone all day whats that not men enough to hold her what do you mean to the general she is there sir  strammfest tell them to send her up i shall have to receive her without even rising without kissing her hand to keep up appearances before the escort it will break my heart  schneidekind into the receiver send her up tcha he hangs up the receiver he says she is halfway up already they couldnt hold her  the grand duchess bursts into the room dragging with her two exhausted soldiers hanging on desperately to her arms she is enveloped from head to foot by a furlined cloak and wears a fur cap  schneidekind pointing to the bench at the word go place your prisoner on the bench in a sitting posture and take your seats right and left of her go  the two soldiers make a supreme effort to force her to sit down she flings them back so that they are forced to sit on the bench to save themselves from falling backwards over it and is herself dragged into sitting between them the second soldier holding on tight to the grand duchess with one hand produces papers with the other and waves them towards schneidekind who takes them from him and passes them on to the general he opens them and reads them with a grave expression  schneidekind be good enough to wait prisoner until the general has read the papers on your case  the grand duchess to the soldiers let go to strammfest tell them to let go or ill upset the bench backwards and bash our three heads on the floor  first soldier no little mother have mercy on the poor  strammfest growling over the edge of the paper he is reading hold your tongue  the grand duchess blazing me or the soldier  strammfest horrified the soldier madam  the grand duchess tell him to let go  strammfest release the lady  the soldiers take their hands off her one of them wipes his fevered brow the other sucks his wrist  schneidkind fiercely ttention  the two soldiers sit up stiffly  the grand duchess oh let the poor man suck his wrist it may be poisoned i bit it  strammfest shocked you bit a common soldier  grand duchess well i offered to cauterize it with the poker in the office stove but he was afraid what more could i do  schneidekind why did you bite him prisoner  the grand duchess he would not let go  strammfest did he let go when you bit him  the grand duchess no patting the soldier on the back you should give the man a cross for his devotion i could not go on eating him so i brought him along with me  strammfest prisoner  the grand duchess dont call me prisoner general strammfest my grandmother dandled you on her knee  strammfest bursting into tears o god yes believe me my heart is what it was then  the grand duchess your brain also is what it was then i will not be addressed by you as prisoner  strammfest i may not for your own sake call you by your rightful and most sacred titles what am i to call you  the grand duchess the revolution has made us comrades call me comrade  strammfest i had rather die  the grand duchess then call me annajanska and i will call you peter piper as grandmamma did  strammfest painfully agitated schneidekind you must speak to her i cannothe breaks down  schneidekind officially the republic of beotia has been compelled to confine the panjandrum and his family for their own safety within certain bounds you have broken those bounds  strammfest taking the word from him you are i must say ita prisoner what am i to do with you  the grand duchess you should have thought of that before you arrested me  strammfest come come prisoner do you know what will happen to

splutters drops a paper and conceals his laughter under the table  strammfest thunderously lieutenant schneidekind  schneidekind in a stifled voice yes sir the table vibrates visibly  strammfest come out of it you fool youre upsetting the ink  schneidekind emerges red in the face with suppressed mirth  strammfest why dont you laugh dont you appreciate her imperial highnesss joke  schneidekind suddenly becoming solemn i dont want to sir  strammfest laugh at once sir i order you to laugh  schneidekind with a touch of temper i really cant sir he sits down decisively  strammfest growling at him yah he turns impressively to the grand duchess your imperial highness desires me to address you as comrade  the grand duchess rising and waving a red handkerchief long live the revolution comrade  strammfest rising and saluting proletarians of all lands unite lieutenant schneidekind you will rise and sing the marseillaise  schneidekind rising but i cannot sir i have no voice no ear  strammfest then sit down and bury your shame in your typewriter schneidekind sits down comrade annajanska you have eloped with a young officer  the grand duchess astounded general strammfest you lie  strammfest denial comrade is useless it is through that officer that your movements have been traced the grand duchess is suddenly enlightened and seems amused strammfest continues an a forensic manner he joined you at the golden anchor in hakonsburg you gave us the slip there but the officer was traced to potterdam where you rejoined him and went alone to premsylople what have you done with that unhappy young man where is he  the grand duchess pretending to whisper an important secret where he has always been  strammfest eagerly where is that  the grand duchess impetuously in your imagination i came alone i am alone hundreds of officers travel every day from hakonsburg to potterdam what do i know about them  strammfest they travel in khaki they do not travel in full dress court uniform as this man did  schneidekind only officers who are eloping with grand duchesses wear court uniform otherwise the grand duchesses could not be seen with them  strammfest hold your tongue schneidekind in high dudgeon folds his arms and retires from the conversation the general returns to his paper and to his examination of the grand duchess this officer travelled with your passport what have you to say to that  the grand duchess bosh how could a man travel with a womans passport  strammfest it is quite simple as you very well know a dozen travellers arrive at the boundary the official collects their passports he counts twelve persons then counts the passports if there are twelve he is satisfied  the grand duchess then how do you know that one of the passports was mine  strammfest a waiter at the potterdam hotel looked at the officers passport when he was in his bath it was your passport  the grand duchess stuff why did he not have me arrested  strammfest when the waiter returned to the hotel with the police the officer had vanished and you were there with your own passport they knouted him  the grand duchess oh strammfest send these men away i must speak to you alone  strammfest rising in horror no this is the last straw i cannot consent it is impossible utterly eternally impossible that a daughter of the imperial house should speak to any one alone were it even her own husband  the grand duchess you forget that there is an exception she may speak to a child alone she rises strammfest you have been dandled on my grandmothers knee by that gracious action the dowager panjandrina made you a child forever so did nature by the way i order you to speak to me alone do you hear i order you for seven hundred years no member of your family has ever disobeyed an order from a member of mine will you disobey me  strammfest there is an alternative to obedience the dead cannot disobey he takes out his pistol and places the muzzle against his temple  schneidekind snatching the pistol from him for gods sake general  strammfest attacking him furiously to recover the weapon dog of a subaltern restore that pistol and my honor  schneidekind reaching out with the pistol to the grand duchess take it quick he is as strong as a bull  the grand duchess snatching it aha leave the room all of you except the general at the double lightning electricity she fires shot after shot spattering the bullets about the ankles of the soldiers they fly precipitately she turns to schneidekind who has by this time been flung on the floor by the general you too he scrambles up march he flies to the door  schneidekind turning at the door for your own sake comrade  the grand duchess indignantly comrade you go she fires two more shots he vanishes  strammfest making an impulsive movement towards her my imperial mistress  the grand duchess stop i have one bullet left if you attempt to take this from me putting the pistol to her temple  strammfest recoiling and covering his eyes with his hands no no put it down put it down i promise everything i swear anything but put it down i implore you  the grand duchess throwing it on the table there  strammfest uncovering his eyes thank god  the grand duchess gently strammfest i am your comrade am i nothing more to you  strammfest falling on his knee you are god help me all that is left to me of the only power i recognize on earth he kisses her hand  the grand duchess indulgently idolater when will you learn that our strength has never been in ourselves but in your illusions about us she shakes off her kindliness and sits down in his chair now tell me what are your orders and do you mean to obey them  strammfest starting like a goaded ox and blundering fretfully about the room how can i obey six different dictators and not one gentleman among the lot of them one of them orders me to make peace with the foreign enemy another orders me to offer all the neutral countries 48 hours to choose between adopting his views on the single tax and being instantly invaded and annihilated a third orders me to go to a damned socialist conference and explain that beotia will allow no annexations and no indemnities and merely wishes to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth throughout the universe he finishes behind schneidekinds chair  the grand duchess damn their trifling  strammfest i thank your imperial highness from the bottom of my heart for that expression europe thanks you  the grand duchess myes butrising strammfest you know that your causethe cause of the dynastyis lost  strammfest you must not say so it is treason even from you he sinks discouraged into the chair and covers his face with his hand  the grand duchess do not deceive yourself general never again will a panjandrum reign in beotia she walks slowly across the room brooding bitterly and thinking aloud we are so decayed so out of date so feeble so wicked in our own despite that we have come at last to will our own destruction  strammfest you are uttering blasphemy  the grand duchess all great truths begin as blasphemies all the kings horses and all the kings men cannot set up my fathers throne again if they could you would have done it would you not  strammfest god knows i would  the grand duchess you really mean that you would keep the people in their hopeless squalid misery you would fill those infamous prisons again with the noblest spirits in the land you would thrust the rising sun of liberty back into the sea of blood from which it has risen and all because there was in the middle of the dirt and ugliness and horror a little patch of court splendor in which you could stand with a few orders on your uniform and yawn day after day and night after night in unspeakable boredom until your grave yawned wider still and you fell into it because you had nothing better to do how can you be so stupid so heartless  strammfest you must be mad to think of royalty in such a way i never yawned at court the dogs yawned but that was because they were dogs they had no imagination no ideals no sense of honor and dignity to sustain them  the grand duchess my poor strammfest you were not often enough at court to tire of it you were mostly soldiering and when you came home to have a new order pinned on your breast your happiness came through looking at my father and mother and at me and adoring us was that not so  strammfest do you reproach me with it i am not ashamed of it  the grand duchess oh it was all very well for you strammfest but think of me of me standing there for you to gape at and knowing that i was no goddess but only a girl like any other girl it was cruelty to animals you could have stuck up a wax doll or a golden calf to worship it would not have been bored  strammfest stop or i shall renounce my allegiance to you i have had women flogged for such seditious chatter as this  the grand duchess do not provoke me to send a bullet through your head for reminding me of it  strammfest you always had low tastes you are no true daughter of the panjandrums you are a changeling thrust into the panjandrinas bed by some profligate nurse i have heard stories of your childhood of how  the grand duchess ha ha yes they took me to the circus when i was a child it was my first moment of happiness my first glimpse of heaven i ran away and joined the troupe they caught me and dragged me back to my gilded cage but i had tasted freedom and they never could make me forget it  strammfest freedom to be the slave of an acrobat to be exhibited to the public to  the grand duchess oh i was trained to that i had learnt that part of the business at court  strammfest you had not been taught to strip yourself half naked and turn head over heels  the grand duchess man i wanted to get rid of my swaddling clothes and turn head over heels i wanted to i wanted to i wanted to i can do it still shall i do it now  strammfest if you do i swear i will throw myself from the window so that i may meet your parents in heaven without having my medals torn from my breast by them  the grand duchess oh you are incorrigible you are mad infatuated you will not believe that we royal divinities are mere common flesh and blood even when we step down from our pedestals and tell you ourselves what a fool you are i will argue no more with you i will use my power at a word from me your men will turn against you already half of them do not salute you and you dare not punish them you have to pretend not to notice it  strammfest it is not for you to taunt me with that if it is so  the grand duchess haughtily taunt i condescend to taunt to taunt a common general you forget yourself sir  strammfest dropping on his knee submissively now at last you speak like your royal self  the grand duchess oh strammfest strammfest they have driven your slavery into your very bones why did you not spit in my face  strammfest rising with a shudder god forbid  the grand duchess well since you will be my slave take your orders from me i have not come here to save our wretched family and our bloodstained crown i am come to save the revolution  strammfest stupid as i am i have come to think that i had better save that than save nothing but what will the revolution do for the people do not be deceived by the fine speeches of the revolutionary leaders and the pamphlets of the revolutionary writers how much liberty is there where they have gained the upper hand are they not hanging shooting imprisoning as much as ever we did do they ever tell the people the truth no if the truth does not suit them they spread lies instead and make it a crime to tell the truth  the grand duchess of course they do why should they not  strammfest hardly able to believe his ears why should they not  the grand duchess yes why should they not we did it you did it whip in hand you flogged women for teaching children to read  strammfest to read sedition to read karl marx  the grand duchess pshaw how could they learn to read the bible without learning to read karl marx why do you not stand to your guns and justify what you did instead of making silly excuses do you suppose i think flogging a woman worse than flogging a man i who am a woman myself  strammfest i am at a loss to understand your imperial highness you seem to me to contradict yourself  the grand duchess nonsense i say that if the people cannot govern themselves they must be governed by somebody if they will not do their duty without being half forced and half humbugged somebody must force them and humbug them some energetic and capable minority must always be in power well i am on the side of the energetic minority whose principles i agree with the revolution is as cruel as we were but its aims are my aims therefore i stand for the revolution  strammfest you do not know what you are saying this is pure bolshevism are you the daughter of a panjandrum a bolshevist  the grand duchess i am anything that will make the world less like a prison and more like a circus  strammfest ah you still want to be a circus star  the grand duchess yes and be billed as the bolshevik empress nothing shall stop me you have your orders general strammfest save the revolution  strammfest what revolution which revolution no two of your rabble of revolutionists mean the same thing by the revolution what can save a mob in which every man is rushing in a different direction  the grand duchess i will tell you the war can save it  strammfest the war  the grand duchess yes the war only a great common danger and a great common duty can unite us and weld these wrangling factions into a solid commonwealth  strammfest bravo war sets everything right i have always said so but what is a united people without a united army and what can i do i am only a soldier i cannot make speeches i have won no victories they will not rally to my call again he sinks into his chair with his former gesture of discouragement  the grand duchess are you sure they will not rally to mine  strammfest oh if only you were a man and a soldier  the grand duchess suppose i find you a man and a soldier  strammfest rising in a fury ah the scoundrel you eloped with you think you will shove this fellow into an army command over my head never  the grand duchess you promised everything you swore anything she marches as if in front of a regiment i know that this man alone can rouse the army to enthusiasm  strammfest delusion folly he is some circus acrobat and you are in love with him  the grand duchess i swear i am not in love with him i swear i will never marry him  strammfest then who is he  the grand duchess anybody in the world but you would have guessed long ago he is under your very eyes  strammfest staring past her right and left where  the grand duchess look out of the window  he rushes to the window looking for the officer the grand duchess takes off her cloak and appears in the uniform of the panderobajensky hussars  strammfest peering through the window where is he i can see no one  the grand duchess here silly  strammfest turning you great heavens the bolshevik empress
