man  startled  oh no  american  i take considerable stock in leo tolstoi myself  grand mangrandsouled apparatus  but i guess youve got to pinch those waiters some to make em skip  to the english who

temperament  now im all for equality  see that poor woman therevery humble womanthere she sits among us with her baby  perhaps youd like to locate her somewhere else  german  shrugging  tolstoi is sentimentalisch  nietzsche is the true philosopher the only one  american  well thats quite in the prospectusvery stimulating partyold nietchvirgin mind  but give me leo  he turns to the redcheeked youth  what do you opine sir  i guess by your labels youll be dutch  do they read tolstoi in your country       the dutch youth laughs  american  that is a very luminous answer  german  tolstoi is nothing  man should himself express  he must pushhe must be strong  american  that is so  in america we believe in virility we like a man to expand  but we believe in brotherhood too  we draw the line at niggers but we aspire  social barriers and distinctions weve not much use for  englishman  do you feel a draught  englishwoman  with a shiver of her shoulder toward the american  i dorather  german  wait  you are a young people  american  that is so there are no flies on us  to the little man who has been gazing eagerly from face to face  say  id like to have you give us your sentiments in relation to the duty of man       the little man fidgets and is about to opens his mouth  american  for exampleis it your opinion that we should kill off the weak and diseased and all that cant jump around  german  nodding ja ja  that is coming  little man  looking from face to face  they might be me       the dutch youth laughs  american  reproving him with a look  thats true humility tisnt grammar  now heres a proposition that brings it nearer the bone  would you step out of your way to help them when it was liable to bring you trouble  german  nein nein  that is stupid  little man  eager but wistful  im afraid not  of course one wants tothere was st francis dassisi and st julien lhospitalier and  american  very lofty dispositions  guess they died of them  he rises  shake hands sirmy name ishe hands a card  i am an icemachine maker  he shakes the little mans hand i like your sentimentsi feel kind of brotherly  catching sight of the waiter appearing in the doorway  waiter where to hll is that glass of beer  german  cigarren  waiter  komm gleich  englishman  consulting watch  trains late  englishwoman  really  nuisance       a station policeman very square and uniformed passes and      repasses  american  resuming his seatto the german  now we dont have so much of that in america  guess we feel more to trust in human nature  german  ah  ha  you will bresently find there is nothing in him but self  little man  wistfully  dont you believe in human nature  american  very stimulating question       he looks round for opinions  the dutch youth laughs  englishman holding out his half of the paper to his wife  swap       his wife swaps  german  in human nature i believe so far as i can see himno more  american  now that pears to me kind o blasphemy  i believe in heroism  i opine theres not one of us settin around here thats not a herogive him the occasion  little man  oh  do you believe that  american  well  i judge a hero is just a person thatll help another at the expense of himself  take that poor woman there well now shes a heroine i guess  she would die for her baby any old time  german  animals will die for their babies  that is nothing  american  i carry it further  i postulate we would all die for that baby if a locomotive was to trundle up right here and try to handle it  to the german  i guess you dont know how good you are  as the german is twisting up the ends of his moustacheto the englishwoman  i should like to have you express an opinion maam  englishwoman  i beg your pardon  american  the english are very humanitarian they have a very high sense of duty  so have the germans so have the americans  to the dutch youth  i judge even in your little country they have that this is an epoch of equality and hightoned ideals  to the little man  what is your nationality sir  little man  im afraid im nothing particular  my father was halfenglish and halfamerican and my mother halfgerman and halfdutch  american  my  thats a bit streaky any old way  the policeman passes again  now i dont believe weve much use any more for those gentlemen in buttons  weve grown kind of mildwe dont think of self as we used to do       the waiter has appeared in the doorway  german  in a voice of thunder cigarren  donnerwetter  american  shaking his fist at the vanishing waiter  that flash of beer  waiter  komm gleich  american  a little more and he will join george washington  i was about to remark when he intruded in this year of grace 1913 the kingdom of christ is quite a going concern  we are mighty near universal brotherhood  the colonel here he indicates the german is a man of blood and iron but give him an opportunity to be magnanimous and hell be right there  oh sir  yep       the german with a profound mixture of pleasure and cynicism      brushes up the ends of his moustache  little man  i wonder  one wants to but somehowhe shakes his head  american you seem kind of skeery about that  youve had experience maybe  im an optimisti think were bound to make the devil hum in the near future  i opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to that old party  theres about to be a holocaust of selfish interests  the colonel there with oldman nietch he wont know himself  theres going to be a very sacred opportunity       as he speaks the voice of a railway official is heard an the      distance calling out in german  it approaches and the words      become audible  german  startled der teufel  he gets up and seizes the bag beside him       the station official has appeared he stands for a moment      casting his commands at the seated group  the dutch youth also      rises and takes his coat and hat  the official turns on his      heel and retires still issuing directions  englishman  what does he say  german  our drain has come in de oder platform only one minute we haf       all have risen in a fluster  american  now thats very provoking  i wont get that flash of beer       there is a general scurry to gather coats and hats and wraps      during which the lowly woman is seen making desperate attempts      to deal with her baby and the two large bundles  quite      defeated she suddenly puts all down wrings her hands and      cries out herr jesu  hilfe  the flying procession turn      their heads at that strange cry  american  whats that  help       he continues to run  the little man spins round rushes back      picks up baby and bundle on which it was seated  little man  come along good woman come along       the woman picks up the other bundle and they run       the waiter appearing in the doorway with the bottle of beer      watches with his tired smile                                 curtain     scene ii       a secondclass compartment of a corridor carriage in motion      in it are seated the englishman and his wife opposite each      other at the corridor end she with her face to the engine he      with his back  both are somewhat protected from the rest of the      travellers by newspapers  next to her sits the german and      opposite him sits the american next the american in one window      corner is seated the dutch youth the other window corner is      taken by the germans bag  the silence is only broken by the      slight rushing noise of the trains progression and the      crackling of the english newspapers  american  turning to the dutch youth  guess id like that window raised its kind of chilly after that old run they gave us       the dutch youth laughs and goes through the motions of raising      the window  the english regard the operation with uneasy      irritation  the german opens his bag which reposes on the      corner seat next him and takes out a book  american  the germans are great readers  very stimulating practice i read most anything myself       the german holds up the book so that the title may be read  don quixotefine book  we americans take considerable stock in old man quixote  bit of a wildcatbut we dont laugh at him  german  he is dead  dead as a sheep  a good thing too  american  in america we have still quite an amount of chivalry  german  chivalry is nothing sentimentalisch  in modern daysno good  a man must push he must pull  american  so you say  but i judge your form of chivalry is sacrifice to the state  we allow more freedom to the individual soul  where theres something little and weak we feel it kind of noble to give up to it  that way we feel elevated       as he speaks there is seen in the corridor doorway the little      man with the womans baby still on his arm and the bundle held      in the other hand  he peers in anxiously  the english acutely      conscious try to dissociate themselves from his presence with      their papers  the dutch youth laughs  german  ach  so  american  dear me  little man  is there room  i cant find a seat  american  why yes  theres a seat for one  little man  depositing bundle outside and heaving baby  may i  american  come right in       the german sulkily moves his bag  the little man comes in and      seats himself gingerly  american  wheres the mother  little man  ruefully  afraid she got left behind       the dutch youth laughs  the english unconsciously emerge from      their newspapers  american  my  that would appear to be quite a domestic incident       the englishman suddenly utters a profound ha ha and      disappears behind his paper  and that paper and the one      opposite are seen to shake and little sguirls and squeaks      emerge  german  and you haf got her bundle and her baby  ha  he cackles drily  american  gravely  i smile  i guess providence has played it pretty low down on you  its sure acted real mean       the baby wails and the little man jigs it with a sort of      gentle desperation looking apologetically from face to face      his wistful glance renews the fore of merriment wherever it      alights  the american alone preserves a gravity which seems      incapable of being broken  american  maybe youd better get off right smart and restore that baby  theres nothing can act madder than a mother  little man  poor thing yes  what she must be suffering       a gale of laughter shakes the carriage  the english for a      moment drop their papers the better to indulge  the little man      smiles a wintry smile  american  in a lull  how did it eventuate  little man  we got there just as the train was going to start and i jumped thinking i could help her up  but it moved too quickly andand left her       the gale of laughter blows up again  american  guess id have thrown the baby out to her  little man  i was afraid the poor little thing might break       the baby wails the little man heaves it the gale of laughter      blows  american  gravely  its highly entertainingnot for the baby what kind of an old baby is it anyway  he sniffs  i judge its a bitniffy  little man  afraid ive hardly looked at it yet  american  which end up is it  little mam  oh  i think the right end  yes yes it is  american  well thats something  maybe you should hold it out of window a bit  very excitable things babies  englishwoman  galvanized  no no  englishman  touching her knee  my dear  american  you are right maam  i opine theres a draught out there  this baby is precious  weve all of us got stock in this baby in a manner of speaking  this is a little bit of universal brotherhood  is it a woman baby  little man  ii can only see the top of its head  american  you cant always tell from that  it looks kind of overwrapped up  maybe it had better be unbound  german  nein nein nein  american  i think you are very likely right colonel  it might be a pity to unbind that baby  i guess the lady should be consulted in this matter  englishwoman  yes yes of course  englishman  touching her  let it be  little beggar seems all right  american  that would seem only known to providence at this moment i judge it might be due to humanity to look at its face  little man  gladly  its sucking my finger  there therenice little thingthere  american  i would surmise in your leisure moments you have created babies sir  little man  oh noindeed no  american  dear methat is a loss  addressing himself to the carriage at large  i think we may esteem ourselves fortunate to have this little stranger right here with us  demonstrates what a hold the little and weak have upon us nowadays  the colonel herea man of blood and ironthere he sits quite calm next door to it  he sniffs  now this baby is rather chasteningthat is a sign of grace in the colonelthat is true heroism  little man  faintly  ii can see its face a little now       all bend forward  american  what sort of a physiognomy has it anyway  little man  still faintly  i dont see anything butbut spots  german  oh  ha  pfui       the dutch youth laughs  american  i am told that is not uncommon amongst babies  perhaps we could have you inform us maam  englishwoman  yes of courseonly what sort of  little man  they seem all over itsat the slight recoil of everyone i feel sure itsits quite a good baby underneath  american  that will be rather difficult to come at  im just a bit sensitive  ive very little use for affections of the epidermis  german  pfui  he has edged away as far as he can get and is lighting a big cigar       the dutch youth draws his legs back  american  also taking out a cigar  i guess it would be well to fumigate this carriage  does it suffer do you think  little man  peering  really i dontim not surei know so little about babies  i think it would have a nice expressionifif it showed  american  is it kind of boiled looking  little man  yesyes it is  american  looking gravely round  i judge this baby has the measles       the german screws himself spasmodically against the arm of the      englishwomans seat  englishwoman  poor little thing  shall i       she half rises  englishman  touching her  no nodash it  american  i honour your emotion maam  it does credit to us all but i sympathize with your husband too  the measles is a very important pestilence in connection with a grown woman  little man  it likes my finger awfully  really its rather a sweet baby  american  sniffing  well that would appear to be quite a question  about them spots now  are they rosy  little man  noo theyre dark almost black  german  gott  typhus  he bounds up on to the arm of the englishwomans seat  american  typhus  thats quite an indisposition       the dutch youth rises suddenly and bolts out into the      corridor  he is followed by the german puffing clouds of      smoke  the english and american sit a moment longer without      speaking  the englishwomans face is turned with a curious      expressionhalf pity half feartowards the little man  then      the englishman gets up  englishman  bit stuffy for you here dear isnt it       he puts his arm through hers raises her and almost pushes her      through the doorway  she goes still looking back  american  gravely  theres nothing i admire moren courage  guess ill go and smoke in the corridor       as he goes out the little man looks very wistfully after him      screwing up his mouth and nose he holds the baby away from him      and wavers then rising he puts it on the seat opposite and      goes through the motions of letting down the window  having      done so he looks at the baby who has begun to wail  suddenly      he raises his hands and clasps them like a child praying      since however the baby does not stop wailing he hovers over      it in indecision then picking it up sits down again to dandle      it with his face turned toward the open window  finding that      it still wails he begins to sing to it in a cracked little      voice  it is charmed at once  while he is singing the      american appears in the corridor  letting down the passage      window he stands there in the doorway with the draught blowing      his hair and the smoke of his cigar all about him  the little      man stops singing and shifts the shawl higher to protect the      babys head from the draught  american  gravely  this is the most sublime spectacle i have ever envisaged  there ought to be a record of this       the little man looks at him wondering  you are typical sir      of the sentiments of modern christianity  you illustrate the      deepest feelings in the heart of every man       the little man rises with the baby and a movement of approach  guess im wanted in the diningcar       he vanishes  the little man sits down again but back to the      engine away from the draught and looks out of the window      patiently jogging the baby on his knee                                 curtain     scene iii       an arrival platform  the little man with the baby and the      bundle is standing disconsolate while travellers pass and      luggage is being carried by  a station official accompanied by      a policeman appears from a doorway behind him  official  consulting telegram in his hand das ist der herr       they advance to the little man  official  sie haben einen buben gestohlen  little man  i only speak english and american  official

american  speaking from as far away as may be  just a moment       the official stops the little man also stops and sits down on      a bench against the wall  the policeman stands stolidly beside      him  the american approaches a step or two beckoning the      official goes up to him  american  guess youve got an angel from heaven there  whats the gentleman in buttons for  official  was ist das  american  is there anybody here that can understand american  official  verstehe nicht  american  well just watch my gestures  i was saying he points to the little man then makes gestures of flying

providence has acted pretty mean loading off that baby on him  he makes the motion of dandling  the little man has a heart of gold  he points to his heart and takes out a gold coin  official  thinking he is about to be bribed aber das ist zu viel  american  now dont rattle me  pointing to the little man  man pointing to his heart herz pointing to the coin von gold this is a flower of the fieldhe dont want no gentleman in buttons to pluck him up       a little crowd is gathering including the two english the      german and the dutch youth  official  verstehe absolut nichts  he taps the telegram ich muss mein duty do  american  but im telling you  this is a white man  this is probably the whitest man on gawds earth  official  das macht nichtsgut or no gut i muss mein duty do he turns

american  i kind o thought youd feel like that  official  die sanitatsmachine  gleich       a porter goes to get it  from either side the broken halfmoon      of persons stand gazing at the little man who sits unhappily      dandling the baby in the centre  official  raising his hands was zu thun  american  guess youd better isolate the baby       a silence during which the little man is heard faintly      whistling and clucking to the baby  official  referring once more to his telegram  rest gentleman mit black baby shaking his head  wir must de gentleman hold  to the german bitte mein herr sagen sie ihm den buben zu niedersetzen  he makes the gesture of deposit  german  to the little man  he say put down the baby       the little man shakes his head and continues to dandle the      baby  official  you must       the little man glowers in silence  englishman  in backgroundmuttering  good man  german  his spirit ever denies  official  again making his gesture aber er muss

man use the baby to save himself from arrest very smart he say  american  i judge you do him an injustice  showing off the little man with a sweep of his arm  this is a white man  hes got a black baby and he won leave it in the lurch  guess we would all act noble that way give us the chance       the little man rises holding out the baby and advances a step      or two  the halfmoon at once gives increasing its size the      american climbs on to a higher trunk  the little man retires      and again sits down  american  addressing the official  guess youd better go out of business and wait for the mother  official  stamping his foot  die mutter sall rested be for taking out baby mit typhus  ha  to the little man  put ze baby down       the little man smiles  do you ear  american  addressing

what was that  i dont want to miss any  german  he say why did you a baby with typhus with you bring out  american  well thats quite a question       he takes out the fieldglasses slung around him and adjusts      them on the baby  mother  bewildered mei bubityphusaber typhus  she shakes her head violently  nein nein nein  typhus  official  er hat typhus  mother  shaking her head  nein nein nein

exchanging the warmth of the little man for the      momentary chill of its mother wails  official  descending and beckoning to the policeman sie wollen den herrn accusiren       the policeman takes the little mans arm  american  whats that  they goin to pitch him after all       the mother still hugging her baby who has stopped crying      gazes at the little man who sits dazedly looking up  suddenly      she drops on her knees and with her free hand lifts his booted      foot and kisses it  american  waving his hat  ra  ra  he descends swiftly goes up to the little man whose arm the policeman has dropped and takes his hand  brother i am proud to know you  this is one of the greatest moments i have ever experienced  displaying the little man to the assembled company  i think i sense the situation when i say that we all esteem it an honour to breathe the rather inferior atmosphere of this station here along with our little friend  i guess we shall all go home and treasure the memory of his face as the whitest thing in our museum of recollections  and perhaps this good woman will also go home and wash the face of our little brother here  i am inspired with a new faith in mankind  ladies and gentlemen i wish to present to you a sureenough saintonly wants a halo to be transfigured to the little man  stand right up       the little man stands up bewildered  they come about him  the      official bows to him the policeman salutes him  the dutch      youth shakes his head and laughs  the german draws himself up      very straight and bows quickly twice  the englishman and his      wife approach at least two steps then thinking better of it      turn to each other and recede  the mother kisses his hand  the      porter returning with the sanitatsmachine turns it on from      behind and its pinkish shower goldened by a ray of sunlight      falls around the little mans head transfiguring it as he      stands with eyes upraised to see whence the portent comes  american  rushing forward and dropping on his knees  hold on just a minute  guess ill take a snapshot of the miracle  he adjusts his pocket camera  this ought to look bully   curtain
