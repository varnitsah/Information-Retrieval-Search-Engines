18567852	odd craft  by ww jacobs    odd charges  seated at his ease in the warm taproom of the cauliflower the stranger had been eating and drinking for some time apparently unconscious of the presence of the withered ancient who huddled up in that corner of the settle which was nearer to the fire fidgeted restlessly with an empty mug and blew with pathetic insistence through a churchwarden pipe which had long been cold  the stranger finished his meal with a sigh of content and then rising from his chair crossed over to the settle and placing his mug on the timeworn table before him began to fill his pipe  illustration seated at his ease in the warm taproom of the cauliflower  the old man took a spill from the table and holding it with trembling fingers to the blaze gave him a light  the other thanked him and then leaning back in his corner of the settle watched the smoke of his pipe through halfclosed eyes and assented drowsily to the old mans remarks upon the weather  bad time o the year for going about said the latter though i spose if you can eat and drink as much as you want it dont matter  i spose you mightnt be a conjurer from london sir  the traveller shook his head  i was oping you might be said the old man  the other manifested no curiosity  if you ad been said the old man with a sigh i should ha asked you to ha done something useful  ginrally speaking conjurers do things that are no use to anyone wot i should like to see a conjurer do would be to make this ere empty mug full o beer and this empty pipe full o shag tobacco  thats wot i should ha made bold to ask you to do if youd been one  the traveller sighed and taking his short briar pipe from his mouth by the bowl rapped three times upon the table with it  in a very short time a mug of ale and a paper cylinder of shag appeared on the table before the old man  wot put me in mind o your being a conjurer said the latter filling his pipe after a satisfying draught from the mug is that youre uncommon like one that come to claybury some time back and give a performance in this very room where were now asitting  so far as looks go you might be his brother  the traveller said that he never had a brother  we didnt know e was a conjurer at fust said the old man  he ad come down for wickham fair and being a day or two before and e was going to different villages round about to give performances  he came into the bar ere and ordered a mug o beer and while e was adrinking of it stood talking about the weather  then e asked bill chambers to excuse im for taking the liberty and putting his and to bills mug took out a live frog  bill was a very partikler man about wot e drunk and i thought hed ha had a fit  he went on at smith the landlord something shocking and at last for the sake o peace and quietness smith gave im another pint to make up for it  illustration putting his and to bills mug he took out a live frog  it must ha been asleep in the mug he ses  bill said that e thought e knew who must ha been asleep and was just going to take a drink when the conjurer asked im to excuse im agin bill put down the mug in a urry and the conjurer put his and to the mug and took out a dead mouse  it would ha been a ard thing to say which was the most upset bill chambers or smith the landlord and bill who was in a terrible state asked why it was everything seemed to get into his mug  praps youre fond o dumb animals sir ses the conjurer  do you appen to notice your coatpocket is all of a wriggle  he put his and to bills pocket and took out a little green snake then he put his and to bills trouserpocket and took out a frog while pore bills eyes looked as if they was corning out o their sockets  keep still ses the conjurer theres a lot more to come yet  bill chambers gave a owl that was dreadful to listen to and then e pushed the conjurer away and started undressing imself as fast as he could move is fingers  i believe hed ha taken off is shirt if it ad ad pockets in it and then e stuck is feet close together and e kept jumping into the air and coming down on to is own clothes in his hobnailed boots  he aint fond o dumb animals then ses the conjurer  then he put his and on his art and bowed  gentlemen all he ses  aving given you this specimen of wot i can do i beg to give notice that with the landlords kind permission i shall give my celebrated conjuring entertainment in the taproom this evening at seven oclock admission threepence each  they didnt understand im at fust but at last they see wot e meant and arter explaining to bill who was still giving little jumps they led im up into a corner and coaxed im into dressing imself agin  he wanted to fight the conjurer but e was that tired e could scarcely stand and byandby smith who ad said e wouldnt ave anything to do with it gave way and said hed risk it  the taproom was crowded that night but we all ad to pay threepence eachcoining money i call it  some o the things wot he done was very clever but amost from the fust startoff there was unpleasantness when he asked somebody to lend im a pocketandkercher to turn into a white rabbit henery walker rushed up and lent im is but instead of a white rabbit it turned into a black one with two white spots on it and arter henery walker ad sat for some time puzzling over it e got up and went off ome without saying goodnight to a soul  then the conjurer borrowed sam joness hat and arter looking into it for some time e was that surprised and astonished that sam jones lost is temper and asked im whether he adnt seen a hat afore  not like this ses the conjurer  and e pulled out a womans dress and jacket and a pair o boots  then e took out a pound or two o taters and some crusts o bread and other things and at last e gave it back to sam jones and shook is head at im and told im if he wasnt very careful hed spoil the shape of it  then e asked somebody to lend im a watch and arter he ad promised to take the greatest care of it dicky weed the tailor lent im a gold watch wot ad been left im by is greataunt when she died  dicky weed thought a great deal o that watch and when the conjurer took a flatiron and began to smash it up into little bits it took three men to hold im down in is seat  this is the most difficult trick o the lot ses the conjurer picking off a wheel wot ad stuck to the flatiron  sometimes i can do it and sometimes i cant  last time i tried it it was a failure and it cost me eighteenpence and a pint o beer afore the gentleman the watch ad belonged to was satisfied  i gave im the bits too  if you dont give me my watch back safe and sound ses dicky weed in a trembling voice itll cost you twenty pounds  ow much ses the conjurer with a start  well i wish youd told me that afore you lent it to me  eighteenpence is my price  he stirred the broken bits up with is finger and shook his ead  ive never tried one o these oldfashioned watches afore he ses owever if i fail gentlemen itll be the fust and only trick ive failed in tonight  you cant expect everything to turn out right but if i do fail this time gentlemen ill try it agin if anybody elsell lend me another watch  dicky weed tried to speak but couldnt and e sat there with is face pale staring at the pieces of is watch on the conjurers table  then the conjurer took a big pistol with a trumpetshaped barrel out of is box and arter putting in a charge o powder picked up the pieces o watch and rammed them in arter it  we could hear the broken bits grating agin the ramrod and arter he ad loaded it e walked round and handed it to us to look at  its all right he ses to dicky weed its going to be a success i could tell in the loading  he walked back to the other end of the room and held up the pistol  i shall now fire this pistol e ses and in so doing mend the watch the explosion of the powder makes the bits o glass join together agin in flying through the air the wheels go round and round collecting all the other parts and the watch as good as new and ticking away its ardest will be found in the coatpocket o the gentleman i shoot at  he pointed the pistol fust at one and then at another as if e couldnt make up is mind and none of em seemed to ave much liking for it peter gubbins told im not to shoot at im because he ad a ole in his pocket and bill chambers when it pointed at im up and told im to let somebody else ave a turn  the only one that didnt flinch was bob pretty the biggest poacher and the greatest rascal in claybury  hed been making fun o the tricks all along saying out loud that hed seen em all aforeand done better  go on he ses i aint afraid of you you cant shoot straight  the conjurer pointed the pistol at im  then e pulled the trigger and the pistol went off bang and the same moment o time bob pretty jumped up with a orrible scream and holding his ands over is eyes danced about as though hed gone mad  everybody started up at once and got round im and asked im wot was the matter but bob didnt answer em  he kept on making a dreadful noise and at last e broke out of the room and holding is andkercher to is face ran off ome as ard as he could run  youve done it now mate ses bill chambers to the conjurer  i thought you wouldnt be satisfied till youd done some arm  youve been and blinded pore bob pretty  nonsense ses the conjurer  hes frightened thats all  frightened  ses peter gubbins  why you fired dicky weeds watch straight into is face  rubbish ses the conjurer it dropped into is pocket and hell find it there when e comes to is senses  do you mean to tell me that bob pretty as gone off with my watch in is pocket  screams dicky weed  i do ses the other  youd better get old of bob afore e finds it out dicky ses bill chambers  dicky weed didnt answer im he was already running along to bob prettys as fast as is legs would take im with most of us follering behind to see wot appened  illustration he was running along to bob prettys as fast as is legs would take im  the door was fastened when we got to it but dicky weed banged away at it as ard as he could bang and at last the bedroom winder went up and mrs pretty stuck her ead out  hsh she ses in a whisper  go away  i want to see bob ses dicky weed  you cant see im ses mrs pretty  im getting im to bed  hes been shot pore dear  cant you ear im groaning  we adnt up to then but amost direckly arter

it ud be a good opportunity for me to mend it for im  i wont charge im nothing  if you drop it down ill do it now  thankee ses mrs pretty if you just wait a moment ill clear the pockets out and drop it down to you  she turned back into the bedroom and dicky weed ground is teeth together and told bill chambers that the next time he took is advice hed remember it  he stood there trembling all over with temper and when mrs pretty came to the winder agin and dropped the coat on his ead and said that bob felt his kindness very much and he oped dicky ud make a good job of it because it was is favrite coat he couldnt speak he stood there shaking all over till mrs pretty ad shut the winder down agin and then e turned to the conjurer as ad come up with the rest of us and asked im wot he was going to do about it now  i tell you hes got the watch ses the conjurer pointing up at the winder  it went into is pocket  i saw it go  he was no more shot than you were  if e was why doesnt he send

monday but ill come back ere to the cauliflower the saturday before and give another entertainment and then well see wots to be done  i cant run away because in any case i cant afford to miss the fair  dicky weed gave way at last and went off ome to bed and told is wife about it and listening to er advice he got up at six oclock in the morning and went round to see ow bob pretty was  mrs pretty was up when e got there and arter calling up the stairs to bob told dicky weed to go upstairs  bob pretty was sitting up in bed with is face covered in bandages and he seemed quite pleased to see im  it aint everybody that ud get up at six oclock to see ow im getting on he ses  youve got a feeling art dicky  dicky weed coughed and looked round wondering whether the watch was in the room and if so where it was hidden  now im ere i may as well tidy up the room for you a bit he ses getting up  i dont like sitting idle  thankee mate ses bob and e lay still and watched dicky weed out of the corner of the eye that wasnt covered with the bandages  i dont suppose that room ad ever been tidied up so thoroughly since the prettys ad lived there but dicky weed couldnt see anything o the watch and wot made im more angry than anything else was mrs pretty setting down in a chair with er ands folded in her lap and pointing out places that he adnt done  you leave im alone ses bob  he knows wot es arter  wot did you do with those little bits o watch you found when you was bandaging me up missis  dont ask me ses mrs pretty  i was in such a state i dont know wot i was doing ardly  well they must be about somewhere ses bob  you ave a look for em dicky and if you find em keep em  they belong to you  dicky weed tried to be civil and thank im and then he went off ome and talked it over with is wife agin  people couldnt make up their minds whether bob pretty ad found the watch in is pocket and was shamming or whether e was really shot but they was all quite certain that whichever way it was dicky weed would never see is watch agin  on the saturday evening this ere cauliflower publicouse was crowded everybody being anxious to see the watch trick done over agin  we had eard that it ad been done all right at cudford and monksham but bob pretty said as ow hed believe it when e saw it and not afore  he was one o the fust to turn up that night because e said e wanted to know wot the conjurer was going to pay him for all is pain and suffering and having things said about is character  he came in leaning on a stick with is face still bandaged and sat right up close to the conjurers table and watched him as ard as he could as e went through is tricks  and now ses the conjurer at last i come to my celebrated watch trick  some of you as wos ere last tuesday when i did it will remember that the man i fired the pistol at pretended that ed been shot and run off ome with it in is pocket  youre a liar  ses bob pretty standing up  very good ses the conjurer you take that bandage off and show us all where youre hurt  i shall do nothing o the kind ses bob  i dont take my orders from you  take the bandage off ses the conjurer and if theres any shot marks ill give you a couple o sovereigns  im afraid of the air getting to it ses bob pretty  you dont want to be afraid o that bob ses john biggs the blacksmith coming up behind and putting is great arms round im  take off that rag somebody ive got hold of im  bob pretty started to struggle at fust but then seeing it was no good kept quite quiet while they took off the bandages  there  look at im ses the conjurer pointing  not a mark on is face not one  wet ses bob pretty  do you mean to say theres no marks  i do ses the conjurer  thank goodness ses bob pretty clasping his ands  thank goodness i was afraid i was disfigured for life  lend me a bit o lookingglass somebody  i can ardly believe it  you stole dicky weeds watch ses john biggs  i ad my suspicions of you all along  youre a thief bob pretty  thats wot you are  prove it ses bob pretty  you eard wot the conjurer said the other night that the last time he tried e failed and ad to give eighteenpence to the man wot the watch ad belonged to  that was by way of a joke like ses the conjurer to john biggs  i can always do it  im going to do it now  will somebody ave the kindness to lend me a watch  he looked all round the room but nobody offeredexcept other mens watches wot wouldnt lend em  come come he ses aint none of you got any trust in me  itll be as safe as if it was in your pocket  i want to prove to you that this man is a thief  he asked em agin and at last john biggs took out is silver watch and offered it to im on the understanding that e was on no account to fire it into bob prettys pocket  not likely ses the conjurer  now everybody take a good look at this watch so as to make sure theres no deceiving  he anded it round and arter everybody ad taken a look at it e took it up to the table and laid it down  let me ave a look at it ses bob pretty going up to the table  im not going to ave my good name took away for nothing if i can elp it  he took it up and looked at it and arter olding it to is ear put it down agin  is that the flatiron its going to be smashed with  he ses  it is ses the conjurer looking at im nasty like praps youd like to examine it  bob pretty took it and looked at it yes mates he ses its a ordinary flatiron  you couldnt ave anything better for smashing a watch with  he eld it up in the air and afore anybody could move brought it down bang on the face o the watch  the conjurer sprang at im and caught at is arm but it was too late and in a terrible state o mind e turned round to john biggs  illustration afore anybody could move he brought it down bang on the face o the watch  hes smashed your watch he ses hes smashed your watch  well ses john biggs it ad got to be smashed adnt it  yes but not by im ses the conjurer dancing about  i wash my ands of it now  look ere ses john biggs dont you talk to me about washing your ands of it  you finish your trick and give me my watch back agin same as it was afore  not now hes been interfering with it ses the conjurer  hed better do the trick now as hes so clever  id sooner ave you do it ses john biggs  wot did you let im interfere for  ow was i to know wot e was going to do  ses the conjurer  you must settle it between you now  ill ave nothing more to do with it  all right john biggs ses bob pretty if e wont do it i will  if it can be done i dont spose it matters who does it  i dont think anybody could smash up a watch better than that  john biggs looked at it and then e asked the conjurer once more to do the trick but e wouldnt  it cant be done now he ses and i warn you that if that pistol is fired i wont be responsible for whatll appen  george kettle shall load the pistol and fire it if e wont ses bob pretty  aving been in the militia there couldnt be a better man for the job  george kettle walked up to the table as red as fire at being praised like that afore people and started loading the pistol  he seemed to be more awkward about it than the conjurer ad been the last time and he ad to roll the watchcases up with the flatiron afore e could get em in but e loaded it at last and stood waiting  dont shoot at me george kettle ses bob  ive been called a thief once and i dont want to be agin  put that pistol down you fool afore you do mischief ses the conjurer  who shall i shoot at  ses george kettle raising the pistol  better fire at the conjurer i think ses bob pretty and if things appen as he says they will appen the watch ought to be found in is coatpocket  where is he  ses george looking round  bill chambers laid old of im just as he was going through the door to fetch the landlord and the scream e gave as he came back and george kettle pointed the pistol at im was awful  illustration the scream e gave as george kettle pointed the pistol at im was awful  its no worse for you than it was for me ses bob  put it down screams the conjurer put it down  youll kill arf the men in the room if it goes off  be careful where you aim george ses sam jones  praps hed better ave a chair all by hisself in the middle of the room  it was all very well for sam jones to talk but the conjurer wouldnt sit on a chair by imself  he wouldnt sit on it at all  he seemed to be all legs and arms and the way e struggled it took four or five men to old im  why dont you keep still  ses john biggs  george kettlell shoot it in your pocket all right  hes the best shot in claybury  help  murder says the conjurer struggling  hell kill me  nobody can do the trick but me  but you say you wont do it ses john biggs  not now ses the conjurer i cant  well im not going to ave my watch lost through want of trying ses john biggs  tie im to the chair mates  all right then ses the conjurer very pale  dont tie me ill sit still all right if you like but youd better bring the chair outside in case of accidents  bring it in the front  george kettle said it was all nonsense but the conjurer said the trick was always better done in the open air and at last they gave way and took im and the chair outside  now ses the conjurer as e sat down all of you go and stand near the man woes going to shoot  when i say three fire  why  theres the watch on the ground there  he pointed with is finger and as they all looked down he jumped up out o that chair and set off on the road to wickham as ard as e could run it was so sudden that nobody knew wot ad appened for a moment and then george kettle wot ad been looking with the rest turned round and pulled the trigger  there was a bang that pretty nigh deafened us and the back o the chair was blown nearly out  by the time wed got our senses agin the conjurer was amost out o sight and bob pretty was explaining to john biggs wot a good job it was is watch adnt been a gold one  thats wot comes o trusting a foreigner afore a man wot youve known all your life he ses shaking his ead  i ope the next man wot tries to take my good name away wont get off so easy  i felt all along the trick couldnt be done it stands to reason it couldnt  i done my best too
