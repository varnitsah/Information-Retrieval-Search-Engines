in cairo in the house and garden of the british consular agent     cÆsars wife     act i        scene the morningroom in the consular agents house at cairo      the windows are arabic in character and so are the architraves of      the doors but otherwise it is an english room airy and spacious      the furniture is lacquer and chippendale there are cool chintzes      on the chairs and sofas cut roses in glass vases and growing      azaleas in pots but here and there an eastern antiquity a helmet      and a coat of mail a piece of woodwork reminds one of the      mussulman conquest of egypt while an ancient god in porphyry      graven images in blue pottery blue bowls recall an older      civilisation still       when the curtain rises the room is empty the blinds are down so      as to keep out the heat and it is dim and mysterious a servant      comes in a darkskinned native in the gorgeous uniform red and      gold of the consular agents establishment and draws the blinds      through the windows is seen the garden with palmtrees oranges and      lemons tropical plants with giant leaves and beyond the radiant      blue of the sky in the distance is heard the plaintive guttural      wailing of an arab song a gardener in a pale blue gaberdine      passes with a basket on his arm  servant  essalâm alêkum peace be with you  gardener  ualêkum essalâm warahmet allâh wa barakâta and with you be peace and gods mercy and blessing       the servant goes out the gardener stops for a moment to nail      back a straggling creeper and then goes on his way the door is      opened mrs appleby comes in with anne etheridge and they are      followed immediately by violet anne is a woman of forty but      handsome still very pleasant and sympathetic she is a woman of      the world tactful and selfcontrolled she is dressed in light      summery things mrs appleby is an elderly homely woman soberly      but not inexpensively dressed the wife of a northcountry      manufacturer she spends a good deal of money on rather dowdy      clothes violet is a very pretty young woman of twenty she looks      very fresh and english in her muslin frock there is something      springlike and virginal in her appearance and her manner of dress      is romantic rather than modish she suggests a lady in a      gainsborough portrait rather than a drawing in a paper of paris      fashions luncheon is just finished and when they come in the women      leave the door open for the men to follow  mrs appleby  how cool it is in here this isnt the room we were in before lunch  anne  no they keep the windows closed and the blinds drawn all the morning so that its beautifully cool when one comes in  mrs appleby  i suppose we shant feel the heat so much when weve been here a few days  anne  oh but this is nothing to what youll get in upper egypt  violet  as she enters is mrs appleby complaining of the heat i love it  anne  dear violet wait till may comes and june you dont know how exhausting it gets  violet  im looking forward to it i think in some past life i must have been a lizard  mrs appleby  i dare say the first year you wont feel it i have a brother settled in canada and he says the first year people come out from england they dont feel the cold anything like what they do later on  anne  ive spent a good many winters here and i always make a point of getting away by the fifteenth of march  mrs appleby  oh are you staying as late as that  anne  good gracious no you make lady littles heart positively sink  violet  nonsense anne you know we want you to stay as long as ever you can  anne  i used to have an apartment in cairo but ive given it up now and lady little asked me to come and stay at the agency while i was getting everything settled  mrs appleby  oh then you knew sir arthur before he married  anne  oh yes hes one of my oldest friends i cant help thinking lady little must have great sweetness of character to put up with me  violet  or you must be a perfect miracle of tact darling  mrs appleby  my belief is its a little of both  anne  when arthur came to see me one day last july and told me he was going to marry the most wonderful girl in the world of course i thought goodbye a man thinks he can keep his bachelor friendships but he never does  mrs appleby  his wife generally sees to that  violet  well i think its nonsense especially with a man like arthur whod been a bachelor so long and naturally had his life laid out before ever i came into it and besides im devoted to anne  anne  its dear of you to say so  violet  i came here as an absolute stranger and after all i wasnt very old was i  mrs appleby  nineteen  violet  oh no i was older than that i was nearly twenty  mrs appleby  smiling good gracious  violet  it was rather alarming to find oneself on a sudden the wife of a man in arthurs position i was dreadfully selfconscious i felt that everybodys eyes were upon me and you dont know how easy it is to make mistakes in a country thats half eastern and half european  anne  to say nothing of having to deal with the representatives of half a dozen great powers all outrageously susceptible  violet  and you know there was the feeling that the smallest false step might do the greatest harm to arthur and his work here i had only just left the schoolroom and i found myself almost a political personage if it hadnt been for anne i should have made a dreadful mess of things  anne  oh i dont think that you had two assets which would have made people excuse a great deal of inexperience your grace and your beauty  violet  you say very nice things to me anne  mrs appleby  your marriage was so romantic i cant see how anyone could help feeling very kindly towards you  violet  theres not much room for romance in the heart of the wife of one of the agents of the foreign powers when she thinks she hasnt been given her proper place at a dinner party  mrs appleby  i remember wondering at the time whether you werent a little overcome by all the excitement caused by your marriage  violet  i was excited too you know  mrs appleby  everyone had always looked upon sir arthur as a confirmed bachelor it was thought he cared for nothing but his work hes had a wonderful career hasnt he  violet  the prime minister told me he was the most competent man hed ever met  anne  ive always thought he must be a comfort to any government whenever anyone has made a hash of things hes been sent to put them straight  violet  well he always has  mrs appleby  mr appleby was saying only this morning he was the last man one would expect to marry in haste  violet  lets hope he wont repent at leisure  anne  smiling mrs appleby is dying to know all about it violet  mrs appleby  im an old woman lady little  violet  gaily well i met arthur at a weekend party hed come home on leave and all sorts of important people had been asked to meet him i was frightened out of my life the duchesses had strawberry leaves hanging all over them and they looked at me down their noses and the cabinet ministers wives had protruding teeth and they looked at me up their noses  anne  what nonsense you talk violet  violet  i was expecting to be terrified of arthur after all i knew he was a great man but you know i wasnt a bit he was inclined to be rather fatherly at first so i cheeked him  anne  i can imagine his surprise no one had done that for twenty years  violet  when you know arthur at all well you discover that when he wants anything he doesnt hesitate to ask for it he told our hostess that he wanted me to sit next to him at dinner that didnt suit her at all but she didnt like to say no somehow people dont say no to arthur the cabinet ministers wives looked more like camels than ever and by sunday evening my dear the duchesses strawberry leaves began to curl and crackle  anne  your poor hostess i feel for her to have got hold of a real lion for your party and then have him refuse to bother himself with anybody but a chit of a girl whom youd asked just to make an even number  mrs appleby  he just fell in love with you at first sight  violet  thats what he says now  mrs appleby  did you know  violet  i thought it looked very like it you know only it was so improbable then came an invitation from a woman i only just knew for the next weekend and she said arthur would be there then my heart really did begin to go pitapat i took the letter in to my sister and sat on her bed and we talked it over does he mean to propose to me i said or does he not and my sister said i cant imagine what he sees in you will you accept him if he does she asked oh no i said good heavens why hes twenty years older than i am but of course i meant to all the time i shouldnt have cared if he was a hundred he was the most wonderful man id ever known  mrs appleby  and did he propose to you that weekend when hed practically only seen you once before  violet  i got down in the afternoon and he was there already as soon as i swallowed a cup of tea he said come out for a walk well id have loved a second cup but i didnt like to say so so i went but we had a second tea in a cottage half an hour later and we were engaged then       appleby comes in with osman pasha mr appleby is a selfmade      man who has entered parliament he is about sixty greybearded      rather short and stout with some accent in his speech shrewd      simple and goodnatured he wears a blue serge suit osman pasha      is a swarthy bearded oriental obese elderly but dignified he      wears the official frockcoat of the khedivial service and a      tarbush  appleby  sir arthur is coming in one moment he is talking to one of his secretaries  violet  really its too bad of them not to leave him alone even when hes snatching a mouthful of food  osman pasha  vous permettez que japporte ma cigarette chère madame  violet  of course come and sit here pasha  appleby  i wanted to tell his excellency how interested i am in his proposal to found a technical college in cairo but i cant speak french  violet  oh but his excellency understands english perfectly and i believe really he talks it as well as i do only he wont  osman pasha  madame je ne comprends langlais que quand vous le parlez et tout galant homme sait ce que dit une jolie femme  anne  translating for the applebys he says he only understands english when lady little speaks it and every nice man understands what a pretty woman says  violet  no one pays me such charming compliments as you do you know im learning arabic  osman pasha  cest une bien belle langue et vous madame vous avez autant dintelligence que de beauté  violet  i have a copt who comes to me every day and i practise a little with your brother anne  anne  to mrs appleby my brother is one of sir arthurs secretaries i expect it was he that mr appleby left with sir arthur  violet  if it is i shall scold him he knows quite well that he has no right to come and bother arthur when hes in the bosom of his family but they say hes a wonderful arabic scholar  osman pasha  vous parlez de m parry je nai jamais connu un anglais qui avait une telle facilité  anne  he says hes never known an englishman who speaks so well as ronny  violet  its a fearfully difficult language sometimes my head seems to get tied up in knots  two saises come in one with a salver on which are coffee cups and the other bearing a small tray on which is a silver vessel containing turkish coffee they go round giving coffee to the various people then wait in silence when sir arthur comes in they give him his coffee and go out  anne  its wonderful of you to persevere  violet  oh you know ronnys very encouraging he says im really getting on i want so badly to be able to talk you cant think how enthusiastic i am about egypt i love it  osman pasha  pas plus que lÉgypte vous aime madame  violet  when we landed at alexandria and i saw that blue sky and that coloured gesticulating crowd my heart leapt i knew i was going to be happy and every day ive loved egypt more i love its antiquities i love the desert and the streets of cairo and those dear little villages by the nile i never knew there was such beauty in the world i thought you only read of romance in books i didnt know there was a country where it sat by the side of a well under the palmtrees as though it were at home  osman pasha  vous êtes charmante madame cest un bien beau pays il na besoin que dune chose pour quon puisse y vivre  anne  translating its a beautiful country it only wants one thing to make it livable and what is that your excellency  osman pasha  la liberté  appleby  liberty  arthur has come in when first violet begins to speak of egypt and he listens to her enthusiasm with an indulgent smile at the pashas remark he comes forward arthur little is a man of fortyfive alert young in manner very intelligent with the urbanity selfassurance tact and resourcefulness of the experienced diplomatist nothing escapes him but he does not often show how much he notices  arthur  egypt has the liberty to do well your excellency does it need the liberty to do ill before it loses the inclination to do it  violet  to mrs appleby i hope you dont mind turkish coffee  mrs appleby  oh no i like it  violet  im so glad i think it perfectly delicious  arthur  you have in my wife an enthusiastic admirer of this country pasha  osman pasha  jen suis ravi  arthur  ive told ronny to come in and have a cup of coffee to anne i thought youd like to say how dyou do to him  anne  are you very busy today  arthur  were always busy isnt that so excellency  osman pasha  en effet et je vous demanderai permission de me retirer mon bureau mappelle  he gets up and shakes hands with violet  violet  it was charming of you to come  osman pasha  mon dieu madame cest moi qui vous remercie de mavoir donné loccasion de saluer votre grâce et votre beauté  he bows to the rest of the company arthur leads him towards the door and he goes out  anne  you take all these compliments without turning a hair violet  arthur  coming back you know thats a wonderful old man hes so wellbred he has such exquisite manners its hard to realise that if it were possible he would have us all massacred tomorrow  appleby  i remember there was a certain uneasiness in england when you recommended that he should be made minister of education  arthur  they dont always understand local conditions in england osman is a moslem of the old school he has a bitter hatred of the english in course of years he has come to accept the inevitable but hes not resigned to it he never loses sight of his aim  appleby  and that is  arthur  why bless you to drive the english into the sea but hes a clever old rascal and he sees that one of the first things that must be done is to educate the egyptians well we want to educate them too i had all sorts of reforms in mind which i would never have got the strict mohammedans to accept if they hadnt been brought forward by a man whose patriotism they believe in and whose orthodoxy is beyond suspicion  anne  dont you find it embarrassing to work with a man you distrust  arthur  i dont distrust him i have a certain admiration for him and i bear him no grudge at all because at the bottom of his heart he simply loathes me  appleby  i dont see why he should do that  arthur  i was in egypt for three years when i was quite a young man i was very small fry then but i came into collision with osman and he tried to poison me i was very ill for two months and hes never forgiven me because i recovered  appleby  what a scoundrel  arthur  he would be a little out of place in a nonconformist community in the good old days of ismael he had one of his wives beaten to death and thrown into the nile  appleby  but is it right to give high office to a man of that character  arthur  they were the manners and customs of the times  mrs appleby  but he tried to kill you dont you bear him any ill will  arthur  i dont think it was very friendly you know but after all no statesman can afford to pay attention to his private feelings his duty is to find the round peg for the round hole and put him in  anne  why does he come here  arthur  he has a very great and respectful admiration for violet she chaffs him if you please and the old man adores her i think shes done more to reconcile him to the british occupation than all our diplomacy  mrs appleby  it must be wonderful to have power in a country like this  violet  power oh i havent that but it makes me so proud to think i can be of any use at all i only wish i had the chance to do more since ive been here ive grown very patriotic  ronald parry comes in he is a young man very goodlooking fresh and pleasant with a peculiar charm of manner  arthur  ah here is ronny  ronny  am i too late for my cup of coffee  violet  no it will be brought to you at once  ronny  shaking hands with violet good morning  violet  this is mr parry mr and mrs appleby  ronny  how dyou do  arthur  now ronny dont put on your foreign office manner mr and mrs appleby are very nice people  mrs appleby  im glad you think that sir arthur  arthur  well when you left your cards with a soup ticket from the fo my heart sank  appleby  there my dear i told you he wouldnt want to be bothered with us  arthur  you see i expected a pompous couple who knew all about everything and were going to tell me exactly how egypt ought to be governed a member of parliament doesnt inspire confidence in the worried bosom of a government official  violet  i dont know if you think youre putting mr and mrs appleby at their ease arthur  arthur  oh but i shouldnt say this if i hadnt been most agreeably disappointed  mrs appleby  i never forget the days when mr appleby used to light the kitchen fire himself and i used to do the weeks washing every monday morning i dont think weve changed much since then either of us  arthur  i know and im really grateful to the foreign office for having given you your letter  mrs appleby  its been a great treat to us to come and see you and its done my heart good to see lady little if you dont mind my saying so shes like a spring morning and it makes one glad to be alive just to look at her  violet  oh dont  arthur  im inclined to feel very kindly to everyone who feels kindly towards her you must enjoy yourselves in upper egypt and when you come back to cairo you must let us know  appleby  im expecting to learn a good deal from my journey  arthur  you may learn a good deal that will surprise you you may learn that there are races in the world that seem born to rule and races that seem born to serve that democracy is not a panacea for all the ills of mankind but merely one system of government like another which hasnt had a long enough trial to make it certain whether it is desirable or not that freedom generally means the power of the strong to oppress the weak and that the wise statesman gives men the illusion of it but not the substancein short a number of things which must be very disturbing to the equilibrium of a radical member of parliament  anne  on the other hand youll see our beautiful nile and the temples  arthur  and perhaps theyll suggest to you that however old the world is its ever young and that when alls said and done the most permanent on the face of the earth is what seems the most transitorythe ideal  appleby  fanny it looks to me as though wed bitten off as big a piece of cake as we can chew with any comfort  mrs appleby  oh well well do our best and though i never could do arithmetic ive always thought perhaps one might be saved without goodbye lady little and thank you for having us  violet  goodbye  there are general farewells and they go to the door ronny opens it for them they go out  ronny  i forgot to tell you sir mrs pritchard has just telephoned to ask if she can see you on a matter of business  arthur  with a grim smile say im very busy today and i regret exceedingly that it will be quite impossible for me to see her  ronny  with a twinkle in his eye she said she was coming round at once  arthur  if shes made up her mind to see me at all costs she might have saved herself the trouble of ringing up to find out if it was convenient  anne  your sister is a determined creature arthur  arthur  i know i have some authority in the affairs of this country but none over dear christina i wonder what she wants  violet  let us hope for the best  arthur  ive noticed that whenever anyone wants to see me very urgently its never to give me anything when christina wants to see me urgently my only safety is in instant flight  violet  you must be nice to her arthur if youre not shell only take it out of me  arthur  its monstrous isnt it  violet  after all she kept house for you for ten years admirably mind you  arthur  admirably she has a genius for order and organisation in the house everything went like clockwork she never wasted a farthing she saved me hundreds of pounds she led me a dogs life ive come to the conclusion theres nothing so detestable as a good housekeeper  violet  how fortunate you married me then but you cant expect her to see that point of view its very hard for her to be turned out of this very pleasant billet and its natural that when you wont do something she asks you she should put it down to my influence  anne  it must have been a very difficult position for you  violet  i did all i could to make her like me i did feel rather like a usurper you know i tried to make her see that i didnt at all want to put on airs  arthur  fortunately shes taken it very well i confess i was a little nervous when she told me she meant to stay on in egypt to be near her son  anne  it would be a detestable person who didnt like violet i think  arthur  detestable i should have no hesitation in having him deported  ronny  i think id better be getting back to my work  anne  oh ronny would you like me to come and help you with your packing  violet  to ronny are you going somewhere  ronny  im leaving cairo  anne  didnt you know ronny has just been appointed to paris  violet  is he going to leave egypt for good  she is taken aback by the news she clenches her hand on the rail of a chair arthur and anne notice the little instinctive motion  ronny  i suppose so  violet  but why was it kept from me why have you been making a secret of it  arthur  darling no ones been making a secret of it ii thought anne would have told you  violet  oh it doesnt matter at all but ronny has been in the habit of doing all sorts of things for me it would have been convenient if id been told that a change was going to be made  arthur  im very sorry it was only arranged this morning i received a telegram from the foreign office i thought it would interest anne so i sent ronny along to tell her  violet  i hate to be treated like a child  there is a moments embarrassment  anne  it was stupid of me i ought to have come and told you i was so pleased and excited that i forgot  violet  i dont quite know why you should have been so excited  anne  it will be very nice for me to have ronny so near you see now ive given up my flat i shant come to egypt very often and i should never have seen ronny i can run over to paris constantly besides its a step isnt it and i want to see him an ambassador before i die  violet  i dont see what good it will do him in paris to speak arabic like a native  arthur  oh well that is the fo all over the best persian scholar in the service has spent the last six years in washington  ronny  its been a great surprise for me i expected to remain in egypt indefinitely  violet  recovering herself i expect youll have a very good time in paris when do you go  ronny  theres a boat the day after tomorrow sir arthur thought id better take that  violet  scarcely mistress of herself as soon as that recovering gaily we shall miss you dreadfully i cant imagine what i shall do without you to anne you cant think how useful hes been to me since i came here  ronny  its very kind of you to say so  violet  hes invaluable at functions and things like that you see he knows where everyone should sit at dinner and at first he used to coach me with details about various people so that i shouldnt say the wrong thing  arthur  if you had youd have said it so charmingly that no one would have resented it  violet  im so afraid that the man who takes ronnys place will refuse to write my invitations for me  arthur  its not exactly the duty of my secretaries  violet  no but i do hate doing it myself and ronny was able to imitate my handwriting  arthur  im sure he could never write as badly as you  violet  oh yes he could couldnt you  ronny  i managed to write quite enough like you for people not to notice the difference  violet  you know there are thirtytwo invitations to do now  anne  why dont you send cards  violet  oh i think a letter is so much more polite somehow i dont feel old enough to ask people to dine with me in the third person  ronny  ill come and do them the moment sir arthur can let me go  arthur  youd better do them before violet goes out  violet  thatll be very soon the khedives mother has asked me to go and see her at halfpast three ill get the list now shall i i dont think ill wait for christina if she wants to see you on business i dare say shed rather i wasnt there  arthur  very well  violet  to ronny will you come here when youre ready  ronny  certainly  she goes out  arthur  have you finished that report yet  ronny  not quite sir it will be ready in ten minutes  arthur  put it on my desk  ronny  all right sir  exit arthur and anne are left alone he looks at her reflectively  arthur  violet is very sensitive to anything that might be considered a slight  anne  its very natural isnt it a highspirited girl  arthur  she likes me to tell her my arrangements it gives her a little feeling of importance to know things before other people  anne  oh of course i quite understand i should do the same in her place  arthur  i ought to have remembered and told her that ronny was going she was just a little vexed because she thought id been fixing things up behind her back  anne  yes i know it would naturally put her out for a moment to learn on a sudden that one of the persons shed been thrown in contact with was going away  arthur  with a twinkle in his eye im wondering if i must blame you for the loss of an excellent secretary  anne  me  arthur  i dont know why the fo should suddenly have made up their minds that your brother was wanted in paris have you been pulling strings  anne  smiling what a suspicious nature you have  arthur  anne own up  anne  i thought ronny was getting into a groove here there didnt seem to be much more for him to do than he has been doing for some time if you will have the truth ive been moving heaven and earth to get him moved  arthur  how deceitful of you not to have said a word about it  anne  i didnt want to make him restless i knew hed be mad to go to paris i thought it much better not to say anything till it was settled  arthur  dyou think hes mad to go to paris  anne  fencing with him any young man would be  arthur  i wonder if hed be very much disappointed if i made other arrangements  anne  what do you mean arthur you wouldnt prevent him from going when ive done everything in the world to get him away  arthur  abruptly why should you be so anxious for him to go  she looks at him for an instant in dismay  anne  good heavens dont speak so sharply to me i told violet just now i wanted him to be more getatable i think he stands a much better chance of being noticed if hes in a place like paris  arthur  with a smile ah yes you said you were coming less frequently to egypt than in the past it might be worth while to keep ronny here in order to tempt you back  anne  egypt isnt the same to me that it was  arthur  i hope my marriage has made no difference to our friendship anne you know how deeply i value it  anne  you used to come and see me very often you knew i was discreet and you used to talk over with me all sorts of matters which occupied you i was pleased and flattered of course i realised that those pleasant conversations of ours must stop when you married i only came here this winter to collect my goods and chattels  arthur  you make me feel vaguely guilty towards you  anne  of course youre nothing of the sort but i dont want violet to feel that i am making any attempt toto monopolise you shes been charming to me the more i know her the more delightful i find her  arthur  its very nice of you to say so  anne  you know ive always had a great admiration for you im so glad to see you married to a girl whos not unworthy of you  arthur  i suppose it was a dangerous experiment for a man of my age to marry a girl of nineteen  anne  i think one can admit that but youve always been one of the favourites of the gods youve made a wonderful success of it  arthur  it needs on a husbands part infinite tact patience and tolerance  anne  you have the great advantage that violet is genuinely in love with you  arthur  i suppose only a fatuous ass would confess that a beautiful girl was in love with him  anne  you make her very happy  arthur  theres nothing i wouldnt do to achieve that im more desperately in love with violet even than when i first married her  anne  im so glad i want nothing but your happiness  arthur  here is christina  the door opens as he says these words and an english butler ushers in mrs pritchard she is a tall spare woman with hair turning grey comely upright in her carriage with decision of character indicated by every gesture but though masterful and firm to attain her ends she is an honest woman direct truthful and not without humour she is admirably gowned in a manner befitting her station and importance  butler  mrs pritchard  exit  arthur  i knew it was you christina i felt a sense of responsibility descend upon the house  christina  kissing him how is violet  arthur  lovely  christina  i was inquiring about her health  arthur  her health is perfect  christina  at her age ones always well i suppose kissing anne how dyou do and how are you my poor arthur  arthur  you ask me as though i was a doddering old gentleman crippled with rheumatism im in the best of health thank you very much and very active for my years christina has seen a flower on the table that has fallen from a bowl and picks it up and puts it back in its place why do you do that  christina  i dont like untidiness  arthur  i do  he takes the flower out again and places it on the table  christina  i was expecting to find you in your office  arthur  do you think im neglecting my work i thought it more becoming to wait for you here  christina  i wanted to see you on a matter of business  arthur  so i understood from your message i feel convinced youre going to put me in the way of making my fortune  anne  ill leave you shall i  christina  oh no pray dont theres not the least reason why you shouldnt hear what its all about  arthur  youre not going to make my fortune after all youre going to ask me to do something  christina  what makes you think that  arthur  you want a third person present to be witness to my brutal selfishness when i refuse i know you christina  christina  smiling youre much too sensible to refuse a perfectly reasonable request  arthur  let us hear it she sits down on the sofa the cushions have been disordered by people sitting on them and she shakes them out and pats them and arranges them in their place i wish youd leave the furniture alone christina  christina  i cannot make out what pleasure people take in seeing things out of their proper place  arthur  youre very long in coming to the point  christina  i hear that the khedive has quarrelled with his secretary  arthur  youre a marvellous woman christina you get hold of all the harem gossip  christina  its true isnt it  arthur  yes but i only heard of it myself just before luncheon how did it come to your ears  christina  that doesnt matter does it i have a way of hearing things that may be of interest to me  arthur  im afraid im very dense but i dont see how it can be of any particular interest to you  christina  smiling dear arthur the khedive has asked you to recommend him an english secretary  anne  has he really thats a change hes never had an english secretary before  arthur  never  anne  its a wonderful opportunity  arthur  if we get the right man he can be of the greatest possible help if hes tactful wise and courteous theres no reason why in time he shouldnt attain very considerable influence over the khedive if we can really get the khedive to work honestly and sincerely with us instead of hampering us by all kinds of secret devices we can do miracles in this country  anne  what a splendid chance for the man who gets the job  arthur  i suppose it is if he has the right qualities he may achieve anything and after all its a splendid chance to be able to render such great service to our own old country  christina  has the khedive given any particulars about the sort of man he wants  arthur  he naturally wants a young man and a good sportsman its important that he should be able to speak arabic but the qualifications which will satisfy the khedive are nothing beside those which will satisfy me the wrong man may cause irreparable damage to british interests  christina  have you thought that henry would be admirably suited  arthur  i cant say i have christina  christina  hes young and hes very good at games he speaks arabic  arthur  quite well i believe i think hes very well suited to the post he has it would be a pity to disturb him when hes just got at home with the work  christina  arthur you cant compare a very badly paid job in the ministry of education with a private secretaryship to the khedive  arthur  the best job for a man is the one hes most fitted to do  christina  youve got no fault to find with henry hes a very good worker hes honest industrious and painstaking  arthur  you dont praise a pair of boots because you can walk in them without discomfort if you cant you chuck them away  christina  what dyou mean by that  arthur  the qualities you mention really dont deserve any particular reward if henry hadnt got them id fire him without a moments hesitation  christina  i have no doubt youd welcome the opportunity its the greatest misfortune of henrys life that he happens to be your nephew  arthur  on the other hand its counterbalanced by his extraordinary good luck in being your son  christina  youve stood in his way on every possible occasion  arthur  goodhumouredly you know thats not true christina ive refused to perpetrate a number of abominable jobs that youve urged me to hes had his chances as everyone else has youre an admirable mother if id listened to you hed be commanderinchief and prime minister by now  christina  ive never asked you to do anything for henry that wasnt perfectly reasonable  arthur  its evident then that we have different views upon what is reasonable  christina  i appeal to you anne do you see any objection to suggesting henry to the khedive as a private secretary  arthur  i knew thats what she wanted you here for anne to be a witness to my pigheaded obstinacy  christina  dont be absurd arthur im asking anne for an unprejudiced opinion  arthur  anne is unlikely to have an opinion of any value on a matter she knows nothing about  anne  with a chuckle that is a very plain hint that i cant do better than hold my tongue ill take it christina  christina  its so unreasonable of you arthur you wont listen to any argument  arthur  the only one youve offered yet is heres a good job going henrys your nephew give it him my dear dont you see the khedive would never accept such a near relation of mine  christina  i dont agree with you at all the fact of his asking you to recommend an english secretary shows that he wants to draw the connection between you and himself closer after all you might give the boy a chance  arthur  this is not an occasion when one can afford to give a chance its hit or miss if the man i choose is a failure the khedive will never ask me to do such a thing for him again i cant take any risks  christina  will you tell me what qualifications henry lacks to make him suitable for the post  arthur  certainly its true he speaks arabic but he doesnt understand the native mind grammars cant teach you that my dear only sympathy he has the mind of an official i often think that you must have swallowed a ramrod in early life and poor henry was born with a footrule in his inside  christina  i am not amused arthur  arthur  i have no doubt in course of time hell become a very competent official but hell never be anything else he lacks imagination and that is just as necessary to a statesman as to a novelist finally he has no charm  christina  how can you judge youre his uncle you might just as well say i have no charm  arthur  you havent youre an admirable woman with all the substantial virtues which make you an ornament to your sex but you have no charm  christina  with a grim smile i should be a fool if i expected you to pay me compliments shouldnt i  arthur  you would at all events be a woman who is unable to learn by experience  christina  besides i dont agree with you i think henry has charm  arthur  why do we all call him henry why does henry suit him so admirably if he had charm we would naturally call him harry  christina  really arthur it amazes me that a man in your position can be influenced by such absurd trifles its so unfair when a boy has a dozen solid real virtues that you should refuse to recommend him for a job because he hasnt got in your opinion a frivolous unsubstantial advantage like charm  arthur  unsubstantial it may be but frivolous it certainly isnt believe me charm is the most valuable asset that any man can have dyou think it sounds immoral to say it compensates for the lack of brains and virtue alas it happens to be true brains may bring you to power but charm enables you to keep it without charm you will never lead men  christina  and do you imagine youre likely to find a young englishman whos a sportsman and an arabic scholar who has tact imagination sympathy wisdom courtesy and charm  anne  if you do arthur im afraid he wont remain here very long because i warn you i shall insist on marrying him  arthur  its not so formidable as it sounds im going to suggest ronny  christina  astounded ronald parry thats the very last person i should have thought youd be inclined to suggest  arthur  sharply why  anne  with dismay you dont really mean that arthur  arthur  why not  christina  to anne didnt you know  anne  its the last thing that would ever have entered my head  christina  i thought youd made all arrangements for sending him away  arthur  i made no arrangements at all i received a telegram from the fo saying that hed been appointed to paris  anne  after a very short pause dont you think youd better leave it at that  arthur  no i dont im going to wire to london explaining the circumstances and suggesting that i think him very suitable for the post thats just offered itself  anne  trying to take it lightly i feel rather aggrieved after all the efforts ive made to get him appointed to paris  christina  oh he owes that to you does he you thought it would be better for him to leave here  arthur  deliberately i dont quite understand what youre driving at christina  christina  taking him up defiantly i cannot imagine anyone more unsuitable than ronald parry  arthur  that is for me to judge isnt it  anne  perhaps the foreign office will say they see no reason to change their mind  arthur  i dont think so  anne  have you told ronny  arthur  no i thought it unnecessary till id found out whether the khedive would be willing to take him  christina  im amazed arthur when henry told me ronald parry was going i couldnt help thinking it was very desirable  arthur  why       she looks at him about to speak then hesitates she does not      dare and resolves to be silent anne comes to the rescue  anne  christina knows that i shall be very little in egypt in future and how fond ronny and i are of one another we naturally want to be as near each other as we can  christina  with a chuckle it really amuses me that you should refuse to give a good job to henry because youve made up your mind to give it to ronald parry       arthur walks up to her deliberately and faces her  arthur  if youve got anything to say against him say it       they stare at one another for a moment in silence  christina  if you have nothing against him theres no reason why i should  arthur  i see i have a good deal to do this afternoon if you have nothing more to say to me id like to get back to my work  christina  very well ill go  arthur  you wont stop and see violet  christina  i dont think so thank you       she goes out he opens the door for her  anne  why didnt you tell me just now that youd decided to keep ronny in cairo  arthur  i thought it was unnecessary till everything was settled i daresay youll be good enough to hold your tongue about it  anne  have you definitely made up your mind  arthur  definitely       they look at one another steadily  anne  i think ill go up to my room i keep to my old habit of a siesta after luncheon  arthur  i wish i could get violet to take it  anne  shes so young she doesnt feel the need of it yet  arthur  yes shes so young       anne goes out for a moment arthur gives way to discouragement      he feels old and tired but he hears a footstep and pulls himself      together he is his usual self gay gallant and humorous when      violet enters the room  violet  i saw christina drive away what did she want  arthur  the earth  violet  i hope you gave it her  arthur  no im trying to get the moon for you just now darling and i thought if i gave her the earth it really would upset the universe a little too much  violet  i thought id better do these invitations before i dressed  arthur  youre not going to put on a different frock to go and have tea with the khedives mother you look charming in that  violet  i think its a little too young it was all right for the morning  arthur  of course you are older this afternoon thats quite true  violet  can you spare ronny just now  arthur  after an instants pause yes ill send him to you at once  violet  as he is going i shall be back in time to give you your tea  arthur  that will be very nice goodbye till then       he goes out she is meditative she gives a slight start as      ronny comes in  violet  i hope i havent torn you away from anything very important  ronny  i was only typing a very dull report id just finished it  violet  you mustnt ever bother about me if its not convenient you know  ronny  i shant have much chance shall i  violet  no look heres the list       she hands him a sheet of paper on which names are scribbled and      he reads it  ronny  it looks rather a stodgy party doesnt it i see youve crossed my name out  violet  its not much good asking you when you wont be here whom dyou advise me to ask in your place  ronny  i dont know i hate the idea of anyone being asked in my place shall i start on them at once  violet  if you dont mind i have to go out you know       he sits down at a writing table  ronny  ill start on those i dislike least  violet  with a chuckle dont you remember when arthur said i must ask the von scheidleins how we hated to write them a civil letter  ronny  writing dear lady sinclair  violet  oh she asked me to call her evelyn  ronny  hang ill have to start again  violet  it always make me so uncomfortable to address fat old ladies by their christian names  ronny  ill end up yours affectionately shall i  violet  i suppose youre awfully excited at the thought of going  ronny  no  violet  its a step for you isnt it i  i ought to congratulate you  ronny  you dont think i want to go do you i hate it  violet  why  ronny  ive been very happy here  violet  you knew you couldnt stay here for the rest of your life  ronny  why not  violet  with an effort at selfcontrol who is the next person on the list  ronny  looking at it will you miss me at all  violet  i suppose i shall at first  ronny  thats not a very kind thing to say  violet  isnt it i dont mean to be unkind ronny  ronny  oh im so miserable       she gives a little cry and looks at him she presses her hands to      her heart  violet  let us go on with the letters       silently he writes she does not watch him but looks hopelessly      into space she is unable to restrain a sob  ronny  youre crying  violet  no im not im not i swear im not he gets up and goes over to her he looks into her eyes it came so suddenly i never dreamt youd be going away  ronny  oh violet  violet  dont call me that please dont  ronny  did you know that i loved you  violet  how should i know oh im so unhappy what have i done to deserve it  ronny  i couldnt help loving you it cant matter if i tell you now its the end of everything i dont want to go without your knowing i love you i love you i love you  violet  oh ronny  ronny  its been so wonderful all these months ive never known anyone to come up to you everything you said pleased me i loved the way you walk and your laugh and the sound of your voice  violet  oh dont  ronny  i was content just to see you and to talk with you and to know you were here near me youve made me extraordinarily happy  violet  have i oh im so glad  ronny  i couldnt help myself i tried not to think of you youre not angry with me  violet  i cant be oh ronny ive had such a rotten time it came upon me unawares i didnt know what was happening i thought i only liked you  ronny  oh my dearest is it possible   violet  and when it struck meoh i was so frightened i thought it must be written on my face and everyone must see i knew it was wrong i knew i mustnt i couldnt help myself  ronny  oh say it violet i want to hear you say it i love you  violet  i love you he kneels down before her and covers her hands with kisses oh dont dont  ronny  my dearest my very dearest  violet  what have i done i made up my mind that no one should ever know i thought then it wouldnt matter it neednt prevent me from doing my duty to arthur it didnt interfere with my affection for him i didnt see how it could hurt anyone if i kept my love for you locked up in my heart tightly and it made me so happy i rejoiced in it  ronny  i never knew i used to weigh every word you said to me you never gave me a sign  violet  i didnt know it was possible to love anybody as i love you ronny  ronny  my precious  violet  oh dont say things like that to me it breaks my heart i wouldnt ever have told you only i was upset by your going if theyd only given me time to get used to the thought i wouldnt  i wouldnt make such a fool of myself  ronny  you cant grudge me that little bit of comfort  violet  but it all came so suddenly the announcement that you were going and your going i felt i couldnt bear it why didnt they give me time  ronny  dont cry my dearest it tortures me  violet  this is the last time we shall be alone ronny i couldnt let you go without  oh my god i cant bear it  ronny  we might have been so happy together violet why didnt we meet sooner i feel were made for one another  violet  oh dont talk of that dyou suppose i havent said to myself oh if id only met him first oh ronny ronny ronny  ronny  i never dared to think that you loved me its maddening that i must go its horrible to think of leaving you now  violet  no its better we couldnt have gone on like that im glad youre going it breaks my heart  ronny  oh violet why didnt you wait for me  violet  i made a mistake i must pay for it arthurs so good and kind he loves me with all his heart oh what a fool i was i didnt know what love was i feel that my life is finished and im so young ronny  ronny  you know id do anything in the world for you  violet  my dear one they stand face to face looking at one another wistfully and sadly its no good ronny were both making ourselves utterly miserable say goodbye to me and let us part he draws her towards him no dont kiss me i dont want you to kiss me he takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately oh ronny i do love you so at last she tears herself away from him she sinks into a chair he makes a movement towards her no dont come near me now im so tired       he looks at her for a moment then he goes back to the table and      sits down to write the letters their eyes meet slowly  ronny  its goodbye then  violet  its goodbye       she presses her hands to her heart as though the aching were      unendurable he buries his head in his hands  end of the first act     act ii        the scene is the garden of the consular agents residence it is      an eastern garden with palmtrees magnolias and flowering bushes      of azaleas on one side is an old arabic wellhead decorated with      verses from the koran a yellow rambler grows over the ironwork      above rosetrees are in full bloom on the other side are basket      chairs and a table at the bottom of the garden runs the nile and      on the farther bank are lines of palmtrees and the eastern sky it      is towards evening and during the act the sun gradually sets       the table is set out with teathings anne is seated reading a      book the gardener in his blue gaberdine with brown legs and the      little round cap of the egyptian workman is watering the flowers      christina comes in  anne  looking up with a smile ah christina  christina  i was told i should find you here i came to see violet but i hear she hasnt come back yet  anne  she was going to see the khedives mother  christina  i think ill wait for her  anne  would you like tea i was waiting till violet came in i expect shes been made to eat all sorts of sweet things and shell want a cup of tea to take the taste out of her mouth  christina  no dont have it brought for me i can never quite get over being treated as a guest in the house i was mistress of for so many years to the gardener imshi get out  gardener  dêtak sa ideh may thy night be happy       he goes out  anne  your knowledge of arabic is rather sketchy christina  christina  i never see why i should trouble myself with strange languages if foreigners want to talk to me they can talk to me in english  anne  but surely when were out of our own country were foreigners  christina  nonsense anne were english i wonder arthur allows violet to learn arabic i cant help thinking itll make a bad impression on the natives i managed this house on fifty words of arabic  anne  smiling im convinced that on a hundred youd be prepared to manage the country  christina  i dont think you can deny that i did my work here competently  anne  youre a wonderful housekeeper  christina  i have common sense and a talent for organisation pursing her lips it breaks my heart to see the way certain things are done here now  anne  you must remember violet is very young  christina  much too young to be a suitable wife for arthur  anne  he seems to be very well satisfied and after all he is the person most concerned  christina  i know his infatuation isblind dont you think  anne  coolly i think its very delightful to see two people so much in love with one another  christina  dyou know that i used to be fearfully jealous of you anne  anne  amused i know that you thoroughly disliked me christina you didnt trouble to hide it  christina  i was always afraid that arthur would marry you i didnt want to be turned out of this house i suppose you think thats horrid of me  anne  no i think its very natural  christina  i didnt see why arthur should marry i gave him all the comforts of home life and i thought it would interfere with his work of course i knew that he liked you i suffered agonies when he used to go and dine with you quietly with a sniff he said it rested him  anne  perhaps it did did you grudge him that  christina  i knew you were desperately in love with him  anne  need you throw that in my face now really i havent deserved it  christina  my dear i wish he had married you it never struck me hed marry a girl twenty years younger than himself  anne  he never looked upon me as anything but a friend i dont suppose it occurred to him for an instant that my feeling might possibly be different  christina  it was stupid of me i ought to have given him a hint  anne  with a smile you took care not to do that christina perhaps you knew that was all it wanted  christina  reflectively i dont think hes treated you very well  anne  nonsense a man isnt obliged to marry a woman just because shes in love with him i dont see why loving should give one a claim on the person one loves  christina  you would have made him a splendid wife  anne  so will violet my dear most men have the wives they deserve  christina  i marvel at your kindness to her youre so tolerant and sympathetic one would never imagine shes robbed you of what you wanted most in the world  anne  i shouldnt respect myself very much if i bore her the shadow of a grudge im so glad that shes sweet and charming and ingenuous it makes it very easy to be fond of her  christina  i know i wanted to dislike her but i cant really there is something about her which disarms one  anne  isnt it lucky its a difficult position that irresistible charm of hers will make everything possible after all you and i can agree in that we both want arthur to be happy  christina  i wonder if theres much chance of that       anne looks at her for a moment inquiringly and christina      coolly returns the stare  anne  why did you come here this afternoon christina  christina  with a faint smile why did you take so much trouble to get your brother moved to paris  anne  good heavens i told you this morning  christina  dyou think we need make pretences with one another  anne  i dont think i quite understand  christina  dont you you wanted ronny to leave egypt because you know hes in love with violet       for a moment anne is a little taken aback but she quickly      recovers herself  anne  hes very susceptible hes always falling in and out of love i had noticed that he was attracted and i confess i thought it better to put him out of harms way  christina  how cunning you are anne you wont admit anything till youre quite certain the person youre talking to knows it you know as well as i do that violet is just as much in love with him  anne  much disturbed christina what are you going to do how could i help knowing youve only got to see the way they look at one another theyre sick with love  christina  what did arthur expect ive never seen a couple more admirably suited to one another  anne  i thought no one knew but me till this morning when you were talking to arthur then i thought you must know too my heart was in my mouth i was afraid you were going to tell him but you didnt and i thought id been mistaken  christina  you didnt give me credit for very nice feeling anne because i didnt act like a perfect beast you thought i must be a perfect fool  anne  i know how devoted you are to your son i didnt believe youd stick at anything when his interests were at stake im sorry christina  christina  pray dont apologise i didnt know it myself it was on the tip of my tongue to tell arthur but i simply couldnt i couldnt do anything so shabby  anne  oh christina we mustnt ever let him know we cant make him so miserable it would break his heart  christina  well what is to be done  anne  heaven knows ive been racking my brains i can think of nothing id arranged everything so beautifully and now im helpless i thought even of going to ronny and asking him to refuse any job that will keep him here but arthur looks upon it as so important hell insist on ronnys accepting unless his reasons for going arewhats the word i want  christina  irrefutable it seems very hard that my boy should be done out of such a splendid chance by ronny except for your brother im sure arthur would give it to henry  anne  diplomatically i know he has the highest opinion of henrys abilities  christina  you cant expect me to sit still and let things go on  anne  arthur is perfectly unconscious he thinks violet is as much in love with him as he is with her you couldnt be so cruel as to hint anything to him  christina  how you adore him anne you may set your mind at rest im not going to say a word to arthur im going to speak to violet  anne  frightened what are you going to say  christina  im going to ask her to do all she can to persuade arthur to give henry the job and then ronny can go to paris  anne  youre not going to tell her you know  christina  deliberately if its necessary she must make ronny refuse the appointment he must invent some excuse that arthur will accept  anne  but its blackmail  christina  i dont care what it is       violet comes in she wears an afternoon gown picturesque and      simple yet elegant enough for the visit she has been paying she      has a large hat which she presently removes  anne  here is violet  violet  oh you poor people havent you had any tea  anne  i thought wed wait till you came back itll come at once now  violet  how are you christina how is henry they kiss one another ive not seen him for days  christina  hes coming to fetch me presently  violet  i shall tell him he neglects me hes the only one of my inlaws im not a little afraid of  christina  hes a good boy  violet  he has a good mother i thought it would be such fun having a nephew several years older than myself but he wont treat me as an aunt he will call me violet i tell him he ought to be more respectful       meanwhile servants have brought the tea  christina  what have you been doing this afternoon  violet  oh i went to see the khedives mother she made me eat seventeen different things and i feel exactly like a boaconstrictor looking at the cakes and scones im afraid theres not a very nice tea  christina  so i notice  violet  with a smile i suppose i couldnt persuade you to pour it out  christina  gratified certainly if you wish it       she sits down in front of the teapot and pours out cups of tea      arthur comes in  arthur  hulloa christina are you pouring out the tea  christina  violet asked me to  violet  if only i werent here it would be quite like old times  arthur  i understand you want to see me violet  violet  oh i hope you havent come out here on purpose i sent the message that i wished to have a word with you when convenient but i didnt want to hurry you i was quite prepared to go to you  arthur  that sounds very formidable i had a few minutes to spare while some letters were being prepared for me to sign but in any case im always at your service  violet  the khedives mother has asked me to talk to you about a man called abdul said  arthur  oh  violet  she thought if i put the circumstances before you  arthur  interrupting what has he got to do with her  violet  hes been employed for years on an estate of hers up the nile his mother was one of her maids it appears she gave her a dowry when she married  arthur  smiling i see i gathered that abdul said had powerful influence somewhere or other  christina  who is this man arthur  arthur  hes been sentenced to death for murder it was a perfectly clear case but there was a lot of perjury and we had some difficulty in getting a conviction what has the princess asked you to do  violet  she explained the whole thing to me and then she asked if i wouldnt intercede with you i promised to do everything i could  arthur  you shouldnt have done that the old lady knows quite well an affair of this sort is no business of yours i wish youd told her so  violet  arthur what could i do his wife was there and his mother if youd seen them i couldnt bear to look at their misery and do nothing i said i was sure that when you knew all the facts youd reprieve the man  arthur  its not in my power to do anything of the sort the prerogative of mercy is with the khedive  violet  i know but if you advise him to exercise it he will hes only too anxious to but he wont move without your advice  arthur  its monstrous of the princess to try and make use of you in this way she prepared a complete trap for you  anne  what did the man do exactly  arthur  its rather a peculiar case abdul said had a difference of opinion with an armenian merchant and shortly after his only son fell ill and died he took it into his head that the armenian had cast the evil eye on him and he took his gun waited for his opportunity and shot the armenian dead the man isnt a criminal in the ordinary sense of the word but we cant afford to make exceptions if we did thered be a crop of murders with the same excuse i looked into the case this morning and i see no reason to advise the khedive to interfere with the course of justice  violet  this morning when you came in to luncheon full of spirits laughing and chaffing had you just sent a man to his death how horribly callous  arthur  im sorry you should think that i give every matter my closest attention and when ive settled it to the best of my ability i put it out of my mind i think it would be just as unwise to let it affect me as for a doctor to let himself be affected by his patients sufferings  violet  it seems to me horrible to slaughter that wretched man because hes ignorant and simpleminded dont you see that for yourself  arthur  im afraid im not here to interpret the law according to my feelings but according to its own spirit  violet  its easy to talk like that when you havent got any feeling one way or the other dont you realise the misery of that man condemned to die for what he honestly thought was a mere act of justice i wish youd seen the agony of those poor women and now theyre more or less happy because i promised to help them the princess told them i had influence with you if she only knew  arthur  you should never have been put in such a position it was grossly unfair ill take care that nothing of the sort occurs again  violet  dyou mean to say youll do nothing wont you even go into the matter againwith a little sympathy  arthur  i cant  violet  its the first thing ive ever asked you arthur  arthur  i know im only sorry that i must refuse you  violet  this is the first sentence of death in egypt since our marriage dont you know what it would mean to me to think id saved a mans life the khedive is waiting to sign the reprieve it only requires a word from you wont you say it i feel that the gratitude of these poor women may be like a blessing on us  arthur  my dear i think my duty is very clear i must do it  violet  its clear because all that grief means nothing to you what do you care if a man is hanged whom youve never even seen i wonder if youd find it so easy to do your duty in a matter that affected you if it meant misery or happiness to you its easy to do ones duty when one doesnt care  arthur  youre quite right that is the test if one can do ones duty when it means the loss of all one holds dear and valuable in the world  violet  i hope youll never be put to it  arthur  with a chuckle my dear you say that as though you hoped precisely the contrary  violet  must i write to the princess and say i was entirely mistaken and i have no more influence over you than a tripper at shepheards hotel  arthur  id sooner you didnt write to her at all i will have a message conveyed which you may be sure will save you from any humiliation  violet  icily im afraid you have a lot of business you mustnt let me keep you       he looks at her reflectively for a moment and then goes out      there is an awkward silence  violet  those good people we had to luncheon today would be amused to see what the power amounts to that they congratulated me on  christina  theres very little that arthur would refuse you hed do practically anything in the world to please you  violet  itll be a long time before i ask him to do anything else  christina  dont say that violet because i came here today on purpose to ask you to use your influence with him  violet  you see how much i have  christina  that was a matter of principle men are always funny about principles you can never get them to understand that circumstances alter cases  violet  arthur looks upon me as a child after all its not my fault that im twenty years younger than he is  christina  i want your help so badly violet and you know the fact that arthur has just refused to do something for you is just the reason that will make him anxious to do anything you ask now  violet  i dont want to expose myself to the humiliation of another refusal  christina  its so important to me it may mean all the difference to henrys future  violet  with a change of manner charmingly oh id love to do anything i could for henry  christina  the khedive has asked arthur for an english secretary it seems to me that henry has every possible qualification but you know what arthur is hes terrified of the least suspicion of favouring his friends and relations  violet  my dear christina what can i do arthur would merely tell me to mind my own business  christina  he wants to give the post to ronald parry  violet  quickly ronny but ronnys going to paris its all arranged  christina  it was but arthur thinks it essential that he should stay in egypt  violet  did you know this anne  anne  not till just now  violet  does ronny know  anne  i dont think so       violet is aghast she does all she can to hide her agitation the      two women watch her christina with cold curiosity anne with      embarrassment  violet  im  im awfully surprised its only an hour or two ago that ronny and i bade one another a pathetic farewell  christina  really but there was never any talk of his going till the day after tomorrow you were in a great hurry with your leavetakings  violet  i thought hed be busy packing and that i mightnt have another chance  christina  youve been so intimate im sure he would have been able to snatch a moment to say goodbye to you and arthur before his train started       violet does not quite know what this speech means she gives      christina a look anne comes to the rescue quickly  anne  ronny has been acting as violets secretary to a certain extent i expect they had all sorts of little secrets together that they wanted to discuss in private  christina  of course thats very natural with great friendliness if i thought i were robbing you of anyone who was indispensable to you i wouldnt ask you to put in a good word for henry but of course if ronald became the khedives secretary he couldnt exactly continue to write letters and pay bills for you could he  violet  im rather taken aback id got it fixed in my head that ronny was going  christina  i can promise you that in helping henry youre not doing any harm to ronald anne is very anxious that he should leave egypt isnt that so  anne  in a way henry is proposing to spend the rest of his official life in egypt an appointment like this is naturally more important to him than it would be to ronny who is by way of being a bird of passage  christina  exactly ronny has had his experience here if he stayed longer it would only be waste of time anne naturally wants to have him near her i daresay shes a little afraid of his getting into mischief here  anne  i dont know about that christina  christina  my dear you know how susceptible he is theres always the possibility that hell fall in love with someone who isnt very desirable  violet  ive got an awful headache  christina  why dont you take a little aspirin im quite sure that if you set your mind to it you can persuade arthur to give the job to henry and that would settle everything  violet  and if i cant persuade him  christina  then you must put it to ronny  violet  i  christina  you see if he refused the appointment and left egypt then im convinced arthur would accept henry  violet  why should i put it to ronny  christina  pleasantly youve been so very friendly havent you if you suggested to him that  hes standing in henrys way  violet  i should have thought it was for anne to do that  christina  how simpleminded you are a man will often do for a pretty woman what he wont do for his sister  violet  you want me to make him go  christina  dont you think yourself that would be the very best thing  for all parties       violet and christina look steadily at one another violet      sinks her eyes she knows that christina is aware of her love      she is terrified ronald comes in he is in the highest      spirits  ronny  ive been sent to have a cup of tea sir arthur is coming along in a minute ive got some news im staying in egypt isnt it splendid       violet gives a little gasp  violet  is it settled then  ronny  did you know i thought it would be a surprise  violet  no ive just heard  ronny  isnt it magnificent  christina  youre very changeable its only a few months ago that you were constantly telling henry youd had enough of the country  ronny  never i love it i should like to stay here all my life  christina  fancy that  ronny  addressing himself to violet it would be madness to leave a place where youre so happy wouldnt it i feel so intensely alive here its a wonderful country one lives every minute of the day  christina  youre so enthusiastic one would almost think youd fallen in love  violet  ronny is naturally enthusiastic  ronny  to christina and why shouldnt i have fallen in love  christina  wont you tell us who with  ronny  with a chuckle i was only joking isnt it enough to have a splendid job in a country where theres so much hope sir arthur has given me a marvellous opportunity itll be my fault if i dont make the most of it  christina  dryly shall i give you a cup of tea  ronny  chaffing her dyou think i want calming down i feel like a prisoner who was going to be hanged and has just had a free pardon i dont want to be calmed down i want to revel in my freedom  christina  all that means i take it that you dont want tea  ronny  its no good trying to snub me im unsnubable today you havent congratulated me anne  anne  my dear youve been talking nineteen to the dozen ive not had the chance to get a word in edgeways  ronny  to violet will you put my name back on your list for that dinner it would have broken my heart to miss it  violet  your official position rather alters things doesnt it i would never dare to ask you now just to make an even number  ronny  oh well im sending out the invitations i shall write a formal letter to myself explaining the circumstances and i daresay i shall see my way to accept  christina  dear ronald you might be eighteen       arthur comes in with henry pritchard this is christinas      son a pleasant clean young man but in no way remarkable  arthur  henry tells me hes come to fetch you away christina  christina  so you lose not a moment in bringing him here  arthur  really christina you do me an injustice i cant bear to think you should be parted from your precious boy an instant longer than necessary  henry  shaking hands with violet how is my stately aunt  violet  merry and bright thank you  henry  you know im having a birthday soon dont you  violet  what of it  henry  ive always been given to understand that aunts give their nephews ten shillings on their birthday  violet  do they i am glad id love to press ten shillings into your willing hand  henry  halloa ronny lucky devil i congratulate you  ronny  thats awfully good of you old man  arthur  on what christina  christina  i told henry i didnt think it would matter i thought it better that he should know  henry  i say uncle arthur im afraid mother has been giving you a rotten time its not my fault you know  arthur  what isnt  henry  well when mother told me at luncheon that the khedive had applied for an english secretary i saw by the beady look in her eye that if i didnt get the job she was going to make things unpleasant for somebody  christina  really henry i dont know what you mean  henry  well mother youre an old dear  christina  not so old either  arthur  certainly not henry let us have none of your nonsense  henry  but you know perfectly well that youd cheerfully bring the british empire tumbling about our ears if you could get me a good fat billet by doing so  arthur  out of the mouths of babes and sucklings  christina  youve got no right to say that henry ive never asked anything for you that it wasnt practically your right to have  henry  well mother between you and me i dont mind telling you that ronny is much more suited to this particular job than i am only a perfect fool would have hesitated and for the honour of the family we cant suspect uncle arthur of being that  arthur  you see what comes of bringing up a boy properly christina youve made him a decent fellow in spite of yourself  christina  youre a tiresome creature henry but im attached to you you may kiss me  henry  come along mother im not going to kiss you in public  christina  getting up well goodbye violet dont forget our little conversation will you  violet  goodbye goodbye henry  christina  to anne why dont you come for a little drive with us its such a beautiful evening  anne  will you take me i think id like it it wont take me a minute to put on my hat       she gets up they start to walk towards the house  christina  putting up her cheek goodbye arthur  arthur  oh ill just come along and put you in your carriage you shant say that i dont treat you with the ceremony due to your importance       they saunter off violet and ronny are left alone  violet  youre coming back arthur  arthur  oh yes in a minute exit  ronny  under his breath violet  violet  be quiet  ronny  isnt it ripping i could hardly prevent myself from letting them see how much i loved you  violet  you didnt christina suspected before and now youve told her in plain words  ronny  gaily thats only your fancy you think because its plain to you it must be plain to anybody else  violet  ive never before had anything to hide dyou think i like it  ronny  and even if she does know what does it matter it does her no harm and how could anyone help loving you  violet  quickly take care what you say  ronny  no one can hear to look at us anyone would think we were discussing the political situation  violet  youre cunning ronny  ronny  i love you i love you i love you  violet  for gods sake dont keep on saying it im so ashamed  ronny  astonished what about  violet  just now this afternoon i would never have said what i did only i thought you were going i wasnt myself then ronny i ought never to have  ronny  thank god you did you cant grudge me the happiness you gave me you cant take it away from me now i know you love me i hold the sun and the moon in my hands and all the stars of heaven  violet  desperately what are we going to do oh its not fair to me  ronny  its done now you cant unsay it each time i look at you i shall remember ive held you in my arms and kissed your lips you can never take that away from me and i neednt go i shall see you constantly oh im so happy       she walks up and down for a moment trying to control herself      then she makes up her mind she stops and faces him  violet  i want you to go ronny i want you to make some excuse and refuse the appointment here  ronny  no i cant leave you now  violet  i beseech you to go  ronny  do you want me to  violet  yes  ronny  give me your hand then  violet  why  ronny  give me your hand she gives it him and he holds it say you love me violet  violet  no  ronny  how cold your hand is  violet  let me go  ronny  dyou really want me to go  violet  you know i dont i adore you itll kill me if you go he bends down and passionately kisses her hand ronny ronny dont what are you doing she tears her hand away she is trembling with emotion he is white and cold with passion they sit opposite one another for a while in silence what a punishment when you told me this afternoon that you loved me i thought id never been happy in my life before and though it tore my heart to think that you must go i feltoh i dont knowas though my joy was so overwhelming there was no room in my heart for anything else and now im wretched wretched  ronny  but why darling my darling we were going to be parted and now were going to be together can anything matter beside that  violet  its all so hopeless  ronny  it neednt be  violet  how can it be anything else  ronny  i dont love you for a day or a week violet i love you for always  violet  whatever happens im going to try to do my duty to arthur  ronny  im not seeking to prevent you what am i asking for i only want to see you i want to know that im close to you i want to touch your hand i want to think of you what harm can that do you  violet  if i were my own mistress i could laugh and let you do as you choose but im not im bound to you hand and foot its torture to me and the worst of it is i love my bonds i cant wish to be without them im at your mercy ronny i love you  ronny  oh but thats enough for me i swear to you i dont want you to do anything that youll ever regret  violet  if it could only be taken out of our hands if something would only happen  ronny  what can happen  violet  perhaps the khedive will change his mind perhaps the foreign office will say you must go to paris  ronny  would you be pleased violet i want so little from you how can it hurt you to give me that let us give ourselves a chance to be happy  violet  we shall never be happy never the only thing we can do is to part and i cant let you go i cant i cant its asking too much of me  ronny  i love you with all my heart and soul i didnt know it was possible to love anyone as i love you  arthur is heard gaily whistling to himself  violet  theres arthur  ronny  quickly shall i go  violet  yes no have we got to hide ourselves has it come to that already oh i hate myself       arthur comes in  violet  brightly youre very gay this afternoon arthur one doesnt often hear you whistle  arthur  dyou think its unbecoming to my years or to my dignity  violet  shall i give you a cup of tea  arthur  to tell you the honest truth that is what i came here for  violet  and i was flattering myself it was for the pleasure of my company  arthur  ronny will you find out if it would be convenient for the khedive to see me at eleven oclock tomorrow  ronny  very good sir       he goes out  violet  what have you to see the khedive aboutif it isnt a secret  arthur  not at all im merely going to place before him ronnys name  violet  then the matters not definitely settled yet  arthur  not formally ive not had the reply yet to my telegram to the foreign office and ive not had the khedives acceptance of my suggestion  violet  but supposing the foreign office say they think hed better go to paris after all  arthur  i think its most unlikely they know by now that the man on the spot is the best judge of the circumstances and ive accustomed them to giving me a free hand  violet  and you think the khedive will raise no objection  arthur  he knows ronny a little and likes him i think hell be delighted with my choice       there is a pause arthur drinks his tea there is no sign that      he is conscious of violets agitation she is tortured by      indecision  violet  arthur im sorry if i was cross just now about abdul said it was stupid of me to interfere with something that wasnt my business  arthur  oh my dear dont say that im sorry i couldnt do what you wanted  violet  i made myself needlessly disagreeable will you forgive me  arthur  darling dont reproach yourself thats more than i can bear theres nothing to forgive  violet  i owe so much to you i hate to think that i was horrid  arthur  you dont owe anything to me at all and youre incapable of being horrid       he seizes her hands and is about to kiss them when she draws      them abruptly away  violet  no dont kiss my hands  arthur  why not       he is surprised for an instant she is taken aback he looks at      her hands and she withdraws them as though he could see on them the      kisses which ronny a few minutes before had pressed on them  violet  with the faintest laugh of embarrassment if you want to kiss me i prefer you to kiss my cheeks  arthur  that is evidently what theyre made for       he does not attempt to kiss them she gives him a quick glance      and looks away  violet  arthur im afraid christina will be awfully disappointed at henrys not getting that job  arthur  let us hope she will bear her disappointment with as much fortitude as i do  violet  i dont think shes entirely given up hope that you will change your mind  arthur  with a chuckle im sure of that i dont expect to have much peace till the matter is officially settled that is why i mean to settle it quickly  violet  what is your objection to henry  arthur  none hes not such a good man as ronald parry thats all  violet  the last time there was a good job going henry just missed getting it  arthur  henry is one of those men who would do very well for a job if there werent always somebody just a little bit better applying at the same time  violet  christina thinks youre so anxious not to favour him because hes your nephew that you are positively biassed against him  arthur  christina like the majority of her sex has an unerring eye for the discreditable motive  violet  she blames me because you wont help henry she thinks its because im jealous of her  arthur  how exactly like her the best mother and the most unreasonable woman ive ever known  violet  forcing the words out it would be a great pleasure to me if you could change your mind and let henry have the post instead of ronald parry  arthur  oh my dear dont ask me to do that you know how i hate refusing to do anything you wish  violet  anne is so anxious that ronny should go to paris hes made all his preparations dont you think you might just as well let him go  arthur  im afraid i dont i want him here  violet  it would be such a joy to me if i could go and tell christina that youd consented it would make such a difference to me you see i want her to be fond of me and i know shed never forget if id been able to do her a good turn like that oh arthur wont you  arthur  darling im afraid i cant  violet  i promise ill never ask you anything again as long as i live if youll only do this for me it means so much to me you dont know how much  arthur  i cant violet  violet  wont you talk it over with anne  arthur  to tell you the truth i dont think its any business of hers  violet  hesitatingly is it due to her influence that ronald was appointed to paris  arthur  why  violet  i want to know if shes been pulling strings to get him moved i suppose its for some reason he was very comfortable here its not often you find a secretary who exactly suits you  arthur  well yes it was her doing she tells me she doesnt mean to come to egypt so much as in the past and wants her brother nearer to her  violet  if she wants to see much of her brother she let him choose rather an unfortunate profession i wonder she didnt tell you the truth  arthur  quickly im convinced she did i thought her explanation very natural im sorry its necessary for me to interfere with her plans  violet  im sure she wouldnt mind my telling you why shes so anxious ronny should leave egypt she thinks hes in love with a married woman and it seems desirable to get him away perhaps she didnt want to tell you i fancy shes been very uneasy about it  arthur  i daresay its only a momentary infatuation let us hope he will get over it quickly i cant lose a useful public servant because he happens to have formed an unfortunate attachment  violet  im afraid im not explaining myself very well ronny is desperately in love theres no other way of putting it you must let him go after all youre very fond of him youve known him since he was a small boy it isnt as though he were a stray young man sent you by the foreign office you cant be entirely indifferent to him perhaps his welfare is at stake dont you think its wiserits only kindto send him out of harms way  arthur  my dear you know that iarthur littlewould do anything to please you and that i care very much for the happiness of anne and the welfare of ronald parry but you see im an official too and the official cant do all sorts of things that the man would be very glad to  violet  how can you separate the official and the man the official cant do things that the man disapproves  arthur  ah thats a point that has been discussed ever since states came into being are the rules of private morality binding on the statesman in theory most of us answer yes but in practice very few act on that principle in this case darling it hardly applies i see no conflict between the man and the official  violet  you think it doesnt really concern you arthur  arthur  ive not said that but im not going to let an appeal to my emotions interfere with my judgment i think i understand the situation im not proposing to change my mind i shall present ronnys name to the khedive tomorrow  violet  dyou think me very stupid arthur  arthur  not at all darling only a clever woman could achieve your beauty  violet  then doesnt it occur to you that if ive made such a point of ronnys going it must be for some very good reason  arthur  with a quick look at her dont you think wed better leave that subject alone darling  violet  im afraid youll think it silly and vain of me to say so but i think you should know thatthat ronnys in love with me that is why i want him to go  arthur  its very natural that he should be in love with you im always surprised that everybody else isnt i dont see how i can prevent that except by taking you to live in the depths of the sahara  violet  dont make light of it arthur it wasnt very easy for me to tell you  arthur  how do you wish me to take it i cant blame ronald hes by way of being a gentleman ive been good to him hell make the best of a bad job  violet  dyou mean to say that it makes no difference to you  arthur  this secretaryship is a steppingstone to a very important position youre not going to ask me to rob him of it because hes done something so very natural as to fall in love with the most charming woman in egypt i imagine that all my secretaries will fall in love with you poor devils i dont see how they can be expected to help it  violet  you drive me mad its so serious its so tremendously serious and you have the heart to make little jokes about it  arthur  gravely has it ever struck you that flippancy is often the best way of dealing with a serious situation sometimes its really too serious to be taken seriously  violet  what do you mean by that  arthur  nothing very much i was excusing myself for my illtimed jests  violet  youre determined to keep ronny here  arthur  quite there is a pause arthur gets up and puts his hand on her shoulder i dont think theres anything more to say if you will forgive me i will get back to the office  violet  no dont go yet arthur theres something more i want to say to you  arthur  will you allow me to advise you not to its so easy to say too much its never unwise to say too little i beseech you not to say anything that we should both of us regret  violet  you think its unimportant if ronny loves me because you trust me implicitly  arthur  implicitly  violet  has it never occurred to you that i might be influenced by his love against my will do you think its so very safe  arthur  if i allowed any doubt on that matter to enter my head i should surely be quite unworthy of your affection  violet  arthur i dont want to have any secrets from you  arthur  trying to stop her dont violet i dont want you to go on  violet  i must now  arthur  oh my dear dont you see that things said can never be taken back we may both know something  violet  interrupting what do you mean  arthur  but so long as we dont tell one another we can ignore it if certain words pass our lips then the situation is entirely changed  violet  youre frightening me  arthur  i dont wish to do that only you can tell me nothing that i dont know but if you tell me you may do irreparable harm  violet  dyou mean to say you know oh its impossible arthur arthur i cant help it i must tell you it burns my heart i love ronny with all my body and soul       there is a pause while they look at one another  arthur  did you think i didnt know  violet  then why did you offer him the job  arthur  i had to  violet  no one could have blamed you if you had suggested henry  arthur  my dear im paid a very considerable salary it would surely be taking money under false pretences if i didnt do my work to the best of my ability  violet  it may mean happiness or misery to all three of us  arthur  i must take the risk of that you see ronny is cut out for this particular position its only common honesty to give it him  violet  dont you love me any more  arthur  dont ask me that violet you know i love you with all my heart  violet  then i cant understand  arthur  you dont think i want him to stay do you when the telegram came from the foreign office ordering him to paris my middleaged heart simply leapt for joy do you think i didnt see all the advantages he had over me he seemed to have so much to offer you and i so little  violet  oh arthur  arthur  but if he went away i thought presently youd forget him i thought if i were very kind to you and tolerant and if i asked nothing more from you than you were prepared to give i might in time make you feel towards me not love perhaps but tenderness and affection that was all i could hope for but that would have made me very happy then the khedive asked for an english secretary and i knew ronny was the only man for it you see ive been at this work so long the official in me makes decisions almost mechanically  violet  and supposing they break the heart of the man in you  arthur  smiling by a merciful interposition of providence we all seem to have just enough strength to bear the burdens that are placed on us  violet  dyou think so  arthur  you like the rest of us violet  violet  how long have you known i loved him  arthur  always i think perhaps i knew before you did  violet  why didnt you do something  arthur  will you tell me what there was to do  violet  arent you angry with us  arthur  i should be a fool to be that it seems to me so natural so horribly natural hes young and nicelooking and cheery it seems to me now inevitable that you should have fallen in love with him you might be made for one another  violet  oh do you see that  arthur  it had struck you too had it i suppose its obvious to anyone who takes the trouble to think about it she does not answer havent you wished with all your heart that youd met him first dont you hate me now because i married you she looks away my dear child im so sorry for you ive been very grateful for your kindness to me during the last month or two ive seen you try to be loving to me and affectionate ive been so anxious to tell you not to force yourself because i understood and you mustnt be unhappy about me but i didnt know how i could only make myself as little troublesome as possible  violet  youve been immensely good to me arthur  arthur  thats the least you had a right to expect of me i did you a great wrong in marrying you i knew you didnt love me you were dazzled by the circumstances you didnt know what marriage was and how irksome it must be unless love makes its constraints sweeter than freedom but i adored you i thought love would come with all my heart i ask you to forgive me  violet  oh arthur dont talk like that you know i was so happy to marry you i thought you wonderful i was so excited and flatteredi thought that was love i never knew that love would come like this if id only known what to expect i could have fought against it it took me unawares i never had a chance it wasnt my fault arthur  arthur  im not blaming you darling  violet  it would be easier for me if you did  arthur  its just bad luck bad luck i might have expected it  violet  still im glad ive told you i hated having a secret from you its better that we should be frank with one another  arthur  if i can help you in any way im glad too that youve told me  violet  what is to be done  arthur  theres nothing to be done  violet  arthur until today ronny and i have never exchanged a word that anyone might not have heard i was happy to be with him i knew he liked me i was quite satisfied with that but when i heard that he was going away suddenly everything was changed i felt i couldnt bear to let him go oh im so ashamed arthur  arthur  dear child  violet  i dont know how it happened he told me he loved me he didnt mean to dont think hes been disloyal to you arthur we were both so upset it was just as much my fault as his i couldnt help letting him see how much he meant to me we thought we were never going to see one another again he took me in his arms and held me in them i was so happy and so miserable i never thought life could mean so much  arthur  and just now when you were alone he kissed your hands  violet  how do you know  arthur  when i wanted to kiss them you withdrew them you couldnt bear that i should touch them you felt on them still the pressure of his lips  violet  i couldnt help it he was beside himself with joy because he neednt go i dont want to love him arthur i want to love you ive tried so desperately hard  arthur  my dear one either loves or one doesnt im afraid trying doesnt do much good  violet  if he stays here i shall have to see him constantly i shant have a chance to get over it oh i cant i cant its intolerable have pity on me  arthur  im afraid youll be very unhappy but you see something more than your happiness is at stake a little while ago you said you wanted to do more for your country than you did does it strike you that you can do something for it now  violet  i  arthur  we all want to do great and heroic things but generally we can only do very modest ones dyou think we ought to shirk them  violet  i dont understand  arthur  ronny can be of infinite value here you cant help your feelings for him i cant bring myself to blame you but you are mistress of your words and your actions what are we to do you wouldnt wish me to resign when my work here is but half done we must make the best of the position remember that all of us here you more than most women because youre my wife work for the common cause by our lives and the example we set at all costs we must seem honest straightforward and without reproach and one finds by experience that its much less trouble to be a thing than only to seem it theres only one way in which we can avoid reproach and that is by being irreproachable  violet  you mean that its necessary for the country that ronny and you should stay here and if my heart breaks it doesnt matter i thought i was doing so much in asking you to send him away dont you know that with all my heart i wanted him to stay dyou know what i feel arthur i cant think of anything else im obsessed by a hungry longing for him till today i could have borne it but now  i feel his arms about me every moment and his kisses on my lips you cant know the rapture and the torture and the ecstasy that consume me  arthur  oh my dear do you think i dont know what love is  violet  i want to do the right thing arthur but you mustnt ask too much of me if ive got to treat him as a casual friend i cant go on seeing him i cant arthur i cant if he must stay then let me go  arthur  never i think even if it werent necessary i should make him stay now you and i are not people to run away from danger after all were not obliged to yield to our passionswe can control them if we want to for your own sake you must stay violet  violet  and if i break i break  arthur  its only the worthless who are broken by unhappiness if you have faith and courage and honesty unhappiness can only make you stronger  violet  have you thought of yourself arthur what will you feel when you see him with me what will you suspect when youre working in your office and dont know where i am  arthur  i shall know that you are unhappy and i shall feel the most tender compassion for you  violet  youre exposing me to a temptation that i want with all my heart to yield to what is there to hold me back only the thought that i must do my duty to you what is there to reward me only the idea that perhaps im doing a little something for the country  arthur  i put myself in your hands violet i shall never suspect that you can do anything not that i should reproach you fori will never reproach youbut that you may reproach yourself for  a pause  violet  just now when we were talking of abdul said i asked if you could do your duty when it was a matter that affected you if it meant misery or happiness to you i said  arthur  my dear duty is rather a forbidding word let us say that iwant to earn my screw  violet  you must have thought me very silly i said i hoped youd never be put to the test and the test had come already and you never hesitated  arthur  these things are very much a matter of habit you know  violet  what you can do i can do too arthurif you believe in me  arthur  of course i believe in you  violet  then let him stay ill do what i can       ronny comes in  ronny  the khedive was engaged when i rang up but i left the message and the answer has just come through he will be pleased to see you sir at eleven oclock  arthur  that will do admirably ronny must lunch with us tomorrow violet well crack a bottle to celebrate his step  end of the second act     act iii        the scene shows part of the garden and a verandah at the consular      agents house coloured lanterns are fixed here and there it is      night and in the distance is seen the blue sky bespangled with      stars at the lack of the verandah are the windows of the house      gaily lit within a band is heard playing dancemusic violet is      giving a dance everyone who appears is magnificently gowned      violet is wearing all her pearls and diamonds arthur has across      his shirt front the broad riband of an order it is the end of the      evening various people are sealed on the verandah enjoying the      coolness they are mr and mrs appleby christina and arthur  appleby  well my dear i think its about time i was taking you back to your hotel  arthur  oh nonsense its when everybody has gone that a dance really begins to get amusing  christina  thats a pleasant remark to make to your guests  mrs appleby  im really ashamed to have stayed like this to the bitter end but i do love to see the young folk enjoying themselves  arthur  ah you have learnt how to make the most of advancing years the solace of old age is to take pleasure in the youth of those who come after us  christina  i dont think youre very polite arthur  mrs appleby  bless your heart i know im not so young as i was  arthur  do you mind  mrs appleby  me why should i ive had my day and ive enjoyed it its only fair to give others a chance now  christina  im sure you enjoyed your trip up the nile  mrs appleby  oh we had a wonderful time  arthur  and what conclusions did you come to mr appleby i remember that you were looking for instruction as well as amusement  appleby  i didnt forget what you told me i just kept my ears open and my mouth shut  arthur  a capital practice not much favoured by democratic communities  appleby  but i came to one very definite conclusion for all that  arthur  what was it  appleby  in fact i came to two  arthur  thats not so satisfactoryunless they contradicted one another in which case i venture to suggest that you have grasped at all events the elements of the egyptian problem  appleby  the first is that youre the right man in the right place  arthur  christina would never admit that she has known for many years that she could manage egypt far better than i do  christina  i dont deny that for a minute i think on the whole women are more levelheaded than men theyre not swayed by emotion theyre more practical they know that principle must often yield to expediency and they can do the expedient without surrendering the principle  arthur  you make my head whirl christina  appleby  i had the opportunity of seeing a good many different sorts of people i never heard a reasonable complaint against you some of them didnt like you personally but they looked up to you and they believed in you i asked myself how you managed it  mrs appleby  i told him that its because youre human  arthur  christina thinks it very bad for me to hear pleasant things said of me  christina  christina doesnt know what her brother would do if he hadnt got an affectionate sister to gibe at  appleby  it must be a great satisfaction to you to see the country becoming every year more prosperous and contented  arthur  what was the second conclusion you came to  appleby  im coming to that most of us are torn asunder as it were by a conflict of duties this and that urgently needs to be done and if you put one thing right you put something else wrong we all want to do for the best but we dont exactly know what the best is now youve got your duty clearly marked out before you if you take my meaning youre young  arthur  youngish  appleby  youve made a success of your job and of your life its not all of us who can say that my second conclusion is that you must be the happiest man alive  mrs appleby  im glad hes got that off his chest hes been dinning it into my ears for the last ten days my impression is that he fell in love with lady little that day he lunched here six weeks ago  arthur  im not going to blame him for that everybody does it was a wise old fellow who said that you must count no man happy till hes dead christina gives him a look and puts her hand affectionately on his arm he quickly withdraws it here is violet       she comes in on henry pritchards arm and sinks into a chair  violet  im absolutely exhausted i feel that in another minute my legs will drop off  arthur  do take care darling that would be so disfiguring  violet  oh id still dance on the stumps  arthur  when are you going to send that unfortunate band away  violet  oh we must have one more dance after all its our last ball of the season and now that everyone has gone i neednt be dignified any more theres no one but henry and anne and ronny weve just had a gorgeous onestep havent we henry  henry  gorgeous youre a ripping dancer  violet  my one accomplishment the band is heard beginning a waltz good heavens theyve started again thats anne im positive shes been playing the british matron too and now shes having her fling  arthur  you girls you never grow up  henry  are you ready for another turn violet  arthur  dont dance any more darling you look worn out  violet  supposing you danced with your mother henry i can see her toes itching inside her black satin slippers  christina  nonsense i havent danced for fifteen years  henry  come on mother just to show them you know how       he seizes her hand and drags her to her feet  christina  i was just as good a dancer as anybody else in my day  arthur  when christina says that she means she was a great deal better  henry  come on mother or itll be over before we begin  christina  dont be rough with me henry       they go into the house  appleby  we rather fancied ourselves too fanny once upon a time what dyou say to trying what we can do my dear  mrs appleby  you be quiet george fancy me dancing with my figure  appleby  i dont deny youre plump but i never did like a scrag perhaps its the last chance we shall ever have  mrs appleby  what would they say at home if they ever come to hear you and me had been dancing really george im surprised at you  arthur  amused i wont tell  appleby  you know you want to fanny youre only afraid theyll laugh come on or else i shall dance by myself  mrs appleby  getting up i see youve quite made up your mind to make a fool of yourself       they go out arthur watches them smiling  arthur  what good people its really a treat to see them together  violet  mr appleby is very enthusiastic about you he was telling me just now about his trip in upper egypt hes tremendously impressed he said i ought to be very proud of you  arthur  i cant imagine any remark more calculated to make you dislike me       she gives him a long look and then glances away when she speaks      it is with embarrassment  violet  are you satisfied with me arthur  arthur  my dear what do you mean  violet  since that afternoon when i told you  arthur  yes i know  violet  weve never talked about it giving him her hand i want to thank you for having been so good to me  arthur  im afraid you havent got much to thank me for it would have been easier if id been able to help you but i didnt see anything i could do but just sit still and twiddle my thumbs  violet  ive felt your confidence in me and that has been a help youve never given the slightest sign that anything was changed you used sometimes to ask me what id been doing during the day of late you havent even done that  arthur  i didnt want you to suspect for a moment that your actions were not perfectly free  violet  i know no one could have been more considerate than youve been oh ive been so unhappy arthur i wouldnt go through the last six weeks for anything in the world  arthur  its torn my heart to see you so pale and wan and when often i saw youd been crying i almost lost my head i didnt know what to do  violet  i couldnt help it if i loved him arthur that wasnt in my power but all that was in my power ive done somehow ive managed not to be alone with him  arthur  havent you had any explanation with him  violet  there didnt seem to be anything to explain dyou think i ought to have told him i didnt love him i couldnt arthur i couldnt  arthur  my dear my dear  violet  once or twice he wrote to me i knew he would and id made up my mind not to read the letters but when they came i couldnt help myself i had to read them i was so wretched and it meant so much to me that he loved me arthur makes an instinctive movement of pain i didnt mean to say that please forgive me  arthur  i think i understand  violet  i didnt answer them  arthur  did he only write once or twice  violet  thats all you see he cant make it out he thinks ive treated him badly oh i think thats the hardest thing of all ive seen the misery in his eyes and there was nothing i could do i hadnt the courage to tell him im weak im so horribly weak and when im with him alone i oh it is cruel that i should make him suffer so when he loves me  arthur  i dont know what to say to you it seems cold comfort to say that you must set your hope in the merciful effects of time time will ease your pain and his perhaps the worst is over already  violet  i hope with all my heart it is i couldnt have borne any more arthur im at the end of my strength  arthur  dear heart youre tired physically now well send these people away and you must go to bed  violet  yes im exhausted but i want to tell you arthur i think youre right the worst is over im not suffering quite so much as i did i find it a little easier not to think of him when i meet him i can manage to be gay and flippant and indifferent im so glad arthur  arthur  youve been very brave i told you we were all strong enough to bear the burdens that are laid upon us  violet  you mustnt think too well of me i couldnt have done what i have except for the consciousness of his great love for me is that awfully disloyal of me arthur  arthur  gravely no darling  violet  you can understand cant you it means so much to me its helped me more than anything else in the world its the only thing that made these past weeks not intolerable im satisfied to know he loves me i want nothing more       mr and mrs appleby come in arthur immediately assumes a      chaffing manner  arthur  why whats this you havent given in already  appleby  the spirit is willing enough but the flesh is weak  mrs appleby  we wouldnt like it talked about at home but the fact is we got a bit out of breath  violet  well sit down a moment and rest yourself  mrs appleby  just a moment if you dont mind and then well be going       christina appears with henry  arthur  here is poor christina in a state of complete mental and physical collapse  christina  dont be ridiculous arthur  arthur  how did you get on  henry  first rate only mother wont let herself go i kept on telling her theres only one thing to do in modern dancinglet all your bones go loose and leave the man to do the rest  christina  with a chuckle i think modern dancing is an abandoned pastime nothing will induce me to let all my bones go loose  henry  mothers idea of dancing is to keep herself to herself  christina  looking at him affectionately youre an impudent boy  mrs appleby  to violet i do wish id seen you dancing with mr parry hes a wonderful dancer  violet  he does dance well doesnt he  henry  havent you danced with him tonight violet  violet  no he came rather late and my card was filled up i promised him an extra but some stuffy old diplomatist came and asked me for a dance so i gave him ronnys  mrs appleby  its too bad it must be a rare sight to see you and mr parry waltzing together  violet  how do you know he dances so well  mrs appleby  there were two or three dances at our hotel last week and we saw him then  violet  oh i see  appleby  with a chuckle i like that young man when he gets hold of a good thing he freezes on to it  violet  oh  appleby  theres a young american girl staying at the hotel shes a miss pender i wonder if you know her  violet  no i dont think so we get to know very few of the winter visitors  mrs appleby  shes a perfect picture to look at and a beautiful dancer  appleby  everyone was looking at them last night they made a wonderful pair  violet  do you know this lady henry  henry  yes ive met her two or three times shes very pretty  appleby  i dont think anyone else had much of a look in with her  henry  well you neednt be disagreeable about it  appleby  as far as i could see she danced with mr parry pretty well all the time  mrs appleby  it was a treat to see them together  violet  a little uncertainly if one gets hold of a partner who suits one i always think its better to stick to him  mrs appleby  oh i dont think it was only that shes so much in love with him that she cant help showing it  henry  i never saw such a fellow as ronny when there is a bit of luck going he always gets it  violet  and is he in love with her too  appleby  oh one cant tell that  mrs appleby  if he isnt he very soon will be shes too pretty for any man to resist long  arthur  lightly you know them the brutes dont you  mrs appleby  bless their hearts i dont blame them what are pretty girls for except to make nice men happy i was a pretty girl myself once  arthur  and was mr appleby a nice man  appleby  i think i must have been for youve certainly made me happy my dear  mrs appleby  i wish youd put that in writing george id like to have a little something like that by me when youve got a bit of a chill on your liver  appleby  hm i think beds the place for you fanny say goodnight to her ladyship and lets be going  mrs appleby  goodnight lady little and thank you so much for asking us we have enjoyed ourselves  violet  goodnight  appleby  goodnight  arthur  i hope youll have a pleasant journey home lucky people youll see the spring in england when you get back the hedgerows will be just bursting into leaf       the applebys go out  violet  how old is this american girl henry  henry  oh i dont know about nineteen or twenty  violet  is she as pretty as they say  henry  rather  violet  is she fair  henry  very shes got wonderful hair  violet  youve never mentioned her do you think ronny is in love with her  henry  oh i dont know about that shes great fun and you know its always flattering when a pretty girl makes a dead set at you       there is a momentary silence violet is extremely disturbed by      the news that has just reached her arthur realises that a crisis      has come  christina  in a matteroffact way let us hope that something will come of it theres no reason why ronny shouldnt marry i think men marry much too late nowadays       anne and ronny appear  anne  im absolutely ashamed of myself i half expected to find youd all gone to bed  violet  smiling have you been having a jolly dance  anne  think of having a good band and the whole floor to oneself by the way violet the band want to know if they can go away  violet  im sorry i had to cut your dance ronny  ronny  it was rotten luck but i suppose on these occasions small fry like me have to put up with that sort of thing  violet  if you like well have a turn now before we send the band away  ronny  id love it       arthur gives a little start and looks at violet curiously      anne is surprised too  christina  if youre going to start dancing again well go henry has to be at his office early in the morning  violet  goodnight then  christina  kissing her your dance has been a great success  violet  its nice of you to say so  christina  to arthur goodnight dear old thing god bless and guard you always  arthur  my dear christina why this embarrassing emotion  christina  i dont know what we should do if anything happened to you  arthur  dont be an idiot my dear nothing is going to happen to me  christina  with a smile i cant get you out of thinking me a perfect fool  arthur  be off with you christina if you go on finding out things that are not your business i shall have you deported  violet  what has she found out now  arthur  a trifle that we thought it wouldnt hurt the public to know nothing about  christina  shaking hands with ronny i dont grudge you your job any more were all under a debt of gratitude to you  ronny  i had a bit of luck thats all its nothing to make a fuss about  arthur  go and have your dance darling its really getting very late  violet  to ronny are you ready  ronny  what shall we make them play       they go out  christina  goodnight anne  anne  kissing her goodnight my dear henry shakes hands with anne and arthur he and his mother go out i suppose i maynt ask what christina was referring to  arthur  i cant prevent you from asking  anne  but you have no intention of answering what is the matter arthur you look so deadly white  arthur  nothing im tired i had a busy day and now the dance the sound of a waltz is heard oh damn that music  anne  sit down and rest yourself why dont you have a smoke putting her hand on his arm my dear friend  arthur  for gods sake dont pity me  anne  wont you talk to me frankly i may be able to help you in the old days you used to bring your troubles to me arthur  arthur  i tell you im only tired what is the use of talking about what cant be helped  anne  you must know that i notice most things that concern your happiness looking away why did you imagine i took so much trouble to get ronny moved to paris  arthur  i suspected ought i to thank you im too miserable and too humiliated  anne  have you heard about a miss pender shes an american girl  arthur  of course i have its my business to know everything that goes on in cairo  anne  dont you think that may be the solution       henry comes in  arthur  sharply what dyou want  henry  i beg your pardon mother left her fan here       he takes it up from a chair  arthur  i thought youd gone five minutes ago  henry  oh we just stood for a moment to look at ronny and violet dancing upon my soul its a fair treat  arthur  they make a wonderful couple dont they  henry  im afraid violets awfully tired shes not saying a word and shes as white as a sheet  arthur  ill send her to bed as soon as theyve finished  henry  goodnight  arthur  smiling goodnight my boy       exit henry  anne  is anything the matter  arthur  tell me about this american girl shes in love with ronny isnt she  anne  yes thats obvious  arthur  and he  anne  hes been very unhappy you know  arthur  almost savagely that is a calamity which i find myself able to bear with patience  anne  and now hes surprised and pleased ive met her poor dear she did everything to make me like her because ronny was my brother shes awfully pretty hes not in love with her yet but i think he may be hes on the brink and if there were nothing else hed fall over  arthur  that is what i suspected you know anne the longer i live the more inexplicable i find human beings i always thought i was by way of being a fairly decent fellow i never knew what mean beastliness there was inside me it would be quite impossible for me to tell you how i hate your brother ive had to be jolly and affable with him and by george i wanted to kill him  anne  why didnt you let him go are you sure it was necessary to give him that job  arthur  already hes been invaluable  anne  then one can only hope for the best       there is a moments pause when arthur speaks it is at first      rather to himself than to anne  arthur  no one knows what ive gone through during the last few months ive been devoured with jealousy and i knew it would be fatal if i showed violet the least trace of illtemper i kept on saying to myself that it wasnt her fault if she was in love with ronny humorously you cant think how devilish hard it is not to resent the fact that somebody doesnt care for you  anne  with a chuckle oh yes i can  arthur  i knew that almost everything depended on how i acted during these weeks and the maddening thing was that i could do nothing but sit still and control myself i saw her miserable and knew that she didnt want my comfort ive yearned to take her in my arms and ive known shed let me because it was her duty those dear good donkeys the applebys told me just now they thought i must be the happiest man alive week after week with an aching heart ive forced myself to be gay and amusing dyou think im amusing anne  anne  sometimes  arthur  the battle has been so unfair all the dice are loaded against me he has every advantage over me but at last i thought id won i thought violet was getting more resigned she told me herself just now that the worst was over and those confounded people must go and upset the applecart damn their eyes  anne  why  arthur  the applebys told her about miss pender it was very natural they knew no reason for not repeating the hotel gossip  anne  was that why she asked ronny to dance with her  arthur  yes its the crisis she had the strength to keep him at arms length when she knew he loved her what will she do now  anne  you heard what henry said they dont seem to be talking to one another  arthur  no  anne  why did you let them dance together you might easily have said it was too late and the band must go  arthur  what good would that do no ive done nothing to prevent their meeting ive left them absolute liberty  anne  do you think its fair to violet you know women act so much on impulse the surroundings and the circumstances have so much influence on them think of the excitement of dancing the magic of this wonderful night and the solitude under these stars you complain the dice are loaded against you but now youre doubleloading them against yourself  arthur  it tortures me but i must give them the opportunity to fight the matter out for themselves  anne  poor child shes so young  arthur  too young  anne  dont say that it sounds as though you regretted having married her  arthur  dont you imagine that regret has been tormenting her ever since she found out what love really was even though i love her with all my heart i know now that i made a mistake do you think you can make anyone love you by constant tenderness devotion and kindness  anne  not a man perhaps but a woman yes yes yes  arthur  whoever loved that loved not at first sight i want so tremendously to make her happy and ive only made her utterly miserable and theres no way out its a pity that a convenient attack of brain fever cant carry me off but im as strong as a horse  anne  you know arthur theres one compensation about the pains of love while ones suffering from them one feels one will never get over them but one does and when theyre gone they dont even leave a scar one looks back and remembers ones torment and marvels that it was possible to suffer like that  arthur  you talk as though youd had experience  anne  i have  arthur  i always look upon you as so calm and selfcontrolled  anne  i was desperately in love for years with a man i should have made him an excellent wife although its i as says it but it never occurred to him for an instant that my feelings were more than friendly and eventually he married somebody else  arthur  my dear friend i hate to think of your being unhappy  anne  im not thats why i told you the tragic story ive got over it so completely that now i have an equal affection both for him and his wife  arthur  dyou know anne at one time i very nearly asked you to marry me  anne  gaily oh what nonsense  arthur  i daresay its as well i didnt i should have lost the best friend ive ever had  anne  on the other hand ive lost the satisfaction of refusing the most distinguished man of our day why didnt you ask me  arthur  you were such an awfully good friend i thought we were very well as we were  anne  that isnt the reason arthur you didnt ask me because you didnt love me if you had youd have let friendship go hang seeing that he is not paying any attention to her whats the matter  arthur  the music has stopped  anne  with a slight tightening of the lips im afraid my concerns dont interest you very much i was only talking about them to distract you  arthur  forgive me but ive got this anguish gnawing at my heart anne when they come back here i want you to come with me for a stroll in the garden  anne  why im frightfully tired i think i shall go to bed  arthur  no do this for me anne i want to give them their chance it may be the last chance for all of us  anne  with a little sigh very well ill do even that for you  arthur  you are a good friend and im a selfish beast  anne  i wish you could have a child arthur that might settle everything  arthur  that is what i look forward to with all my heart i think she might love her babys father  anne  then shell realise that only you could have been so tolerant and so immensely patient when she looks back shell be filled with gratitude       ronny and violet come in  violet  ive told the band they can go  arthur  i dont suppose they wanted telling twice did you have a pleasant dance  violet  i was very tired  ronny  it was brutal of me to make you dance so long ill say goodnight before im turned out  arthur  oh wont you sit down and have a cigarette before you go anne and i were just going to stroll to the end of the garden to have a look at the nile  violet  oh  anne  im too restless to go to bed just yet       arthur and anne go out violet and ronny do not speak for a      moment at first the conversation is quite light  violet  what was it that christina was referring to just now had it anything to do with you  ronny  i dont think im justified in telling you about it if sir arthur thinks you should know i daresay hed rather tell you himself  violet  of course you mustnt tell me if its a secret  ronny  id almost forgotten what a beautiful dancer you were  violet  with a smile so soon  ronny  you havent given me much chance of dancing with you during the last few weeks  violet  i hear theres a girl at the ghezireh palace who dances very well miss pender isnt that her name  ronny  yes shes wonderful  violet  im told shes charming  ronny  very  violet  i should like to meet her i wonder whom i know that could bring us together  ronny  with a change of tone why do you speak of her  violet  is there any reason why i shouldnt  ronny  do you know that this is the first time ive been quite alone with you for six weeks  violet  still quite lightly it was inevitable that when you ceased being arthurs private secretary we should see less of one another  ronny  i only welcomed my new job because i thought i shouldnt be utterly parted from you  violet  dont you think it was better that we shouldnt see too much of one another  ronny  what have i done to you violet why have you been treating me like this  violet  im not conscious that ive treated you differently from what i used  ronny  why didnt you answer my letters  violet  in a low voice i hadnt anything to say  ronny  i wonder if you can imagine what i went through the eagerness with which i looked forward to a letter from you just a word or two would have satisfied me how anxiously i expected each post and my despair when day after day went by  violet  you ought not to have written to me  ronny  dyou think i could help myself have you forgotten that day when we thought we were never going to meet again if you wanted me to be nothing more than a friend why did you tell me you loved me why did you let me kiss you and hold you in my arms  violet  you know quite well i lost my head i was foolish youyou attached too much importance to the emotion of the moment  ronny  oh violet how can you say that i know you loved me then after all the past cant be undone i loved you i know you loved me we couldnt go back to the time when we were no more than friends  violet  you forget that arthur is my husband and you owe him everything in the world we both owe him everything in the world  ronny  no i dont forget it for a moment after all were straight both of us and we could have trusted ourselves i wanted nothing but to be allowed to love you and to know that you loved me  violet  do you remember what you said in the first letter you wrote me  ronny  oh you cant blame me for that id loved you so long so passionately id never dared to hope that you cared for me and when i knew i never said a tenth part of what i wanted to i went home and i just wrote all that had filled my heart to overflowing i wanted you to know how humbly grateful i was for the wonderful happiness youd given me i wanted you to know that my soul to its most hidden corners was yours for ever  violet  how could i answer it  ronny  you neednt have been afraid of me violet if it displeased you i would never even have told you that i loved you i would have carried you in my heart like an image of the blessed virgin when we met here or there though there were a thousand people between us and we never exchanged a word i should have known that we were the only people in the world and that somehow in some strange mystic fashion i belonged to you and you belonged to me oh violet i only wanted a little kindness was it so much to ask       violet is moved to the very depths of her heart she can scarcely      control herself the pain she suffers seems unendurable her throat      is so dry that she can hardly speak  violet  they say that miss pender is in love with you is it true  ronny  a mans generally a conceited ass when he thinks girls are in love with him  violet  never mind that is it true please be frank with me  ronny  perhaps it is  violet  would she marry you if you asked her  ronny  i think so  violet  she cant have fallen in love with you without some encouragement  ronny  she plays tennis a good deal and shes very fond of dancing you know i was rather wretched sometimes you looked at me as though you hated me you seemed to try and avoid me i wanted to forget i didnt know what id done to make you treat me so cruelly it was very pleasant to be with someone who seemed to want me everything i did pleased her shes rather like you when i was with her i was a little less unhappy when i found she was in love with me i was touched and i was tremendously grateful  violet  are you sure youre not in love with her  ronny  yes im quite sure  violet  but you like her very much dont you  ronny  yes very much  violet  dont you think if it werent for me you would be in love with her  ronny  i dont know  violet  id like you to be frank with me  ronny  unwillingly you dont want my love shes sweet and kind and tender  violet  i think she might make you very happy  ronny  who knows       there is a pause violet forces herself to make the final      renunciation her fingers move spasmodically in the effort she      makes to speak calmly  violet  it seems a pity that you should waste your life for nothing im afraid youll think me a heartless flirt im not that at the time i feel all i say but  i dont quite understand myself i take a violent fancy to someone and i lose my head but somehow it doesnt last i  i suppose im not capable of any enduring passion there are people like that arent there it goes just as suddenly as it comes and when it goeswell its gone for ever i cant understand then what on earth i saw in the man who made my heart go pitapat im dreadfully sorry i caused you so much pain you took it so much more seriously than i expected and afterwards i didnt know what to do you mustyou must try to forgive me       there is a long pause  ronny  dont you love me at all now  violet  its much better that i should tell you the truth isnt it even at the risk of hurting your feelings im frightfully ashamed of myself im afraid youll think me awfully frivolous  ronny  why dont you say it right out  violet  dyou want me to she hesitates but then takes courage im very sorry dear ronny im afraid i dont care for you in that way at all  ronny  im glad to know  violet  youre not angry with me  ronny  oh no my dear how can you help it were made as were made dyou mind if i go now  violet  wont you stop and say goodnight to anne  ronny  no if you dont mind id like to go quickly  violet  very well and try to forgive me ronny  ronny  goodnight       he takes her hand and they look into one anothers eyes  violet  goodnight       he goes out violet clasps her hands to her heart as though to      ease its aching anne and arthur return  anne  where is ronny  violet  hes gone it was so late he asked me to say goodnight to you  anne  thank you it must be very late ill say goodnight too she bends down and kisses violet goodnight arthur  arthur  goodnight she goes out arthur sits down a sais comes in and turns out some of the lights in the distance is heard the wailing of an arab song arthur motions to the sais leave these ill turn them out myself the sais goes in and turns out all the lights in the lower rooms but one the light remains now only just round arthur and violet the arab song is like a wail of pain that sounds strangely after the waltzes and onesteps that weve heard this evening  violet  it seems to come from very far away  arthur  it seems to wail down the ages from an immeasurable past  violet  what does it say  arthur  i dont know it must be some old lament  violet  its heartrending  arthur  now it stops  violet  the garden is so silent it seems to be listening too  arthur  are you awfully unhappy violet  violet  awfully  arthur  it breaks my heart that i who would do anything in the world for you can do so little to console you  violet  had you any idea that ronny no longer cared for me  arthur  how should i know what his feelings were  violet  it never occurred to me that he could change i felt so secure in his love it never occurred to me that anyone could take him from me  arthur  did he tell you he didnt care for you any more  violet  no  arthur  i dont think hes in love with miss pender  violet  i told him that he meant nothing to me any more i told him that i took fancies and got over them i made him think i was a silly flirt and he believed me if he loved me truly truly as he did before whatever id said hed have known it was incredible oh i wouldnt have believed him if hed made himself cheap in my eyes  arthur  my poor child  violet  hes not in love with her yet i know that hes only pleased and flattered hes angry with me if hes angry he must love me still he asked so little it only needed a word and he would have loved me as much as ever what have i done what harm would it have done you ive sent him away now for good its all over and done with and my heart aches what shall i do arthur  arthur  my dear have courage i beseech you to have courage  violet  i suppose its shameful that we should have loved one another at all but how could we help it were masters of our actions but how can we command our feelings after all our feelings are our own i dont know what im going to do arthur it wasnt so bad till tonight i could control myself i thought my pain was growing less i long for him with all my soul and i must let him go oh i hate him i hate him if hed loved me he might have been faithful to me a few short weeks he wouldnt cause me such cruel pain  arthur  dont be unjust to him violet i think he fell in love with you without knowing what was happening to him and when he knew i think he struggled against it as honourably as you did you know that very little escapes me ive seen a sort of shyness in him when he was with me as though he were a little ashamed in my presence i even felt sorry for him because he felt he was behaving badly to me and he couldnt help himself hes suffered just as much as you have its not very strange that when this girl fell in love with him it should seem to offer a new hope he was unhappy and she comforted him anne says shes rather like you if ever he loves her perhaps it will be you that he loves in her  violet  why do you say all this to me  arthur  youve been so wretched i dont want bitterness to come to you now i cant bear that you should think your first love has been for someone not worthy of it i think time will heal the wounds which now you think are incurable but when it does i hope that you will look back on your love as a thing only of beauty  violet  i am a beast arthur i dont deserve anyone to be so good to me as you are  arthur  and theres something else i must tell you it appears that various enterprising people have been laying plans to put me out of the way  violet  startled arthur  arthur  i find that there was a plot to kill me this morning on my way to the review  violet  how awful  arthur  oh its nothing to be alarmed about weve settled everything without any fuss our old friend osman pasha is going to spend some time on his country estates for the good of his health and half a dozen foolish young men
