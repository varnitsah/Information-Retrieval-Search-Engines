3172268	the moonstone  a romance  by wilkie collins     prologue  the storming of seringapatam 1799   extracted from a family paper   i address these lineswritten in indiato my relatives in england  my object is to explain the motive which has induced me to refuse the right hand of friendship to my cousin john herncastle the reserve which i have hitherto maintained in this matter has been misinterpreted by members of my family whose good opinion i cannot consent to forfeit i request them to suspend their decision until they have read my narrative and i declare on my word of honour that what i am now about to write is strictly and literally the truth  the private difference between my cousin and me took its rise in a great public event in which we were both concernedthe storming of seringapatam under general baird on the 4th of may 1799  in order that the circumstances may be clearly understood i must revert for a moment to the period before the assault and to the stories current in our camp of the treasure in jewels and gold stored up in the palace of seringapatam    ii   one of the wildest of these stories related to a yellow diamonda famous gem in the native annals of india  the earliest known traditions describe the stone as having been set in the forehead of the fourhanded indian god who typifies the moon partly from its peculiar colour partly from a superstition which represented it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned and growing and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the moon it first gained the name by which it continues to be known in india to this daythe name of the moonstone a similar superstition was once prevalent as i have heard in ancient greece and rome not applying however as in india to a diamond devoted to the service of a god but to a semitransparent stone of the inferior order of gems supposed to be affected by the lunar influencesthe moon in this latter case also giving the name by which the stone is still known to collectors in our own time  the adventures of the yellow diamond begin with the eleventh century of the christian era  at that date the mohammedan conqueror mahmoud of ghizni crossed india seized on the holy city of somnauth and stripped of its treasures the famous temple which had stood for centuriesthe shrine of hindoo pilgrimage and the wonder of the eastern world  of all the deities worshipped in the temple the moongod alone escaped the rapacity of the conquering mohammedans preserved by three brahmins the inviolate deity bearing the yellow diamond in its forehead was removed by night and was transported to the second of the sacred cities of indiathe city of benares  here in a new shrinein a hall inlaid with precious stones under a roof supported by pillars of goldthe moongod was set up and worshipped here on the night when the shrine was completed vishnu the preserver appeared to the three brahmins in a dream  the deity breathed the breath of his divinity on the diamond in the forehead of the god and the brahmins knelt and hid their faces in their robes the deity commanded that the moonstone should be watched from that time forth by three priests in turn night and day to the end of the generations of men and the brahmins heard and bowed before his will the deity predicted certain disaster to the presumptuous mortal who laid hands on the sacred gem and to all of his house and name who received it after him and the brahmins caused the prophecy to be written over the gates of the shrine in letters of gold  one age followed anotherand still generation after generation the successors of the three brahmins watched their priceless moonstone night and day one age followed another until the first years of the eighteenth christian century saw the reign of aurungzebe emperor of the moguls at his command havoc and rapine were let loose once more among the temples of the worship of brahmah the shrine of the fourhanded god was polluted by the slaughter of sacred animals the images of the deities were broken in pieces and the moonstone was seized by an officer of rank in the army of aurungzebe  powerless to recover their lost treasure by open force the three guardian priests followed and watched it in disguise the generations succeeded each other the warrior who had committed the sacrilege perished miserably the moonstone passed carrying its curse with it from one lawless mohammedan hand to another and still through all chances and changes the successors of the three guardian priests kept their watch waiting the day when the will of vishnu the preserver should restore to them their sacred gem time rolled on from the first to the last years of the eighteenth christian century the diamond fell into the possession of tippoo sultan of seringapatam who caused it to be placed as an ornament in the handle of a dagger and who commanded it to be kept among the choicest treasures of his armoury even thenin the palace of the sultan himselfthe three guardian priests still kept their watch in secret there were three officers of tippoos household strangers to the rest who had won their masters confidence by conforming or appearing to conform to the mussulman faith and to those three men report pointed as the three priests in disguise    iii   so as told in our camp ran the fanciful story of the moonstone it made no serious impression on any of us except my cousinwhose love of the marvellous induced him to believe it on the night before the assault on seringapatam he was absurdly angry with me and with others for treating the whole thing as a fable a foolish wrangle followed and herncastles unlucky temper got the better of him he declared in his boastful way that we should see the diamond on his finger if the english army took seringapatam the sally was saluted by a roar of laughter and there as we all thought that night the thing ended  let me now take you on to the day of the assault my cousin and i were separated at the outset i never saw him when we forded the river when we planted the english flag in the first breach when we crossed the ditch beyond and fighting every inch of our way entered the town it was only at dusk when the place was ours and after general baird himself had found the dead body of tippoo under a heap of the slain that herncastle and i met  we were each attached to a party sent out by the generals orders to prevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest the campfollowers committed deplorable excesses and worse still the soldiers found their way by a guarded door into the treasury of the palace and loaded themselves with gold and jewels it was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and i met to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers herncastles fiery temper had been as i could plainly see exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible slaughter through which we had passed he was very unfit in my opinion to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him  there was riot and confusion enough in the treasury but no violence that i saw the men if i may use such an expression disgraced themselves goodhumouredly all sorts of rough jests and catchwords were bandied about among them and the story of the diamond turned up again unexpectedly in the form of a mischievous joke whos got the moonstone was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the plundering as soon as it was stopped in one place to break out in another while i was still vainly trying to establish order i heard a frightful yelling on the other side of the courtyard and at once ran towards the cries in dread of finding some new outbreak of the pillage in that direction  i got to an open door and saw the bodies of two indians by their dress as i guessed officers of the palace lying across the entrance dead  a cry inside hurried me into a room which appeared to serve as an armoury a third indian mortally wounded was sinking at the feet of a man whose back was towards me the man turned at the instant when i came in and i saw john herncastle with a torch in one hand and a dagger dripping with blood in the other a stone set like a pommel in the end of the daggers handle flashed in the torchlight as he turned on me like a gleam of fire the dying indian sank to his knees pointed to the dagger in herncastles hand and said in his native languagethe moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours he spoke those words and fell dead on the floor  before i could stir in the matter the men who had followed me across the courtyard crowded in my cousin rushed to meet them like a madman clear the room he shouted to me and set a guard on the door the men fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his dagger i put two sentinels of my own company on whom i could rely to keep the door through the remainder of the night i saw no more of my cousin  early in the morning the plunder still going on general baird announced publicly by beat of drum that any thief detected in the fact be he whom he might should be hung the provostmarshal was in attendance to prove that the general was in earnest and in the throng that followed the proclamation herncastle and i met again  he held out his hand as usual and said good morning  i waited before i gave him my hand in return  tell me first i said how the indian in the armoury met his death and what those last words meant when he pointed to the dagger in your hand  the indian met his death as i suppose by a mortal wound said herncastle what his last words meant i know no more than you do  i looked at him narrowly his frenzy of the previous day had all calmed down i determined to give him another chance  is that all you have to tell me i asked  he answered that is all  i turned my back on him and we have not spoken since    iv   i beg it to be understood that what i write here about my cousin unless some necessity should arise for making it public is for the information of the family only herncastle has said nothing that can justify me in speaking to our commanding officer he has been taunted more than once about the diamond by those who recollect his angry outbreak before the assault but as may easily be imagined his own remembrance of the circumstances under which i surprised him in the armoury has been enough to keep him silent it is reported that he means to exchange into another regiment avowedly for the purpose of separating himself from me  whether this be true or not i cannot prevail upon myself to become his accuserand i think with good reason if i made the matter public i have no evidence but moral evidence to bring forward i have not only no proof that he killed the two men at the door i cannot even declare that he killed the third man insidefor i cannot say that my own eyes saw the deed committed it is true that i heard the dying indians words but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of delirium how could i contradict the assertion from my own knowledge let our relatives on either side form their own opinion on what i have written and decide for themselves whether the aversion i now feel towards this man is well or ill founded  although i attach no sort of credit to the fantastic indian legend of the gem i must acknowledge before i conclude that i am influenced by a certain superstition of my own in this matter it is my conviction or my delusion no matter which that crime brings its own fatality with it i am not only persuaded of herncastles guilt i am even fanciful enough to believe that he will live to regret it if he keeps the diamond and that others will live to regret taking it from him if he gives the diamond away     the story     first period  the loss of the diamond 1848   the events related by gabriel betteredge housesteward in the service of julia lady verinder    chapter i   in the first part of robinson crusoe at page one hundred and twentynine you will find it thus written  now i saw though too late the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost and before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it  only yesterday i opened my robinson crusoe at that place only this morning may twentyfirst eighteen hundred and fifty came my ladys nephew mr franklin blake and held a short conversation with me as follows  betteredge says mr franklin i have been to the lawyers about some family matters and among other things we have been talking of the loss of the indian diamond in my aunts house in yorkshire two years since mr bruff thinks as i think that the whole story ought in the interests of truth to be placed on record in writingand the sooner the better  not perceiving his drift yet and thinking it always desirable for the sake of peace and quietness to be on the lawyers side i said i thought so too mr franklin went on  in this matter of the diamond he said the characters of innocent people have suffered under suspicion alreadyas you know the memories of innocent people may suffer hereafter for want of a record of the facts to which those who come after us can appeal there can be no doubt that this strange family story of ours ought to be told and i think betteredge mr bruff and i together have hit on the right way of telling it  very satisfactory to both of them no doubt but i failed to see what i myself had to do with it so far  we have certain events to relate mr franklin proceeded and we have certain persons concerned in those events who are capable of relating them starting from these plain facts the idea is that we should all write the story of the moonstone in turnas far as our own personal experience extends and no farther we must begin by showing how the diamond first fell into the hands of my uncle herncastle when he was serving in india fifty years since this prefatory narrative i have already got by me in the form of an old family paper which relates the necessary particulars on the authority of an eyewitness the next thing to do is to tell how the diamond found its way into my aunts house in yorkshire two years ago and how it came to be lost in little more than twelve hours afterwards nobody knows as much as you do betteredge about what went on in the house at that time so you must take the pen in hand and start the story  in those terms i was informed of what my personal concern was with the matter of the diamond if you are curious to know what course i took under the circumstances i beg to inform you that i did what you would probably have done in my place i modestly declared myself to be quite unequal to the task imposed upon meand i privately felt all the time that i was quite clever enough to perform it if i only gave my own abilities a fair chance mr franklin i imagine must have seen my private sentiments in my face he declined to believe in my modesty and he insisted on giving my abilities a fair chance  two hours have passed since mr franklin left me as soon as his back was turned i went to my writing desk to start the story there i have sat helpless in spite of my abilities ever since seeing what robinson crusoe saw as quoted abovenamely the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost and before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it please to remember i opened the book by accident at that bit only the day before i rashly undertook the business now in hand and allow me to askif that isnt prophecy what is  i am not superstitious i have read a heap of books in my time i am a scholar in my own way though turned seventy i possess an active memory and legs to correspond you are not to take it if you please as the saying of an ignorant man when i express my opinion that such a book as robinson crusoe never was written and never will be written again i have tried that book for yearsgenerally in combination with a pipe of tobaccoand i have found it my friend in need in all the necessities of this mortal life when my spirits are badrobinson crusoe when i want advicerobinson crusoe in past times when my wife plagued me in present times when i have had a drop too muchrobinson crusoe i have worn out six stout robinson crusoes with hard work in my service on my ladys last birthday she gave me a seventh i took a drop too much on the strength of it and robinson crusoe put me right again price four shillings and sixpence bound in blue with a picture into the bargain  still this dont look much like starting the story of the diamonddoes it i seem to be wandering off in search of lord knows what lord knows where we will take a new sheet of paper if you please and begin over again with my best respects to you    chapter ii   i spoke of my lady a line or two back now the diamond could never have been in our house where it was lost if it had not been made a present of to my ladys daughter and my ladys daughter would never have been in existence to have the present if it had not been for my lady who with pain and travail produced her into the world consequently if we begin with my lady we are pretty sure of beginning far enough back and that let me tell you when you have got such a job as mine in hand is a real comfort at starting  if you know anything of the fashionable world you have heard tell of the three beautiful miss herncastles miss adelaide miss caroline and miss juliathis last being the youngest and the best of the three sisters in my opinion and i had opportunities of judging as you shall presently see i went into the service of the old lord their father thank god we have got nothing to do with him in this business of the diamond he had the longest tongue and the shortest temper of any man high or low i ever met withi say i went into the service of the old lord as pageboy in waiting on the three honourable young ladies at the age of fifteen years there i lived till miss julia married the late sir john verinder an excellent man who only wanted somebody to manage him and between ourselves he found somebody to do it and what is more he throve on it and grew fat on it and lived happy and died easy on it dating from the day when my lady took him to church to be married to the day when she relieved him of his last breath and closed his eyes for ever  i have omitted to state that i went with the bride to the brides husbands house and lands down here sir john she says i cant do without gabriel betteredge my lady says sir john i cant do without him either that was his way with herand that was how i went into his service it was all one to me where i went so long as my mistress and i were together  seeing that my lady took an interest in the outofdoor work and the farms and such like i took an interest in them toowith all the more reason that i was a small farmers seventh son myself my lady got me put under the bailiff and i did my best and gave satisfaction and got promotion accordingly some years later on the monday as it might be my lady says sir john your bailiff is a stupid old man pension him liberally and let gabriel betteredge have his place on the tuesday as it might be sir john says my lady the bailiff is pensioned liberally and gabriel betteredge has got his place you hear more than enough of married people living together miserably here is an example to the contrary let it be a warning to some of you and an encouragement to others in the meantime i will go on with my story  well there i was in clover you will say placed in a position of trust and honour with a little cottage of my own to live in with my rounds on the estate to occupy me in the morning and my accounts in the afternoon and my pipe and my robinson crusoe in the eveningwhat more could i possibly want to make me happy remember what adam wanted when he was alone in the garden of eden and if you dont blame it in adam dont blame it in me  the woman i fixed my eye on was the woman who kept house for me at my cottage her name was selina goby i agree with the late william cobbett about picking a wife see that she chews her food well and sets her foot down firmly on the ground when she walks and youre all right selina goby was all right in both these respects which was one reason for marrying her i had another reason likewise entirely of my own discovering selina being a single woman made me pay so much a week for her board and services selina being my wife couldnt charge for her board and would have to give me her services for nothing that was the point of view i looked at it from economywith a dash of love i put it to my mistress as in duty bound just as i had put it to myself  i have been turning selina goby over in my mind i said and i think my lady it will be cheaper to marry her than to keep her  my lady burst out laughing and said she didnt know which to be most shocked atmy language or my principles some joke tickled her i suppose of the sort that you cant take unless you are a person of quality understanding nothing myself but that i was free to put it next to selina i went and put it accordingly and what did selina say lord how little you must know of women if you ask that of course she said yes  as my time drew nearer and there got to be talk of my having a new coat for the ceremony my mind began to misgive me i have compared notes with other men as to what they felt while they were in my interesting situation and they have all acknowledged that about a week before it happened they privately wished themselves out of it i went a trifle further than that myself i actually rose up as it were and tried to get out of it not for nothing i was too just a man to expect she would let me off for nothing compensation to the woman when the man gets out of it is one of the laws of england in obedience to the laws and after turning it over carefully in my mind i offered selina goby a featherbed and fifty shillings to be off the bargain you will hardly believe it but it is nevertheless trueshe was fool enough to refuse  after that it was all over with me of course i got the new coat as cheap as i could and i went through all the rest of it as cheap as i could we were not a happy couple and not a miserable couple we were six of one and halfadozen of the other how it was i dont understand but we always seemed to be getting with the best of motives in one anothers way when i wanted to go upstairs there was my wife coming down or when my wife wanted to go down there was i coming up that is married life according to my experience of it  after five years of misunderstandings on the stairs it pleased an allwise providence to relieve us of each other by taking my wife i was left with my little girl penelope and with no other child shortly afterwards sir john died and my lady was left with her little girl miss rachel and no other child i have written to very poor purpose of my lady if you require to be told that my little penelope was taken care of under my good mistresss own eye and was sent to school and taught and made a sharp girl and promoted when old enough to be miss rachels own maid  as for me i went on with my business as bailiff year after year up to christmas 1847 when there came a change in my life on that day my lady invited herself to a cup of tea alone with me in my cottage she remarked that reckoning from the year when i started as pageboy in the time of the old lord i had been more than fifty years in her service and she put into my hands a beautiful waistcoat of wool that she had worked herself to keep me warm in the bitter winter weather  i received this magnificent present quite at a loss to find words to thank my mistress with for the honour she had done me to my great astonishment it turned out however that the waistcoat was not an honour but a bribe my lady had discovered that i was getting old before i had discovered it myself and she had come to my cottage to wheedle me if i may use such an expression into giving up my hard outofdoor work as bailiff and taking my ease for the rest of my days as steward in the house i made as good a fight of it against the indignity of taking my ease as i could but my mistress knew the weak side of me she put it as a favour to herself the dispute between us ended after that in my wiping my eyes like an old fool with my new woollen waistcoat and saying i would think about it  the perturbation in my mind in regard to thinking about it being truly dreadful after my lady had gone away i applied the remedy which i have never yet found to fail me in cases of doubt and emergency i smoked a pipe and took a turn at robinson crusoe before i had occupied myself with that extraordinary book five minutes i came on a comforting bit page one hundred and fiftyeight as follows today we love what tomorrow we hate i saw my way clear directly today i was all for continuing to be farmbailiff tomorrow on the authority of robinson crusoe i should be all the other way take myself tomorrow while in tomorrows humour and the thing was done my mind being relieved in this manner i went to sleep that night in the character of lady verinders farm bailiff and i woke up the next morning in the character of lady verinders housesteward all quite comfortable and all through robinson crusoe  my daughter penelope has just looked over my shoulder to see what i have done so far she remarks that it is beautifully written and every word of it true but she points out one objection she says what i have done so far isnt in the least what i was wanted to do i am asked to tell the story of the diamond and instead of that i have been telling the story of my own self curious and quite beyond me to account for i wonder whether the gentlemen who make a business and a living out of writing books ever find their own selves getting in the way of their subjects like me if they do i can feel for them in the meantime here is another false start and more waste of good writingpaper whats to be done now nothing that i know of except for you to keep your temper and for me to begin it all over again for the third time    chapter iii   the question of how i am to start the story properly i have tried to settle in two ways first by scratching my head which led to nothing second by consulting my daughter penelope which has resulted in an entirely new idea  penelopes notion is that i should set down what happened regularly day by day beginning with the day when we got the news that mr franklin blake was expected on a visit to the house when you come to fix your memory with a date in this way it is wonderful what your memory will pick up for you upon that compulsion the only difficulty is to fetch out the dates in the first place this penelope offers to do for me by looking into her own diary which she was taught to keep when she was at school and which she has gone on keeping ever since in answer to an improvement on this notion devised by myself namely that she should tell the story instead of me out of her own diary penelope observes with a fierce look and a red face that her journal is for her own private eye and that no living creature shall ever know what is in it but herself when i inquire what this means penelope says fiddlesticks i say sweethearts  beginning then on penelopes plan i beg to mention that i was specially called one wednesday morning into my ladys own sittingroom the date being the twentyfourth of may eighteen hundred and fortyeight  gabriel says my lady here is news that will surprise you franklin blake has come back from abroad he has been staying with his father in london and he is coming to us tomorrow to stop till next month and keep rachels birthday  if i had had a hat in my hand nothing but respect would have prevented me from throwing that hat up to the ceiling i had not seen mr franklin since he was a boy living along with us in this house he was out of all sight as i remember him the nicest boy that ever spun a top or broke a window miss rachel who was present and to whom i made that remark observed in return that she remembered him as the most atrocious tyrant that ever tortured a doll and the hardest driver of an exhausted little girl in string harness that england could produce i burn with indignation and i ache with fatigue was the way miss rachel summed it up when i think of franklin blake  hearing what i now tell you you will naturally ask how it was that mr franklin should have passed all the years from the time when he was a boy to the time when he was a man out of his own country i answer because his father had the misfortune to be next heir to a dukedom and not to be able to prove it  in two words this was how the thing happened  my ladys eldest sister married the celebrated mr blakeequally famous for his great riches and his great suit at law how many years he went on worrying the tribunals of his country to turn out the duke in possession and to put himself in the dukes placehow many lawyers purses he filled to bursting and how many otherwise harmless people he set by the ears together disputing whether he was right or wrongis more by a great deal than i can reckon up his wife died and two of his three children died before the tribunals could make up their minds to show him the door and take no more of his money when it was all over and the duke in possession was left in possession mr blake discovered that the only way of being even with his country for the manner in which it had treated him was not to let his country have the honour of educating his son how can i trust my native institutions was the form in which he put it after the way in which my native institutions have behaved to me add to this that mr blake disliked all boys his own included and you will admit that it could only end in one way master franklin was taken from us in england and was sent to institutions which his father could trust in that superior country germany mr blake himself you will observe remaining snug in england to improve his fellowcountrymen in the parliament house and to publish a statement on the subject of the duke in possession which has remained an unfinished statement from that day to this  there thank god thats told neither you nor i need trouble our heads any more about mr blake senior leave him to the dukedom and let you and i stick to the diamond  the diamond takes us back to mr franklin who was the innocent means of bringing that unlucky jewel into the house  our nice boy didnt forget us after he went abroad he wrote every now and then sometimes to my lady sometimes to miss rachel and sometimes to me we had had a transaction together before he left which consisted in his borrowing of me a ball of string a fourbladed knife and sevenandsixpence in moneythe colour of which last i have not seen and never expect to see again his letters to me chiefly related to borrowing more i heard however from my lady how he got on abroad as he grew in years and stature after he had learnt what the institutions of germany could teach him he gave the french a turn next and the italians a turn after that they made him among them a sort of universal genius as well as i could understand it he wrote a little he painted a little he sang and played and composed a littleborrowing as i suspect in all these cases just as he had borrowed from me his mothers fortune seven hundred a year fell to him when he came of age and ran through him as it might be through a sieve the more money he had the more he wanted there was a hole in mr franklins pocket that nothing would sew up wherever he went the lively easy way of him made him welcome he lived here there and everywhere his address as he used to put it himself being post office europeto be left till called for twice over he made up his mind to come back to england and see us and twice over saving your presence some unmentionable woman stood in the way and stopped him his third attempt succeeded as you know already from what my lady told me on thursday the twentyfifth of may we were to see for the first time what our nice boy had grown to be as a man he came of good blood he had a high courage and he was fiveandtwenty years of age by our reckoning now you know as much of mr franklin blake as i didbefore mr franklin blake came down to our house  the thursday was as fine a summers day as ever you saw and my lady and miss rachel not expecting mr franklin till dinnertime drove out to lunch with some friends in the neighbourhood  when they were gone i went and had a look at the bedroom which had been got ready for our guest and saw that all was straight then being butler in my ladys establishment as well as steward at my own particular request mind and because it vexed me to see anybody but myself in possession of the key of the late sir johns cellarthen i say i fetched up some of our famous latour claret and set it in the warm summer air to take off the chill before dinner concluding to set myself in the warm summer air nextseeing that what is good for old claret is equally good for old agei took up my beehive chair to go out into the back court when i was stopped by hearing a sound like the soft beating of a drum on the terrace in front of my ladys residence  going round to the terrace i found three mahoganycoloured indians in white linen frocks and trousers looking up at the house  the indians as i saw on looking closer had small handdrums slung in front of them behind them stood a little delicatelooking lighthaired english boy carrying a bag i judged the fellows to be strolling conjurors and the boy with the bag to be carrying the tools of their trade one of the three who spoke english and who exhibited i must own the most elegant manners presently informed me that my judgment was right he requested permission to show his tricks in the presence of the lady of the house  now i am not a sour old man i am generally all for amusement and the last person in the world to distrust another person because he happens to be a few shades darker than myself but the best of us have our weaknessesand my weakness when i know a family platebasket to be out on a pantrytable is to be instantly reminded of that basket by the sight of a strolling stranger whose manners are superior to my own i accordingly informed the indian that the lady of the house was out and i warned him and his party off the premises he made me a beautiful bow in return and he and his party went off the premises on my side i returned to my beehive chair and set myself down on the sunny side of the court and fell if the truth must be owned not exactly into a sleep but into the next best thing to it  i was roused up by my daughter penelope running out at me as if the house was on fire what do you think she wanted she wanted to have the three indian jugglers instantly taken up for this reason namely that they knew who was coming from london to visit us and that they meant some mischief to mr franklin blake  mr franklins name roused me i opened my eyes and made my girl explain herself  it appeared that penelope had just come from our lodge where she had been having a gossip with the lodgekeepers daughter the two girls had seen the indians pass out after i had warned them off followed by their little boy taking it into their heads that the boy was illused by the foreignersfor no reason that i could discover except that he was pretty and delicatelookingthe two girls had stolen along the inner side of the hedge between us and the road and had watched the proceedings of the foreigners on the outer side those proceedings resulted in the performance of the following extraordinary tricks  they first looked up the road and down the road and made sure that they were alone then they all three faced about and stared hard in the direction of our house then they jabbered and disputed in their own language and looked at each other like men in doubt then they all turned to their little english boy as if they expected him to help them and then the chief indian who spoke english said to the boy hold out your hand  on hearing those dreadful words my daughter penelope said she didnt know what prevented her heart from flying straight out of her i thought privately that it might have been her stays all i said however was you make my flesh creep nota bene women like these little compliments  well when the indian said hold out your hand the boy shrunk back and shook his head and said he didnt like it the indian thereupon asked him not at all unkindly whether he would like to be sent back to london and left where they had found him sleeping in an empty basket in a marketa hungry ragged and forsaken little boy this it seems ended the difficulty the little chap unwillingly held out his hand upon that the indian took a bottle from his bosom and poured out of it some black stuff like ink into the palm of the boys hand the indianfirst touching the boys head and making signs over it in the airthen said look the boy became quite stiff and stood like a statue looking into the ink in the hollow of his hand  so far it seemed to me to be juggling accompanied by a foolish waste of ink i was beginning to feel sleepy again when penelopes next words stirred me up  the indians looked up the road and down the road once moreand then the chief indian said these words to the boy see the english gentleman from foreign parts  the boy said i see him  the indian said is it on the road to this house and on no other that the english gentleman will travel today  the boy said it is on the road to this house and on no other that the english gentleman will travel today the indian put a second questionafter waiting a little first he said has the english gentleman got it about him  the boy answeredalso after waiting a little firstyes  the indian put a third and last question will the english gentleman come here as he has promised to come at the close of day  the boy said i cant tell  the indian asked why  the boy said i am tired the mist rises in my head and puzzles me i can see no more today  with that the catechism ended the chief indian said something in his own language to the other two pointing to the boy and pointing towards the town in which as we afterwards discovered they were lodged he then after making more signs on the boys head blew on his forehead and so woke him up with a start after that they all went on their way towards the town and the girls saw them no more  most things they say have a moral if you only look for it what was the moral of this  the moral was as i thought first that the chief juggler had heard mr franklins arrival talked of among the servants outofdoors and saw his way to making a little money by it second that he and his men and boy with a view to making the said money meant to hang about till they saw my lady drive home and then to come back and foretell mr franklins arrival by magic third that penelope had heard them rehearsing their hocuspocus like actors rehearsing a play fourth that i should do well to have an eye that evening on the platebasket fifth that penelope would do well to cool down and leave me her father to doze off again in the sun  that appeared to me to be the sensible view if you know anything of the ways of young women you wont be surprised to hear that penelope wouldnt take it the moral of the thing was serious according to my daughter she particularly reminded me of the indians third question has the english gentleman got it about him oh father says penelope clasping her hands dont joke about this what does it mean  well ask mr franklin my dear i said if you can wait till mr franklin comes i winked to show i meant that in joke penelope took it quite seriously my girls earnestness tickled me what on earth should mr franklin know about it i inquired ask him says penelope and see whether he thinks it a laughing matter too with that parting shot my daughter left me  i settled it with myself when she was gone that i really would ask mr franklinmainly to set penelopes mind at rest what was said between us when i did ask him later on that same day you will find set out fully in its proper place but as i dont wish to raise your expectations and then disappoint them i will take leave to warn you herebefore we go any furtherthat you wont find the ghost of a joke in our conversation on the subject of the jugglers to my great surprise mr franklin like penelope took the thing seriously how seriously you will understand when i tell you that in his opinion it meant the moonstone    chapter iv   i am truly sorry to detain you over me and my beehive chair a sleepy old man in a sunny back yard is not an interesting object i am well aware but things must be put down in their places as things actually happenedand you must please to jog on a little while longer with me in expectation of mr franklin blakes arrival later in the day  before i had time to doze off again after my daughter penelope had left me i was disturbed by a rattling of plates and dishes in the servants hall which meant that dinner was ready taking my own meals in my own sittingroom i had nothing to do with the servants dinner except to wish them a good stomach to it all round previous to composing myself once more in my chair i was just stretching my legs when out bounced another woman on me not my daughter again only nancy the kitchenmaid this time i was straight in her way out and i observed as she asked me to let her by that she had a sulky facea thing which as head of the servants i never allow on principle to pass me without inquiry  what are you turning your back on your dinner for i asked whats wrong now nancy  nancy tried to push by without answering upon which i rose up and took her by the ear she is a nice plump young lass and it is customary with me to adopt that manner of showing that i personally approve of a girl  whats wrong now i said once more  rosannas late again for dinner says nancy and im sent to fetch her in all the hard work falls on my shoulders in this house let me alone mr betteredge  the person here mentioned as rosanna was our second housemaid having a kind of pity for our second housemaid why you shall presently know and seeing in nancys face that she would fetch her fellowservant in with more hard words than might be needful under the circumstances it struck me that i had nothing particular to do and that i might as well fetch rosanna myself giving her a hint to be punctual in future which i knew she would take kindly from me  where is rosanna i inquired  at the sands of course says nancy with a toss of her head she had another of her fainting fits this morning and she asked to go out and get a breath of fresh air i have no patience with her  go back to your dinner my girl i said i have patience with her and ill fetch her in  nancy who has a fine appetite looked pleased when she looks pleased she looks nice when she looks nice i chuck her under the chin it isnt immoralityits only habit  well i took my stick and set off for the sands  no it wont do to set off yet i am sorry again to detain you but you really must hear the story of the sands and the story of rosannafor this reason that the matter of the diamond touches them both nearly how hard i try to get on with my statement without stopping by the way and how badly i succeed but therepersons and things do turn up so vexatiously in this life and will in a manner insist on being noticed let us take it easy and let us take it short we shall be in the thick of the mystery soon i promise you  rosanna to put the person before the thing which is but common politeness was the only new servant in our house about four months before the time i am writing of my lady had been in london and had gone over a reformatory intended to save forlorn women from drifting back into bad ways after they had got released from prison the matron seeing my lady took an interest in the place pointed out a girl to her named rosanna spearman and told her a most miserable story which i havent the heart to repeat here for i dont like to be made wretched without any use and no more do you the upshot of it was that rosanna spearman had been a thief and not being of the sort that get up companies in the city and rob from thousands instead of only robbing from one the law laid hold of her and the prison and the reformatory followed the lead of the law the matrons opinion of rosanna was in spite of what she had done that the girl was one in a thousand and that she only wanted a chance to prove herself worthy of any christian womans interest in her my lady being a christian woman if ever there was one yet said to the matron upon that rosanna spearman shall have her chance in my service in a week afterwards rosanna spearman entered this establishment as our second housemaid  not a soul was told the girls story excepting miss rachel and me my lady doing me the honour to consult me about most things consulted me about rosanna having fallen a good deal latterly into the late sir johns way of always agreeing with my lady i agreed with her heartily about rosanna spearman  a fairer chance no girl could have had than was given to this poor girl of ours none of the servants could cast her past life in her teeth for none of the servants knew what it had been she had her wages and her privileges like the rest of them and every now and then a friendly word from my lady in private to encourage her in return she showed herself i am bound to say well worthy of the kind treatment bestowed upon her though far from strong and troubled occasionally with those faintingfits already mentioned she went about her work modestly and uncomplainingly doing it carefully and doing it well but somehow she failed to make friends among the other women servants excepting my daughter penelope who was always kind to rosanna though never intimate with her  i hardly know what the girl did to offend them there was certainly no beauty about her to make the others envious she was the plainest woman in the house with the additional misfortune of having one shoulder bigger than the other what the servants chiefly resented i think was her silent tongue and her solitary ways she read or worked in leisure hours when the rest gossiped and when it came to her turn to go out nine times out of ten she quietly put on her bonnet and had her turn by herself she never quarrelled she never took offence she only kept a certain distance obstinately and civilly between the rest of them and herself add to this that plain as she was there was just a dash of something that wasnt like a housemaid and that was like a lady about her it might have been in her voice or it might have been in her face all i can say is that the other women pounced on it like lightning the first day she came into the house and said which was most unjust that rosanna spearman gave herself airs  having now told the story of rosanna i have only to notice one of the many queer ways of this strange girl to get on next to the story of the sands  our house is high up on the yorkshire coast and close by the sea we have got beautiful walks all round us in every direction but one that one i acknowledge to be a horrid walk it leads for a quarter of a mile through a melancholy plantation of firs and brings you out between low cliffs on the loneliest and ugliest little bay on all our coast  the sandhills here run down to the sea and end in two spits of rock jutting out opposite each other till you lose sight of them in the water one is called the north spit and one the south between the two shifting backwards and forwards at certain seasons of the year lies the most horrible quicksand on the shores of yorkshire at the turn of the tide something goes on in the unknown deeps below which sets the whole face of the quicksand shivering and trembling in a manner most remarkable to see and which has given to it among the people in our parts the name of the shivering sand a great bank half a mile out nigh the mouth of the bay breaks the force of the main ocean coming in from the offing winter and summer when the tide flows over the quicksand the sea seems to leave the waves behind it on the bank and rolls its waters in smoothly with a heave and covers the sand in silence a lonesome and a horrid retreat i can tell you no boat ever ventures into this bay no children from our fishingvillage called cobbs hole ever come here to play the very birds of the air as it seems to me give the shivering sand a wide berth that a young woman with dozens of nice walks to choose from and company to go with her if she only said come should prefer this place and should sit and work or read in it all alone when its her turn out i grant you passes belief its true nevertheless account for it as you may that this was rosanna spearmans favourite walk except when she went once or twice to cobbs hole to see the only friend she had in our neighbourhood of whom more anon its also true that i was now setting out for this same place to fetch the girl in to dinner which brings us round happily to our former point and starts us fair again on our way to the sands  i saw no sign of the girl in the plantation when i got out through the sandhills on to the beach there she was in her little straw bonnet and her plain grey cloak that she always wore to hide her deformed shoulder as much as might bethere she was all alone looking out on the quicksand and the sea  she started when i came up with her and turned her head away from me not looking me in the face being another of the proceedings which as head of the servants i never allow on principle to pass without inquiryi turned her round my way and saw that she was crying my bandanna handkerchiefone of six beauties given to me by my ladywas handy in my pocket i took it out and i said to rosanna come and sit down my dear on the slope of the beach along with me ill dry your eyes for you first and then ill make so bold as to ask what you have been crying about  when you come to my age you will find sitting down on the slope of a beach a much longer job than you think it now by the time i was settled rosanna had dried her own eyes with a very inferior handkerchief to minecheap cambric she looked very quiet and very wretched but she sat down by me like a good girl when i told her when you want to comfort a woman by the shortest way take her on your knee i thought of this golden rule but there rosanna wasnt nancy and thats the truth of it  now tell me my dear i said what are you crying about  about the years that are gone mr betteredge says rosanna quietly my past life still comes back to me sometimes  come come my girl i said your past life is all sponged out why cant you forget it  she took me by one of the lappets of my coat i am a slovenly old man and a good deal of my meat and drink gets splashed about on my clothes sometimes one of the women and sometimes another cleans me of my grease the day before rosanna had taken out a spot for me on the lappet of my coat with a new composition warranted to remove anything the grease was gone but there was a little dull place left on the nap of the cloth where the grease had been the girl pointed to that place and shook her head  the stain is taken off she said but the place shows mr betteredgethe place shows  a remark which takes a man unawares by means of his own coat is not an easy remark to answer something in the girl herself too made me particularly sorry for her just then she had nice brown eyes plain as she was in other waysand she looked at me with a sort of respect for my happy old age and my good character as things for ever out of her own reach which made my heart heavy for our second housemaid not feeling myself able to comfort her there was only one other thing to do that thing wasto take her in to dinner  help me up i said youre late for dinner rosannaand i have come to fetch you in  you mr betteredge says she  they told nancy to fetch you i said but thought you might like your scolding better my dear if it came from me  instead of helping me up the poor thing stole her hand into mine and gave it a little squeeze she tried hard to keep from crying again and succeededfor which i respected her youre very kind mr betteredge she said i dont want any dinner todaylet me bide a little longer here  what makes you like to be here i asked what is it that brings you everlastingly to this miserable place  something draws me to it says the girl making images with her finger in the sand i try to keep away from it and i cant sometimes says she in a low voice as if she was frightened at her own fancy sometimes mr betteredge i think that my grave is waiting for me here  theres roast mutton and suetpudding waiting for you says i go in to dinner directly this is what comes rosanna of thinking on an empty stomach i spoke severely being naturally indignant at my time of life to hear a young woman of fiveandtwenty talking about her latter end  she didnt seem to hear me she put her hand on my shoulder and kept me where i was sitting by her side  i think the place has laid a spell on me she said i dream of it night after night i think of it when i sit stitching at my work you know i am grateful mr betteredgeyou know i try to deserve your kindness and my ladys confidence in me but i wonder sometimes whether the life here is too quiet and too good for such a woman as i am after all i have gone through mr betteredgeafter all i have gone through its more lonely to me to be among the other servants knowing i am not what they are than it is to be here my lady doesnt know the matron at the reformatory doesnt know what a dreadful reproach honest people are in themselves to a woman like me dont scold me theres a dear good man i do my work dont i please not to tell my lady i am discontentedi am not my minds unquiet sometimes thats all she snatched her hand off my shoulder and suddenly pointed down to the quicksand look she said isnt it wonderful isnt it terrible i have seen it dozens of times and its always as new to me as if i had never seen it before  i looked where she pointed the tide was on the turn and the horrid sand began to shiver the broad brown face of it heaved slowly and then dimpled and quivered all over do you know what it looks like to me says rosanna catching me by the shoulder again it looks as if it had hundreds of suffocating people under itall struggling to get to the surface and all sinking lower and lower in the dreadful deeps throw a stone in mr betteredge throw a stone in and lets see the sand suck it down  here was unwholesome talk here was an empty stomach feeding on an unquiet mind my answera pretty sharp one in the poor girls own interests i promise youwas at my tongues end when it was snapped short off on a sudden by a voice among the sandhills shouting for me by my name betteredge cries the voice where are you here i shouted out in return without a notion in my mind of who it was rosanna started to her feet and stood looking towards the voice i was just thinking of getting on my own legs next when i was staggered by a sudden change in the girls face  her complexion turned of a beautiful red which i had never seen in it before she brightened all over with a kind of speechless and breathless surprise who is it i asked rosanna gave me back my own question oh who is it she said softly more to herself than to me i twisted round on the sand and looked behind me there coming out on us from among the hills was a brighteyed young gentleman dressed in a beautiful fawncoloured suit with gloves and hat to match with a rose in his buttonhole and a smile on his face that might have set the shivering sand itself smiling at him in return before i could get on my legs he plumped down on the sand by the side of me put his arm round my neck foreign fashion and gave me a hug that fairly squeezed the breath out of my body dear old betteredge says he i owe you sevenandsixpence now do you know who i am  lord bless us and save us herefour good hours before we expected himwas mr franklin blake  before i could say a word i saw mr franklin a little surprised to all appearance look up from me to rosanna following his lead i looked at the girl too she was blushing of a deeper red than ever seemingly at having caught mr franklins eye and she turned and left us suddenly in a confusion quite unaccountable to my mind without either making her curtsey to the gentleman or saying a word to me very unlike her usual self a civiller and betterbehaved servant in general you never met with  thats an odd girl says mr franklin i wonder what she sees in me to surprise her  i suppose sir i answered drolling on our young gentlemans continental education its the varnish from foreign parts  i set down here mr franklins careless question and my foolish answer as a consolation and encouragement to all stupid peopleit being as i have remarked a great satisfaction to our inferior fellowcreatures to find that their betters are on occasions no brighter than they are neither mr franklin with his wonderful foreign training nor i with my age experience and natural motherwit had the ghost of an idea of what rosanna spearmans unaccountable behaviour really meant she was out of our thoughts poor soul before we had seen the last flutter of her little grey cloak among the sandhills and what of that you will ask naturally enough read on good friend as patiently as you can and perhaps you will be as sorry for rosanna spearman as i was when i found out the truth    chapter v   the first thing i did after we were left together alone was to make a third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand mr franklin stopped me  there is one advantage about this horrid place he said we have got it all to ourselves stay where you are betteredge i have something to say to you  while he was speaking i was looking at him and trying to see something of the boy i remembered in the man before me the man put me out look as i might i could see no more of his boys rosy cheeks than of his boys trim little jacket his complexion had got pale his face at the lower part was covered to my great surprise and disappointment with a curly brown beard and mustachios he had a lively touchandgo way with him very pleasant and engaging i admit but nothing to compare with his freeandeasy manners of other times to make matters worse he had promised to be tall and had not kept his promise he was neat and slim and well made but he wasnt by an inch or two up to the middle height in short he baffled me altogether the years that had passed had left nothing of his old self except the bright straightforward look in his eyes there i found our nice boy again and there i concluded to stop in my investigation  welcome back to the old place mr franklin i said all the more welcome sir that you have come some hours before we expected you  i have a reason for coming before you expected me answered mr franklin i suspect betteredge that i have been followed and watched in london for the last three or four days and i have travelled by the morning instead of the afternoon train because i wanted to give a certain darklooking stranger the slip  those words did more than surprise me they brought back to my mind in a flash the three jugglers and penelopes notion that they meant some mischief to mr franklin blake  whos watching you sirand why i inquired  tell me about the three indians you have had at the house today says mr franklin without noticing my question its just possible betteredge that my stranger and your three jugglers may turn out to be pieces of the same puzzle  how do you come to know about the jugglers sir i asked putting one question on the top of another which was bad manners i own but you dont expect much from poor human natureso dont expect much from me  i saw penelope at the house says mr franklin and penelope told me your daughter promised to be a pretty girl betteredge and she has kept her promise penelope has got a small ear and a small foot did the late mrs betteredge possess those inestimable advantages  the late mrs betteredge possessed a good many defects sir says i one of them if you will pardon my mentioning it was never keeping to the matter in hand she was more like a fly than a woman she couldnt settle on anything  she would just have suited me says mr franklin i never settle on anything either betteredge your edge is better than ever your daughter said as much when i asked for particulars about the jugglers father will tell you sir hes a wonderful man for his age and he expresses himself beautifully penelopes own wordsblushing divinely not even my respect for you prevented me fromnever mind i knew her when she was a child and shes none the worse for it lets be serious what did the jugglers do  i was something dissatisfied with my daughternot for letting mr franklin kiss her mr franklin was welcome to thatbut for forcing me to tell her foolish story at second hand however there was no help for it now but to mention the circumstances mr franklins merriment all died away as i went on he sat knitting his eyebrows and twisting his beard when i had done he repeated after me two of the questions which the chief juggler had put to the boyseemingly for the purpose of fixing them well in his mind  is it on the road to this house and on no other that the english gentleman will travel today has the english gentleman got it about him i suspect says mr franklin pulling a little sealed paper parcel out of his pocket that it means this and this betteredge means my uncle herncastles famous diamond  good lord sir i broke out how do you come to be in charge of the wicked colonels diamond  the wicked colonels will has left his diamond as a birthday present to my cousin rachel says mr franklin and my father as the wicked colonels executor has given it in charge to me to bring down here  if the sea then oozing in smoothly over the shivering sand had been changed into dry land before my own eyes i doubt if i could have been more surprised than i was when mr franklin spoke those words  the colonels diamond left to miss rachel says i and your father sir the colonels executor why i would have laid any bet you like mr franklin that your father wouldnt have touched the colonel with a pair of tongs  strong language betteredge what was there against the colonel he belonged to your time not to mine tell me what you know about him and ill tell you how my father came to be his executor and more besides i have made some discoveries in london about my uncle herncastle and his diamond which have rather an ugly look to my eyes and i want you to confirm them you called him the wicked colonel just now search your memory my old friend and tell me why  i saw he was in earnest and i told him  here follows the substance of what i said written out entirely for your benefit pay attention to it or you will be all abroad when we get deeper into the story clear your mind of the children or the dinner or the new bonnet or what not try if you cant forget politics horses prices in the city and grievances at the club i hope you wont take this freedom on my part amiss its only a way i have of appealing to the gentle reader lord havent i seen you with the greatest authors in your hands and dont i know how ready your attention is to wander when its a book that asks for it instead of a person  i spoke a little way back of my ladys father the old lord with the short temper and the long tongue he had five children in all two sons to begin with then after a long time his wife broke out breeding again and the three young ladies came briskly one after the other as fast as the nature of things would permit my mistress as before mentioned being the youngest and best of the three of the two sons the eldest arthur inherited the title and estates the second the honourable john got a fine fortune left him by a relative and went into the army  its an ill bird they say that fouls its own nest i look on the noble family of the herncastles as being my nest and i shall take it as a favour if i am not expected to enter into particulars on the subject of the honourable john he was i honestly believe one of the greatest blackguards that ever lived i can hardly say more or less for him than that he went into the army beginning in the guards he had to leave the guards before he was twoandtwentynever mind why they are very strict in the army and they were too strict for the honourable john he went out to india to see whether they were equally strict there and to try a little active service in the matter of bravery to give him his due he was a mixture of bulldog and gamecock with a dash of the savage he was at the taking of seringapatam soon afterwards he changed into another regiment and in course of time changed into a third in the third he got his last step as lieutenantcolonel and getting that got also a sunstroke and came home to england  he came back with a character that closed the doors of all his family against him my lady then just married taking the lead and declaring with sir johns approval of course that her brother should never enter any house of hers there was more than one slur on the colonel that made people shy of him but the blot of the diamond is all i need mention here  it was said he had got possession of his indian jewel by means which bold as he was he didnt dare acknowledge he never attempted to sell itnot being in need of money and not to give him his due again making money an object he never gave it away he never even showed it to any living soul some said he was afraid of its getting him into a difficulty with the military authorities others very ignorant indeed of the real nature of the man said he was afraid if he showed it of its costing him his life  there was perhaps a grain of truth mixed up with this last report it was false to say that he was afraid but it was a fact that his life had been twice threatened in india and it was firmly believed that the moonstone was at the bottom of it when he came back to england and found himself avoided by everybody the moonstone was thought to be at the bottom of it again the mystery of the colonels life got in the colonels way and outlawed him as you may say among his own people the men wouldnt let him into their clubs the womenmore than onewhom he wanted to marry refused him friends and relations got too nearsighted to see him in the street  some men in this mess would have tried to set themselves right with the world but to give in even when he was wrong and had all society against him was not the way of the honourable john he had kept the diamond in flat defiance of assassination in india he kept the diamond in flat defiance of public opinion in england there you have the portrait of the man before you as in a picture a character that braved everything and a face handsome as it was that looked possessed by the devil  we heard different rumours about him from time to time sometimes they said he was given up to smoking opium and collecting old books sometimes he was reported to be trying strange things in chemistry sometimes he was seen carousing and amusing himself among the lowest people in the lowest slums of london anyhow a solitary vicious underground life was the life the colonel led once and once only after his return to england i myself saw him face to face  about two years before the time of which i am now writing and about a year and a half before the time of his death the colonel came unexpectedly to my ladys house in london it was the night of miss rachels birthday the twentyfirst of june and there was a party in honour of it as usual i received a message from the footman to say that a gentleman wanted to see me going up into the hall there i found the colonel wasted and worn and old and shabby and as wild and as wicked as ever  go up to my sister says he and say that i have called to wish my niece many happy returns of the day  he had made attempts by letter more than once already to be reconciled with my lady for no other purpose i am firmly persuaded than to annoy her but this was the first time he had actually come to the house i had it on the tip of my tongue to say that my mistress had a party that night but the devilish look of him daunted me i went upstairs with his message and left him by his own desire waiting in the hall the servants stood staring at him at a distance as if he was a walking engine of destruction loaded with powder and shot and likely to go off among them at a moments notice  my lady had a dashno moreof the family temper tell colonel herncastle she said when i gave her her brothers message that miss verinder is engaged and that i decline to see him i tried to plead for a civiller answer than that knowing the colonels constitutional superiority to the restraints which govern gentlemen in general quite useless the family temper flashed out at me directly when i want your advice says my lady you know that i always ask for it i dont ask for it now i went downstairs with the message of which i took the liberty of presenting a new and amended edition of my own contriving as follows my lady and miss rachel regret that they are engaged colonel and beg to be excused having the honour of seeing you  i expected him to break out even at that polite way of putting it to my surprise he did nothing of the sort he alarmed me by taking the thing with an unnatural quiet his eyes of a glittering bright grey just settled on me for a moment and he laughed not out of himself like other people but into himself in a soft chuckling horridly mischievous way thank you betteredge he said i shall remember my nieces birthday with that he turned on his heel and walked out of the house  the next birthday came round and we heard he was ill in bed six months afterwardsthat is to say six months before the time i am now writing ofthere came a letter from a highly respectable clergyman to my lady it communicated two wonderful things in the way of family news first that the colonel had forgiven his sister on his deathbed second that he had forgiven everybody else and had made a most edifying end i have myself in spite of the bishops and the clergy an unfeigned respect for the church but i am firmly persuaded at the same time that the devil remained in undisturbed possession of the honourable john and that the last abominable act in the life of that abominable man was saving your presence to take the clergyman in  this was the sumtotal of what i had to tell mr franklin i remarked that he listened more and more eagerly the longer i went on also that the story of the colonel being sent away from his sisters door on the occasion of his nieces birthday seemed to strike mr franklin like a shot that had hit the mark though he didnt acknowledge it i saw that i had made him uneasy plainly enough in his face  you have said your say betteredge he remarked its my turn now before however i tell you what discoveries i have made in london and how i came to be mixed up in this matter of the diamond i want to know one thing you look my old friend as if you didnt quite understand the object to be answered by this consultation of ours do your looks belie you  no sir i said my looks on this occasion at any rate tell the truth  in that case says mr franklin suppose i put you up to my point of view before we go any further i see three very serious questions involved in the colonels birthdaygift to my cousin rachel follow me carefully betteredge and count me off on your fingers if it will help you says mr franklin with a certain pleasure in showing how clearheaded he could be which reminded me wonderfully of old times when he was a boy question the first was the colonels diamond the object of a conspiracy in india question the second has the conspiracy followed the colonels diamond to england question the third did the colonel know the conspiracy followed the diamond and has he purposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to his sister through the innocent medium of his sisters child that is what i am driving at betteredge dont let me frighten you  it was all very well to say that but he had frightened me  if he was right here was our quiet english house suddenly invaded by a devilish indian diamondbringing after it a conspiracy of living rogues set loose on us by the vengeance of a dead man there was our situation as revealed to me in mr franklins last words who ever heard the like of itin the nineteenth century mind in an age of progress and in a country which rejoices in the blessings of the british constitution nobody ever heard the like of it and consequently nobody can be expected to believe it i shall go on with my story however in spite of that  when you get a sudden alarm of the sort that i had got now nine times out of ten the place you feel it in is your stomach when you feel it in your stomach your attention wanders and you begin to fidget i fidgeted silently in my place on the sand mr franklin noticed me contending with a perturbed stomach or mindwhich you please they mean the same thingand checking himself just as he was starting with his part of the story said to me sharply what do you want  what did i want i didnt tell him but ill tell you in confidence i wanted a whiff of my pipe and a turn at robinson crusoe    chapter vi   keeping my private sentiments to myself i respectfully requested mr franklin to go on mr franklin replied dont fidget betteredge and went on  our young gentlemans first words informed me that his discoveries concerning the wicked colonel and the diamond had begun with a visit which he had paid before he came to us to the family lawyer at hampstead a chance word dropped by mr franklin when the two were alone one day after dinner revealed that he had been charged by his father with a birthday present to be taken to miss rachel one thing led to another and it ended in the lawyer mentioning what the present really was and how the friendly connexion between the late colonel and mr blake senior had taken its rise the facts here are really so extraordinary that i doubt if i can trust my own language to do justice to them i prefer trying to report mr franklins discoveries as nearly as may be in mr franklins own words  you remember the time betteredge he said when my father was trying to prove his title to that unlucky dukedom well that was also the time when my uncle herncastle returned from india my father discovered that his brotherinlaw was in possession of certain papers which were likely to be of service to him in his lawsuit he called on the colonel on pretence of welcoming him back to england the colonel was not to be deluded in that way you want something he said or you would never have compromised your reputation by calling on me my father saw that the one chance for him was to show his hand he admitted at once that he wanted the papers the colonel asked for a day to consider his answer his answer came in the shape of a most extraordinary letter which my friend the lawyer showed me the colonel began by saying that he wanted something of my father and that he begged to propose an exchange of friendly services between them the fortune of war that was the expression he used had placed him in possession of one of the largest diamonds in the world and he had reason to believe that neither he nor his precious jewel was safe in any house in any quarter of the globe which they occupied together under these alarming circumstances he had determined to place his diamond in the keeping of another person that person was not expected to run any risk he might deposit the precious stone in any place especially guarded and set apartlike a bankers or jewellers strongroomfor the safe custody of valuables of high price his main personal responsibility in the matter was to be of the passive kind he was to undertake either by himself or by a trustworthy representativeto receive at a prearranged address on certain prearranged days in every year a note from the colonel simply stating the fact that he was a living man at that date in the event of the date passing over without the note being received the colonels silence might be taken as a sure token of the colonels death by murder in that case and in no other certain sealed instructions relating to the disposal of the diamond and deposited with it were to be opened and followed implicitly if my father chose to accept this strange charge the colonels papers were at his disposal in return that was the letter  what did your father do sir i asked  do says mr franklin ill tell you what he did he brought the invaluable faculty called common sense to bear on the colonels letter the whole thing he declared was simply absurd somewhere in his indian wanderings the colonel had picked up with some wretched crystal which he took for a diamond as for the danger of his being murdered and the precautions devised to preserve his life and his piece of crystal this was the nineteenth century and any man in his senses had only to apply to the police the colonel had been a notorious opiumeater for years past and if the only way of getting at the valuable papers he possessed was by accepting a matter of opium as a matter of fact my father was quite willing to take the ridiculous responsibility imposed on himall the more readily that it involved no trouble to himself the diamond and the sealed instructions went into his bankers strongroom and the colonels letters periodically reporting him a living man were received and opened by our family lawyer mr bruff as my fathers representative no sensible person in a similar position could have viewed the matter in any other way nothing in this world betteredge is probable unless it appeals to our own trumpery experience and we only believe in a romance when we see it in a newspaper  it was plain to me from this that mr franklin thought his fathers notion about the colonel hasty and wrong  what is your own private opinion about the matter sir i asked  lets finish the story of the colonel first says mr franklin there is a curious want of system betteredge in the english mind and your question my old friend is an instance of it when we are not occupied in making machinery we are mentally speaking the most slovenly people in the universe  so much i thought to myself for a foreign education he has learned that way of girding at us in france i suppose  mr franklin took up the lost thread and went on  my father he said got the papers he wanted and never saw his brotherinlaw again from that time year after year on the prearranged days the prearranged letter came from the colonel and was opened by mr bruff i have seen the letters in a heap all of them written in the same brief businesslike form of words sirthis is to certify that i am still a living man let the diamond be john herncastle that was all he ever wrote and that came regularly to the day until some six or eight months since when the form of the letter varied for the first time it ran now sirthey tell me i am dying come to me and help me to make my will mr bruff went and found him in the little suburban villa surrounded by its own grounds in which he had lived alone ever since he had left india he had dogs cats and birds to keep him company but no human being near him except the person who came daily to do the housework and the doctor at the bedside the will was a very simple matter the colonel had dissipated the greater part of his fortune in his chemical investigations his will began and ended in three clauses which he dictated from his bed in perfect possession of his faculties the first clause provided for the safe keeping and support of his animals the second founded a professorship of experimental chemistry at a northern university the third bequeathed the moonstone as a birthday present to his niece on condition that my father would act as executor my father at first refused to act on second thoughts however he gave way partly because he was assured that the executorship would involve him in no trouble partly because mr bruff suggested in rachels interest that the diamond might be worth something after all  did the colonel give any reason sir i inquired why he left the diamond to miss rachel  he not only gave the reasonhe had the reason written in his will said mr franklin i have got an extract which you shall see presently dont be slovenlyminded betteredge one thing at a time you have heard about the colonels will now you must hear what happened after the colonels death it was formally necessary to have the diamond valued before the will could be proved all the jewellers consulted at once confirmed the colonels assertion that he possessed one of the largest diamonds in the world the question of accurately valuing it presented some serious difficulties its size made it a phenomenon in the diamond market its colour placed it in a category by itself and to add to these elements of uncertainty there was a defect in the shape of a flaw in the very heart of the stone even with this last serious drawback however the lowest of the various estimates given was twenty thousand pounds conceive my fathers astonishment he had been within a hairsbreadth of refusing to act as executor and of allowing this magnificent jewel to be lost to the family the interest he took in the matter now induced him to open the sealed instructions which had been deposited with the diamond mr bruff showed this document to me with the other papers and it suggests to my mind a clue to the nature of the conspiracy which threatened the colonels life  then you do believe sir i said that there was a conspiracy  not possessing my fathers excellent common sense answered mr franklin i believe the colonels life was threatened exactly as the colonel said the sealed instructions as i think explain how it was that he died after all quietly in his bed in the event of his death by violence that is to say in the absence of the regular letter from him at the appointed date my father was then directed to send the moonstone secretly to amsterdam it was to be deposited in that city with a famous diamondcutter and it was to be cut up into from four to six separate stones the stones were then to be sold for what they would fetch and the proceeds were to be applied to the founding of that professorship of experimental chemistry which the colonel has since endowed by his will now betteredge exert those sharp wits of yours and observe the conclusion to which the colonels instructions point  i instantly exerted my wits they were of the slovenly english sort and they consequently muddled it all until mr franklin took them in hand and pointed out what they ought to see  remark says mr franklin that the integrity of the diamond as a whole stone is here artfully made dependent on the preservation from violence of the colonels life he is not satisfied with saying to the enemies he dreads kill meand you will be no nearer to the diamond than you are now it is where you cant get at itin the guarded strongroom of a bank he says instead kill meand the diamond will be the diamond no longer its identity will be destroyed what does that mean  here i had as i thought a flash of the wonderful foreign brightness  i know i said it means lowering the value of the stone and cheating the rogues in that way  nothing of the sort says mr franklin i have inquired about that the flawed diamond cut up would actually fetch more than the diamond as it now is for this plain reasonthat from four to six perfect brilliants might be cut from it which would be collectively worth more money than the largebut imperfect single stone if robbery for the purpose of gain was at the bottom of the conspiracy the colonels instructions absolutely made the diamond better worth stealing more money could have been got for it and the disposal of it in the diamond market would have been infinitely easier if it had passed through the hands of the workmen of amsterdam  lord bless us sir i burst out what was the plot then  a plot organised among the indians who originally owned the jewel says mr franklina plot with some old hindoo superstition at the bottom of it that is my opinion confirmed by a family paper which i have about me at this moment  i saw now why the appearance of the three indian jugglers at our house had presented itself to mr franklin in the light of a circumstance worth noting  i dont want to force my opinion on you mr franklin went on the idea of certain chosen servants of an old hindoo superstition devoting themselves through all difficulties and dangers to watching the opportunity of recovering their sacred gem appears to me to be perfectly consistent with everything that we know of the patience of oriental races and the influence of oriental religions but then i am an imaginative man and the butcher the baker and the taxgatherer are not the only credible realities in existence to my mind let the guess i have made at the truth in this matter go for what it is worth and let us get on to the only practical question that concerns us does the conspiracy against the moonstone survive the colonels death and did the colonel know it when he left the birthday gift to his niece  i began to see my lady and miss rachel at the end of it all now not a word he said escaped me  i was not very willing when i discovered the story of the moonstone said mr franklin to be the means of bringing it here but mr bruff reminded me that somebody must put my cousins legacy into my cousins handsand that i might as well do it as anybody else after taking the diamond out of the bank i fancied i was followed in the streets by a shabby darkcomplexioned man i went to my fathers house to pick up my luggage and found a letter there which unexpectedly detained me in london i went back to the bank with the diamond and thought i saw the shabby man again taking the diamond once more out of the bank this morning i saw the man for the third time gave him the slip and started before he recovered the trace of me by the morning instead of the afternoon train here i am with the diamond safe and soundand what is the first news that meets me i find that three strolling indians have been at the house and that my arrival from london and something which i am expected to have about me are two special objects of investigation to them when they believe themselves to be alone i dont waste time and words on their pouring the ink into the boys hand and telling him to look in it for a man at a distance and for something in that mans pocket the thing which i have often seen done in the east is hocuspocus in my opinion as it is in yours the present question for us to decide is whether i am wrongly attaching a meaning to a mere accident or whether we really have evidence of the indians being on the track of the moonstone the moment it is removed from the safe keeping of the bank  neither he nor i seemed to fancy dealing with this part of the inquiry we looked at each other and then we looked at the tide oozing in smoothly higher and higher over the shivering sand  what are you thinking of says mr franklin suddenly  i was thinking sir i answered that i should like to shy the diamond into the quicksand and settle the question in that way  if you have got the value of the stone in your pocket answered mr franklin say so betteredge and in it goes  its curious to note when your minds anxious how very far in the way of relief a very small joke will go we found a fund of merriment at the time in the notion of making away with miss rachels lawful property and getting mr blake as executor into dreadful troublethough where the merriment was i am quite at a loss to discover now  mr franklin was the first to bring the talk back to the talks proper purpose he took an envelope out of his pocket opened it and handed to me the paper inside  betteredge he said we must face the question of the colonels motive in leaving this legacy to his niece for my aunts sake bear in mind how lady verinder treated her brother from the time when he returned to england to the time when he told you he should remember his nieces birthday and read that  he gave me the extract from the colonels will i have got it by me while i write these words and i copy it as follows for your benefit  thirdly and lastly i give and bequeath to my niece rachel verinder daughter and only child of my sister julia verinder widowif her mother the said julia verinder shall be living on the said rachel verinders next birthday after my deaththe yellow diamond belonging to me and known in the east by the name of the moonstone subject to this condition that her mother the said julia verinder shall be living at the time and i hereby desire my executor to give my diamond either by his own hands or by the hands of some trustworthy representative whom he shall appoint into the personal possession of my said niece rachel on her next birthday after my death and in the presence if possible of my sister the said julia verinder and i desire that my said sister may be informed by means of a true copy of this the third and last clause of my will that i give the diamond to her daughter rachel in token of my free forgiveness of the injury which her conduct towards me has been the means of inflicting on my reputation in my lifetime and especially in proof that i pardon as becomes a dying man the insult offered to me as an officer and a gentleman when her servant by her orders closed the door of her house against me on the occasion of her daughters birthday  more words followed these providing if my lady was dead or if miss rachel was dead at the time of the testators decease for the diamond being sent to holland in accordance with the sealed instructions originally deposited with it the proceeds of the sale were in that case to be added to the money already left by the will for the professorship of chemistry at the university in the north  i handed the paper back to mr franklin sorely troubled what to say to him up to that moment my own opinion had been as you know that the colonel had died as wickedly as he had lived i dont say the copy from his will actually converted me from that opinion i only say it staggered me  well says mr franklin now you have read the colonels own statement what do you say in bringing the moonstone to my aunts house am i serving his vengeance blindfold or am i vindicating him in the character of a penitent and christian man  it seems hard to say sir i answered that he died with a horrid revenge in his heart and a horrid lie on his lips god alone knows the truth dont ask me  mr franklin sat twisting and turning the extract from the will in his fingers as if he expected to squeeze the truth out of it in that manner he altered quite remarkably at the same time from being brisk and bright he now became most unaccountably a slow solemn and pondering young man  this question has two sides he said an objective side and a subjective side which are we to take  he had had a german education as well as a french one of the two had been in undisturbed possession of him as i supposed up to this time and now as well as i could make out the other was taking its place it is one of my rules in life never to notice what i dont understand i steered a middle course between the objective side and the subjective side in plain english i stared hard and said nothing  lets extract the inner meaning of this says mr franklin why did my uncle leave the diamond to rachel why didnt he leave it to my aunt  thats not beyond guessing sir at any rate i said colonel herncastle knew my lady well enough to know that she would have refused to accept any legacy that came to her from him  how did he know that rachel might not refuse to accept it too  is there any young lady in existence sir who could resist the temptation of accepting such a birthday present as the moonstone  thats the subjective view says mr franklin it does you great credit betteredge to be able to take the subjective view but theres another mystery about the colonels legacy which is not accounted for yet how are we to explain his only giving rachel her birthday present conditionally on her mother being alive  i dont want to slander a dead man sir i answered but if he has purposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to his sister by the means of her child it must be a legacy made conditional on his sisters being alive to feel the vexation of it  oh thats your interpretation of his motive is it the subjective interpretation again have you ever been in germany betteredge  no sir whats your interpretation if you please  i can see says mr franklin that the colonels object may quite possibly have beennot to benefit his niece whom he had never even seenbut to prove to his sister that he had died forgiving her and to prove it very prettily by means of a present made to her child there is a totally different explanation from yours betteredge taking its rise in a subjectiveobjective point of view from all i can see one interpretation is just as likely to be right as the other  having brought matters to this pleasant and comforting issue mr franklin appeared to think that he had completed all that was required of him he laid down flat on his back on the sand and asked what was to be done next  he had been so clever and clearheaded before he began to talk the foreign gibberish and had so completely taken the lead in the business up to the present time that i was quite unprepared for such a sudden change as he now exhibited in this helpless leaning upon me it was not till later that i learnedby assistance of miss rachel who was the first to make the discoverythat these puzzling shifts and transformations in mr franklin were due to the effect on him of his foreign training at the age when we are all of us most apt to take our colouring in the form of a reflection from the colouring of other people he had been sent abroad and had been passed on from one nation to another before there was time for any one colouring more than another to settle itself on him firmly as a consequence of this he had come back with so many different sides to his character all more or less jarring with each other that he seemed to pass his life in a state of perpetual contradiction with himself he could be a busy man and a lazy man cloudy in the head and clear in the head a model of determination and a spectacle of helplessness all together he had his french side and his german side and his italian sidethe original english foundation showing through every now and then as much as to say here i am sorely transmogrified as you see but theres something of me left at the bottom of him still miss rachel used to remark that the italian side of him was uppermost on those occasions when he unexpectedly gave in and asked you in his nice sweettempered way to take his own responsibilities on your shoulders you will do him no injustice i think if you conclude that the italian side of him was uppermost now  isnt it your business sir i asked to know what to do next surely it cant be mine  mr franklin didnt appear to see the force of my questionnot being in a position at the time to see anything but the sky over his head  i dont want to alarm my aunt without reason he said and i dont want to leave her without what may be a needful warning if you were in my place betteredge tell me in one word what would you do  in one word i told him wait  with all my heart says mr franklin how long  i proceeded to explain myself  as i understand it sir i said somebody is bound to put this plaguy diamond into miss rachels hands on her birthdayand you may as well do it as another very good this is the twentyfifth of may and the birthday is on the twentyfirst of june we have got close on four weeks before us lets wait and see what happens in that time and lets warn my lady or not as the circumstances direct us  perfect betteredge as far as it goes says mr franklin but between this and the birthday whats to be done with the diamond  what your father did with it to be sure sir i answered your father put it in the safe keeping of a bank in london you put in the safe keeping of the bank at frizinghall frizinghall was our nearest town and the bank of england wasnt safer than the bank there if i were you sir i added i would ride straight away with it to frizinghall before the ladies come back  the prospect of doing somethingand what is more of doing that something on a horsebrought mr franklin up like lightning from the flat of his back he sprang to his feet and pulled me up without ceremony on to mine betteredge you are worth your weight in gold he said come along and saddle the best horse in the stables directly  here god bless it was the original english foundation of him showing through all the foreign varnish at last here was the master franklin i remembered coming out again in the good old way at the prospect of a ride and reminding me of the good old times saddle a horse for him i would have saddled a dozen horses if he could only have ridden them all  we went back to the house in a hurry we had the fleetest horse in the stables saddled in a hurry and mr franklin rattled off in a hurry to lodge the cursed diamond once more in the strongroom of a bank when i heard the last of his horses hoofs on the drive and when i turned about in the yard and found i was alone again i felt half inclined to ask myself if i hadnt woke up from a dream    chapter vii   while i was in this bewildered frame of mind sorely needing a little quiet time by myself to put me right again my daughter penelope got in my way just as her late mother used to get in my way on the stairs and instantly summoned me to tell her all that had passed at the conference between mr franklin and me under present circumstances the one thing to be done was to clap the extinguisher upon penelopes curiosity on the spot i accordingly replied that mr franklin and i had both talked of foreign politics till we could talk no longer and had then mutually fallen asleep in the heat of the sun try that sort of answer when your wife or your daughter next worries you with an awkward question at an awkward time and depend on the natural sweetness of women for kissing and making it up again at the next opportunity  the afternoon wore on and my lady and miss rachel came back  needless to say how astonished they were when they heard that mr franklin blake had arrived and had gone off again on horseback needless also to say that they asked awkward questions directly and that the foreign politics and the falling asleep in the sun wouldnt serve a second time over with them being at the end of my invention i said mr franklins arrival by the early train was entirely attributable to one of mr franklins freaks being asked upon that whether his galloping off again on horseback was another of mr franklins freaks i said yes it was and slipped out of iti think very cleverlyin that way  having got over my difficulties with the ladies i found more difficulties waiting for me when i went back to my own room in came penelopewith the natural sweetness of womento kiss and make it up again andwith the natural curiosity of womento ask another question this time she only wanted me to tell her what was the matter with our second housemaid rosanna spearman  after leaving mr franklin and me at the shivering sand rosanna it appeared had returned to the house in a very unaccountable state of mind she had turned if penelope was to be believed all the colours of the rainbow she had been merry without reason and sad without reason in one breath she asked hundreds of questions about mr franklin blake and in another breath she had been angry with penelope for presuming to suppose that a strange gentleman could possess any interest for her she had been surprised smiling and scribbling mr franklins name inside her workbox she had been surprised again crying and looking at her deformed shoulder in the glass had she and mr franklin known anything of each other before today quite impossible had they heard anything of each other impossible again i could speak to mr franklins astonishment as genuine when he saw how the girl stared at him penelope could speak to the girls inquisitiveness as genuine when she asked questions about mr franklin the conference between us conducted in this way was tiresome enough until my daughter suddenly ended it by bursting out with what i thought the most monstrous supposition i had ever heard in my life  father says penelope quite seriously theres only one explanation of it rosanna has fallen in love with mr franklin blake at first sight  you have heard of beautiful young ladies falling in love at first sight and have thought it natural enough but a housemaid out of a reformatory with a plain face and a deformed shoulder falling in love at first sight with a gentleman who comes on a visit to her mistresss house match me that in the way of an absurdity out of any storybook in christendom if you can i laughed till the tears rolled down my cheeks penelope resented my merriment in rather a strange way i never knew you cruel before father she said very gently and went out  my girls words fell upon me like a splash of cold water i was savage with myself for feeling uneasy in myself the moment she had spoken thembut so it was we will change the subject if you please i am sorry i drifted into writing about it and not without reason as you will see when we have gone on together a little longer  the evening came and the dressingbell for dinner rang before mr franklin returned from frizinghall i took his hot water up to his room myself expecting to hear after this extraordinary delay that something had happened to my great disappointment and no doubt to yours also nothing had happened he had not met with the indians either going or returning he had deposited the moonstone in the bankdescribing it merely as a valuable of great priceand he had got the receipt for it safe in his pocket i went downstairs feeling that this was rather a flat ending after all our excitement about the diamond earlier in the day  how the meeting between mr franklin and his aunt and cousin went off is more than i can tell you  i would have given something to have waited at table that day but in my position in the household waiting at dinner except on high family festivals was letting down my dignity in the eyes of the other servantsa thing which my lady considered me quite prone enough to do already without seeking occasions for it the news brought to me from the upper regions that evening came from penelope and the footman penelope mentioned that she had never known miss rachel so particular about the dressing of her hair and had never seen her look so bright and pretty as she did when she went down to meet mr franklin in the drawingroom the footmans report was that the preservation of a respectful composure in the presence of his betters and the waiting on mr franklin blake at dinner were two of the hardest things to reconcile with each other that had ever tried his training in service later in the evening we heard them singing and playing duets mr franklin piping high miss rachel piping higher and my lady on the piano following them as it were over hedge and ditch and seeing them safe through it in a manner most wonderful and pleasant to hear through the open windows on the terrace at night later still i went to mr franklin in the smokingroom with the sodawater and brandy and found that miss rachel had put the diamond clean out of his head shes the most charming girl i have seen since i came back to england was all i could extract from him when i endeavoured to lead the conversation to more serious things  towards midnight i went round the house to lock up accompanied by my second in command samuel the footman as usual when all the doors were made fast except the side door that opened on the terrace i sent samuel to bed and stepped out for a breath of fresh air before i too went to bed in my turn  the night was still and close and the moon was at the full in the heavens it was so silent out of doors that i heard from time to time very faint and low the fall of the sea as the groundswell heaved it in on the sandbank near the mouth of our little bay as the house stood the terrace side was the dark side but the broad moonlight showed fair on the gravel walk that ran along the next side to the terrace looking this way after looking up at the sky i saw the shadow of a person in the moonlight thrown forward from behind the corner of the house  being old and sly i forbore to call out but being also unfortunately old and heavy my feet betrayed me on the gravel before i could steal suddenly round the corner as i had proposed i heard lighter feet than mineand more than one pair of them as i thoughtretreating in a hurry by the time i had got to the corner the trespassers whoever they were had run into the shrubbery at the off side of the walk and were hidden from sight among the thick trees and bushes in that part of the grounds from the shrubbery they could easily make their way over our fence into the road if i had been forty years younger i might have had a chance of catching them before they got clear of our premises as it was i went back to set agoing a younger pair of legs than mine without disturbing anybody samuel and i got a couple of guns and went all round the house and through the shrubbery having made sure that no persons were lurking about anywhere in our grounds we turned back passing over the walk where i had seen the shadow i now noticed for the first time a little bright object lying on the clean gravel under the light of the moon picking the object up i discovered it was a small bottle containing a thick sweetsmelling liquor as black as ink  i said nothing to samuel but remembering what penelope had told me about the jugglers and the pouring of the little pool of ink into the palm of the boys hand i instantly suspected that i had disturbed the three indians lurking about the house and bent in their heathenish way on discovering the whereabouts of the diamond that night    chapter viii   here for one moment i find it necessary to call a halt  on summoning up my own recollectionsand on getting penelope to help me by consulting her journali find that we may pass pretty rapidly over the interval between mr franklin blakes arrival and miss rachels birthday for the greater part of that time the days passed and brought nothing with them worth recording with your good leave then and with penelopes help i shall notice certain dates only in this place reserving to myself to tell the story day by day once more as soon as we get to the time when the business of the moonstone became the chief business of everybody in our house  this said we may now go on againbeginning of course with the bottle of sweetsmelling ink which i found on the gravel walk at night  on the next morning the morning of the twentysixth i showed mr franklin this article of jugglery and told him what i have already told you his opinion was not only that the indians had been lurking about after the diamond but also that they were actually foolish enough to believe in their own magicmeaning thereby the making of signs on a boys head and the pouring of ink into a boys hand and then expecting him to see persons and things beyond the reach of human vision in our country as well as in the east mr franklin informed me there are people who practise this curious hocuspocus without the ink however and who call it by a french name signifying something like brightness of sight depend upon it says mr franklin the indians took it for granted that we should keep the diamond here and they brought their clairvoyant boy to show them the way to it if they succeeded in getting into the house last night  do you think theyll try again sir i asked  it depends says mr franklin on what the boy can really do if he can see the diamond through the iron safe of the bank at frizinghall we shall be troubled with no more visits from the indians for the present if he cant we shall have another chance of catching them in the shrubbery before many more nights are over our heads  i waited pretty confidently for that latter chance but strange to relate it never came  whether the jugglers heard in the town of mr franklin having been seen at the bank and drew their conclusions accordingly or whether the boy really did see the diamond where the diamond was now lodged which i for one flatly disbelieve or whether after all it was a mere effect of chance this at any rate is the plain truthnot the ghost of an indian came near the house again through the weeks that passed before miss rachels birthday the jugglers remained in and about the town plying their trade and mr franklin and i remained waiting to see what might happen and resolute not to put the rogues on their guard by showing our suspicions of them too soon with this report of the proceedings on either side ends all that i have to say about the indians for the present  on the twentyninth of the month miss rachel and mr franklin hit on a new method of working their way together through the time which might otherwise have hung heavy on their hands there are reasons for taking particular notice here of the occupation that amused them you will find it has a bearing on something that is still to come  gentlefolks in general have a very awkward rock ahead in lifethe rock ahead of their own idleness their lives being for the most part passed in looking about them for something to do it is curious to seeespecially when their tastes are of what is called the intellectual sorthow often they drift blindfold into some nasty pursuit nine times out of ten they take to torturing something or to spoiling somethingand they firmly believe they are improving their minds when the plain truth is they are only making a mess in the house i have seen them ladies i am sorry to say as well as gentlemen go out day after day for example with empty pillboxes and catch newts and beetles and spiders and frogs and come home and stick pins through the miserable wretches or cut them up without a pang of remorse into little pieces you see my young master or my young mistress poring over one of their spiders insides with a magnifyingglass or you meet one of their frogs walking downstairs without his headand when you wonder what this cruel nastiness means you are told that it means a taste in my young master or my young mistress for natural history sometimes again you see them occupied for hours together in spoiling a pretty flower with pointed instruments out of a stupid curiosity to know what the flower is made of is its colour any prettier or its scent any sweeter when you do know but there the poor souls must get through the time you seethey must get through the time you dabbled in nasty mud and made pies when you were a child and you dabble in nasty science and dissect spiders and spoil flowers when you grow up in the one case and in the other the secret of it is that you have got nothing to think of in your poor empty head and nothing to do with your poor idle hands and so it ends in your spoiling canvas with paints and making a smell in the house or in keeping tadpoles in a glass box full of dirty water and turning everybodys stomach in the house or in chipping off bits of stone here there and everywhere and dropping grit into all the victuals in the house or in staining your fingers in the pursuit of photography and doing justice without mercy on everybodys face in the house it often falls heavy enough no doubt on people who are really obliged to get their living to be forced to work for the clothes that cover them the roof that shelters them and the food that keeps them going but compare the hardest days work you ever did with the idleness that splits flowers and pokes its way into spiders stomachs and thank your stars that your head has got something it must think of and your hands something that they must do  as for mr franklin and miss rachel they tortured nothing i am glad to say they simply confined themselves to making a mess and all they spoilt to do them justice was the panelling of a door  mr franklins universal genius dabbling in everything dabbled in what he called decorative painting he had invented he informed us a new mixture to moisten paint with which he described as a vehicle what it was made of i dont know what it did i can tell you in two wordsit stank miss rachel being wild to try her hand at the new process mr franklin sent to london for the materials mixed them up with accompaniment of a smell which made the very dogs sneeze when they came into the room put an apron and a bib over miss rachels gown and set her to work decorating her own little sittingroomcalled for want of english to name it in her boudoir they began with the inside of the door mr franklin scraped off all the nice varnish with pumicestone and made what he described as a surface to work on miss rachel then covered the surface under his directions and with his help with patterns and devicesgriffins birds flowers cupids and such likecopied from designs made by a famous italian painter whose name escapes me the one i mean who stocked the world with virgin maries and had a sweetheart at the bakers viewed as work this decoration was slow to do and dirty to deal with but our young lady and gentleman never seemed to tire of it when they were not riding or seeing company or taking their meals or piping their songs there they were with their heads together as busy as bees spoiling the door who was the poet who said that satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do if he had occupied my place in the family and had seen miss rachel with her brush and mr franklin with his vehicle he could have written nothing truer of either of them than that  the next date worthy of notice is sunday the fourth of june  on that evening we in the servants hall debated a domestic question for the first time which like the decoration of the door has its bearing on something that is still to come  seeing the pleasure which mr franklin and miss rachel took in each others society and noting what a pretty match they were in all personal respects we naturally speculated on the chance of their putting their heads together with other objects in view besides the ornamenting of a door some of us said there would be a wedding in the house before the summer was over others led by me admitted it was likely enough miss rachel might be married but we doubted for reasons which will presently appear whether her bridegroom would be mr franklin blake  that mr franklin was in love on his side nobody who saw and heard him could doubt the difficulty was to fathom miss rachel let me do myself the honour of making you acquainted with her after which i will leave you to fathom for yourselfif you can  my young ladys eighteenth birthday was the birthday now coming on the twentyfirst of june if you happen to like dark women who i am informed have gone out of fashion latterly in the gay world and if you have no particular prejudice in favour of size i answer for miss rachel as one of the prettiest girls your eyes ever looked on she was small and slim but all in fine proportion from top to toe to see her sit down to see her get up and specially to see her walk was enough to satisfy any man in his senses that the graces of her figure if you will pardon me the expression were in her flesh and not in her clothes her hair was the blackest i ever saw her eyes matched her hair her nose was not quite large enough i admit her mouth and chin were to quote mr franklin morsels for the gods and her complexion on the same undeniable authority was as warm as the sun itself with this great advantage over the sun that it was always in nice order to look at add to the foregoing that she carried her head as upright as a dart in a dashing spirited thoroughbred waythat she had a clear voice with a ring of the right metal in it and a smile that began very prettily in her eyes before it got to her lipsand there behold the portrait of her to the best of my painting as large as life  and what about her disposition next had this charming creature no faults she had just as many faults as you have maamneither more nor less  to put it seriously my dear pretty miss rachel possessing a host of graces and attractions had one defect which strict impartiality compels me to acknowledge she was unlike most other girls of her age in thisthat she had ideas of her own and was stiffnecked enough to set the fashions themselves at defiance if the fashions didnt suit her views in trifles this independence of hers was all well enough but in matters of importance it carried her as my lady thought and as i thought too far she judged for herself as few women of twice her age judge in general never asked your advice never told you beforehand what she was going to do never came with secrets and confidences to anybody from her mother downwards in little things and great with people she loved and people she hated and she did both with equal heartiness miss rachel always went on a way of her own sufficient for herself in the joys and sorrows of her life over and over again i have heard my lady say rachels best friend and rachels worst enemy are one and the otherrachel herself  add one thing more to this and i have done  with all her secrecy and selfwill there was not so much as the shadow of anything false in her i never remember her breaking her word i never remember her saying no and meaning yes i can call to mind in her childhood more than one occasion when the good little soul took the blame and suffered the punishment for some fault committed by a playfellow whom she loved nobody ever knew her to confess to it when the thing was found out and she was charged with it afterwards but nobody ever knew her to lie about it either she looked you straight in the face and shook her little saucy head and said plainly i wont tell you punished again for this she would own to being sorry for saying wont but bread and water notwithstanding she never told you selfwilleddevilish selfwilled sometimesi grant but the finest creature nevertheless that ever walked the ways of this lower world perhaps you think you see a certain contradiction here in that case a word in your ear study your wife closely for the next fourandtwenty hours if your good lady doesnt exhibit something in the shape of a contradiction in that time heaven help youyou have married a monster  i have now brought you acquainted with miss rachel which you will find puts us face to face next with the question of that young ladys matrimonial views  on june the twelfth an invitation from my mistress was sent to a gentleman in london to come and help to keep miss rachels birthday this was the fortunate individual on whom i believed her heart to be privately set like mr franklin he was a cousin of hers his name was mr godfrey ablewhite  my ladys second sister dont be alarmed we are not going very deep into family matters this timemy ladys second sister i say had a disappointment in love and taking a husband afterwards on the neck or nothing principle made what they call a misalliance there was terrible work in the family when the honourable caroline insisted on marrying plain mr ablewhite the banker at frizinghall he was very rich and very respectable and he begot a prodigious large familyall in his favour so far but he had presumed to raise himself from a low station in the worldand that was against him however time and the progress of modern enlightenment put things right and the misalliance passed muster very well we are all getting liberal now and provided you can scratch me if i scratch you what do i care in or out of parliament whether you are a dustman or a duke thats the modern way of looking at itand i keep up with the modern way the ablewhites lived in a fine house and grounds a little out of frizinghall very worthy people and greatly respected in the neighbourhood we shall not be much troubled with them in these pagesexcepting mr godfrey who was mr ablewhites second son and who must take his proper place here if you please for miss rachels sake  with all his brightness and cleverness and general good qualities mr franklins chance of topping mr godfrey in our young ladys estimation was in my opinion a very poor chance indeed  in the first place mr godfrey was in point of size the finest man by far of the two he stood over six feet high he had a beautiful red and white colour a smooth round face shaved as bare as your hand and a head of lovely long flaxen hair falling negligently over the poll of his neck but why do i try to give you this personal description of him if you ever subscribed to a ladies charity in london you know mr godfrey ablewhite as well as i do he was a barrister by profession a ladies man by temperament and a good samaritan by choice female benevolence and female destitution could do nothing without him maternal societies for confining poor women magdalen societies for rescuing poor women strongminded societies for putting poor women into poor mens places and leaving the men to shift for themselveshe was vicepresident manager referee to them all wherever there was a table with a committee of ladies sitting round it in council there was mr godfrey at the bottom of the board keeping the temper of the committee and leading the dear creatures along the thorny ways of business hat in hand i do suppose this was the most accomplished philanthropist on a small independence that england ever produced as a speaker at charitable meetings the like of him for drawing your tears and your money was not easy to find he was quite a public character the last time i was in london my mistress gave me two treats she sent me to the theatre to see a dancing woman who was all the rage and she sent me to exeter hall to hear mr godfrey the lady did it with a band of music the gentleman did it with a handkerchief and a glass of water crowds at the performance with the legs ditto at the performance with the tongue and with all this the sweetest tempered person i allude to mr godfreythe simplest and pleasantest and easiest to pleaseyou ever met with he loved everybody and everybody loved him what chance had mr franklinwhat chance had anybody of average reputation and capacitiesagainst such a man as this  on the fourteenth came mr godfreys answer  he accepted my mistresss invitation from the wednesday of the birthday to the evening of fridaywhen his duties to the ladies charities would oblige him to return to town he also enclosed a copy of verses on what he elegantly called his cousins natal day miss rachel i was informed joined mr franklin in making fun of the verses at dinner and penelope who was all on mr franklins side asked me in great triumph what i thought of that miss rachel has led you off on a false scent my dear i replied but my nose is not so easily mystified wait till mr ablewhites verses are followed by mr ablewhite himself  my daughter replied that mr franklin might strike in and try his luck before the verses were followed by the poet in favour of this view i must acknowledge that mr franklin left no chance untried of winning miss rachels good graces  though one of the most inveterate smokers i ever met with he gave up his cigar because she said one day she hated the stale smell of it in his clothes he slept so badly after this effort of selfdenial for want of the composing effect of the tobacco to which he was used and came down morning after morning looking so haggard and worn that miss rachel herself begged him to take to his cigars again no he would take to nothing again that could cause her a moments annoyance he would fight it out resolutely and get back his sleep sooner or later by main force of patience in waiting for it such devotion as this you may say as some of them said downstairs could never fail of producing the right effect on miss rachelbacked up too as it was by the decorating work every day on the door all very wellbut she had a photograph of mr godfrey in her bedroom represented speaking at a public meeting with all his hair blown out by the breath of his own eloquence and his eyes most lovely charming the money out of your pockets what do you say to that every morningas penelope herself owned to methere was the man whom the women couldnt do without looking on in effigy while miss rachel was having her hair combed he would be looking on in reality before longthat was my opinion of it  june the sixteenth brought an event which made mr franklins chance look to my mind a worse chance than ever  a strange gentleman speaking english with a foreign accent came that morning to the house and asked to see mr franklin blake on business the business could not possibly have been connected with the diamond for these two reasonsfirst that mr franklin told me nothing about it secondly that he communicated it when the gentleman had gone as i suppose to my lady she probably hinted something about it next to her daughter at any rate miss rachel was reported to have said some severe things to mr franklin at the piano that evening about the people he had lived among and the principles he had adopted in foreign parts the next day for the first time nothing was done towards the decoration of the door i suspect some imprudence of mr franklins on the continentwith a woman or a debt at the bottom of ithad followed him to england but that is all guesswork in this case not only mr franklin but my lady too for a wonder left me in the dark  on the seventeenth to all appearance the cloud passed away again they returned to their decorating work on the door and seemed to be as good friends as ever if penelope was to be believed mr franklin had seized the opportunity of the reconciliation to make an offer to miss rachel and had neither been accepted nor refused my girl was sure from signs and tokens which i need not trouble you with that her young mistress had fought mr franklin off by declining to believe that he was in earnest and had then secretly regretted treating him in that way afterwards though penelope was admitted to more familiarity with her young mistress than maids generally arefor the two had been almost brought up together as childrenstill i knew miss rachels reserved character too well to believe that she would show her mind to anybody in this way what my daughter told me on the present occasion was as i suspected more what she wished than what she really knew  on the nineteenth another event happened we had the doctor in the house professionally he was summoned to prescribe for a person whom i have had occasion to present to you in these pagesour second housemaid rosanna spearman  this poor girlwho had puzzled me as you know already at the shivering sandpuzzled me more than once again in the interval time of which i am now writing penelopes notion that her fellowservant was in love with mr franklin which my daughter by my orders kept strictly secret seemed to be just as absurd as ever but i must own that what i myself saw and what my daughter saw also of our second housemaids conduct began to look mysterious to say the least of it  for example the girl constantly put herself in mr franklins wayvery slyly and quietly but she did it he took about as much notice of her as he took of the cat it never seemed to occur to him to waste a look on rosannas plain face the poor things appetite never much fell away dreadfully and her eyes in the morning showed plain signs of waking and crying at night one day penelope made an awkward discovery which we hushed up on the spot she caught rosanna at mr franklins dressingtable secretly removing a rose which miss rachel had given him to wear in his buttonhole and putting another rose like it of her own picking in its place she was after that once or twice impudent to me when i gave her a wellmeant general hint to be careful in her conduct and worse still she was not overrespectful now on the few occasions when miss rachel accidentally spoke to her  my lady noticed the change and asked me what i thought about it i tried to screen the girl by answering that i thought she was out of health and it ended in the doctor being sent for as already mentioned on the nineteenth he said it was her nerves and doubted if she was fit for service my lady offered to remove her for change of air to one of our farms inland she begged and prayed with the tears in her eyes to be let to stop and in an evil hour i advised my lady to try her for a little longer as the event proved and as you will soon see this was the worst advice i could have given if i could only have looked a little way into the future i would have taken rosanna spearman out of the house then and there with my own hand  on the twentieth there came a note from mr godfrey he had arranged to stop at frizinghall that night having occasion to consult his father on business on the afternoon of the next day he and his two eldest sisters would ride over to us on horseback in good time before dinner an elegant little casket in china accompanied the note presented to miss rachel with her cousins love and best wishes mr franklin had only given her a plain locket not worth half the money my daughter penelope neverthelesssuch is the obstinacy of womenstill backed him to win  thanks be to heaven we have arrived at the eve of the birthday at last you will own i think that i have got you over the ground this time without much loitering by the way cheer up ill ease you with another new chapter hereand what is more that chapter shall take you straight into the thick of the story    chapter ix   june twentyfirst the day of the birthday was cloudy and unsettled at sunrise but towards noon it cleared up bravely  we in the servants hall began this happy anniversary as usual by offering our little presents to miss rachel with the regular speech delivered annually by me as the chief i follow the plan adopted by the queen in opening parliamentnamely the plan of saying much the same thing regularly every year before it is delivered my speech like the queens is looked for as eagerly as if nothing of the kind had ever been heard before when it is delivered and turns out not to be the novelty anticipated though they grumble a little they look forward hopefully to something newer next year an easy people to govern in the parliament and in the kitchenthats the moral of it after breakfast mr franklin and i had a private conference on the subject of the moonstonethe time having now come for removing it from the bank at frizinghall and placing it in miss rachels own hands  whether he had been trying to make love to his cousin again and had got a rebuffor whether his broken rest night after night was aggravating the queer contradictions and uncertainties in his characteri dont know but certain it is that mr franklin failed to show himself at his best on the morning of the birthday he was in twenty different minds about the diamond in as many minutes for my part i stuck fast by the plain facts aa we knew them nothing had happened to justify us in alarming my lady on the subject of the jewel and nothing could alter the legal obligation that now lay on mr franklin to put it in his cousins possession that was my view of the matter and twist and turn it as he might he was forced in the end to make it his view too we arranged that he was to ride over after lunch to frizinghall and bring the diamond back with mr godfrey and the two young ladies in all probability to keep him company on the way home again  this settled our young gentleman went back to miss rachel  they consumed the whole morning and part of the afternoon in the everlasting business of decorating the door penelope standing by to mix the colours as directed and my lady as luncheon time drew near going in and out of the room with her handkerchief to her nose for they used a deal of mr franklins vehicle that day and trying vainly to get the two artists away from their work it was three oclock before they took off their aprons and released penelope much the worse for the vehicle and cleaned themselves of their mess but they had done what they wantedthey had finished the door on the birthday and proud enough they were of it the griffins cupids and so on were i must own most beautiful to behold though so many in number so entangled in flowers and devices and so topsyturvy in their actions and attitudes that you felt them unpleasantly in your head for hours after you had done with the pleasure of looking at them if i add that penelope ended her part of the mornings work by being sick in the backkitchen it is in no unfriendly spirit towards the vehicle no no it left off stinking when it dried and if art requires these sort of sacrificesthough the girl is my own daughteri say let art have them  mr franklin snatched a morsel from the luncheontable and rode off to frizinghallto escort his cousins as he told my lady to fetch the moonstone as was privately known to himself and to me  this being one of the high festivals on which i took my place at the sideboard in command of the attendance at table i had plenty to occupy my mind while mr franklin was away having seen to the wine and reviewed my men and women who were to wait at dinner i retired to collect myself before the company came a whiff ofyou know what and a turn at a certain book which i have had occasion to mention in these pages composed me body and mind i was aroused from what i am inclined to think must have been not a nap but a reverie by the clatter of horses hoofs outside and going to the door received a cavalcade comprising mr franklin and his three cousins escorted by one of old mr ablewhites grooms  mr godfrey struck me strangely enough as being like mr franklin in this respectthat he did not seem to be in his customary spirits he kindly shook hands with me as usual and was most politely glad to see his old friend betteredge wearing so well but there was a sort of cloud over him which i couldnt at all account for and when i asked how he had found his father in health he answered rather shortly much as usual however the two miss ablewhites were cheerful enough for twenty which more than restored the balance they were nearly as big as their brother spanking yellowhaired rosy lasses overflowing with superabundant flesh and blood bursting from head to foot with health and spirits the legs of the poor horses trembled with carrying them and when they jumped from their saddles without waiting to be helped i declare they bounced on the ground as if they were made of indiarubber everything the miss ablewhites said began with a large o everything they did was done with a bang and they giggled and screamed in season and out of season on the smallest provocation bouncersthats what i call them  under cover of the noise made by the young ladies i had an opportunity of saying a private word to mr franklin in the hall  have you got the diamond safe sir  he nodded and tapped the breastpocket of his coat  have you seen anything of the indians  not a glimpse with that answer he asked for my lady and hearing she was in the small drawingroom went there straight the bell rang before he had been a minute in the room and penelope was sent to tell miss rachel that mr franklin blake wanted to speak to her  crossing the hall about half an hour afterwards i was brought to a sudden standstill by an outbreak of screams from the small drawingroom i cant say i was at all alarmed for i recognised in the screams the favourite large o of the miss ablewhites however i went in on pretence of asking for instructions about the dinner to discover whether anything serious had really happened  there stood miss rachel at the table like a person fascinated with the colonels unlucky diamond in her hand there on either side of her knelt the two bouncers devouring the jewel with their eyes and screaming with ecstasy every time it flashed on them in a new light there at the opposite side of the table stood mr godfrey clapping his hands like a large child and singing out softly exquisite exquisite there sat mr franklin in a chair by the bookcase tugging at his beard and looking anxiously towards the window and there at the window stood the object he was contemplatingmy lady having the extract from the colonels will in her hand and keeping her back turned on the whole of the company  she faced me when i asked for my instructions and i saw the family frown gathering over her eyes and the family temper twitching at the corners of her mouth  come to my room in half an hour she answered i shall have something to say to you then  with those words she went out it was plain enough that she was posed by the same difficulty which had posed mr franklin and me in our conference at the shivering sand was the legacy of the moonstone a proof that she had treated her brother with cruel injustice or was it a proof that he was worse than the worst she had ever thought of him serious questions those for my lady to determine while her daughter innocent of all knowledge of the colonels character stood there with the colonels birthday gift in her hand  before i could leave the room in my turn miss rachel always considerate to the old servant who had been in the house when she was born stopped me look gabriel she said and flashed the jewel before my eyes in a ray of sunlight that poured through the window  lord bless us it was a diamond as large or nearly as a plovers egg the light that streamed from it was like the light of the harvest moon when you looked down into the stone you looked into a yellow deep that drew your eyes into it so that they saw nothing else it seemed unfathomable this jewel that you could hold between your finger and thumb seemed unfathomable as the heavens themselves we set it in the sun and then shut the light out of the room and it shone awfully out of the depths of its own brightness with a moony gleam in the dark no wonder miss rachel was fascinated no wonder her cousins screamed the diamond laid such a hold on me that i burst out with as large an o as the bouncers themselves the only one of us who kept his senses was mr godfrey he put an arm round each of his sisters waists and looking compassionately backwards and forwards between the diamond and me said carbon betteredge mere carbon my good friend after all  his object i suppose was to instruct me all he did however was to remind me of the dinner i hobbled off to my army of waiters downstairs as i went out mr godfrey said dear old betteredge i have the truest regard for him he was embracing his sisters and ogling miss rachel while he honoured me with that testimony of affection something like a stock of love to draw on there mr franklin was a perfect savage by comparison with him  at the end of half an hour i presented myself as directed in my ladys room  what passed between my mistress and me on this occasion was in the main a repetition of what had passed between mr franklin and me at the shivering sandwith this difference that i took care to keep my own counsel about the jugglers seeing that nothing had happened to justify me in alarming my lady on this head when i received my dismissal i could see that she took the blackest view possible of the colonels motives and that she was bent on getting the moonstone out of her daughters possession at the first opportunity  on my way back to my own part of the house i was encountered by mr franklin he wanted to know if i had seen anything of his cousin rachel i had seen nothing of her could i tell him where his cousin godfrey was i didnt know but i began to suspect that cousin godfrey might not be far away from cousin rachel mr franklins suspicions apparently took the same turn he tugged hard at his beard and went and shut himself up in the library with a bang of the door that had a world of meaning in it  i was interrupted no more in the business of preparing for the birthday dinner till it was time for me to smarten myself up for receiving the company just as i had got my white waistcoat on penelope presented herself at my toilet on pretence of brushing what little hair i have got left and improving the tie of my white cravat my girl was in high spirits and i saw she had something to say to me she gave me a kiss on the top of my bald head and whispered news for you father miss rachel has refused him  whos him i asked  the ladies committeeman father says penelope a nasty sly fellow i hate him for trying to supplant mr franklin  if i had had breath enough i should certainly have protested against this indecent way of speaking of an eminent philanthropic character but my daughter happened to be improving the tie of my cravat at that moment and the whole strength of her feelings found its way into her fingers i never was more nearly strangled in my life  i saw him take her away alone into the rosegarden says penelope and i waited behind the holly to see how they came back they had gone out arminarm both laughing they came back walking separate as grave as grave could be and looking straight away from each other in a manner which there was no mistaking i never was more delighted father in my life theres one woman in the world who can resist mr godfrey ablewhite at any rate and if i was a lady i should be another  here i should have protested again but my daughter had got the hairbrush by this time and the whole strength of her feelings had passed into that if you are bald you will understand how she sacrificed me if you are not skip this bit and thank god you have got something in the way of a defence between your hairbrush and your head  just on the other side of the holly penelope went on mr godfrey came to a standstill you prefer says he that i should stop here as if nothing had happened miss rachel turned on him like lightning you have accepted my mothers invitation she said and you are here to meet her guests unless you wish to make a scandal in the house you will remain of course she went on a few steps and then seemed to relent a little let us forget what has passed godfrey she said and let us remain cousins still she gave him her hand he kissed it which i should have considered taking a liberty and then she left him he waited a little by himself with his head down and his heel grinding a hole slowly in the gravel walk you never saw a man look more put out in your life awkward he said between his teeth when he looked up and went on to the housevery awkward if that was his opinion of himself he was quite right awkward enough im sure and the end of it is father what i told you all along cries penelope finishing me off with a last scarification the hottest of all mr franklins the man  i got possession of the hairbrush and opened my lips to administer the reproof which you will own my daughters language and conduct richly deserved  before i could say a word the crash of carriagewheels outside struck in and stopped me the first of the dinnercompany had come penelope instantly ran off i put on my coat and looked in the glass my head was as red as a lobster but in other respects i was as nicely dressed for the ceremonies of the evening as a man need be i got into the hall just in time to announce the two first of the guests you neednt feel particularly interested about them only the philanthropists father and mothermr and mrs ablewhite    chapter x   one on the top of the other the rest of the company followed the ablewhites till we had the whole tale of them complete including the family they were twentyfour in all it was a noble sight to see when they were settled in their places round the dinnertable and the rector of frizinghall with beautiful elocution rose and said grace  there is no need to worry you with a list of the guests you will meet none of them a second timein my part of the story at any ratewith the exception of two  those two sat on either side of miss rachel who as queen of the day was naturally the great attraction of the party on this occasion she was more particularly the centrepoint towards which everybodys eyes were directed for to my ladys secret annoyance she wore her wonderful birthday present which eclipsed all the restthe moonstone it was without any setting when it had been placed in her hands but that universal genius mr franklin had contrived with the help of his neat fingers and a little bit of silver wire to fix it as a brooch in the bosom of her white dress everybody wondered at the prodigious size and beauty of the diamond as a matter of course but the only two of the company who said anything out of the common way about it were those two guests i have mentioned who sat by miss rachel on her right hand and her left  the guest on her left was mr candy our doctor at frizinghall  this was a pleasant companionable little man with the drawback however i must own of being too fond in season and out of season of his joke and of his plunging in rather a headlong manner into talk with strangers without waiting to feel his way first in society he was constantly making mistakes and setting people unintentionally by the ears together in his medical practice he was a more prudent man picking up his discretion as his enemies said by a kind of instinct and proving to be generally right where more carefully conducted doctors turned out to be wrong  what he said about the diamond to miss rachel was said as usual by way of a mystification or joke he gravely entreated her in the interests of science to let him take it home and burn it we will first heat it miss rachel says the doctor to such and such a degree then we will expose it to a current of air and little by littlepuffwe evaporate the diamond and spare you a world of anxiety about the safe keeping of a valuable precious stone my lady listening with rather a careworn expression on her face seemed to wish that the doctor had been in earnest and that he could have found miss rachel zealous enough in the cause of science to sacrifice her birthday gift  the other guest who sat on my young ladys right hand was an eminent public characterbeing no other than the celebrated indian traveller mr murthwaite who at risk of his life had penetrated in disguise where no european had ever set foot before  this was a long lean wiry brown silent man he had a weary look and a very steady attentive eye it was rumoured that he was tired of the humdrum life among the people in our parts and longing to go back and wander off on the tramp again in the wild places of the east except what he said to miss rachel about her jewel i doubt if he spoke six words or drank so much as a single glass of wine all through the dinner the moonstone was the only object that interested him in the smallest degree the fame of it seemed to have reached him in some of those perilous indian places where his wanderings had lain after looking at it silently for so long a time that miss rachel began to get confused he said to her in his cool immovable way if you ever go to india miss verinder dont take your uncles birthday gift with you a hindoo diamond is sometimes part of a hindoo religion i know a certain city and a certain temple in that city where dressed as you are now your life would not be worth five minutes purchase miss rachel safe in england was quite delighted to hear of her danger in india the bouncers were more delighted still they dropped their knives and forks with a crash and burst out together vehemently o how interesting my lady fidgeted in her chair and changed the subject  as the dinner got on i became aware little by little that this festival was not prospering as other like festivals had prospered before it  looking back at the birthday now by the light of what happened afterwards i am half inclined to think that the cursed diamond must have cast a blight on the whole company i plied them well with wine and being a privileged character followed the unpopular dishes round the table and whispered to the company confidentially please to change your mind and try it for i know it will do you good nine times out of ten they changed their mindsout of regard for their old original betteredge they were pleased to saybut all to no purpose there were gaps of silence in the talk as the dinner got on that made me feel personally uncomfortable when they did use their tongues again they used them innocently in the most unfortunate manner and to the worst possible purpose mr candy the doctor for instance said more unlucky things than i ever knew him to say before take one sample of the way in which he went on and you will understand what i had to put up with at the sideboard officiating as i was in the character of a man who had the prosperity of the festival at heart  one of our ladies present at dinner was worthy mrs threadgall widow of the late professor of that name talking of her deceased husband perpetually this good lady never mentioned to strangers that he was deceased she thought i suppose that every ablebodied adult in england ought to know as much as that in one of the gaps of silence somebody mentioned the dry and rather nasty subject of human anatomy whereupon good mrs threadgall straightway brought in her late husband as usual without mentioning that he was dead anatomy she described as the professors favourite recreation in his leisure hours as illluck would have it mr candy sitting opposite who knew nothing of the deceased gentleman heard her being the most polite of men he seized the opportunity of assisting the professors anatomical amusements on the spot  they have got some remarkably fine skeletons lately at the college of surgeons says mr candy across the table in a loud cheerful voice i strongly recommend the professor maam when he next has an hour to spare to pay them a visit  you might have heard a pin fall the company out of respect to the professors memory all sat speechless i was behind mrs threadgall at the time plying her confidentially with a glass of hock she dropped her head and said in a very low voice my beloved husband is no more  unluckily mr candy hearing nothing and miles away from suspecting the truth went on across the table louder and politer than ever   the professor may not be aware says he that the card of a member of the college will admit him on any day but sunday between the hours of ten and four  mrs threadgall dropped her head right into her tucker and in a lower voice still repeated the solemn words my beloved husband is no more  i winked hard at mr candy across the table miss rachel touched his arm my lady looked unutterable things at him quite useless on he went with a cordiality that there was no stopping anyhow i shall be delighted says he to send the professor my card if you will oblige me by mentioning his present address  his present address sir is the grave says mrs threadgall suddenly losing her temper and speaking with an emphasis and fury that made the glasses ring again the professor has been dead these ten years  oh good heavens says mr candy excepting the bouncers who burst out laughing such a blank now fell on the company that they might all have been going the way of the professor and hailing as he did from the direction of the grave  so much for mr candy the rest of them were nearly as provoking in their different ways as the doctor himself when they ought to have spoken they didnt speak or when they did speak they were perpetually at cross purposes mr godfrey though so eloquent in public declined to exert himself in private whether he was sulky or whether he was bashful after his discomfiture in the rosegarden i cant say he kept all his talk for the private ear of the lady a member of our family who sat next to him she was one of his committeewomena spirituallyminded person with a fine show of collarbone and a pretty taste in champagne liked it dry you understand and plenty of it being close behind these two at the sideboard i can testify from what i heard pass between them that the company lost a good deal of very improving conversation which i caught up while drawing the corks and carving the mutton and so forth what they said about their charities i didnt hear when i had time to listen to them they had got a long way beyond their women to be confined and their women to be rescued and were disputing on serious subjects religion i understand mr godfrey to say between the corks and the carving meant love and love meant religion and earth was heaven a little the worse for wear and heaven was earth done up again to look like new earth had some very objectionable people in it but to make amends for that all the women in heaven would be members of a prodigious committee that never quarrelled with all the men in attendance on them as ministering angels beautiful beautiful but why the mischief did mr godfrey keep it all to his lady and himself  mr franklin againsurely you will say mr franklin stirred the company up into making a pleasant evening of it  nothing of the sort he had quite recovered himself and he was in wonderful force and spirits penelope having informed him i suspect of mr godfreys reception in the rosegarden but talk as he might nine times out of ten he pitched on the wrong subject or he addressed himself to the wrong person the end of it being that he offended some and puzzled all of them that foreign training of histhose french and german and italian sides of him to which i have already alludedcame out at my ladys hospitable board in a most bewildering manner  what do you think for instance of his discussing the lengths to which a married woman might let her admiration go for a man who was not her husband and putting it in his clearheaded witty french way to the maiden aunt of the vicar of frizinghall what do you think when he shifted to the german side of his telling the lord of the manor while that great authority on cattle was quoting his experience in the breeding of bulls that experience properly understood counted for nothing and that the proper way to breed bulls was to look deep into your own mind evolve out of it the idea of a perfect bull and produce him what do you say when our county member growing hot at cheese and salad time about the spread of democracy in england burst out as follows if we once lose our ancient safeguards mr blake i beg to ask you what have we got leftwhat do you say to mr franklin answering from the italian point of view we have got three things left sirlove music and salad he not only terrified the company with such outbreaks as these but when the english side of him turned up in due course he lost his foreign smoothness and getting on the subject of the medical profession said such downright things in ridicule of doctors that he actually put goodhumoured little mr candy in a rage  the dispute between them began in mr franklin being ledi forget howto acknowledge that he had latterly slept very badly at night mr candy thereupon told him that his nerves were all out of order and that he ought to go through a course of medicine immediately mr franklin replied that a course of medicine and a course of groping in the dark meant in his estimation one and the same thing mr candy hitting back smartly said that mr franklin himself was constitutionally speaking groping in the dark after sleep and that nothing but medicine could help him to find it mr franklin keeping the ball up on his side said he had often heard of the blind leading the blind and now for the first time he knew what it meant in this way they kept it going briskly cut and thrust till they both of them got hotmr candy in particular so completely losing his selfcontrol in defence of his profession that my lady was obliged to interfere and forbid the dispute to go on this necessary act of authority put the last extinguisher on the spirits of the company the talk spurted up again here and there for a minute or two at a time but there was a miserable lack of life and sparkle in it the devil or the diamond possessed that dinnerparty and it was a relief to everybody when my mistress rose and gave the ladies the signal to leave the gentlemen over their wine  i had just ranged the decanters in a row before old mr ablewhite who represented the master of the house when there came a sound from the terrace which startled me out of my company manners on the instant mr franklin and i looked at each other it was the sound of the indian drum as i live by bread here were the jugglers returning to us with the return of the moonstone to the house  as they rounded the corner of the terrace and came in sight i hobbled out to warn them off but as illluck would have it the two bouncers were beforehand with me they whizzed out on to the terrace like a couple of skyrockets wild to see the indians exhibit their tricks the other ladies followed the gentlemen came out on their side before you could say lord bless us the rogues were making their salaams and the bouncers were kissing the pretty little boy  mr franklin got on one side of miss rachel and i put myself behind her if our suspicions were right there she stood innocent of all knowledge of the truth showing the indians the diamond in the bosom of her dress  i cant tell you what tricks they performed or how they did it what with the vexation about the dinner and what with the provocation of the rogues coming back just in the nick of time to see the jewel with their own eyes i own i lost my head the first thing that i remember noticing was the sudden appearance on the scene of the indian traveller mr murthwaite skirting the halfcircle in which the gentlefolks stood or sat he came quietly behind the jugglers and spoke to them on a sudden in the language of their own country  if he had pricked them with a bayonet i doubt if the indians could have started and turned on him with a more tigerish quickness than they did on hearing the first words that passed his lips the next moment they were bowing and salaaming to him in their most polite and snaky way after a few words in the unknown tongue had passed on either side mr murthwaite withdrew as quietly as he had approached the chief indian who acted as interpreter thereupon wheeled about again towards the gentlefolks i noticed that the fellows coffeecoloured face had turned grey since mr murthwaite had spoken to him he bowed to my lady and informed her that the exhibition was over the bouncers indescribably disappointed burst out with a loud o directed against mr murthwaite for stopping the performance the chief indian laid his hand humbly on his breast and said a second time that the juggling was over the little boy went round with the hat the ladies withdrew to the drawingroom and the gentlemen excepting mr franklin and mr murthwaite returned to their wine i and the footman followed the indians and saw them safe off the premises  going back by way of the shrubbery i smelt tobacco and found mr franklin and mr murthwaite the latter smoking a cheroot walking slowly up and down among the trees mr franklin beckoned to me to join them  this says mr franklin presenting me to the great traveller is gabriel betteredge the old servant and friend of our family of whom i spoke to you just now tell him if you please what you have just told me  mr murthwaite took his cheroot out of his mouth and leaned in his weary way against the trunk of a tree  mr betteredge he began those three indians are no more jugglers than you and i are  here was a new surprise i naturally asked the traveller if he had ever met with the indians before  never says mr murthwaite but i know what indian juggling really is all you have seen tonight is a very bad and clumsy imitation of it unless after long experience i am utterly mistaken those men are highcaste brahmins i charged them with being disguised and you saw how it told on them clever as the hindoo people are in concealing their feelings there is a mystery about their conduct that i cant explain they have doubly sacrificed their castefirst in crossing the sea secondly in disguising themselves as jugglers in the land they live in that is a tremendous sacrifice to make there must be some very serious motive at the bottom of it and some justification of no ordinary kind to plead for them in recovery of their caste when they return to their own country  i was struck dumb mr murthwaite went on with his cheroot mr franklin after what looked to me like a little private veering about between the different sides of his character broke the silence as follows  i feel some hesitation mr murthwaite in troubling you with family matters in which you can have no interest and which i am not very willing to speak of out of our own circle but after what you have said i feel bound in the interests of lady verinder and her daughter to tell you something which may possibly put the clue into your hands i speak to you in confidence you will oblige me i am sure by not forgetting that  with this preface he told the indian traveller all that he had told me at the shivering sand even the immovable mr murthwaite was so interested in what he heard that he let his cheroot go out  now says mr franklin when he had done what does your experience say  my experience answered the traveller says that you have had more narrow escapes of your life mr franklin blake than i have had of mine and that is saying a great deal  it was mr franklins turn to be astonished now  is it really as serious as that he asked  in my opinion it is answered mr murthwaite i cant doubt after what you have told me that the restoration of the moonstone to its place on the forehead of the indian idol is the motive and the justification of that sacrifice of caste which i alluded to just now those men will wait their opportunity with the patience of cats and will use it with the ferocity of tigers how you have escaped them i cant imagine says the eminent traveller lighting his cheroot again and staring hard at mr franklin you have been carrying the diamond backwards and forwards here and in london and you are still a living man let us try and account for it it was daylight both times i suppose when you took the jewel out of the bank in london  broad daylight says mr franklin  and plenty of people in the streets  plenty  you settled of course to arrive at lady verinders house at a certain time its a lonely country between this and the station did you keep your appointment  no i arrived four hours earlier than my appointment  i beg to congratulate you on that proceeding when did you take the diamond to the bank at the town here  i took it an hour after i had brought it to this houseand three hours before anybody was prepared for seeing me in these parts  i beg to congratulate you again did you bring it back here alone  no i happened to ride back with my cousins and the groom  i beg to congratulate you for the third time if you ever feel inclined to travel beyond the civilised limits mr blake let me know and i will go with you you are a lucky man  here i struck in this sort of thing didnt at all square with my english ideas  you dont really mean to say sir i asked that they would have taken mr franklins life to get their diamond if he had given them the chance  do you smoke mr betteredge says the traveller  yes sir  do you care much for the ashes left in your pipe when you empty it  no sir  in the country those men came from they care just as much about killing a man as you care about emptying the ashes out of your pipe if a thousand lives stood between them and the getting back of their diamondand if they thought they could destroy those lives without discoverythey would take them all the sacrifice of caste is a serious thing in india if you like the sacrifice of life is nothing at all  i expressed my opinion upon this that they were a set of murdering thieves mr murthwaite expressed his opinion that they were a wonderful people mr franklin expressing no opinion at all brought us back to the matter in hand  they have seen the moonstone on miss verinders dress he said what is to be done  what your uncle threatened to do answered mr murthwaite colonel herncastle understood the people he had to deal with send the diamond tomorrow under guard of more than one man to be cut up at amsterdam make half a dozen diamonds of it instead of one there is an end of its sacred identity as the moonstoneand there is an end of the conspiracy  mr franklin turned to me  there is no help for it he said we must speak to lady verinder tomorrow  what about tonight sir i asked suppose the indians come back  mr murthwaite answered me before mr franklin could speak  the indians wont risk coming back tonight he said the direct way is hardly ever the way they take to anythinglet alone a matter like this in which the slightest mistake might be fatal to their reaching their end  but suppose the rogues are bolder than you think sir i persisted  in that case says mr murthwaite let the dogs loose have you got any big dogs in the yard  two sir a mastiff and a bloodhound  they will do in the present emergency mr betteredge the mastiff and the bloodhound have one great meritthey are not likely to be troubled with your scruples about the sanctity of human life  the strumming of the piano reached us from the drawingroom as he fired that shot at me he threw away his cheroot and took mr franklins arm to go back to the ladies i noticed that the sky was clouding over fast as i followed them to the house mr murthwaite noticed it too he looked round at me in his dry droning way and said  the indians will want their umbrellas mr betteredge tonight  it was all very well for him to joke but i was not an eminent travellerand my way in this world had not led me into playing ducks and drakes with my own life among thieves and murderers in the outlandish places of the earth i went into my own little room and sat down in my chair in a perspiration and wondered helplessly what was to be done next in this anxious frame of mind other men might have ended by working themselves up into a fever i ended in a different way i lit my pipe and took a turn at robinson crusoe  before i had been at it five minutes i came to this amazing bitpage one hundred and sixtyoneas follows  fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself when apparent to the eyes and we find the burthen of anxiety greater by much than the evil which we are anxious about  the man who doesnt believe in robinson crusoe after that is a man with a screw loose in his understanding or a man lost in the mist of his own selfconceit argument is thrown away upon him and pity is better reserved for some person with a livelier faith  i was far on with my second pipe and still lost in admiration of that wonderful book when penelope who had been handing round the tea came in with her report from the drawingroom she had left the bouncers singing a duetwords beginning with a large o and music to correspond she had observed that my lady made mistakes in her game of whist for the first time in our experience of her she had seen the great traveller asleep in a corner she had overheard mr franklin sharpening his wits on mr godfrey at the expense of ladies charities in general and she had noticed that mr godfrey hit him back again rather more smartly than became a gentleman of his benevolent character she had detected miss rachel apparently engaged in appeasing mrs threadgall by showing her some photographs and really occupied in stealing looks at mr franklin which no intelligent ladys maid could misinterpret for a single instant finally she had missed mr candy the doctor who had mysteriously disappeared from the drawingroom and had then mysteriously returned and entered into conversation with mr godfrey upon the whole things were prospering better than the experience of the dinner gave us any right to expect if we could only hold on for another hour old father time would bring up their carriages and relieve us of them altogether  everything wears off in this world and even the comforting effect of robinson crusoe wore off after penelope left me i got fidgety again and resolved on making a survey of the grounds before the rain came instead of taking the footman whose nose was human and therefore useless in any emergency i took the bloodhound with me his nose for a stranger was to be depended on we went all round the premises and out into the roadand returned as wise as we went having discovered no such thing as a lurking human creature anywhere  the arrival of the carriages was the signal for the arrival of the rain it poured as if it meant to pour all night with the exception of the doctor whose gig was waiting for him the rest of the company went home snugly under cover in close carriages i told mr candy that i was afraid he would get wet through he told me in return that he wondered i had arrived at my time of life without knowing that a doctors skin was waterproof so he drove away in the rain laughing over his own little joke and so we got rid of our dinner company  the next thing to tell is the story of the night    chapter xi   when the last of the guests had driven away i went back into the inner hall and found samuel at the sidetable presiding over the brandy and sodawater my lady and miss rachel came out of the drawingroom followed by the two gentlemen mr godfrey had some brandy and sodawater mr franklin took nothing he sat down looking dead tired the talking on this birthday occasion had i suppose been too much for him  my lady turning round to wish them goodnight looked hard at the wicked colonels legacy shining in her daughters dress  rachel she asked where are you going to put your diamond tonight  miss rachel was in high good spirits just in that humour for talking nonsense and perversely persisting in it as if it was sense which you may sometimes have observed in young girls when they are highly wrought up at the end of an exciting day first she declared she didnt know where to put the diamond then she said on her dressingtable of course along with her other things then she remembered that the diamond might take to shining of itself with its awful moony light in the darkand that would terrify her in the dead of night then she bethought herself of an indian cabinet which stood in her sittingroom and instantly made up her mind to put the indian diamond in the indian cabinet for the purpose of permitting two beautiful native productions to admire each other having let her little flow of nonsense run on as far as that point her mother interposed and stopped her  my dear your indian cabinet has no lock to it says my lady  good heavens mamma cried miss rachel is this an hotel are there thieves in the house  without taking notice of this fantastic way of talking my lady wished the gentlemen goodnight she next turned to miss rachel and kissed her why not let me keep the diamond for you tonight she asked  miss rachel received that proposal as she might ten years since have received a proposal to part her from a new doll my lady saw there was no reasoning with her that night come into my room rachel the first thing tomorrow morning she said i shall have something to say to you with those last words she left us slowly thinking her own thoughts and to all appearance not best pleased with the way by which they were leading her  miss rachel was the next to say goodnight she shook hands first with mr godfrey who was standing at the other end of the hall looking at a picture then she turned back to mr franklin still sitting weary and silent in a corner  what words passed between them i cant say but standing near the old oak frame which holds our large lookingglass i saw her reflected in it slyly slipping the locket which mr franklin had given to her out of the bosom of her dress and showing it to him for a moment with a smile which certainly meant something out of the common before she tripped off to bed this incident staggered me a little in the reliance i had previously felt on my own judgment i began to think that penelope might be right about the state of her young ladys affections after all  as soon as miss rachel left him eyes to see with mr franklin noticed me his variable humour shifting about everything had shifted about the indians already  betteredge he said im half inclined to think i took mr murthwaite too seriously when we had that talk in the shrubbery i wonder whether he has been trying any of his travellers tales on us do you really mean to let the dogs loose  ill relieve them of their collars sir i answered and leave them free to take a turn in the night if they smell a reason for it  all right says mr franklin well see what is to be done tomorrow i am not at all disposed to alarm my aunt betteredge without a very pressing reason for it goodnight  he looked so worn and pale as he nodded to me and took his candle to go upstairs that i ventured to advise his having a drop of brandyandwater by way of nightcap mr godfrey walking towards us from the other end of the hall backed me he pressed mr franklin in the friendliest manner to take something before he went to bed  i only note these trifling circumstances because after all i had seen and heard that day it pleased me to observe that our two gentlemen were on just as good terms as ever their warfare of words heard by penelope in the drawingroom and their rivalry for the best place in miss rachels good graces seemed to have set no serious difference between them but there they were both goodtempered and both men of the world and there is certainly this merit in people of station that they are not nearly so quarrelsome among each other as people of no station at all  mr franklin declined the brandyandwater and went upstairs with mr godfrey their rooms being next door to each other on the landing however either his cousin persuaded him or he veered about and changed his mind as usual perhaps i may want it in the night he called down to me send up some brandyandwater into my room  i sent up samuel with the brandyandwater and then went out and unbuckled the dogs collars they both lost their heads with astonishment on being set loose at that time of night and jumped upon me like a couple of puppies however the rain soon cooled them down again they lapped a drop of water each and crept back into their kennels as i went into the house i noticed signs in the sky which betokened a break in the weather for the better for the present it still poured heavily and the ground was in a perfect sop  samuel and i went all over the house and shut up as usual i examined everything myself and trusted nothing to my deputy on this occasion all was safe and fast when i rested my old bones in bed between midnight and one in the morning  the worries of the day had been a little too much for me i suppose at any rate i had a touch of mr franklins malady that night it was sunrise before i fell off at last into a sleep all the time i lay awake the house was as quiet as the grave not a sound stirred but the splash of the rain and the sighing of the wind among the trees as a breeze sprang up with the morning  about halfpast seven i woke and opened my window on a fine sunshiny day the clock had struck eight and i was just going out to chain up the dogs again when i heard a sudden whisking of petticoats on the stairs behind me  i turned about and there was penelope flying down after me like mad father she screamed come upstairs for gods sake the diamond is gone are you out of your mind i asked her  gone says penelope gone nobody knows how come up and see  she dragged me after her into our young ladys sittingroom which opened into her bedroom there on the threshold of her bedroom door stood miss rachel almost as white in the face as the white dressinggown that clothed her there also stood the two doors of the indian cabinet wide open one of the drawers inside was pulled out as far as it would go  look says penelope i myself saw miss rachel put the diamond into that drawer last night i went to the cabinet the drawer was empty  is this true miss i asked  with a look that was not like herself with a voice that was not like her own miss rachel answered as my daughter had answered the diamond is gone having said those words she withdrew into her bedroom and shut and locked the door  before we knew which way to turn next my lady came in hearing my voice in her daughters sittingroom and wondering what had happened the news of the loss of the diamond seemed to petrify her she went straight to miss rachels bedroom and insisted on being admitted miss rachel let her in  the alarm running through the house like fire caught the two gentlemen next  mr godfrey was the first to come out of his room all he did when he heard what had happened was to hold up his hands in a state of bewilderment which didnt say much for his natural strength of mind mr franklin whose clear head i had confidently counted on to advise us seemed to be as helpless as his cousin when he heard the news in his turn for a wonder he had had a good nights rest at last and the unaccustomed luxury of sleep had as he said himself apparently stupefied him however when he had swallowed his cup of coffeewhich he always took on the foreign plan some hours before he ate any breakfasthis brains brightened the clearheaded side of him turned up and he took the matter in hand resolutely and cleverly much as follows  he first sent for the servants and told them to leave all the lower doors and windows with the exception of the front door which i had opened exactly as they had been left when we locked up over night he next proposed to his cousin and to me to make quite sure before we took any further steps that the diamond had not accidentally dropped somewhere out of sightsay at the back of the cabinet or down behind the table on which the cabinet stood having searched in both places and found nothinghaving also questioned penelope and discovered from her no more than the little she had already told memr franklin suggested next extending our inquiries to miss rachel and sent penelope to knock at her bedroom door  my lady answered the knock and closed the door behind her the moment after we heard it locked inside by miss rachel my mistress came out among us looking sorely puzzled and distressed the loss of the diamond seems to have quite overwhelmed rachel she said in reply to mr franklin she shrinks in the strangest manner from speaking of it even to me it is impossible you can see her for the present having added to our perplexities by this account of miss rachel my lady after a little effort recovered her usual composure and acted with her usual decision  i suppose there is no help for it she said quietly i suppose i have no alternative but to send for the police  and the first thing for the police to do added mr franklin catching her up is to lay hands on the indian jugglers who performed here last night  my lady and mr godfrey not knowing what mr franklin and i knew both started and both looked surprised  i cant stop to explain myself now mr franklin went on i can only tell you that the indians have certainly stolen the diamond give me a letter of introduction says he addressing my lady to one of the magistrates at frizinghallmerely telling him that i represent your interests and wishes and let me ride off with it instantly our chance of catching the thieves may depend on our not wasting one unnecessary minute nota bene whether it was the french side or the english the right side of mr franklin seemed to be uppermost now the only question was how long would it last  he put pen ink and paper before his aunt who as it appeared to me wrote the letter he wanted a little unwillingly if it had been possible to overlook such an event as the loss of a jewel worth twenty thousand pounds i believewith my ladys opinion of her late brother and her distrust of his birthdaygiftit would have been privately a relief to her to let the thieves get off with the moonstone scot free  i went out with mr franklin to the stables and took the opportunity of asking him how the indians whom i suspected of course as shrewdly as he did could possibly have got into the house  one of them might have slipped into the hall in the confusion when the dinner company were going away says mr franklin the fellow may have been under the sofa while my aunt and rachel were talking about where the diamond was to be put for the night he would only have to wait till the house was quiet and there it would be in the cabinet to be had for the taking with those words he called to the groom to open the gate and galloped off  this seemed certainly to be the only rational explanation but how had the thief contrived to make his escape from the house i had found the front door locked and bolted as i had left it at night when i went to open it after getting up as for the other doors and windows there they were still all safe and fast to speak for themselves the dogs too suppose the thief had got away by dropping from one of the upper windows how had he escaped the dogs had he come provided for them with drugged meat as the doubt crossed my mind the dogs themselves came galloping at me round a corner rolling each other over on the wet grass in such lively health and spirits that it was with no small difficulty i brought them to reason and chained them up again the more i turned it over in my mind the less satisfactory mr franklins explanation appeared to be  we had our breakfastswhatever happens in a house robbery or murder it doesnt matter you must have your breakfast when we had done my lady sent for me and i found myself compelled to tell her all that i had hitherto concealed relating to the indians and their plot being a woman of a high courage she soon got over the first startling effect of what i had to communicate her mind seemed to be far more perturbed about her daughter than about the heathen rogues and their conspiracy you know how odd rachel is and how differently she behaves sometimes from other girls my lady said to me but i have never in all my experience seen her so strange and so reserved as she is now the loss of her jewel seems almost to have turned her brain who would have thought that horrible diamond could have laid such a hold on her in so short a time  it was certainly strange taking toys and trinkets in general miss rachel was nothing like so mad after them as most young girls yet there she was still locked up inconsolably in her bedroom it is but fair to add that she was not the only one of us in the house who was thrown out of the regular groove mr godfrey for instancethough professionally a sort of consolergeneralseemed to be at a loss where to look for his own resources having no company to amuse him and getting no chance of trying what his experience of women in distress could do towards comforting miss rachel he wandered hither and thither about the house and gardens in an aimless uneasy way he was in two different minds about what it became him to do after the misfortune that had happened to us ought he to relieve the family in their present situation of the responsibility of him as a guest or ought he to stay on the chance that even his humble services might be of some use he decided ultimately that the last course was perhaps the most customary and considerate course to take in such a very peculiar case of family distress as this was circumstances try the metal a man is really made of mr godfrey tried by circumstances showed himself of weaker metal than i had thought him to be as for the womenservants excepting rosanna spearman who kept by herselfthey took to whispering together in corners and staring at nothing suspiciously as is the manner of that weaker half of the human family when anything extraordinary happens in a house i myself acknowledge to have been fidgety and illtempered the cursed moonstone had turned us all upside down  a little before eleven mr franklin came back the resolute side of him had to all appearance given way in the interval since his departure under the stress that had been laid on it he had left us at a gallop he came back to us at a walk when he went away he was made of iron when he returned he was stuffed with cotton as limp as limp could be  well says my lady are the police coming  yes says mr franklin they said they would follow me in a fly superintendent seegrave of your local police force and two of his men a mere form the case is hopeless  what have the indians escaped sir i asked  the poor illused indians have been most unjustly put in prison says mr franklin they are as innocent as the babe unborn my idea that one of them was hidden in the house has ended like all the rest of my ideas in smoke its been proved says mr franklin dwelling with great relish on his own incapacity to be simply impossible  after astonishing us by announcing this totally new turn in the matter of the moonstone our young gentleman at his aunts request took a seat and explained himself  it appeared that the resolute side of him had held out as far as frizinghall he had put the whole case plainly before the magistrate and the magistrate had at once sent for the police the first inquiries instituted about the indians showed that they had not so much as attempted to leave the town further questions addressed to the police proved that all three had been seen returning to frizinghall with their boy on the previous night between ten and elevenwhich regard being had to hours and distances also proved that they had walked straight back after performing on our terrace later still at midnight the police having occasion to search the common lodginghouse where they lived had seen them all three again and their little boy with them as usual soon after midnight i myself had safely shut up the house plainer evidence than this in favour of the indians there could not well be the magistrate said there was not even a case of suspicion against them so far but as it was just possible when the police came to investigate the matter that discoveries affecting the jugglers might be made he would contrive by committing them as rogues and vagabonds to keep them at our disposal under lock and key for a week they had ignorantly done something i forget what in the town which barely brought them within the operation of the law every human institution justice included will stretch a little if you only pull it the right way the worthy magistrate was an old friend of my ladys and the indians were committed for a week as soon as the court opened that morning  such was mr franklins narrative of events at frizinghall the indian clue to the mystery of the lost jewel was now to all appearance a clue that had broken in our hands if the jugglers were innocent who in the name of wonder had taken the moonstone out of miss rachels drawer  ten minutes later to our infinite relief superintendent seegrave arrived at the house he reported passing mr franklin on the terrace sitting in the sun i suppose with the italian side of him uppermost and warning the police as they went by that the investigation was hopeless before the investigation had begun  for a family in our situation the superintendent of the frizinghall police was the most comforting officer you could wish to see mr seegrave was tall and portly and military in his manners he had a fine commanding voice and a mighty resolute eye and a grand frockcoat which buttoned beautifully up to his leather stock im the man you want was written all over his face and he ordered his two inferior police men about with a severity which convinced us all that there was no trifling with him  he began by going round the premises outside and in the result of that investigation proving to him that no thieves had broken in upon us from outside and that the robbery consequently must have been committed by some person in the house i leave you to imagine the state the servants were in when this official announcement first reached their ears the superintendent decided to begin by examining the boudoir and that done to examine the servants next at the same time he posted one of his men on the staircase which led to the servants bedrooms with instructions to let nobody in the house pass him till further orders  at this latter proceeding the weaker half of the human family went distracted on the spot they bounced out of their comers whisked upstairs in a body to miss rachels room rosanna spearman being carried away among them this time burst in on superintendent seegrave and all looking equally guilty summoned him to say which of them he suspected at once  mr superintendent proved equal to the occasion he looked at them with his resolute eye and he cowed them with his military voice  now then you women go downstairs again every one of you i wont have you here look says mr superintendent suddenly pointing to a little smear of the decorative painting on miss rachels door at the outer edge just under the lock look what mischief the petticoats of some of you have done already clear out clear out rosanna spearman who was nearest to him and nearest to the little smear on the door set the example of obedience and slipped off instantly to her work the rest followed her out the superintendent finished his examination of the room and making nothing of it asked me who had first discovered the robbery my daughter had first discovered it my daughter was sent for  mr superintendent proved to be a little too sharp with penelope at starting now young woman attend to me and mind you speak the truth penelope fired up instantly ive never been taught to tell lies mr policemanand if father can stand there and hear me accused of falsehood and thieving and my own bedroom shut against me and my character taken away which is all a poor girl has left hes not the good father i take him for a timely word from me put justice and penelope on a pleasanter footing together the questions and answers went swimmingly and ended in nothing worth mentioning my daughter had seen miss rachel put the diamond in the drawer of the cabinet the last thing at night she had gone in with miss rachels cup of tea at eight the next morning and had found the drawer open and empty upon that she had alarmed the houseand there was an end of penelopes evidence  mr superintendent next asked to see miss rachel herself penelope mentioned his request through the door the answer reached us by the same road i have nothing to tell the policemani cant see anybody our experienced officer looked equally surprised and offended when he heard that reply i told him my young lady was ill and begged him to wait a little and see her later we thereupon went downstairs again and were met by mr godfrey and mr franklin crossing the hall  the two gentlemen being inmates of the house were summoned to say if they could throw any light on the matter neither of them knew anything about it had they heard any suspicious noises during the previous night they had heard nothing but the pattering of the rain had i lying awake longer than either of them heard nothing either nothing released from examination mr franklin still sticking to the helpless view of our difficulty whispered to me that man will be of no earthly use to us superintendent seegrave is an ass released in his turn mr godfrey whispered to meevidently a most competent person betteredge i have the greatest faith in him many men many opinions as one of the ancients said before my time  mr superintendents next proceeding took him back to the boudoir again with my daughter and me at his heels his object was to discover whether any of the furniture had been moved during the night out of its customary placehis previous investigation in the room having apparently not gone quite far enough to satisfy his mind on this point  while we were still poking about among the chairs and tables the door of the bedroom was suddenly opened after having denied herself to everybody miss rachel to our astonishment walked into the midst of us of her own accord she took up her garden hat from a chair and then went straight to penelope with this question  mr franklin blake sent you with a message to me this morning  yes miss  he wished to speak to me didnt he  yes miss  where is he now  hearing voices on the terrace below i looked out of window and saw the two gentlemen walking up and down together answering for my daughter i said mr franklin is on the terrace miss  without another word without heeding mr superintendent who tried to speak to her pale as death and wrapped up strangely in her own thoughts she left the room and went down to her cousins on the terrace  it showed a want of due respect it showed a breach of good manners on my part but for the life of me i couldnt help looking out of window when miss rachel met the gentlemen outside she went up to mr franklin without appearing to notice mr godfrey who thereupon drew back and left them by themselves what she said to mr franklin appeared to be spoken vehemently it lasted but for a short time and judging by what i saw of his face from the window seemed to astonish him beyond all power of expression while they were still together my lady appeared on the terrace miss rachel saw hersaid a few last words to mr franklinand suddenly went back into the house again before her mother came up with her my lady surprised herself and noticing mr franklins surprise spoke to him mr godfrey joined them and spoke also mr franklin walked away a little between the two telling them what had happened i suppose for they both stopped short after taking a few steps like persons struck with amazement i had just seen as much as this when the door of the sittingroom was opened violently miss rachel walked swiftly through to her bedroom wild and angry with fierce eyes and flaming cheeks mr superintendent once more attempted to question her she turned round on him at her bedroom door i have not sent for you she cried out vehemently i dont want you my diamond is lost neither you nor anybody else will ever find it with those words she went in and locked the door in our faces penelope standing nearest to it heard her burst out crying the moment she was alone again  in a rage one moment in tears the next what did it mean  i told the superintendent it meant that miss rachels temper was upset by the loss of her jewel being anxious for the honour of the family it distressed me to see my young lady forget herselfeven with a policeofficerand i made the best excuse i could accordingly in my own private mind i was more puzzled by miss rachels extraordinary language and conduct than words can tell taking what she had said at her bedroom door as a guide to guess by i could only conclude that she was mortally offended by our sending for the police and that mr franklins astonishment on the terrace was caused by her having expressed herself to him as the person chiefly instrumental in fetching the police to that effect if this guess was right whyhaving lost her diamondshould she object to the presence in the house of the very people whose business it was to recover it for her and how in heavens name could she know that the moonstone would never be found again  as things stood at present no answer to those questions was to be hoped for from anybody in the house mr franklin appeared to think it a point of honour to forbear repeating to a servanteven to so old a servant as i waswhat miss rachel had said to him on the terrace mr godfrey who as a gentleman and a relative had been probably admitted into mr franklins confidence respected that confidence as he was bound to do my lady who was also in the secret no doubt and who alone had access to miss rachel owned openly that she could make nothing of her you madden me when you talk of the diamond all her mothers influence failed to extract from her a word more than that  here we were then at a deadlock about miss racheland at a deadlock about the moonstone in the first case my lady was powerless to help us in the second as you shall presently judge mr seegrave was fast approaching the condition of a superintendent at his wits end  having ferreted about all over the boudoir without making any discoveries among the furniture our experienced officer applied to me to know whether the servants in general were or were not acquainted with the place in which the diamond had been put for the night  i knew where it was put sir i said to begin with samuel the footman knew alsofor he was present in the hall when they were talking about where the diamond was to be kept that night my daughter knew as she has already told you she or samuel may have mentioned the thing to the other servantsor the other servants may have heard the talk for themselves through the sidedoor of the hall which might have been open to the back staircase for all i can tell everybody in the house may have known where the jewel was last night  my answer presenting rather a wide field for mr superintendents suspicions to range over he tried to narrow it by asking about the servants characters next  i thought directly of rosanna spearman but it was neither my place nor my wish to direct suspicion against a poor girl whose honesty had been above all doubt as long as i had known her the matron at the reformatory had reported her to my lady as a sincerely penitent and thoroughly trustworthy girl it was the superintendents business to discover reason for suspecting her firstand then and not till then it would be my duty to tell him how she came into my ladys service all our people have excellent characters i said and all have deserved the trust their mistress has placed in them after that there was but one thing left for mr seegrave to donamely to set to work and tackle the servants characters himself  one after another they were examined one after another they proved to have nothing to sayand said it so far as the women were concerned at great length and with a very angry sense of the embargo laid on their bedrooms the rest of them being sent back to their places downstairs penelope was then summoned and examined separately a second time  my daughters little outbreak of temper in the boudoir and her readiness to think herself suspected appeared to have produced an unfavourable impression on superintendent seegrave it seemed also to dwell a little on his mind that she had been the last person who saw the diamond at night when the second questioning was over my girl came back to me in a frenzy there was no doubt of it any longerthe policeofficer had almost as good as told her she was the thief i could scarcely believe him taking mr franklins view to be quite such an ass as that but though he said nothing the eye with which he looked at my daughter was not a very pleasant eye to see i laughed it off with poor penelope as something too ridiculous to be treated seriouslywhich it certainly was secretly i am afraid i was foolish enough to be angry too it was a little tryingit was indeed my girl sat down in a corner with her apron over her head quite brokenhearted foolish of her you will say she might have waited till he openly accused her well being a man of just an equal temper i admit that still mr superintendent might have rememberednever mind what he might have remembered the devil take him  the next and last step in the investigation brought matters as they say to a crisis the officer had an interview at which i was present with my lady after informing her that the diamond must have been taken by somebody in the house he requested permission for himself and his men to search the servants rooms and boxes on the spot my good mistress like the generous highbred woman she was refused to let us be treated like thieves i will never consent to make such a return as that she said for all i owe to the faithful servants who are employed in my house  mr superintendent made his bow with a look in my direction which said plainly why employ me if you are to tie my hands in this way as head of the servants i felt directly that we were bound in justice to all parties not to profit by our mistresss generosity we gratefully thank your ladyship i said but we ask your permission to do what is right in this matter by giving up our keys when gabriel betteredge sets the example says i stopping superintendent seegrave at the door the rest of the servants will follow i promise you there are my keys to begin with my lady took me by the hand and thanked me with the tears in her eyes lord what would i not have given at that moment for the privilege of knocking superintendent seegrave down  as i had promised for them the other servants followed my lead sorely against the grain of course but all taking the view that i took the women were a sight to see while the policeofficers were rummaging among their things the cook looked as if she could grill mr superintendent alive on a furnace and the other women looked as if they could eat him when he was done  the search over and no diamond or sign of a diamond being found of course anywhere superintendent seegrave retired to my little room to consider with himself what he was to do next he and his men had now been hours in the house and had not advanced us one inch towards a discovery of how the moonstone had been taken or of whom we were to suspect as the thief  while the policeofficer was still pondering in solitude i was sent for to see mr franklin in the library to my unutterable astonishment just as my hand was on the door it was suddenly opened from the inside and out walked rosanna spearman  after the library had been swept and cleaned in the morning neither first nor second housemaid had any business in that room at any later period of the day i stopped rosanna spearman and charged her with a breach of domestic discipline on the spot  what might you want in the library at this time of day i inquired  mr franklin blake dropped one of his rings upstairs says rosanna and i have been into the library to give it to him the girls face was all in a flush as she made me that answer and she walked away with a toss of her head and a look of selfimportance which i was quite at a loss to account for the proceedings in the house had doubtless upset all the womenservants more or less but none of them had gone clean out of their natural characters as rosanna to all appearance had now gone out of hers  i found mr franklin writing at the librarytable he asked for a conveyance to the railway station the moment i entered the room the first sound of his voice informed me that we now had the resolute side of him uppermost once more the man made of cotton had disappeared and the man made of iron sat before me again  going to london sir i asked  going to telegraph to london says mr franklin i have convinced my aunt that we must have a cleverer head than superintendent seegraves to help us and i have got her permission to despatch a telegram to my father he knows the chief commissioner of police and the commissioner can lay his hand on the right man to solve the mystery of the diamond talking of mysteries bythebye says mr franklin dropping his voice i have another word to say to you before you go to the stables dont breathe a word of it to anybody as yet but either rosanna spearmans head is not quite right or i am afraid she knows more about the moonstone than she ought to know  i can hardly tell whether i was more startled or distressed at hearing him say that if i had been younger i might have confessed as much to mr franklin but when you are old you acquire one excellent habit in cases where you dont see your way clearly you hold your tongue  she came in here with a ring i dropped in my bedroom mr franklin went on when i had thanked her of course i expected her to go instead of that she stood opposite to me at the table looking at me in the oddest mannerhalf frightened and half familiari couldnt make it out this is a strange thing about the diamond sir she said in a curiously sudden headlong way i said yes it was and wondered what was coming next upon my honour betteredge i think she must be wrong in the head she said they will never find the diamond sir will they no nor the person who took itill answer for that she actually nodded and smiled at me before i could ask her what she meant we heard your step outside i suppose she was afraid of your catching her here at any rate she changed colour and left the room what on earth does it mean  i could not bring myself to tell him the girls story even then it would have been almost as good as telling him that she was the thief besides even if i had made a clean breast of it and even supposing she was the thief the reason why she should let out her secret to mr franklin of all the people in the world would have been still as far to seek as ever  i cant bear the idea of getting the poor girl into a scrape merely because she has a flighty way with her and talks very strangely mr franklin went on and yet if she had said to the superintendent what she said to me fool as he is im afraid he stopped there and left the rest unspoken  the best way sir i said will be for me to say two words privately to my mistress about it at the first opportunity my lady has a very friendly interest in rosanna and the girl may only have been forward and foolish after all when theres a mess of any kind in a house sir the womenservants like to look at the gloomy sideit gives the poor wretches a kind of importance in their own eyes if theres anybody ill trust the women for prophesying that the person will die if its a jewel lost trust them for prophesying that it will never be found again  this view which i am bound to say i thought a probable view myself on reflection seemed to relieve mr franklin mightily he folded up his telegram and dismissed the subject on my way to the stables to order the ponychaise i looked in at the servants hall where they were at dinner rosanna spearman was not among them on inquiry i found that she had been suddenly taken ill and had gone upstairs to her own room to lie down  curious she looked well enough when i saw her last i remarked  penelope followed me out dont talk in that way before the rest of them father she said you only make them harder on rosanna than ever the poor thing is breaking her heart about mr franklin blake  here was another view of the girls conduct if it was possible for penelope to be right the explanation of rosannas strange language and behaviour might have been all in thisthat she didnt care what she said so long as she could surprise mr franklin into speaking to her granting that to be the right reading of the riddle it accounted perhaps for her flighty selfconceited manner when she passed me in the hall though he had only said three words still she had carried her point and mr franklin had spoken to her  i saw the pony harnessed myself in the infernal network of mysteries and uncertainties that now surrounded us i declare it was a relief to observe how well the buckles and straps understood each other when you had seen the pony backed into the shafts of the chaise you had seen something there was no doubt about and that let me tell you was becoming a treat of the rarest kind in our household  going round with the chaise to the front door i found not only mr franklin but mr godfrey and superintendent seegrave also waiting for me on the steps  mr superintendents reflections after failing to find the diamond in the servants rooms or boxes had led him it appeared to an entirely new conclusion still sticking to his first text namely that somebody in the house had stolen the jewel our experienced officer was now of the opinion that the thief he was wise enough not to name poor penelope whatever he might privately think of her had been acting in concert with the indians and he accordingly proposed shifting his inquiries to the jugglers in the prison at frizinghall hearing of this new move mr franklin had volunteered to take the superintendent back to the town from which he could telegraph to london as easily as from our station mr godfrey still devoutly believing in mr seegrave and greatly interested in witnessing the examination of the indians had begged leave to accompany the officer to frizinghall one of the two inferior policemen was to be left at the house in case anything happened the other was to go back with the superintendent to the town so the four places in the ponychaise were just filled  before he took the reins to drive off mr franklin walked me away a few steps out of hearing of the others  i will wait to telegraph to london he said till i see what comes of our examination of the indians my own conviction is that this muddleheaded local policeofficer is as much in the dark as ever and is simply trying to gain time the idea of any of the servants being in league with the indians is a preposterous absurdity in my opinion keep about the house betteredge till i come back and try what you can make of rosanna spearman i dont ask you to do anything degrading to your own selfrespect or anything cruel towards the girl i only ask you to exercise your observation more carefully than usual we will make as light of it as we can before my auntbut this is a more important matter than you may suppose  it is a matter of twenty thousand pounds sir i said thinking of the value of the diamond  its a matter of quieting rachels mind answered mr franklin gravely i am very uneasy about her  he left me suddenly as if he desired to cut short any further talk between us i thought i understood why further talk might have let me into the secret of what miss rachel had said to him on the terrace  so they drove away to frizinghall i was ready enough in the girls own interest to have a little talk with rosanna in private but the needful opportunity failed to present itself she only came downstairs again at teatime when she did appear she was flighty and excited had what they call an hysterical attack took a dose of salvolatile by my ladys order and was sent back to her bed  the day wore on to its end drearily and miserably enough i can tell you miss rachel still kept her room declaring that she was too ill to come down to dinner that day my lady was in such low spirits about her daughter that i could not bring myself to make her additionally anxious by reporting what rosanna spearman had said to mr franklin penelope persisted in believing that she was to be forthwith tried sentenced and transported for theft the other women took to their bibles and hymnbooks and looked as sour as verjuice over their readinga result which i have observed in my sphere of life to follow generally on the performance of acts of piety at unaccustomed periods of the day as for me i hadnt even heart enough to open my robinson crusoe i went out into the yard and being hard up for a little cheerful society set my chair by the kennels and talked to the dogs  half an hour before dinnertime the two gentlemen came back from frizinghall having arranged with superintendent seegrave that he was to return to us the next day they had called on mr murthwaite the indian traveller at his present residence near the town at mr franklins request he had kindly given them the benefit of his knowledge of the language in dealing with those two out of the three indians who knew nothing of english the examination conducted carefully and at great length had ended in nothing not the shadow of a reason being discovered for suspecting the jugglers of having tampered with any of our servants on reaching that conclusion mr franklin had sent his telegraphic message to london and there the matter now rested till tomorrow came  so much for the history of the day that followed the birthday not a glimmer of light had broken in on us so far a day or two after however the darkness lifted a little how and with what result you shall presently see    chapter xii   the thursday night passed and nothing happened with the friday morning came two pieces of news  item the first the bakers man declared he had met rosanna spearman on the previous afternoon with a thick veil on walking towards frizinghall by the footpath way over the moor it seemed strange that anybody should be mistaken about rosanna whose shoulder marked her out pretty plainly poor thingbut mistaken the man must have been for rosanna as you know had been all the thursday afternoon ill upstairs in her room  item the second came through the postman worthy mr candy had said one more of his many unlucky things when he drove off in the rain on the birthday night and told me that a doctors skin was waterproof in spite of his skin the wet had got through him he had caught a chill that night and was now down with a fever the last accounts brought by the postman represented him to be lightheadedtalking nonsense as glibly poor man in his delirium as he often talked it in his sober senses we were all sorry for the little doctor but mr franklin appeared to regret his illness chiefly on miss rachels account from what he said to my lady while i was in the room at breakfasttime he appeared to think that miss rachelif the suspense about the moonstone was not soon set at restmight stand in urgent need of the best medical advice at our disposal  breakfast had not been over long when a telegram from mr blake the elder arrived in answer to his son it informed us that he had laid hands by help of his friend the commissioner on the right man to help us the name of him was sergeant cuff and the arrival of him from london might be expected by the morning train  at reading the name of the new policeofficer mr franklin gave a start it seems that he had heard some curious anecdotes about sergeant cuff from his fathers lawyer during his stay in london  i begin to hope we are seeing the end of our anxieties already he said if half the stories i have heard are true when it comes to unravelling a mystery there isnt the equal in england of sergeant cuff  we all got excited and impatient as the time drew near for the appearance of this renowned and capable character superintendent seegrave returning to us at his appointed time and hearing that the sergeant was expected instantly shut himself up in a room with pen ink and paper to make notes of the report which would be certainly expected from him i should have liked to have gone to the station myself to fetch the sergeant but my ladys carriage and horses were not to be thought of even for the celebrated cuff and the ponychaise was required later for mr godfrey he deeply regretted being obliged to leave his aunt at such an anxious time and he kindly put off the hour of his departure till as late as the last train for the purpose of hearing what the clever london policeofficer thought of the case but on friday night he must be in town having a ladies charity in difficulties waiting to consult him on saturday morning  when the time came for the sergeants arrival i went down to the gate to look out for him  a fly from the railway drove up as i reached the lodge and out got a grizzled elderly man so miserably lean that he looked as if he had not got an ounce of flesh on his bones in any part of him he was dressed all in decent black with a white cravat round his neck his face was as sharp as a hatchet and the skin of it was as yellow and dry and withered as an autumn leaf his eyes of a steely light grey had a very disconcerting trick when they encountered your eyes of looking as if they expected something more from you than you were aware of yourself his walk was soft his voice was melancholy his long lanky fingers were hooked like claws he might have been a parson or an undertakeror anything else you like except what he really was a more complete opposite to superintendent seegrave than sergeant cuff and a less comforting officer to look at for a family in distress i defy you to discover search where you may  is this lady verinders he asked  yes sir  i am sergeant cuff  this way sir if you please  on our road to the house i mentioned my name and position in the family to satisfy him that he might speak to me about the business on which my lady was to employ him not a word did he say about the business however for all that he admired the grounds and remarked that he felt the sea air very brisk and refreshing i privately wondered on my side how the celebrated cuff had got his reputation we reached the house in the temper of two strange dogs coupled up together for the first time in their lives by the same chain  asking for my lady and hearing that she was in one of the conservatories we went round to the gardens at the back and sent a servant to seek her while we were waiting sergeant cuff looked through the evergreen arch on our left spied out our rosery and walked straight in with the first appearance of anything like interest that he had shown yet to the gardeners astonishment and to my disgust this celebrated policeman proved to be quite a mine of learning on the trumpery subject of rosegardens  ah youve got the right exposure here to the south and souwest says the sergeant with a wag of his grizzled head and a streak of pleasure in his melancholy voice this is the shape for a roserynothing like a circle set in a square yes yes with walks between all the beds but they oughtnt to be gravel walks like these grass mr gardenergrass walks between your roses gravels too hard for them thats a sweet pretty bed of white roses and blush roses they always mix well together dont they heres the white musk rose mr betteredgeour old english rose holding up its head along with the best and the newest of them pretty dear says the sergeant fondling the musk rose with his lanky fingers and speaking to it as if he was speaking to a child  this was a nice sort of man to recover miss rachels diamond and to find out the thief who stole it  you seem to be fond of roses sergeant i remarked  i havent much time to be fond of anything says sergeant cuff but when i have a moments fondness to bestow most times mr betteredge the roses get it i began my life among them in my fathers nursery garden and i shall end my life among them if i can yes one of these days please god i shall retire from catching thieves and try my hand at growing roses there will be grass walks mr gardener between my beds says the sergeant on whose mind the gravel paths of our rosery seemed to dwell unpleasantly  it seems an odd taste sir i ventured to say for a man in your line of life  if you will look about you which most people wont do says sergeant cuff you will see that the nature of a mans tastes is most times as opposite as possible to the nature of a mans business show me any two things more opposite one from the other than a rose and a thief and ill correct my tastes accordinglyif it isnt too late at my time of life you find the damask rose a goodish stock for most of the tender sorts dont you mr gardener ah i thought so heres a lady coming is it lady verinder  he had seen her before either i or the gardener had seen her though we knew which way to look and he didnt i began to think him rather a quicker man than he appeared to be at first sight  the sergeants appearance or the sergeants errandone or bothseemed to cause my lady some little embarrassment she was for the first time in all my experience of her at a loss what to say at an interview with a stranger sergeant cuff put her at her ease directly he asked if any other person had been employed about the robbery before we sent for him and hearing that another person had been called in and was now in the house begged leave to speak to him before anything else was done  my lady led the way back before he followed her the sergeant relieved his mind on the subject of the gravel walks by a parting word to the gardener get her ladyship to try grass he said with a sour look at the paths no gravel no gravel  why superintendent seegrave should have appeared to be several sizes smaller than life on being presented to sergeant cuff i cant undertake to explain i can only state the fact they retired together and remained a weary long time shut up from all mortal intrusion when they came out mr superintendent was excited and mr sergeant was yawning  the sergeant wishes to see miss verinders sittingroom says mr seegrave addressing me with great pomp and eagerness the sergeant may have some questions to ask attend the sergeant if you please  while i was being ordered about in this way i looked at the great cuff the great cuff on his side looked at superintendent seegrave in that quietly expecting way which i have already noticed i cant affirm that he was on the watch for his brother officers speedy appearance in the character of an assi can only say that i strongly suspected it  i led the way upstairs the sergeant went softly all over the indian cabinet and all round the boudoir asking questions occasionally only of mr superintendent and continually of me the drift of which i believe to have been equally unintelligible to both of us in due time his course brought him to the door and put him face to face with the decorative painting that you know of he laid one lean inquiring finger on the small smear just under the lock which superintendent seegrave had already noticed when he reproved the womenservants for all crowding together into the room  thats a pity says sergeant cuff how did it happen  he put the question to me i answered that the womenservants had crowded into the room on the previous morning and that some of their petticoats had done the mischief superintendent seegrave ordered them out sir i added before they did any more harm  right says mr superintendent in his military way i ordered them out the petticoats did it sergeantthe petticoats did it  did you notice which petticoat did it asked sergeant cuff still addressing himself not to his brotherofficer but to me  no sir  he turned to superintendent seegrave upon that and said you noticed i suppose  mr superintendent looked a little taken aback but he made the best of it i cant charge my memory sergeant he said a mere triflea mere trifle  sergeant cuff looked at mr seegrave as he had looked at the gravel walks in the rosery and gave us in his melancholy way the first taste of his quality which we had had yet  i made a private inquiry last week mr superintendent he said at one end of the inquiry there was a murder and at the other end there was a spot of ink on a table cloth that nobody could account for in all my experience along the dirtiest ways of this dirty little world i have never met with such a thing as a trifle yet before we go a step further in this business we must see the petticoat that made the smear and we must know for certain when that paint was wet  mr superintendenttaking his setdown rather sulkilyasked if he should summon the women sergeant cuff after considering a minute sighed and shook his head  no he said well take the matter of the paint first its a question of yes or no with the paintwhich is short its a question of petticoats with the womenwhich is long what oclock was it when the servants were in this room yesterday morning eleven oclockeh is there anybody in the house who knows whether that paint was wet or dry at eleven yesterday morning  her ladyships nephew mr franklin blake knows i said  is the gentleman in the house  mr franklin was as close at hand as could bewaiting for his first chance of being introduced to the great cuff in half a minute he was in the room and was giving his evidence as follows  that door sergeant he said has been painted by miss verinder under my inspection with my help and in a vehicle of my own composition the vehicle dries whatever colours may be used with it in twelve hours  do you remember when the smeared bit was done sir asked the sergeant  perfectly answered mr franklin that was the last morsel of the door to be finished we wanted to get it done on wednesday lastand i myself completed it by three in the afternoon or soon after  today is friday said sergeant cuff addressing himself to superintendent seegrave let us reckon back sir at three on the wednesday afternoon that bit of the painting was completed the vehicle dried it in twelve hoursthat is to say dried it by three oclock on thursday morning at eleven on thursday morning you held your inquiry here take three from eleven and eight remains that paint had been eight hours dry mr superintendent when you supposed that the womenservants petticoats smeared it  first knockdown blow for mr seegrave if he had not suspected poor penelope i should have pitied him  having settled the question of the paint sergeant cuff from that moment gave his brotherofficer up as a bad joband addressed himself to mr franklin as the more promising assistant of the two  its quite on the cards sir he said that you have put the clue into our hands  as the words passed his lips the bedroom door opened and miss rachel came out among us suddenly  she addressed herself to the sergeant without appearing to notice or to heed that he was a perfect stranger to her  did you say she asked pointing to mr franklin that he had put the clue into your hands  this is miss verinder i whispered behind the sergeant  that gentleman miss says the sergeantwith his steelygrey eyes carefully studying my young ladys facehas possibly put the clue into our hands  she turned for one moment and tried to look at mr franklin i say tried for she suddenly looked away again before their eyes met there seemed to be some strange disturbance in her mind she coloured up and then she turned pale again with the paleness there came a new look into her facea look which it startled me to see  having answered your question miss says the sergeant i beg leave to make an inquiry in my turn there is a smear on the painting of your door here do you happen to know when it was done or who did it  instead of making any reply miss rachel went on with her questions as if he had not spoken or as if she had not heard him  are you another policeofficer she asked  i am sergeant cuff miss of the detective police  do you think a young ladys advice worth having  i shall be glad to hear it miss  do your duty by yourselfand dont allow mr franklin blake to help you  she said those words so spitefully so savagely with such an extraordinary outbreak of illwill towards mr franklin in her voice and in her look thatthough i had known her from a baby though i loved and honoured her next to my lady herselfi was ashamed of miss rachel for the first time in my life  sergeant cuffs immovable eyes never stirred from off her face thank you miss he said do you happen to know anything about the smear might you have done it by accident yourself  i know nothing about the smear  with that answer she turned away and shut herself up again in her bedroom this time i heard heras penelope had heard her beforeburst out crying as soon as she was alone again  i couldnt bring myself to look at the sergeanti looked at mr franklin who stood nearest to me he seemed to be even more sorely distressed at what had passed than i was  i told you i was uneasy about her he said and now you see why  miss verinder appears to be a little out of temper about the loss of her diamond remarked the sergeant its a valuable jewel natural enough natural enough  here was the excuse that i had made for her when she forgot herself before superintendent seegrave on the previous day being made for her over again by a man who couldnt have had my interest in making itfor he was a perfect stranger a kind of cold shudder ran through me which i couldnt account for at the time i know now that i must have got my first suspicion at that moment of a new light and horrid light having suddenly fallen on the case in the mind of sergeant cuffpurely and entirely in consequence of what he had seen in miss rachel and heard from miss rachel at that first interview between them  a young ladys tongue is a privileged member sir says the sergeant to mr franklin let us forget what has passed and go straight on with this business thanks to you we know when the paint was dry the next thing to discover is when the paint was last seen without that smear you have got a head on your shouldersand you understand what i mean  mr franklin composed himself and came back with an effort from miss rachel to the matter in hand  i think i do understand he said the more we narrow the question of time the more we also narrow the field of inquiry  thats it sir said the sergeant did you notice your work here on the wednesday afternoon after you had done it  mr franklin shook his head and answered i cant say i did  did you inquired sergeant cuff turning to me  i cant say i did either sir  who was the last person in the room the last thing on wednesday night  miss rachel i suppose sir  mr franklin struck in there or possibly your daughter betteredge he turned to sergeant cuff and explained that my daughter was miss verinders maid  mr betteredge ask your daughter to step up stop says the sergeant taking me away to the window out of earshot your superintendent here he went on in a whisper has made a pretty full report to me of the manner in which he has managed this case among other things he has by his own confession set the servants backs up its very important to smooth them down again tell your daughter and tell the rest of them these two things with my compliments first that i have no evidence before me yet that the diamond has been stolen i only know that the diamond has been lost second that my business here with the servants is simply to ask them to lay their heads together and help me to find it  my experience of the womenservants when superintendent seegrave laid his embargo on their rooms came in handy here  may i make so bold sergeant as to tell the women a third thing i asked are they free with your compliments to fidget up and downstairs and whisk in and out of their bedrooms if the fit takes them  perfectly free said the sergeant  that will smooth them down sir i remarked from the cook to the scullion  go and do it at once mr betteredge  i did it in less than five minutes there was only one difficulty when i came to the bit about the bedrooms it took a pretty stiff exertion of my authority as chief to prevent the whole of the female household from following me and penelope upstairs in the character of volunteer witnesses in a burning fever of anxiety to help sergeant cuff  the sergeant seemed to approve of penelope he became a trifle less dreary and he looked much as he had looked when he noticed the white musk rose in the flowergarden here is my daughters evidence as drawn off from her by the sergeant she gave it i think very prettilybut there she is my child all over nothing of her mother in her lord bless you nothing of her mother in her  penelope examined took a lively interest in the painting on the door having helped to mix the colours noticed the bit of work under the lock because it was the last bit done had seen it some hours afterwards without a smear had left it as late as twelve at night without a smear had at that hour wished her young lady good night in the bedroom had heard the clock strike in the boudoir had her hand at the time on the handle of the painted door knew the paint was wet having helped to mix the colours as aforesaid took particular pains not to touch it could swear that she held up the skirts of her dress and that there was no smear on the paint then could not swear that her dress mightnt have touched it accidentally in going out remembered the dress she had on because it was new a present from miss rachel her father remembered and could speak to it too could and would and did fetch it dress recognised by her father as the dress she wore that night skirts examined a long job from the size of them not the ghost of a paintstain discovered anywhere end of penelopes evidenceand very pretty and convincing too signed gabriel betteredge  the sergeants next proceeding was to question me about any large dogs in the house who might have got into the room and done the mischief with a whisk of their tails hearing that this was impossible he next sent for a magnifyingglass and tried how the smear looked seen that way no skinmark as of a human hand printed off on the paint all the signs visiblesigns which told that the paint had been smeared by some loose article of somebodys dress touching it in going by that somebody putting together penelopes evidence and mr franklins evidence must have been in the room and done the mischief between midnight and three oclock on the thursday morning  having brought his investigation to this point sergeant cuff discovered that such a person as superintendent seegrave was still left in the room upon which he summed up the proceedings for his brotherofficers benefit as follows  this trifle of yours mr superintendent says the sergeant pointing to the place on the door has grown a little in importance since you noticed it last at the present stage of the inquiry there are as i take it three discoveries to make starting from that smear find out first whether there is any article of dress in this house with the smear of the paint on it find out second who that dress belongs to find out third how the person can account for having been in this room and smeared the paint between midnight and three in the morning if the person cant satisfy you you havent far to look for the hand that has got the diamond ill work this by myself if you please and detain you no longerfrom your regular business in the town you have got one of your men here i see leave him here at my disposal in case i want himand allow me to wish you good morning  superintendent seegraves respect for the sergeant was great but his respect for himself was greater still hit hard by the celebrated cuff he hit back smartly to the best of his ability on leaving the room  i have abstained from expressing any opinion so far says mr superintendent with his military voice still in good working order i have now only one remark to offer on leaving this case in your hands there is such a thing sergeant as making a mountain out of a molehill good morning  there is also such a thing as making nothing out of a molehill in consequence of your head being too high to see it having returned his brotherofficers compliments in those terms sergeant cuff wheeled about and walked away to the window by himself  mr franklin and i waited to see what was coming next the sergeant stood at the window with his hands in his pockets looking out and whistling the tune of the last rose of summer softly to himself later in the proceedings i discovered that he only forgot his manners so far as to whistle when his mind was hard at work seeing its way inch by inch to its own private ends on which occasions the last rose of summer evidently helped and encouraged him i suppose it fitted in somehow with his character it reminded him you see of his favourite roses and as he whistled it it was the most melancholy tune going  turning from the window after a minute or two the sergeant walked into the middle of the room and stopped there deep in thought with his eyes on miss rachels bedroom door after a little he roused himself nodded his head as much as to say that will do and addressing me asked for ten minutes conversation with my mistress at her ladyships earliest convenience  leaving the room with this message i heard mr franklin ask the sergeant a question and stopped to hear the answer also at the threshold of the door  can you guess yet inquired mr franklin who has stolen the diamond  nobody has stolen the diamond answered sergeant cuff  we both started at that extraordinary view of the case and both earnestly begged him to tell us what he meant  wait a little said the sergeant the pieces of the puzzle are not all put together yet    chapter xiii   i found my lady in her own sitting room she started and looked annoyed when i mentioned that sergeant cuff wished to speak to her  must i see him she asked cant you represent me gabriel  i felt at a loss to understand this and showed it plainly i suppose in my face my lady was so good as to explain herself  i am afraid my nerves are a little shaken she said there is something in that policeofficer from london which i recoil fromi dont know why i have a presentiment that he is bringing trouble and misery with him into the house very foolish and very unlike mebut so it is  i hardly knew what to say to this the more i saw of sergeant cuff the better i liked him my lady rallied a little after having opened her heart to mebeing naturally a woman of a high courage as i have already told you  if i must see him i must she said but i cant prevail on myself to see him alone bring him in gabriel and stay here as long as he stays  this was the first attack of the megrims that i remembered in my mistress since the time when she was a young girl i went back to the boudoir mr franklin strolled out into the garden and joined mr godfrey whose time for departure was now drawing near sergeant cuff and i went straight to my mistresss room  i declare my lady turned a shade paler at the sight of him she commanded herself however in other respects and asked the sergeant if he had any objection to my being present she was so good as to add that i was her trusted adviser as well as her old servant and that in anything which related to the household i was the person whom it might be most profitable to consult the sergeant politely answered that he would take my presence as a favour having something to say about the servants in general and having found my experience in that quarter already of some use to him my lady pointed to two chairs and we set in for our conference immediately  i have already formed an opinion on this case says sergeant cuff which i beg your ladyships permission to keep to myself for the present my business now is to mention what i have discovered upstairs in miss verinders sittingroom and what i have decided with your ladyships leave on doing next  he then went into the matter of the smear on the paint and stated the conclusions he drew from itjust as he had stated them only with greater respect of language to superintendent seegrave one thing he said in conclusion is certain the diamond is missing out of the drawer in the cabinet another thing is next to certain the marks from the smear on the door must be on some article of dress belonging to somebody in this house we must discover that article of dress before we go a step further  and that discovery remarked my mistress implies i presume the discovery of the thief  i beg your ladyships pardoni dont say the diamond is stolen i only say at present that the diamond is missing the discovery of the stained dress may lead the way to finding it  her ladyship looked at me do you understand this she said  sergeant cuff understands it my lady i answered  how do you propose to discover the stained dress inquired my mistress addressing herself once more to the sergeant my good servants who have been with me for years have i am ashamed to say had their boxes and rooms searched already by the other officer i cant and wont permit them to be insulted in that way a second time  there was a mistress to serve there was a woman in ten thousand if you like  that is the very point i was about to put to your ladyship said the sergeant the other officer has done a world of harm to this inquiry by letting the servants see that he suspected them if i give them cause to think themselves suspected a second time theres no knowing what obstacles they may not throw in my waythe women especially at the same time their boxes must be searched againfor this plain reason that the first investigation only looked for the diamond and that the second investigation must look for the stained dress i quite agree with you my lady that the servants feelings ought to be consulted but i am equally clear that the servants wardrobes ought to be searched  this looked very like a deadlock my lady said so in choicer language than mine  i have got a plan to meet the difficulty said sergeant cuff if your ladyship will consent to it i propose explaining the case to the servants  the women will think themselves suspected directly i said interrupting him  the women wont mr betteredge answered the sergeant if i can tell them i am going to examine the wardrobes of everybodyfrom her ladyship downwardswho slept in the house on wednesday night its a mere formality he added with a side look at my mistress but the servants will accept it as even dealing between them and their betters and instead of hindering the investigation they will make a point of honour of assisting it  i saw the truth of that my lady after her first surprise was over saw the truth of it also  you are certain the investigation is necessary she said  its the shortest way that i can see my lady to the end we have in view  my mistress rose to ring the bell for her maid you shall speak to the servants she said with the keys of my wardrobe in your hand  sergeant cuff stopped her by a very unexpected question  hadnt we better make sure first he asked that the other ladies and gentlemen in the house will consent too  the only other lady in the house is miss verinder answered my mistress with a look of surprise the only gentlemen are my nephews mr blake and mr ablewhite there is not the least fear of a refusal from any of the three  i reminded my lady here that mr godfrey was going away as i said the words mr godfrey himself knocked at the door to say goodbye and was followed in by mr franklin who was going with him to the station my lady explained the difficulty mr godfrey settled it directly he called to samuel through the window to take his portmanteau upstairs again and he then put the key himself into sergeant cuffs hand my luggage can follow me to london he said when the inquiry is over the sergeant received the key with a becoming apology i am sorry to put you to any inconvenience sir for a mere formality but the example of their betters will do wonders in reconciling the servants to this inquiry mr godfrey after taking leave of my lady in a most sympathising manner left a farewell message for miss rachel the terms of which made it clear to my mind that he had not taken no for an answer and that he meant to put the marriage question to her once more at the next opportunity mr franklin on following his cousin out informed the sergeant that all his clothes were open to examination and that nothing he possessed was kept under lock and key sergeant cuff made his best acknowledgments his views you will observe had been met with the utmost readiness by my lady by mr godfrey and by mr franklin there was only miss rachel now wanting to follow their lead before we called the servants together and began the search for the stained dress  my ladys unaccountable objection to the sergeant seemed to make our conference more distasteful to her than ever as soon as we were left alone again if i send you down miss verinders keys she said to him i presume i shall have done all you want of me for the present  i beg your ladyships pardon said sergeant cuff before we begin i should like if convenient to have the washingbook the stained article of dress may be an article of linen if the search leads to nothing i want to be able to account next for all the linen in the house and for all the linen sent to the wash if there is an article missing there will be at least a presumption that it has got the paintstain on it and that it has been purposely made away with yesterday or today by the person owning it superintendent seegrave added the sergeant turning to me pointed the attention of the womenservants to the smear when they all crowded into the room on thursday morning that may turn out mr betteredge to have been one more of superintendent seegraves many mistakes  my lady desired me to ring the bell and order the washingbook she remained with us until it was produced in case sergeant cuff had any further request to make of her after looking at it  the washingbook was brought in by rosanna spearman the girl had come down to breakfast that morning miserably pale and haggard but sufficiently recovered from her illness of the previous day to do her usual work sergeant cuff looked attentively at our second housemaidat her face when she came in at her crooked shoulder when she went out  have you anything more to say to me asked my lady still as eager as ever to be out of the sergeants society  the great cuff opened the washingbook understood it perfectly in half a minute and shut it up again i venture to trouble your ladyship with one last question he said has the young woman who brought us this book been in your employment as long as the other servants  why do you ask said my lady  the last time i saw her answered the sergeant she was in prison for theft  after that there was no help for it but to tell him the truth my mistress dwelt strongly on rosannas good conduct in her service and on the high opinion entertained of her by the matron at the reformatory you dont suspect her i hope my lady added in conclusion very earnestly  i have already told your ladyship that i dont suspect any person in the house of thievingup to the present time  after that answer my lady rose to go upstairs and ask for miss rachels keys the sergeant was beforehand with me in opening the door for her he made a very low bow my lady shuddered as she passed him  we waited and waited and no keys appeared sergeant cuff made no remark to me he turned his melancholy face to the window he put his lanky hands into his pockets and he whistled the last rose of summer softly to himself  at last samuel came in not with the keys but with a morsel of paper for me i got at my spectacles with some fumbling and difficulty feeling the sergeants dismal eyes fixed on me all the time there were two or three lines on the paper written in pencil by my lady they informed me that miss rachel flatly refused to have her wardrobe examined asked for her reasons she had burst out crying asked again she had said i wont because i wont i must yield to force if you use it but i will yield to nothing else i understood my ladys disinclination to face sergeant cuff with such an answer from her daughter as that if i had not been too old for the amiable weaknesses of youth i believe i should have blushed at the notion of facing him myself  any news of miss verinders keys asked the sergeant  my young lady refuses to have her wardrobe examined  ah said the sergeant  his voice was not quite in such a perfect state of discipline as his face when he said ah he said it in the tone of a man who had heard something which he expected to hear he half angered and half frightened mewhy i couldnt tell but he did it  must the search be given up i asked  yes said the sergeant the search must be given up because your young lady refuses to submit to it like the rest we must examine all the wardrobes in the house or none send mr ablewhites portmanteau to london by the next train and return the washingbook with my compliments and thanks to the young woman who brought it in  he laid the washingbook on the table and taking out his penknife began to trim his nails  you dont seem to be much disappointed i said  no said sergeant cuff i am not much disappointed  i tried to make him explain himself  why should miss rachel put an obstacle in your way i inquired isnt it her interest to help you  wait a little mr betteredgewait a little  cleverer heads than mine might have seen his drift or a person less fond of miss rachel than i was might have seen his drift my ladys horror of him might as i have since thought have meant that she saw his drift as the scripture says in a glass darkly i didnt see it yetthats all i know  whats to be done next i asked  sergeant cuff finished the nail on which he was then at work looked at it for a moment with a melancholy interest and put up his penknife  come out into the garden he said and lets have a look at the roses    chapter xiv   the nearest way to the garden on going out of my ladys sittingroom was by the shrubbery path which you already know of for the sake of your better understanding of what is now to come i may add to this that the shrubbery path was mr franklins favourite walk when he was out in the grounds and when we failed to find him anywhere else we generally found him here  i am afraid i must own that i am rather an obstinate old man the more firmly sergeant cuff kept his thoughts shut up from me the more firmly i persisted in trying to look in at them as we turned into the shrubbery path i attempted to circumvent him in another way  as things are now i said if i was in your place i should be at my wits end  if you were in my place answered the sergeant you would have formed an opinionand as things are now any doubt you might previously have felt about your own conclusions would be completely set at rest never mind for the present what those conclusions are mr betteredge i havent brought you out here to draw me like a badger i have brought you out here to ask for some information you might have given it to me no doubt in the house instead of out of it but doors and listeners have a knack of getting together and in my line of life we cultivate a healthy taste for the open air  who was to circumvent this man i gave inand waited as patiently as i could to hear what was coming next  we wont enter into your young ladys motives the sergeant went on we will only say its a pity she declines to assist me because by so doing she makes this investigation more difficult than it might otherwise have been we must now try to solve the mystery of the smear on the doorwhich you may take my word for it means the mystery of the diamond alsoin some other way i have decided to see the servants and to search their thoughts and actions mr betteredge instead of searching their wardrobes before i begin however i want to ask you a question or two you are an observant mandid you notice anything strange in any of the servants making due allowance of course for fright and fluster after the loss of the diamond was found out any particular quarrel among them any one of them not in his or her usual spirits unexpectedly out of temper for instance or unexpectedly taken ill  i had just time to think of rosanna spearmans sudden illness at yesterdays dinnerbut not time to make any answerwhen i saw sergeant cuffs eyes suddenly turn aside towards the shrubbery and i heard him say softly to himself hullo  whats the matter i asked  a touch of the rheumatics in my back said the sergeant in a loud voice as if he wanted some third person to hear us we shall have a change in the weather before long  a few steps further brought us to the corner of the house turning off sharp to the right we entered on the terrace and went down by the steps in the middle into the garden below sergeant cuff stopped there in the open space where we could see round us on every side  about that young person rosanna spearman he said it isnt very likely with her personal appearance that she has got a lover but for the girls own sake i must ask you at once whether she has provided herself with a sweetheart poor wretch like the rest of them  what on earth did he mean under present circumstances by putting such a question to me as that i stared at him instead of answering him  i saw rosanna spearman hiding in the shrubbery as we went by said the sergeant  when you said hullo  yeswhen i said hullo if theres a sweetheart in the case the hiding doesnt much matter if there isntas things are in this housethe hiding is a highly suspicious circumstance and it will be my painful duty to act on it accordingly  what in gods name was i to say to him i knew the shrubbery was mr franklins favourite walk i knew he would most likely turn that way when he came back from the station i knew that penelope had over and over again caught her fellowservant hanging about there and had always declared to me that rosannas object was to attract mr franklins attention if my daughter was right she might well have been lying in wait for mr franklins return when the sergeant noticed her i was put between the two difficulties of mentioning penelopes fanciful notion as if it was mine or of leaving an unfortunate creature to suffer the consequences the very serious consequences of exciting the suspicion of sergeant cuff out of pure pity for the girlon my soul and my character out of pure pity for the girli gave the sergeant the necessary explanations and told him that rosanna had been mad enough to set her heart on mr franklin blake  sergeant cuff never laughed on the few occasions when anything amused him he curled up a little at the corners of the lips nothing more he curled up now  hadnt you better say shes mad enough to be an ugly girl and only a servant he asked the falling in love with a gentleman of mr franklin blakes manners and appearance doesnt seem to me to be the maddest part of her conduct by any means however im glad the thing is cleared up it relieves ones mind to have things cleared up yes ill keep it a secret mr betteredge i like to be tender to human infirmitythough i dont get many chances of exercising that virtue in my line of life you think mr franklin blake hasnt got a suspicion of the girls fancy for him ah he would have found it out fast enough if she had been nicelooking the ugly women have a bad time of it in this world lets hope it will be made up to them in another you have got a nice garden here and a wellkept lawn see for yourself how much better the flowers look with grass about them instead of gravel no thank you i wont take a rose it goes to my heart to break them off the stem just as it goes to your heart you know when theres something wrong in the servants hall did you notice anything you couldnt account for in any of the servants when the loss of the diamond was first found out  i had got on very fairly well with sergeant cuff so far but the slyness with which he slipped in that last question put me on my guard in plain english i didnt at all relish the notion of helping his inquiries when those inquiries took him in the capacity of snake in the grass among my fellowservants  i noticed nothing i said except that we all lost our heads together myself included  oh says the sergeant thats all you have to tell me is it  i answered with as i flattered myself an unmoved countenance that is all  sergeant cuffs dismal eyes looked me hard in the face  mr betteredge he said have you any objection to oblige me by shaking hands i have taken an extraordinary liking to you  why he should have chosen the exact moment when i was deceiving him to give me that proof of his good opinion is beyond all comprehension i felt a little proudi really did feel a little proud of having been one too many at last for the celebrated cuff  we went back to the house the sergeant requesting that i would give him a room to himself and then send in the servants the indoor servants only one after another in the order of their rank from first to last  i showed sergeant cuff into my own room and then called the servants together in the hall rosanna spearman appeared among them much as usual she was as quick in her way as the sergeant in his and i suspect she had heard what he said to me about the servants in general just before he discovered her there she was at any rate looking as if she had never heard of such a place as the shrubbery in her life  i sent them in one by one as desired the cook was the first to enter the court of justice otherwise my room she remained but a short time report on coming out sergeant cuff is depressed in his spirits but sergeant cuff is a perfect gentleman my ladys own maid followed remained much longer report on coming out if sergeant cuff doesnt believe a respectable woman he might keep his opinion to himself at any rate penelope went next remained only a moment or two report on coming out sergeant cuff is much to be pitied he must have been crossed in love father when he was a young man the first housemaid followed penelope remained like my ladys maid a long time report on coming out i didnt enter her ladyships service mr betteredge to be doubted to my face by a low policeofficer rosanna spearman went next remained longer than any of them no report on coming outdead silence and lips as pale as ashes samuel the footman followed rosanna remained a minute or two report on coming out whoever blacks sergeant cuffs boots ought to be ashamed of himself nancy the kitchenmaid went last remained a minute or two report on coming out sergeant cuff has a heart he doesnt cut jokes mr betteredge with a poor hardworking girl  going into the court of justice when it was all over to hear if there were any further commands for me i found the sergeant at his old tricklooking out of window and whistling the last rose of summer to himself  any discoveries sir i inquired  if rosanna spearman asks leave to go out said the sergeant let the poor thing go but let me know first  i might as well have held my tongue about rosanna and mr franklin it was plain enough the unfortunate girl had fallen under sergeant cuffs suspicions in spite of all i could do to prevent it  i hope you dont think rosanna is concerned in the loss of the diamond i ventured to say  the corners of the sergeants melancholy mouth curled up and he looked hard in my face just as he had looked in the garden  i think i had better not tell you mr betteredge he said you might lose your head you know for the second time  i began to doubt whether i had been one too many for the celebrated cuff after all it was rather a relief to me that we were interrupted here by a knock at the door and a message from the cook rosanna spearman had asked to go out for the usual reason that her head was bad and she wanted a breath of fresh air at a sign from the sergeant i said yes which is the servants way out he asked when the messenger had gone i showed him the servants way out lock the door of your room says the sergeant and if anybody asks for me say im in there composing my mind he curled up again at the corners of the lips and disappeared  left alone under those circumstances a devouring curiosity pushed me on to make some discoveries for myself  it was plain that sergeant cuffs suspicions of rosanna had been roused by something that he had found out at his examination of the servants in my room now the only two servants excepting rosanna herself who had remained under examination for any length of time were my ladys own maid and the first housemaid those two being also the women who had taken the lead in persecuting their unfortunate fellowservant from the first reaching these conclusions i looked in on them casually as it might be in the servants hall and finding tea going forward instantly invited myself to that meal for nota bene a drop of tea is to a womans tongue what a drop of oil is to a wasting lamp  my reliance on the teapot as an ally did not go unrewarded in less than half an hour i knew as much as the sergeant himself  my ladys maid and the housemaid had it appeared neither of them believed in rosannas illness of the previous day these two devilsi ask your pardon but how else can you describe a couple of spiteful womenhad stolen upstairs at intervals during the thursday afternoon had tried rosannas door and found it locked had knocked and not been answered had listened and not heard a sound inside when the girl had come down to tea and had been sent up still out of sorts to bed again the two devils aforesaid had tried her door once more and found it locked had looked at the keyhole and found it stopped up had seen a light under the door at midnight and had heard the crackling of a fire a fire in a servants bedroom in the month of june at four in the morning all this they had told sergeant cuff who in return for their anxiety to enlighten him had eyed them with sour and suspicious looks and had shown them plainly that he didnt believe either one or the other hence the unfavourable reports of him which these two women had brought out with them from the examination hence also without reckoning the influence of the teapot their readiness to let their tongues run to any length on the subject of the sergeants ungracious behaviour to them  having had some experience of the great cuffs roundabout ways and having last seen him evidently bent on following rosanna privately when she went out for her walk it seemed clear to me that he had thought it unadvisable to let the ladys maid and the housemaid know how materially they had helped him they were just the sort of women if he had treated their evidence as trustworthy to have been puffed up by it and to have said or done something which would have put rosanna spearman on her guard  i walked out in the fine summer afternoon very sorry for the poor girl and very uneasy in my mind at the turn things had taken drifting towards the shrubbery some time later there i met mr franklin after returning from seeing his cousin off at the station he had been with my lady holding a long conversation with her she had told him of miss rachels unaccountable refusal to let her wardrobe be examined and had put him in such low spirits about my young lady that he seemed to shrink from speaking on the subject the family temper appeared in his face that evening for the first time in my experience of him  well betteredge he said how does the atmosphere of mystery and suspicion in which we are all living now agree with you do you remember that morning when i first came here with the moonstone i wish to god we had thrown it into the quicksand  after breaking out in that way he abstained from speaking again until he had composed himself we walked silently side by side for a minute or two and then he asked me what had become of sergeant cuff it was impossible to put mr franklin off with the excuse of the sergeant being in my room composing his mind i told him exactly what had happened mentioning particularly what my ladys maid and the housemaid had said about rosanna spearman  mr franklins clear head saw the turn the sergeants suspicions had taken in the twinkling of an eye  didnt you tell me this morning he said that one of the tradespeople declared he had met rosanna yesterday on the footway to frizinghall when we supposed her to be ill in her room  yes sir  if my aunts maid and the other woman have spoken the truth you may depend upon it the tradesman did meet her the girls attack of illness was a blind to deceive us she had some guilty reason for going to the town secretly the paintstained dress is a dress of hers and the fire heard crackling in her room at four in the morning was a fire lit to destroy it rosanna spearman has stolen the diamond ill go in directly and tell my aunt the turn things have taken  not just yet if you please sir said a melancholy voice behind us  we both turned about and found ourselves face to face with sergeant cuff  why not just yet asked mr franklin  because sir if you tell her ladyship her ladyship will tell miss verinder  suppose she does what then mr franklin said those words with a sudden heat and vehemence as if the sergeant had mortally offended him  do you think its wise sir said sergeant cuff quietly to put such a question as that to meat such a time as this  there was a moments silence between them mr franklin walked close up to the sergeant the two looked each other straight in the face mr franklin spoke first dropping his voice as suddenly as he had raised it  i suppose you know mr cuff he said that you are treading on delicate ground  it isnt the first time by a good many hundreds that i find myself treading on delicate ground answered the other as immovable as ever  i am to understand that you forbid me to tell my aunt what has happened  you are to understand if you please sir that i throw up the case if you tell lady verinder or tell anybody what has happened until i give you leave  that settled it mr franklin had no choice but to submit he turned away in angerand left us  i had stood there listening to them all in a tremble not knowing whom to suspect or what to think next in the midst of my confusion two things however were plain to me first that my young lady was in some unaccountable manner at the bottom of the sharp speeches that had passed between them second that they thoroughly understood each other without having previously exchanged a word of explanation on either side  mr betteredge says the sergeant you have done a very foolish thing in my absence you have done a little detective business on your own account for the future perhaps you will be so obliging as to do your detective business along with me  he took me by the arm and walked me away with him along the road by which he had come i dare say i had deserved his reproofbut i was not going to help him to set traps for rosanna spearman for all that thief or no thief legal or not legal i dont carei pitied her  what do you want of me i asked shaking him off and stopping short  only a little information about the country round here said the sergeant  i couldnt well object to improve sergeant cuff in his geography  is there any path in that direction leading to the seabeach from this house asked the sergeant he pointed as he spoke to the firplantation which led to the shivering sand  yes i said there is a path  show it to me  side by side in the grey of the summer evening sergeant cuff and i set forth for the shivering sand    chapter xv   the sergeant remained silent thinking his own thoughts till we entered the plantation of firs which led to the quicksand there he roused himself like a man whose mind was made up and spoke to me again  mr betteredge he said as you have honoured me by taking an oar in my boat and as you may i think be of some assistance to me before the evening is out i see no use in our mystifying one another any longer and i propose to set you an example of plain speaking on my side you are determined to give me no information to the prejudice of rosanna spearman because she has been a good girl to you and because you pity her heartily those humane considerations do you a world of credit but they happen in this instance to be humane considerations clean thrown away rosanna spearman is not in the slightest danger of getting into troubleno not if i fix her with being concerned in the disappearance of the diamond on evidence which is as plain as the nose on your face  do you mean that my lady wont prosecute i asked  i mean that your lady cant prosecute said the sergeant rosanna spearman is simply an instrument in the hands of another person and rosanna spearman will be held harmless for that other persons sake  he spoke like a man in earnestthere was no denying that still i felt something stirring uneasily against him in my mind cant you give that other person a name i said  cant you mr betteredge  no  sergeant cuff stood stock still and surveyed me with a look of melancholy interest  its always a pleasure to me to be tender towards human infirmity he said i feel particularly tender at the present moment mr betteredge towards you and you with the same excellent motive feel particularly tender towards rosanna spearman dont you do you happen to know whether she has had a new outfit of linen lately  what he meant by slipping in this extraordinary question unawares i was at a total loss to imagine seeing no possible injury to rosanna if i owned the truth i answered that the girl had come to us rather sparely provided with linen and that my lady in recompense for her good conduct i laid a stress on her good conduct had given her a new outfit not a fortnight since  this is a miserable world says the sergeant human life mr betteredge is a sort of targetmisfortune is always firing at it and always hitting the mark but for that outfit we should have discovered a new nightgown or petticoat among rosannas things and have nailed her in that way youre not at a loss to follow me are you you have examined the servants yourself and you know what discoveries two of them made outside rosannas door surely you know what the girl was about yesterday after she was taken ill you cant guess oh dear me its as plain as that strip of light there at the end of the trees at eleven on thursday morning superintendent seegrave who is a mass of human infirmity points out to all the women servants the smear on the door rosanna has her own reasons for suspecting her own things she takes the first opportunity of getting to her room finds the paintstain on her nightgown or petticoat or what not shams ill and slips away to the town gets the materials for making a new petticoat or nightgown makes it alone in her room on the thursday night lights a fire not to destroy it two of her fellowservants are prying outside her door and she knows better than to make a smell of burning and to have a lot of tinder to get rid oflights a fire i say to dry and iron the substitute dress after wringing it out keeps the stained dress hidden probably on her and is at this moment occupied in making away with it in some convenient place on that lonely bit of beach ahead of us i have traced her this evening to your fishing village and to one particular cottage which we may possibly have to visit before we go back she stopped in the cottage for some time and she came out with as i believe something hidden under her cloak a cloak on a womans back is an emblem of charityit covers a multitude of sins i saw her set off northwards along the coast after leaving the cottage is your seashore here considered a fine specimen of marine landscape mr betteredge  i answered yes as shortly as might be  tastes differ says sergeant cuff looking at it from my point of view i never saw a marine landscape that i admired less if you happen to be following another person along your seacoast and if that person happens to look round there isnt a scrap of cover to hide you anywhere i had to choose between taking rosanna in custody on suspicion or leaving her for the time being with her little game in her own hands for reasons which i wont trouble you with i decided on making any sacrifice rather than give the alarm as soon as tonight to a certain person who shall be nameless between us i came back to the house to ask you to take me to the north end of the beach by another way sandin respect of its printing off peoples footstepsis one of the best detective officers i know if we dont meet with rosanna spearman by coming round on her in this way the sand may tell us what she has been at if the light only lasts long enough here is the sand if you will excuse my suggesting itsuppose you hold your tongue and let me go first  if there is such a thing known at the doctors shop as a detectivefever that disease had now got fast hold of your humble servant sergeant cuff went on between the hillocks of sand down to the beach i followed him with my heart in my mouth and waited at a little distance for what was to happen next  as it turned out i found myself standing nearly in the same place where rosanna spearman and i had been talking together when mr franklin suddenly appeared before us on arriving at our house from london while my eyes were watching the sergeant my mind wandered away in spite of me to what had passed on that former occasion between rosanna and me i declare i almost felt the poor thing slip her hand again into mine and give it a little grateful squeeze to thank me for speaking kindly to her i declare i almost heard her voice telling me again that the shivering sand seemed to draw her to it against her own will whenever she went outalmost saw her face brighten again as it brightened when she first set eyes upon mr franklin coming briskly out on us from among the hillocks my spirits fell lower and lower as i thought of these thingsand the view of the lonesome little bay when i looked about to rouse myself only served to make me feel more uneasy still  the last of the evening light was fading away and over all the desolate place there hung a still and awful calm the heave of the main ocean on the great sandbank out in the bay was a heave that made no sound the inner sea lay lost and dim without a breath of wind to stir it patches of nasty ooze floated yellowwhite on the dead surface of the water scum and slime shone faintly in certain places where the last of the light still caught them on the two great spits of rock jutting out north and south into the sea it was now the time of the turn of the tide and even as i stood there waiting the broad brown face of the quicksand began to dimple and quiverthe only moving thing in all the horrid place  i saw the sergeant start as the shiver of the sand caught his eye after looking at it for a minute or so he turned and came back to me  a treacherous place mr betteredge he said and no signs of rosanna spearman anywhere on the beach look where you may  he took me down lower on the shore and i saw for myself that his footsteps and mine were the only footsteps printed off on the sand  how does the fishing village bear standing where we are now asked sergeant cuff  cobbs hole i answered that being the name of the place bears as near as may be due south  i saw the girl this evening walking northward along the shore from cobbs hole said the sergeant consequently she must have been walking towards this place is cobbs hole on the other side of that point of land there and can we get to itnow its low waterby the beach  i answered yes to both those questions  if youll excuse my suggesting it well step out briskly said the sergeant i want to find the place where she left the shore before it gets dark  we had walked i should say a couple of hundred yards towards cobbs hole when sergeant cuff suddenly went down on his knees on the beach to all appearance seized with a sudden frenzy for saying his prayers  theres something to be said for your marine landscape here after all remarked the sergeant here are a womans footsteps mr betteredge let us call them rosannas footsteps until we find evidence to the contrary that we cant resist very confused footsteps you will please to observepurposely confused i should say ah poor soul she understands the detective virtues of sand as well as i do but hasnt she been in rather too great a hurry to tread out the marks thoroughly i think she has heres one footstep going from cobbs hole and here is another going back to it isnt that the toe of her shoe pointing straight to the waters edge and dont i see two heelmarks further down the beach close at the waters edge also i dont want to hurt your feelings but im afraid rosanna is sly it looks as if she had determined to get to that place you and i have just come from without leaving any marks on the sand to trace her by shall we say that she walked through the water from this point till she got to that ledge of rocks behind us and came back the same way and then took to the beach again where those two heel marks are still left yes well say that it seems to fit in with my notion that she had something under her cloak when she left the cottage no not something to destroyfor in that case where would have been the need of all these precautions to prevent my tracing the place at which her walk ended something to hide is i think the better guess of the two perhaps if we go on to the cottage we may find out what that something is  at this proposal my detectivefever suddenly cooled you dont want me i said what good can i do  the longer i know you mr betteredge said the sergeant the more virtues i discover modestyoh dear me how rare modesty is in this world and how much of that rarity you possess if i go alone to the cottage the peoples tongues will be tied at the first question i put to them if i go with you i go introduced by a justly respected neighbour and a flow of conversation is the necessary result it strikes me in that light how does it strike you  not having an answer of the needful smartness as ready as i could have wished i tried to gain time by asking him what cottage he wanted to go to  on the sergeant describing the place i recognised it as a cottage inhabited by a fisherman named yolland with his wife and two grownup children a son and a daughter if you will look back you will find that in first presenting rosanna spearman to your notice i have described her as occasionally varying her walk to the shivering sand by a visit to some friends of hers at cobbs hole those friends were the yollandsrespectable worthy people a credit to the neighbourhood rosannas acquaintance with them had begun by means of the daughter who was afflicted with a misshapen foot and who was known in our parts by the name of limping lucy the two deformed girls had i suppose a kind of fellowfeeling for each other anyway the yollands and rosanna always appeared to get on together at the few chances they had of meeting in a pleasant and friendly manner the fact of sergeant cuff having traced the girl to their cottage set the matter of my helping his inquiries in quite a new light rosanna had merely gone where she was in the habit of going and to show that she had been in company with the fisherman and his family was as good as to prove that she had been innocently occupied so far at any rate it would be doing the girl a service therefore instead of an injury if i allowed myself to be convinced by sergeant cuffs logic i professed myself convinced by it accordingly  we went on to cobbs hole seeing the footsteps on the sand as long as the light lasted  on reaching the cottage the fisherman and his son proved to be out in the boat and limping lucy always weak and weary was resting on her bed upstairs good mrs yolland received us alone in her kitchen when she heard that sergeant cuff was a celebrated character in london she clapped a bottle of dutch gin and a couple of clean pipes on the table and stared as if she could never see enough of him  i sat quiet in a corner waiting to hear how the sergeant would find his way to the subject of rosanna spearman his usual roundabout manner of going to work proved on this occasion to be more roundabout than ever how he managed it is more than i could tell at the time and more than i can tell now but this is certain he began with the royal family the primitive methodists and the price of fish and he got from that in his dismal underground way to the loss of the moonstone the spitefulness of our first housemaid and the hard behaviour of the womenservants generally towards rosanna spearman having reached his subject in this fashion he described himself as making his inquiries about the lost diamond partly with a view to find it and partly for the purpose of clearing rosanna from the unjust suspicions of her enemies in the house in about a quarter of an hour from the time when we entered the kitchen good mrs yolland was persuaded that she was talking to rosannas best friend and was pressing sergeant cuff to comfort his stomach and revive his spirits out of the dutch bottle  being firmly persuaded that the sergeant was wasting his breath to no purpose on mrs yolland i sat enjoying the talk between them much as i have sat in my time enjoying a stage play the great cuff showed a wonderful patience trying his luck drearily this way and that way and firing shot after shot as it were at random on the chance of hitting the mark everything to rosannas credit nothing to rosannas prejudicethat was how it ended try as he might with mrs yolland talking nineteen to the dozen and placing the most entire confidence in him his last effort was made when we had looked at our watches and had got on our legs previous to taking leave  i shall now wish you goodnight maam says the sergeant and i shall only say at parting that rosanna spearman has a sincere wellwisher in myself your obedient servant but oh dear me she will never get on in her present place and my advice to her isleave it  bless your heart alive she is going to leave it cries mrs yolland nota benei translate mrs yolland out of the yorkshire language into the english language when i tell you that the allaccomplished cuff was every now and then puzzled to understand her until i helped him you will draw your own conclusions as to what your state of mind would be if i reported her in her native tongue  rosanna spearman going to leave us i pricked up my ears at that it seemed strange to say the least of it that she should have given no warning in the first place to my lady or to me a certain doubt came up in my mind whether sergeant cuffs last random shot might not have hit the mark i began to question whether my share in the proceedings was quite as harmless a one as i had thought it it might be all in the way of the sergeants business to mystify an honest woman by wrapping her round in a network of lies but it was my duty to have remembered as a good protestant that the father of lies is the deviland that mischief and the devil are never far apart beginning to smell mischief in the air i tried to take sergeant cuff out he sat down again instantly and asked for a little drop of comfort out of the dutch bottle mrs yolland sat down opposite to him and gave him his nip i went on to the door excessively uncomfortable and said i thought i must bid them goodnightand yet i didnt go  so she means to leave says the sergeant what is she to do when she does leave sad sad the poor creature has got no friends in the world except you and me  ah but she has though says mrs yolland she came in here as i told you this evening and after sitting and talking a little with my girl lucy and me she asked to go upstairs by herself into lucys room its the only room in our place where theres pen and ink i want to write a letter to a friend she says and i cant do it for the prying and peeping of the servants up at the house who the letter was written to i cant tell you it must have been a mortal long one judging by the time she stopped upstairs over it i offered her a postagestamp when she came down she hadnt got the letter in her hand and she didnt accept the stamp a little close poor soul as you know about herself and her doings but a friend she has got somewhere i can tell you and to that friend you may depend upon it she will go  soon asked the sergeant  as soon as she can says mrs yolland  here i stepped in again from the door as chief of my ladys establishment i couldnt allow this sort of loose talk about a servant of ours going or not going to proceed any longer in my presence without noticing it  you must be mistaken about rosanna spearman i said if she had been going to leave her present situation she would have mentioned it in the first place to me  mistaken cries mrs yolland why only an hour ago she bought some things she wanted for travellingof my own self mr betteredge in this very room and that reminds me says the wearisome woman suddenly beginning to feel in her pocket of something i have got it on my mind to say about rosanna and her money are you either of you likely to see her when you go back to the house  ill take a message to the poor thing with the greatest pleasure answered sergeant cuff before i could put in a word edgewise  mrs yolland produced out of her pocket a few shillings and sixpences and counted them out with a most particular and exasperating carefulness in the palm of her hand she offered the money to the sergeant looking mighty loth to part with it all the while  might i ask you to give this back to rosanna with my love and respects says mrs yolland she insisted on paying me for the one or two things she took a fancy to this eveningand moneys welcome enough in our house i dont deny it still im not easy in my mind about taking the poor things little savings and to tell you the truth i dont think my man would like to hear that i had taken rosanna spearmans money when he comes back tomorrow morning from his work please say shes heartily welcome to the things she bought of meas a gift and dont leave the money on the table says mrs yolland putting it down suddenly before the sergeant as if it burnt her fingersdont theres a good man for times are hard and flesh is weak and i might feel tempted to put it back in my pocket again  come along i said i cant wait any longer i must go back to the house  ill follow you directly says sergeant cuff  for the second time i went to the door and for the second time try as i might i couldnt cross the threshold  its a delicate matter maam i heard the sergeant say giving money back you charged her cheap for the things im sure  cheap says mrs yolland come and judge for yourself  she took up the candle and led the sergeant to a corner of the kitchen for the life of me i couldnt help following them shaken down in the corner was a heap of odds and ends mostly old metal which the fisherman had picked up at different times from wrecked ships and which he hadnt found a market for yet to his own mind mrs yolland dived into this rubbish and brought up an old japanned tin case with a cover to it and a hasp to hang it up bythe sort of thing they use on board ship for keeping their maps and charts and suchlike from the wet  there says she when rosanna came in this evening she bought the fellow to that it will just do she says to put my cuffs and collars in and keep them from being crumpled in my box one and ninepence mr cuff as i live by bread not a halfpenny more  dirt cheap says the sergeant with a heavy sigh  he weighed the case in his hand i thought i heard a note or two of the last rose of summer as he looked at it there was no doubt now he had made another discovery to the prejudice of rosanna spearman in the place of all others where i thought her character was safest and all through me i leave you to imagine what i felt and how sincerely i repented having been the medium of introduction between mrs yolland and sergeant cuff  that will do i said we really must go  without paying the least attention to me mrs yolland took another dive into the rubbish and came up out of it this time with a dogchain  weigh it in your hand sir she said to the sergeant we had three of these and rosanna has taken two of them what can you want my dear with a couple of dogs chains says i if i join them together theyll do round my box nicely says she ropes cheapest says i chains surest says she who ever heard of a box corded with chain says i oh mrs yolland dont make objections says she let me have my chains a strange girl mr cuffgood as gold and kinder than a sister to my lucybut always a little strange there i humoured her three and sixpence on the word of an honest woman three and sixpence mr cuff  each says the sergeant  both together says mrs yolland three and sixpence for the two  given away maam says the sergeant shaking his head clean given away  theres the money says mrs yolland getting back sideways to the little heap of silver on the table as if it drew her in spite of herself the tin case and the dog chains were all she bought and all she took away one and ninepence and three and sixpencetotal five and three with my love and respectsand i cant find it in my conscience to take a poor girls savings when she may want them herself  i cant find it in my conscience maam to give the money back says sergeant cuff you have as good as made her a present of the thingsyou have indeed  is that your sincere opinion sir says mrs yolland brightening up wonderfully  there cant be a doubt about it answered the sergeant ask mr betteredge  it was no use asking me all they got out of me was goodnight  bother the money says mrs yolland with these words she appeared to lose all command over herself and making a sudden snatch at the heap of silver put it back holusbolus in her pocket it upsets ones temper it does to see it lying there and nobody taking it cries this unreasonable woman sitting down with a thump and looking at sergeant cuff as much as to say its in my pocket again nowget it out if you can  this time i not only went to the door but went fairly out on the road back explain it how you may i felt as if one or both of them had mortally offended me before i had taken three steps down the village i heard the sergeant behind me  thank you for your introduction mr betteredge he said i am indebted to the fishermans wife for an entirely new sensation mrs yolland has puzzled me  it was on the tip of my tongue to have given him a sharp answer for no better reason than thisthat i was out of temper with him because i was out of temper with myself but when he owned to being puzzled a comforting doubt crossed my mind whether any great harm had been done after all i waited in discreet silence to hear more  yes says the sergeant as if he was actually reading my thoughts in the dark instead of putting me on the scent it may console you to know mr betteredge with your interest in rosanna that you have been the means of throwing me off what the girl has done tonight is clear enough of course she has joined the two chains and has fastened them to the hasp in the tin case she has sunk the case in the water or in the quicksand she has made the loose end of the chain fast to some place under the rocks known only to herself and she will leave the case secure at its anchorage till the present proceedings have come to an end after which she can privately pull it up again out of its hidingplace at her own leisure and convenience all perfectly plain so far but says the sergeant with the first tone of impatience in his voice that i had heard yet the mystery iswhat the devil has she hidden in the tin case  i thought to myself the moonstone but i only said to sergeant cuff cant you guess  its not the diamond says the sergeant the whole experience of my life is at fault if rosanna spearman has got the diamond  on hearing those words the infernal detectivefever began i suppose to burn in me again at any rate i forgot myself in the interest of guessing this new riddle i said rashly the stained dress  sergeant cuff stopped short in the dark and laid his hand on my arm  is anything thrown into that quicksand of yours ever thrown up on the surface again he asked  never i answered light or heavy whatever goes into the shivering sand is sucked down and seen no more  does rosanna spearman know that  she knows it as well as i do  then says the sergeant what on earth has she got to do but to tie up a bit of stone in the stained dress and throw it into the quicksand there isnt the shadow of a reason why she should have hidden itand yet she must have hidden it query says the sergeant walking on again is the paintstained dress a petticoat or a nightgown or is it something else which there is a reason for preserving at any risk mr betteredge if nothing occurs to prevent it i must go to frizinghall tomorrow and discover what she bought in the town when she privately got the materials for making the substitute dress its a risk to leave the house as things are nowbut its a worse risk still to stir another step in this matter in the dark excuse my being a little out of temper im degraded in my own estimationi have let rosanna spearman puzzle me  when we got back the servants were at supper the first person we saw in the outer yard was the policeman whom superintendent seegrave had left at the sergeants disposal the sergeant asked if rosanna spearman had returned yes when nearly an hour since what had she done she had gone upstairs to take off her bonnet and cloakand she was now at supper quietly with the rest  without making any remark sergeant cuff walked on sinking lower and lower in his own estimation to the back of the house missing the entrance in the dark he went on in spite of my calling to him till he was stopped by a wicketgate which led into the garden when i joined him to bring him back by the right way i found that he was looking up attentively at one particular window on the bedroom floor at the back of the house  looking up in my turn i discovered that the object of his contemplation was the window of miss rachels room and that lights were passing backwards and forwards there as if something unusual was going on  isnt that miss verinders room asked sergeant cuff  i replied that it was and invited him to go in with me to supper the sergeant remained in his place and said something about enjoying the smell of the garden at night i left him to his enjoyment just as i was turning in at the door i heard the last rose of summer at the wicketgate sergeant cuff had made another discovery and my young ladys window was at the bottom of it this time  the latter reflection took me back again to the sergeant with a polite intimation that i could not find it in my heart to leave him by himself is there anything you dont understand up there i added pointing to miss rachels window  judging by his voice sergeant cuff had suddenly risen again to the right place in his own estimation you are great people for betting in yorkshire are you not he asked  well i said suppose we are  if i was a yorkshireman proceeded the sergeant taking my arm i would lay you an even sovereign mr betteredge that your young lady has suddenly resolved to leave the house if i won on that event i should offer to lay another sovereign that the idea has occurred to her within the last hour the first of the sergeants guesses startled me the second mixed itself up somehow in my head with the report we had heard from the policeman that rosanna spearman had returned from the sands with in the last hour the two together had a curious effect on me as we went in to supper i shook off sergeant cuffs arm and forgetting my manners pushed by him through the door to make my own inquiries for myself  samuel the footman was the first person i met in the passage  her ladyship is waiting to see you and sergeant cuff he said before i could put any questions to him  how long has she been waiting asked the sergeants voice behind me  for the last hour sir  there it was again rosanna had come back miss rachel had taken some resolution out of the common and my lady had been waiting to see the sergeantall within the last hour it was not pleasant to find these very different persons and things linking themselves together in this way i went on upstairs without looking at sergeant cuff or speaking to him my hand took a sudden fit of trembling as i lifted it to knock at my mistresss door  i shouldnt be surprised whispered the sergeant over my shoulder if a scandal was to burst up in the house tonight dont be alarmed i have put the muzzle on worse family difficulties than this in my time  as he said the words i heard my mistresss voice calling to us to come in    chapter xvi   we found my lady with no light in the room but the readinglamp the shade was screwed down so as to overshadow her face instead of looking up at us in her usual straightforward way she sat close at the table and kept her eyes fixed obstinately on an open book  officer she said is it important to the inquiry you are conducting to know beforehand if any person now in this house wishes to leave it  most important my lady  i have to tell you then that miss verinder proposes going to stay with her aunt mrs ablewhite of frizinghall she has arranged to leave us the first thing tomorrow morning  sergeant cuff looked at me i made a step forward to speak to my mistressand feeling my heart fail me if i must own it took a step back again and said nothing  may i ask your ladyship when miss verinder informed you that she was going to her aunts inquired the sergeant  about an hour since answered my mistress  sergeant cuff looked at me once more they say old peoples hearts are not very easily moved my heart couldnt have thumped much harder than it did now if i had been fiveandtwenty again  i have no claim my lady says the sergeant to control miss verinders actions all i can ask you to do is to put off her departure if possible till later in the day i must go to frizinghall myself tomorrow morningand i shall be back by two oclock if not before if miss verinder can be kept here till that time i should wish to say two words to herunexpectedlybefore she goes  my lady directed me to give the coachman her orders that the carriage was not to come for miss rachel until two oclock have you more to say she asked of the sergeant when this had been done  only one thing your ladyship if miss verinder is surprised at this change in the arrangements please not to mention me as being the cause of putting off her journey  my mistress lifted her head suddenly from her book as if she was going to say somethingchecked herself by a great effortand looking back again at the open page dismissed us with a sign of her hand  thats a wonderful woman said sergeant cuff when we were out in the hall again but for her selfcontrol the mystery that puzzles you mr betteredge would have been at an end tonight  at those words the truth rushed at last into my stupid old head for the moment i suppose i must have gone clean out of my senses i seized the sergeant by the collar of his coat and pinned him against the wall  damn you i cried out theres something wrong about miss racheland you have been hiding it from me all this time  sergeant cuff looked up at meflat against the wallwithout stirring a hand or moving a muscle of his melancholy face  ah he said youve guessed it at last  my hand dropped from his collar and my head sunk on my breast please to remember as some excuse for my breaking out as i did that i had served the family for fifty years miss rachel had climbed upon my knees and pulled my whiskers many and many a time when she was a child miss rachel with all her faults had been to my mind the dearest and prettiest and best young mistress that ever an old servant waited on and loved i begged sergeants cuffs pardon but i am afraid i did it with watery eyes and not in a very becoming way  dont distress yourself mr betteredge says the sergeant with more kindness than i had any right to expect from him in my line of life if we were quick at taking offence we shouldnt be worth salt to our porridge if its any comfort to you collar me again you dont in the least know how to do it but ill overlook your awkwardness in consideration of your feelings  he curled up at the corners of his lips and in his own dreary way seemed to think he had delivered himself of a very good joke  i led him into my own little sittingroom and closed the door  tell me the truth sergeant i said what do you suspect its no kindness to hide it from me now  i dont suspect said sergeant cuff i know  my unlucky temper began to get the better of me again  do you mean to tell me in plain english i said that miss rachel has stolen her own diamond  yes says the sergeant that is what i mean to tell you in so many words miss verinder has been in secret possession of the moonstone from first to last and she has taken rosanna spearman into her confidence because she has calculated on our suspecting rosanna spearman of the theft there is the whole case in a nutshell collar me again mr betteredge if its any vent to your feelings collar me again  god help me my feelings were not to be relieved in that way give me your reasons that was all i could say to him  you shall hear my reasons tomorrow said the sergeant if miss verinder refuses to put off her visit to her aunt which you will find miss verinder will do i shall be obliged to lay the whole case before your mistress tomorrow and as i dont know what may come of it i shall request you to be present and to hear what passes on both sides let the matter rest for tonight no mr betteredge you dont get a word more on the subject of the moonstone out of me there is your table spread for supper thats one of the many human infirmities which i always treat tenderly if you will ring the bell ill say grace for what we are going to receive  i wish you a good appetite to it sergeant i said my appetite is gone ill wait and see you served and then ill ask you to excuse me if i go away and try to get the better of this by myself  i saw him served with the best of everythingand i shouldnt have been sorry if the best of everything had choked him the head gardener mr begbie came in at the same time with his weekly account the sergeant got on the subject of roses and the merits of grass walks and gravel walks immediately i left the two together and went out with a heavy heart this was the first trouble i remember for many a long year which wasnt to be blown off by a whiff of tobacco and which was even beyond the reach of robinson crusoe  being restless and miserable and having no particular room to go to i took a turn on the terrace and thought it over in peace and quietness by myself it doesnt much matter what my thoughts were i felt wretchedly old and worn out and unfit for my placeand began to wonder for the first time in my life when it would please god to take me with all this i held firm notwithstanding to my belief in miss rachel if sergeant cuff had been solomon in all his glory and had told me that my young lady had mixed herself up in a mean and guilty plot i should have had but one answer for solomon wise as he was you dont know her and i do  my meditations were interrupted by samuel he brought me a written message from my mistress  going into the house to get a light to read it by samuel remarked that there seemed a change coming in the weather my troubled mind had prevented me from noticing it before but now my attention was roused i heard the dogs uneasy and the wind moaning low looking up at the sky i saw the rack of clouds getting blacker and blacker and hurrying faster and faster over a watery moon wild weather comingsamuel was right wild weather coming  the message from my lady informed me that the magistrate at frizinghall had written to remind her about the three indians early in the coming week the rogues must needs be released and left free to follow their own devices if we had any more questions to ask them there was no time to lose having forgotten to mention this when she had last seen sergeant cuff my mistress now desired me to supply the omission the indians had gone clean out of my head as they have no doubt gone clean out of yours i didnt see much use in stirring that subject again however i obeyed my orders on the spot as a matter of course  i found sergeant cuff and the gardener with a bottle of scotch whisky between them head over ears in an argument on the growing of roses the sergeant was so deeply interested that he held up his hand and signed to me not to interrupt the discussion when i came in as far as i could understand it the question between them was whether the white moss rose did or did not require to be budded on the dogrose to make it grow well mr begbie said yes and sergeant cuff said no they appealed to me as hotly as a couple of boys knowing nothing whatever about the growing of roses i steered a middle coursejust as her majestys judges do when the scales of justice bother them by hanging even to a hair gentlemen i remarked there is much to be said on both sides in the temporary lull produced by that impartial sentence i laid my ladys written message on the table under the eyes of sergeant cuff  i had got by this time as nearly as might be to hate the sergeant but truth compels me to acknowledge that in respect of readiness of mind he was a wonderful man  in half a minute after he had read the message he had looked back into his memory for superintendent seegraves report had picked out that part of it in which the indians were concerned and was ready with his answer a certain great traveller who understood the indians and their language had figured in mr seegraves report hadnt he very well did i know the gentlemans name and address very well again would i write them on the back of my ladys message much obliged to me sergeant cuff would look that gentleman up when he went to frizinghall in the morning  do you expect anything to come of it i asked superintendent seegrave found the indians as innocent as the babe unborn  superintendent seegrave has been proved wrong up to this time in all his conclusions answered the sergeant it may be worth while to find out tomorrow whether superintendent seegrave was wrong about the indians as well with that he turned to mr begbie and took up the argument again exactly at the place where it had left off this question between us is a question of soils and seasons and patience and pains mr gardener now let me put it to you from another point of view you take your white moss rose  by that time i had closed the door on them and was out of hearing of the rest of the dispute  in the passage i met penelope hanging about and asked what she was waiting for  she was waiting for her young ladys bell when her young lady chose to call her back to go on with the packing for the next days journey further inquiry revealed to me that miss rachel had given it as a reason for wanting to go to her aunt at frizinghall that the house was unendurable to her and that she could bear the odious presence of a policeman under the same roof with herself no longer on being informed half an hour since that her departure would be delayed till two in the afternoon she had flown into a violent passion my lady present at the time had severely rebuked her and then having apparently something to say which was reserved for her daughters private ear had sent penelope out of the room my girl was in wretchedly low spirits about the changed state of things in the house nothing goes right father nothing is like what it used to be i feel as if some dreadful misfortune was hanging over us all  that was my feeling too but i put a good face on it before my daughter miss rachels bell rang while we were talking penelope ran up the back stairs to go on with the packing i went by the other way to the hall to see what the glass said about the change in the weather  just as i approached the swingdoor leading into the hall from the servants offices it was violently opened from the other side and rosanna spearman ran by me with a miserable look of pain in her face and one of her hands pressed hard over her heart as if the pang was in that quarter whats the matter my girl i asked stopping her are you ill for gods sake dont speak to me she answered and twisted herself out of my hands and ran on towards the servants staircase i called to the cook who was within hearing to look after the poor girl two other persons proved to be within hearing as well as the cook sergeant cuff darted softly out of my room and asked what was the matter i answered nothing mr franklin on the other side pulled open the swingdoor and beckoning me into the hall inquired if i had seen anything of rosanna spearman  she has just passed me sir with a very disturbed face and in a very odd manner  i am afraid i am innocently the cause of that disturbance betteredge  you sir  i cant explain it says mr franklin but if the girl is concerned in the loss of the diamond i do really believe she was on the point of confessing everythingto me of all the people in the worldnot two minutes since  looking towards the swingdoor as he said those last words i fancied i saw it opened a little way from the inner side  was there anybody listening the door fell to before i could get to it looking through the moment after i thought i saw the tails of sergeant cuffs respectable black coat disappearing round the corner of the passage he knew as well as i did that he could expect no more help from me now that i had discovered the turn which his investigations were really taking under those circumstances it was quite in his character to help himself and to do it by the underground way  not feeling sure that i had really seen the sergeantand not desiring to make needless mischief where heaven knows there was mischief enough going on alreadyi told mr franklin that i thought one of the dogs had got into the houseand then begged him to describe what had happened between rosanna and himself  were you passing through the hall sir i asked did you meet her accidentally when she spoke to you  mr franklin pointed to the billiardtable  i was knocking the balls about he said and trying to get this miserable business of the diamond out of my mind i happened to look upand there stood rosanna spearman at the side of me like a ghost her stealing on me in that way was so strange that i hardly knew what to do at first seeing a very anxious expression in her face i asked her if she wished to speak to me she answered yes if i dare knowing what suspicion attached to her i could only put one construction on such language as that i confess it made me uncomfortable i had no wish to invite the girls confidence at the same time in the difficulties that now beset us i could hardly feel justified in refusing to listen to her if she was really bent on speaking to me it was an awkward position and i dare say i got out of it awkwardly enough i said to her i dont quite understand you is there anything you want me to do mind betteredge i didnt speak unkindly the poor girl cant help being uglyi felt that at the time the cue was still in my hand and i went on knocking the balls about to take off the awkwardness of the thing as it turned out i only made matters worse still im afraid i mortified her without meaning it she suddenly turned away he looks at the billiard balls i heard her say anything rather than look at me before i could stop her she had left the hall i am not quite easy about it betteredge would you mind telling rosanna that i meant no unkindness i have been a little hard on her perhaps in my own thoughtsi have almost hoped that the loss of the diamond might be traced to her not from any illwill to the poor girl but he stopped there and going back to the billiardtable began to knock the balls about once more  after what had passed between the sergeant and me i knew what it was that he had left unspoken as well as he knew it himself  nothing but the tracing of the moonstone to our second housemaid could now raise miss rachel above the infamous suspicion that rested on her in the mind of sergeant cuff it was no longer a question of quieting my young ladys nervous excitement it was a question of proving her innocence if rosanna had done nothing to compromise herself the hope which mr franklin confessed to having felt would have been hard enough on her in all conscience but this was not the case she had pretended to be ill and had gone secretly to frizinghall she had been up all night making something or destroying something in private and she had been at the shivering sand that evening under circumstances which were highly suspicious to say the least of them for all these reasons sorry as i was for rosanna i could not but think that mr franklins way of looking at the matter was neither unnatural nor unreasonable in mr franklins position i said a word to him to that effect  yes yes he said in return but there is just a chancea very poor one certainlythat rosannas conduct may admit of some explanation which we dont see at present i hate hurting a womans feelings betteredge tell the poor creature what i told you to tell her and if she wants to speak to mei dont care whether i get into a scrape or notsend her to me in the library with those kind words he laid down the cue and left me  inquiry at the servants offices informed me that rosanna had retired to her own room she had declined all offers of assistance with thanks and had only asked to be left to rest in quiet here therefore was an end of any confession on her part supposing she really had a confession to make for that night i reported the result to mr franklin who thereupon left the library and went up to bed  i was putting the lights out and making the windows fast when samuel came in with news of the two guests whom i had left in my room  the argument about the white moss rose had apparently come to an end at last the gardener had gone home and sergeant cuff was nowhere to be found in the lower regions of the house  i looked into my room quite truenothing was to be discovered there but a couple of empty tumblers and a strong smell of hot grog had the sergeant gone of his own accord to the bedchamber that was prepared for him i went upstairs to see  after reaching the second landing i thought i heard a sound of quiet and regular breathing on my lefthand side my lefthand side led to the corridor which communicated with miss rachels room i looked in and there coiled up on three chairs placed right across the passagethere with a red handkerchief tied round his grizzled head and his respectable black coat rolled up for a pillow lay and slept sergeant cuff  he woke instantly and quietly like a dog the moment i approached him  good night mr betteredge he said and mind if you ever take to growing roses the white moss rose is all the better for not being budded on the dogrose whatever the gardener may say to the contrary  what are you doing here i asked why are you not in your proper bed  i am not in my proper bed answered the sergeant because i am one of the many people in this miserable world who cant earn their money honestly and easily at the same time there was a coincidence this evening between the period of rosanna spearmans return from the sands and the period when miss verinder stated her resolution to leave the house whatever rosanna may have hidden its clear to my mind that your young lady couldnt go away until she knew that it was hidden the two must have communicated privately once already tonight if they try to communicate again when the house is quiet i want to be in the way and stop it dont blame me for upsetting your sleeping arrangements mr betteredgeblame the diamond  i wish to god the diamond had never found its way into this house i broke out  sergeant cuff looked with a rueful face at the three chairs on which he had condemned himself to pass the night  so do i he said gravely    chapter xvii   nothing happened in the night and i am happy to add no attempt at communication between miss rachel and rosanna rewarded the vigilance of sergeant cuff  i had expected the sergeant to set off for frizinghall the first thing in the morning he waited about however as if he had something else to do first i left him to his own devices and going into the grounds shortly after met mr franklin on his favourite walk by the shrubbery side  before we had exchanged two words the sergeant unexpectedly joined us he made up to mr franklin who received him i must own haughtily enough have you anything to say to me was all the return he got for politely wishing mr franklin good morning  i have something to say to you sir answered the sergeant on the subject of the inquiry i am conducting here you detected the turn that inquiry was really taking yesterday naturally enough in your position you are shocked and distressed naturally enough also you visit your own angry sense of your own family scandal upon me  what do you want mr franklin broke in sharply enough  i want to remind you sir that i have at any rate thus far not been proved to be wrong bearing that in mind be pleased to remember at the same time that i am an officer of the law acting here under the sanction of the mistress of the house under these circumstances is it or is it not your duty as a good citizen to assist me with any special information which you may happen to possess  i possess no special information says mr franklin  sergeant cuff put that answer by him as if no answer had been made  you may save my time sir from being wasted on an inquiry at a distance he went on if you choose to understand me and speak out  i dont understand you answered mr franklin and i have nothing to say  one of the female servants i wont mention names spoke to you privately sir last night  once more mr franklin cut him short once more mr franklin answered i have nothing to say  standing by in silence i thought of the movement in the swingdoor on the previous evening and of the coattails which i had seen disappearing down the passage sergeant cuff had no doubt just heard enough before i interrupted him to make him suspect that rosanna had relieved her mind by confessing something to mr franklin blake  this notion had barely struck mewhen who should appear at the end of the shrubbery walk but rosanna spearman in her own proper person she was followed by penelope who was evidently trying to make her retrace her steps to the house seeing that mr franklin was not alone rosanna came to a standstill evidently in great perplexity what to do next penelope waited behind her mr franklin saw the girls as soon as i saw them the sergeant with his devilish cunning took on not to have noticed them at all all this happened in an instant before either mr franklin or i could say a word sergeant cuff struck in smoothly with an appearance of continuing the previous conversation  you neednt be afraid of harming the girl sir he said to mr franklin speaking in a loud voice so that rosanna might hear him on the contrary i recommend you to honour me with your confidence if you feel any interest in rosanna spearman  mr franklin instantly took on not to have noticed the girls either he answered speaking loudly on his side  i take no interest whatever in rosanna spearman  i looked towards the end of the walk all i saw at the distance was that rosanna suddenly turned round the moment mr franklin had spoken instead of resisting penelope as she had done the moment before she now let my daughter take her by the arm and lead her back to the house  the breakfastbell rang as the two girls disappearedand even sergeant cuff was now obliged to give it up as a bad job he said to me quietly i shall go to frizinghall mr betteredge and i shall be back before two he went his way without a word moreand for some few hours we were well rid of him  you must make it right with rosanna mr franklin said to me when we were alone i seem to be fated to say or do something awkward before that unlucky girl you must have seen yourself that sergeant cuff laid a trap for both of us if he could confuse me or irritate her into breaking out either she or i might have said something which would answer his purpose on the spur of the moment i saw no better way out of it than the way i took it stopped the girl from saying anything and it showed the sergeant that i saw through him he was evidently listening betteredge when i was speaking to you last night  he had done worse than listen as i privately thought to myself he had remembered my telling him that the girl was in love with mr franklin and he had calculated on that when he appealed to mr franklins interest in rosannain rosannas hearing  as to listening sir i remarked keeping the other point to myself we shall all be rowing in the same boat if this sort of thing goes on much longer prying and peeping and listening are the natural occupations of people situated as we are in another day or two mr franklin we shall all be struck dumb togetherfor this reason that we shall all be listening to surprise each others secrets and all know it excuse my breaking out sir the horrid mystery hanging over us in this house gets into my head like liquor and makes me wild i wont forget what you have told me ill take the first opportunity of making it right with rosanna spearman  you havent said anything to her yet about last night have you mr franklin asked  no sir  then say nothing now i had better not invite the girls confidence with the sergeant on the lookout to surprise us together my conduct is not very consistent betteredgeis it i see no way out of this business which isnt dreadful to think of unless the diamond is traced to rosanna and yet i cant and wont help sergeant cuff to find the girl out  unreasonable enough no doubt but it was my state of mind as well i thoroughly understood him if you will for once in your life remember that you are mortal perhaps you will thoroughly understand him too  the state of things indoors and out while sergeant cuff was on his way to frizinghall was briefly this  miss rachel waited for the time when the carriage was to take her to her aunts still obstinately shut up in her own room my lady and mr franklin breakfasted together after breakfast mr franklin took one of his sudden resolutions and went out precipitately to quiet his mind by a long walk i was the only person who saw him go and he told me he should be back before the sergeant returned the change in the weather foreshadowed overnight had come heavy rain had been followed soon after dawn by high wind it was blowing fresh as the day got on but though the clouds threatened more than once the rain still held off it was not a bad day for a walk if you were young and strong and could breast the great gusts of wind which came sweeping in from the sea  i attended my lady after breakfast and assisted her in the settlement of our household accounts she only once alluded to the matter of the moonstone and that was in the way of forbidding any present mention of it between us wait till that man comes back she said meaning the sergeant we must speak of it then we are not obliged to speak of it now  after leaving my mistress i found penelope waiting for me in my room  i wish father you would come and speak to rosanna she said i am very uneasy about her  i suspected what was the matter readily enough but it is a maxim of mine that men being superior creatures are bound to improve womenif they can when a woman wants me to do anything my daughter or not it doesnt matter i always insist on knowing why the oftener you make them rummage their own minds for a reason the more manageable you will find them in all the relations of life it isnt their fault poor wretches that they act first and think afterwards its the fault of the fools who humour them  penelopes reason why on this occasion may be given in her own words i am afraid father she said mr franklin has hurt rosanna cruelly without intending it  what took rosanna into the shrubbery walk i asked  her own madness says penelope i can call it nothing else she was bent on speaking to mr franklin this morning come what might of it i did my best to stop her you saw that if i could only have got her away before she heard those dreadful words  there there i said dont lose your head i cant call to mind that anything happened to alarm rosanna  nothing to alarm her father but mr franklin said he took no interest whatever in herand oh he said it in such a cruel voice  he said it to stop the sergeants mouth i answered  i told her that says penelope but you see father though mr franklin isnt to blame hes been mortifying and disappointing her for weeks and weeks past and now this comes on the top of it all she has no right of course to expect him to take any interest in her its quite monstrous that she should forget herself and her station in that way but she seems to have lost pride and proper feeling and everything she frightened me father when mr franklin said those words they seemed to turn her into stone a sudden quiet came over her and she has gone about her work ever since like a woman in a dream  i began to feel a little uneasy there was something in the way penelope put it which silenced my superior sense i called to mind now my thoughts were directed that way what had passed between mr franklin and rosanna overnight she looked cut to the heart on that occasion and now as illluck would have it she had been unavoidably stung again poor soul on the tender place sad sadall the more sad because the girl had no reason to justify her and no right to feel it  i had promised mr franklin to speak to rosanna and this seemed the fittest time for keeping my word  we found the girl sweeping the corridor outside the bedrooms pale and composed and neat as ever in her modest print dress i noticed a curious dimness and dullness in her eyesnot as if she had been crying but as if she had been looking at something too long possibly it was a misty something raised by her own thoughts there was certainly no object about her to look at which she had not seen already hundreds on hundreds of times  cheer up rosanna i said you mustnt fret over your own fancies i have got something to say to you from mr franklin  i thereupon put the matter in the right view before her in the friendliest and most comforting words i could find my principles in regard to the other sex are as you may have noticed very severe but somehow or other when i come face to face with the women my practice i own is not conformable  mr franklin is very kind and considerate please to thank him that was all the answer she made me  my daughter had already noticed that rosanna went about her work like a woman in a dream i now added to this observation that she also listened and spoke like a woman in a dream i doubted if her mind was in a fit condition to take in what i had said to her  are you quite sure rosanna that you understand me i asked  quite sure  she echoed me not like a living woman but like a creature moved by machinery she went on sweeping all the time i took away the broom as gently and as kindly as i could  come come my girl i said this is not like yourself you have got something on your mind im your friendand ill stand your friend even if you have done wrong make a clean breast of it rosannamake a clean breast of it  the time had been when my speaking to her in that way would have brought the tears into her eyes i could see no change in them now  yes she said ill make a clean breast of it  to my lady i asked  no  to mr franklin  yes to mr franklin  i hardly knew what to say to that she was in no condition to understand the caution against speaking to him in private which mr franklin had directed me to give her feeling my way little by little i only told her mr franklin had gone out for a walk  it doesnt matter she answered i shant trouble mr franklin today  why not speak to my lady i said the way to relieve your mind is to speak to the merciful and christian mistress who has always been kind to you  she looked at me for a moment with a grave and steady attention as if she was fixing what i said in her mind then she took the broom out of my hands and moved off with it slowly a little way down the corridor  no she said going on with her sweeping and speaking to herself i know a better way of relieving my mind than that  what is it  please to let me go on with my work  penelope followed her and offered to help her  she answered no i want to do my work thank you penelope she looked round at me thank you mr betteredge  there was no moving herthere was nothing more to be said i signed to penelope to come away with me we left her as we had found her sweeping the corridor like a woman in a dream  this is a matter for the doctor to look into i said its beyond me  my daughter reminded me of mr candys illness owing as you may remember to the chill he had caught on the night of the dinnerparty his assistanta certain mr ezra jenningswas at our disposal to be sure but nobody knew much about him in our parts he had been engaged by mr candy under rather peculiar circumstances and right or wrong we none of us liked him or trusted him there were other doctors at frizinghall but they were strangers to our house and penelope doubted in rosannas present state whether strangers might not do her more harm than good  i thought of speaking to my lady but remembering the heavy weight of anxiety which she already had on her mind i hesitated to add to all the other vexations this new trouble still there was a necessity for doing something the girls state was to my thinking downright alarmingand my mistress ought to be informed of it unwilling enough i went to her sittingroom no one was there my lady was shut up with miss rachel it was impossible for me to see her till she came out again  i waited in vain till the clock on the front staircase struck the quarter to two five minutes afterwards i heard my name called from the drive outside the house i knew the voice directly sergeant cuff had returned from frizinghall    chapter xviii   going down to the front door i met the sergeant on the steps  it went against the grain with me after what had passed between us to show him that i felt any sort of interest in his proceedings in spite of myself however i felt an interest that there was no resisting my sense of dignity sank from under me and out came the words what news from frizinghall  i have seen the indians answered sergeant cuff and i have found out what rosanna bought privately in the town on thursday last the indians will be set free on wednesday in next week there isnt a doubt on my mind and there isnt a doubt on mr murthwaites mind that they came to this place to steal the moonstone their calculations were all thrown out of course by what happened in the house on wednesday night and they have no more to do with the actual loss of the jewel than you have but i can tell you one thing mr betteredgeif we dont find the moonstone they will you have not heard the last of the three jugglers yet  mr franklin came back from his walk as the sergeant said those startling words governing his curiosity better than i had governed mine he passed us without a word and went on into the house  as for me having already dropped my dignity i determined to have the whole benefit of the sacrifice so much for the indians i said what about rosanna next  sergeant cuff shook his head  the mystery in that quarter is thicker than ever he said i have traced her to a shop at frizinghall kept by a linen draper named maltby she bought nothing whatever at any of the other drapers shops or at any milliners or tailors shops and she bought nothing at maltbys but a piece of long cloth she was very particular in choosing a certain quality as to quantity she bought enough to make a nightgown  whose nightgown i asked  her own to be sure between twelve and three on the thursday morning she must have slipped down to your young ladys room to settle the hiding of the moonstone while all the rest of you were in bed in going back to her own room her nightgown must have brushed the wet paint on the door she couldnt wash out the stain and she couldnt safely destroy the nightgown without first providing another like it to make the inventory of her linen complete  what proves that it was rosannas nightgown i objected  the material she bought for making the substitute dress answered the sergeant if it had been miss verinders nightgown she would have had to buy lace and frilling and lord knows what besides and she wouldnt have had time to make it in one night plain long cloth means a plain servants nightgown no no mr betteredgeall that is clear enough the pinch of the question iswhy after having provided the substitute dress does she hide the smeared nightgown instead of destroying it if the girl wont speak out there is only one way of settling the difficulty the hidingplace at the shivering sand must be searchedand the true state of the case will be discovered there  how are you to find the place i inquired  i am sorry to disappoint you said the sergeantbut thats a secret which i mean to keep to myself  not to irritate your curiosity as he irritated mine i may here inform you that he had come back from frizinghall provided with a searchwarrant his experience in such matters told him that rosanna was in all probability carrying about her a memorandum of the hidingplace to guide her in case she returned to it under changed circumstances and after a lapse of time possessed of this memorandum the sergeant would be furnished with all that he could desire  now mr betteredge he went on suppose we drop speculation and get to business i told joyce to have an eye on rosanna where is joyce  joyce was the frizinghall policeman who had been left by superintendent seegrave at sergeant cuffs disposal the clock struck two as he put the question and punctual to the moment the carriage came round to take miss rachel to her aunts  one thing at a time said the sergeant stopping me as i was about to send in search of joyce i must attend to miss verinder first  as the rain was still threatening it was the close carriage that had been appointed to take miss rachel to frizinghall sergeant cuff beckoned samuel to come down to him from the rumble behind  you will see a friend of mine waiting among the trees on this side of the lodge gate he said my friend without stopping the carriage will get up into the rumble with you you have nothing to do but to hold your tongue and shut your eyes otherwise you will get into trouble  with that advice he sent the footman back to his place what samuel thought i dont know it was plain to my mind that miss rachel was to be privately kept in view from the time when she left our houseif she did leave it a watch set on my young lady a spy behind her in the rumble of her mothers carriage i could have cut my own tongue out for having forgotten myself so far as to speak to sergeant cuff  the first person to come out of the house was my lady she stood aside on the top step posting herself there to see what happened not a word did she say either to the sergeant or to me with her lips closed and her arms folded in the light garden cloak which she had wrapped round her on coming into the air there she stood as still as a statue waiting for her daughter to appear  in a minute more miss rachel came downstairsvery nicely dressed in some soft yellow stuff that set off her dark complexion and clipped her tight in the form of a jacket round the waist she had a smart little straw hat on her head with a white veil twisted round it she had primrosecoloured gloves that fitted her hands like a second skin her beautiful black hair looked as smooth as satin under her hat her little ears were like rosy shellsthey had a pearl dangling from each of them she came swiftly out to us as straight as a lily on its stem and as lithe and supple in every movement she made as a young cat nothing that i could discover was altered in her pretty face but her eyes and her lips her eyes were brighter and fiercer than i liked to see and her lips had so completely lost their colour and their smile that i hardly knew them again she kissed her mother in a hasty and sudden manner on the cheek she said try to forgive me mammaand then pulled down her veil over her face so vehemently that she tore it in another moment she had run down the steps and had rushed into the carriage as if it was a hidingplace  sergeant cuff was just as quick on his side he put samuel back and stood before miss rachel with the open carriagedoor in his hand at the instant when she settled herself in her place  what do you want says miss rachel from behind her veil  i want to say one word to you miss answered the sergeant before you go i cant presume to stop your paying a visit to your aunt i can only venture to say that your leaving us as things are now puts an obstacle in the way of my recovering your diamond please to understand that and now decide for yourself whether you go or stay  miss rachel never even answered him drive on james she called out to the coachman  without another word the sergeant shut the carriagedoor just as he closed it mr franklin came running down the steps goodbye rachel he said holding out his hand  drive on cried miss rachel louder than ever and taking no more notice of mr franklin than she had taken of sergeant cuff  mr franklin stepped back thunderstruck as well he might be the coachman not knowing what to do looked towards my lady still standing immovable on the top step my lady with anger and sorrow and shame all struggling together in her face made him a sign to start the horses and then turned back hastily into the house mr franklin recovering the use of his speech called after her as the carriage drove off aunt you were quite right accept my thanks for all your kindnessand let me go  my lady turned as though to speak to him then as if distrusting herself waved her hand kindly let me see you before you leave us franklin she said in a broken voiceand went on to her own room  do me a last favour betteredge says mr franklin turning to me with the tears in his eyes get me away to the train as soon as you can  he too went his way into the house for the moment miss rachel had completely unmanned him judge from that how fond he must have been of her  sergeant cuff and i were left face to face at the bottom of the steps the sergeant stood with his face set towards a gap in the trees commanding a view of one of the windings of the drive which led from the house he had his hands in his pockets and he was softly whistling the last rose of summer to himself  theres a time for everything i said savagely enough this isnt a time for whistling  at that moment the carriage appeared in the distance through the gap on its way to the lodgegate there was another man besides samuel plainly visible in the rumble behind  all right said the sergeant to himself he turned round to me its no time for whistling mr betteredge as you say its time to take this business in hand now without sparing anybody well begin with rosanna spearman where is joyce  we both called for joyce and received no answer i sent one of the stableboys to look for him  you heard what i said to miss verinder remarked the sergeant while we were waiting and you saw how she received it i tell her plainly that her leaving us will be an obstacle in the way of my recovering her diamondand she leaves in the face of that statement your young lady has got a travelling companion in her mothers carriage mr betteredgeand the name of it is the moonstone  i said nothing i only held on like death to my belief in miss rachel  the stableboy came back followedvery unwillingly as it appeared to meby joyce  where is rosanna spearman asked sergeant cuff  i cant account for it sir joyce began and i am very sorry but somehow or other  before i went to frizinghall said the sergeant cutting him short i told you to keep your eyes on rosanna spearman without allowing her to discover that she was being watched do you mean to tell me that you have let her give you the slip  i am afraid sir says joyce beginning to tremble that i was perhaps a little too careful not to let her discover me there are such a many passages in the lower parts of this house  how long is it since you missed her  nigh on an hour since sir  you can go back to your regular business at frizinghall said the sergeant speaking just as composedly as ever in his usual quiet and dreary way i dont think your talents are at all in our line mr joyce your present form of employment is a trifle beyond you good morning  the man slunk off i find it very difficult to describe how i was affected by the discovery that rosanna spearman was missing i seemed to be in fifty different minds about it all at the same time in that state i stood staring at sergeant cuffand my powers of language quite failed me  no mr betteredge said the sergeant as if he had discovered the uppermost thought in me and was picking it out to be answered before all the rest your young friend rosanna wont slip through my fingers so easy as you think as long as i know where miss verinder is i have the means at my disposal of tracing miss verinders accomplice i prevented them from communicating last night very good they will get together at frizinghall instead of getting together here the present inquiry must be simply shifted rather sooner than i had anticipated from this house to the house at which miss verinder is visiting in the meantime im afraid i must trouble you to call the servants together again  i went round with him to the servants hall it is very disgraceful but it is not the less true that i had another attack of the detectivefever when he said those last words i forgot that i hated sergeant cuff i seized him confidentially by the arm i said for goodness sake tell us what you are going to do with the servants now  the great cuff stood stock still and addressed himself in a kind of melancholy rapture to the empty air  if this man said the sergeant apparently meaning me only understood the growing of roses he would be the most completely perfect character on the face of creation after that strong expression of feeling he sighed and put his arm through mine this is how it stands he said dropping down again to business rosanna has done one of two things she has either gone direct to frizinghall before i can get there or she has gone first to visit her hidingplace at the shivering sand the first thing to find out is which of the servants saw the last of her before she left the house  on instituting this inquiry it turned out that the last person who had set eyes on rosanna was nancy the kitchenmaid  nancy had seen her slip out with a letter in her hand and stop the butchers man who had just been delivering some meat at the back door nancy had heard her ask the man to post the letter when he got back to frizinghall the man had looked at the address and had said it was a roundabout way of delivering a letter directed to cobbs hole to post it at frizinghalland that moreover on a saturday which would prevent the letter from getting to its destination until monday morning rosanna had answered that the delivery of the letter being delayed till monday was of no importance the only thing she wished to be sure of was that the man would do what she told him the man had promised to do it and had driven away nancy had been called back to her work in the kitchen and no other person had seen anything afterwards of rosanna spearman  well i asked when we were alone again  well says the sergeant i must go to frizinghall  about the letter sir  yes the memorandum of the hidingplace is in that letter i must see the address at the postoffice if it is the address i suspect i shall pay our friend mrs yolland another visit on monday next  i went with the sergeant to order the ponychaise in the stableyard we got a new light thrown on the missing girl    chapter xix   the news of rosannas disappearance had as it appeared spread among the outofdoor servants they too had made their inquiries and they had just laid hands on a quick little imp nicknamed duffywho was occasionally employed in weeding the garden and who had seen rosanna spearman as lately as halfanhour since duffy was certain that the girl had passed him in the firplantation not walking but running in the direction of the seashore  does this boy know the coast hereabouts asked sergeant cuff  he has been born and bred on the coast i answered  duffy says the sergeant do you want to earn a shilling if you do come along with me keep the ponychaise ready mr betteredge till i come back  he started for the shivering sand at a rate that my legs though well enough preserved for my time of life had no hope of matching little duffy as the way is with the young savages in our parts when they are in high spirits gave a howl and trotted off at the sergeants heels  here again i find it impossible to give anything like a clear account of the state of my mind in the interval after sergeant cuff had left us a curious and stupefying restlessness got possession of me i did a dozen different needless things in and out of the house not one of which i can now remember i dont even know how long it was after the sergeant had gone to the sands when duffy came running back with a message for me sergeant cuff had given the boy a leaf torn out of his pocketbook on which was written in pencil send me one of rosanna spearmans boots and be quick about it  i despatched the first womanservant i could find to rosannas room and i sent the boy back to say that i myself would follow him with the boot  this i am well aware was not the quickest way to take of obeying the directions which i had received but i was resolved to see for myself what new mystification was going on before i trusted rosannas boot in the sergeants hands my old notion of screening the girl if i could seemed to have come back on me again at the eleventh hour this state of feeling to say nothing of the detectivefever hurried me off as soon as i had got the boot at the nearest approach to a run which a man turned seventy can reasonably hope to make  as i got near the shore the clouds gathered black and the rain came down drifting in great white sheets of water before the wind i heard the thunder of the sea on the sandbank at the mouth of the bay a little further on i passed the boy crouching for shelter under the lee of the sand hills then i saw the raging sea and the rollers tumbling in on the sandbank and the driven rain sweeping over the waters like a flying garment and the yellow wilderness of the beach with one solitary black figure standing on itthe figure of sergeant cuff  he waved his hand towards the north when he first saw me keep on that side he shouted and come on down here to me  i went down to him choking for breath with my heart leaping as if it was like to leap out of me i was past speaking i had a hundred questions to put to him and not one of them would pass my lips his face frightened me i saw a look in his eyes which was a look of horror he snatched the boot out of my hand and set it in a footmark on the sand bearing south from us as we stood and pointing straight towards the rocky ledge called the south spit the mark was not yet blurred out by the rainand the girls boot fitted it to a hair  the sergeant pointed to the boot in the footmark without saying a word  i caught at his arm and tried to speak to him and failed as i had failed when i tried before he went on following the footsteps down and down to where the rocks and the sand joined the south spit was just awash with the flowing tide the waters heaved over the hidden face of the shivering sand now this way and now that with an obstinate patience that was dreadful to see sergeant cuff tried the boot in the footsteps and always found it pointing the same waystraight to the rocks hunt as he might no sign could he find anywhere of the footsteps walking from them  he gave it up at last still keeping silence he looked again at me and then he looked out at the waters before us heaving in deeper and deeper over the quicksand i looked where he lookedand i saw his thought in his face a dreadful dumb trembling crawled all over me on a sudden i fell upon my knees on the beach  she has been back at the hidingplace i heard the sergeant say to himself some fatal accident has happened to her on those rocks  the girls altered looks and words and actionsthe numbed deadened way in which she listened to me and spoke to mewhen i had found her sweeping the corridor but a few hours since rose up in my mind and warned me even as the sergeant spoke that his guess was wide of the dreadful truth i tried to tell him of the fear that had frozen me up i tried to say the death she has died sergeant was a death of her own seeking no the words wouldnt come the dumb trembling held me in its grip i couldnt feel the driving rain i couldnt see the rising tide as in the vision of a dream the poor lost creature came back before me i saw her again as i had seen her in the past timeon the morning when i went to fetch her into the house i heard her again telling me that the shivering sand seemed to draw her to it against her will and wondering whether her grave was waiting for her there the horror of it struck at me in some unfathomable way through my own child my girl was just her age my girl tried as rosanna was tried might have lived that miserable life and died this dreadful death  the sergeant kindly lifted me up and turned me away from the sight of the place where she had perished  with that relief i began to fetch my breath again and to see things about me as things really were looking towards the sandhills i saw the menservants from outofdoors and the fisherman named yolland all running down to us together and all having taken the alarm calling out to know if the girl had been found in the fewest words the sergeant showed them the evidence of the footmarks and told them that a fatal accident must have happened to her he then picked out the fisherman from the rest and put a question to him turning about again towards the sea tell me he said could a boat have taken her off in such weather as this from those rocks where her footmarks stop  the fisherman pointed to the rollers tumbling in on the sandbank and to the great waves leaping up in clouds of foam against the headlands on either side of us  no boat that ever was built he answered could have got to her through that  sergeant cuff looked for the last time at the footmarks on the sand which the rain was now fast blurring out  there he said is the evidence that she cant have left this place by land and here he went on looking at the fisherman is the evidence that she cant have got away by sea he stopped and considered for a minute she was seen running towards this place half an hour before i got here from the house he said to yolland some time has passed since then call it altogether an hour ago how high would the water be at that time on this side of the rocks he pointed to the south sideotherwise the side which was not filled up by the quicksand  as the tide makes today said the fisherman there wouldnt have been water enough to drown a kitten on that side of the spit an hour since  sergeant cuff turned about northward towards the quicksand  how much on this side he asked  less still answered yolland the shivering sand would have been just awash and no more  the sergeant turned to me and said that the accident must have happened on the side of the quicksand my tongue was loosened at that no accident i told him when she came to this place she came weary of her life to end it here  he started back from me how do you know he asked the rest of them crowded round the sergeant recovered himself instantly he put them back from me he said i was an old man he said the discovery had shaken me he said let him alone a little then he turned to yolland and asked is there any chance of finding her when the tide ebbs again and yolland answered none what the sand gets the sand keeps for ever having said that the fisherman came a step nearer and addressed himself to me  mr betteredge he said i have a word to say to you about the young womans death four foot out broadwise along the side of the spit theres a shelf of rock about half fathom down under the sand my question iswhy didnt she strike that if she slipped by accident from off the spit she fell in where theres foothold at the bottom at a depth that would barely cover her to the waist she must have waded out or jumped out into the deeps beyondor she wouldnt be missing now no accident sir the deeps of the quicksand have got her and they have got her by her own act  after that testimony from a man whose knowledge was to be relied on the sergeant was silent the rest of us like him held our peace with one accord we all turned back up the slope of the beach  at the sandhillocks we were met by the undergroom running to us from the house the lad is a good lad and has an honest respect for me he handed me a little note with a decent sorrow in his face penelope sent me with this mr betteredge he said she found it in rosannas room  it was her last farewell word to the old man who had done his bestthank god always done his bestto befriend her  you have often forgiven me mr betteredge in past times when you next see the shivering sand try to forgive me once more i have found my grave where my grave was waiting for me i have lived and died sir grateful for your kindness  there was no more than that little as it was i hadnt manhood enough to hold up against it your tears come easy when youre young and beginning the world your tears come easy when youre old and leaving it i burst out crying  sergeant cuff took a step nearer to memeaning kindly i dont doubt i shrank back from him dont touch me i said its the dread of you that has driven her to it  you are wrong mr betteredge he answered quietly but there will be time enough to speak of it when we are indoors again  i followed the rest of them with the help of the grooms arm through the driving rain we went backto meet the trouble and the terror that were waiting for us at the house    chapter xx   those in front had spread the news before us we found the servants in a state of panic as we passed my ladys door it was thrown open violently from the inner side my mistress came out among us with mr franklin following and trying vainly to compose her quite beside herself with the horror of the thing  you are answerable for this she cried out threatening the sergeant wildly with her hand gabriel give that wretch his moneyand release me from the sight of him  the sergeant was the only one among us who was fit to cope with herbeing the only one among us who was in possession of himself  i am no more answerable for this distressing calamity my lady than you are he said if in half an hour from this you still insist on my leaving the house i will accept your ladyships dismissal but not your ladyships money  it was spoken very respectfully but very firmly at the same timeand it had its effect on my mistress as well as on me she suffered mr franklin to lead her back into the room as the door closed on the two the sergeant looking about among the womenservants in his observant way noticed that while all the rest were merely frightened penelope was in tears when your father has changed his wet clothes he said to her come and speak to us in your fathers room  before the halfhour was out i had got my dry clothes on and had lent sergeant cuff such change of dress as he required penelope came in to us to hear what the sergeant wanted with her i dont think i ever felt what a good dutiful daughter i had so strongly as i felt it at that moment i took her and sat her on my knee and i prayed god bless her she hid her head on my bosom and put her arms round my neckand we waited a little while in silence the poor dead girl must have been at the bottom of it i think with my daughter and with me the sergeant went to the window and stood there looking out i thought it right to thank him for considering us both in this wayand i did  people in high life have all the luxuries to themselvesamong others the luxury of indulging their feelings people in low life have no such privilege necessity which spares our betters has no pity on us we learn to put our feelings back into ourselves and to jog on with our duties as patiently as may be i dont complain of thisi only notice it penelope and i were ready for the sergeant as soon as the sergeant was ready on his side asked if she knew what had led her fellowservant to destroy herself my daughter answered as you will foresee that it was for love of mr franklin blake asked next if she had mentioned this notion of hers to any other person penelope answered i have not mentioned it for rosannas sake i felt it necessary to add a word to this i said and for mr franklins sake my dear as well if rosanna has died for love of him it is not with his knowledge or by his fault let him leave the house today if he does leave it without the useless pain of knowing the truth sergeant cuff said quite right and fell silent again comparing penelopes notion as it seemed to me with some other notion of his own which he kept to himself  at the end of the halfhour my mistresss bell rang  on my way to answer it i met mr franklin coming out of his aunts sittingroom he mentioned that her ladyship was ready to see sergeant cuffin my presence as beforeand he added that he himself wanted to say two words to the sergeant first on our way back to my room he stopped and looked at the railway timetable in the hall  are you really going to leave us sir i asked miss rachel will surely come right again if you only give her time  she will come right again answered mr franklin when she hears that i have gone away and that she will see me no more  i thought he spoke in resentment of my young ladys treatment of him but it was not so my mistress had noticed from the time when the police first came into the house that the bare mention of him was enough to set miss rachels temper in a flame he had been too fond of his cousin to like to confess this to himself until the truth had been forced on him when she drove off to her aunts his eyes once opened in that cruel way which you know of mr franklin had taken his resolutionthe one resolution which a man of any spirit could taketo leave the house  what he had to say to the sergeant was spoken in my presence he described her ladyship as willing to acknowledge that she had spoken overhastily and he asked if sergeant cuff would consentin that caseto accept his fee and to leave the matter of the diamond where the matter stood now the sergeant answered no sir my fee is paid me for doing my duty i decline to take it until my duty is done  i dont understand you says mr franklin  ill explain myself sir says the sergeant when i came here i undertook to throw the necessary light on the matter of the missing diamond i am now ready and waiting to redeem my pledge when i have stated the case to lady verinder as the case now stands and when i have told her plainly what course of action to take for the recovery of the moonstone the responsibility will be off my shoulders let her ladyship decide after that whether she does or does not allow me to go on i shall then have done what i undertook to doand ill take my fee  in those words sergeant cuff reminded us that even in the detective police a man may have a reputation to lose  the view he took was so plainly the right one that there was no more to be said as i rose to conduct him to my ladys room he asked if mr franklin wished to be present mr franklin answered not unless lady verinder desires it he added in a whisper to me as i was following the sergeant out i know what that man is going to say about rachel and i am too fond of her to hear it and keep my temper leave me by myself  i left him miserable enough leaning on the sill of my window with his face hidden in his hands and penelope peeping through the door longing to comfort him in mr franklins place i should have called her in when you are illused by one woman there is great comfort in telling it to anotherbecause nine times out of ten the other always takes your side perhaps when my back was turned he did call her in in that case it is only doing my daughter justice to declare that she would stick at nothing in the way of comforting mr franklin blake  in the meantime sergeant cuff and i proceeded to my ladys room  at the last conference we had held with her we had found her not over willing to lift her eyes from the book which she had on the table on this occasion there was a change for the better she met the sergeants eye with an eye that was as steady as his own the family spirit showed itself in every line of her face and i knew that sergeant cuff would meet his match when a woman like my mistress was strung up to hear the worst he could say to her    chapter xxi   the first words when we had taken our seats were spoken by my lady  sergeant cuff she said there was perhaps some excuse for the inconsiderate manner in which i spoke to you half an hour since i have no wish however to claim that excuse i say with perfect sincerity that i regret it if i wronged you  the grace of voice and manner with which she made him that atonement had its due effect on the sergeant he requested permission to justify himselfputting his justification as an act of respect to my mistress it was impossible he said that he could be in any way responsible for the calamity which had shocked us all for this sufficient reason that his success in bringing his inquiry to its proper end depended on his neither saying nor doing anything that could alarm rosanna spearman he appealed to me to testify whether he had or had not carried that object out i could and did bear witness that he had and there as i thought the matter might have been judiciously left to come to an end  sergeant cuff however took it a step further evidently as you shall now judge with the purpose of forcing the most painful of all possible explanations to take place between her ladyship and himself  i have heard a motive assigned for the young womans suicide said the sergeant which may possibly be the right one it is a motive quite unconnected with the case which i am conducting here i am bound to add however that my own opinion points the other way some unbearable anxiety in connexion with the missing diamond has i believe driven the poor creature to her own destruction i dont pretend to know what that unbearable anxiety may have been but i think with your ladyships permission i can lay my hand on a person who is capable of deciding whether i am right or wrong  is the person now in the house my mistress asked after waiting a little  the person has left the house my lady  that answer pointed as straight to miss rachel as straight could be a silence dropped on us which i thought would never come to an end lord how the wind howled and how the rain drove at the window as i sat there waiting for one or other of them to speak again  be so good as to express yourself plainly said my lady do you refer to my daughter  i do said sergeant cuff in so many words  my mistress had her chequebook on the table when we entered the roomno doubt to pay the sergeant his fee she now put it back in the drawer it went to my heart to see how her poor hand trembledthe hand that had loaded her old servant with benefits the hand that i pray god may take mine when my time comes and i leave my place for ever  i had hoped said my lady very slowly and quietly to have recompensed your services and to have parted with you without miss verinders name having been openly mentioned between us as it has been mentioned now my nephew has probably said something of this before you came into my room  mr blake gave his message my lady and i gave mr blake a reason  it is needless to tell me your reason after what you have just said you know as well as i do that you have gone too far to go back i owe it to myself and i owe it to my child to insist on your remaining here and to insist on your speaking out  the sergeant looked at his watch  if there had been time my lady he answered i should have preferred writing my report instead of communicating it by word of mouth but if this inquiry is to go on time is of too much importance to be wasted in writing i am ready to go into the matter at once it is a very painful matter for me to speak of and for you to hear  there my mistress stopped him once more  i may possibly make it less painful to you and to my good servant and friend here she said if i set the example of speaking boldly on my side you suspect miss verinder of deceiving us all by secreting the diamond for some purpose of her own is that true  quite true my lady  very well now before you begin i have to tell you as miss verinders mother that she is absolutely incapable of doing what you suppose her to have done your knowledge of her character dates from a day or two since my knowledge of her character dates from the beginning of her life state your suspicion of her as strongly as you pleaseit is impossible that you can offend me by doing so i am sure beforehand that with all your experience the circumstances have fatally misled you in this case mind i am in possession of no private information i am as absolutely shut out of my daughters confidence as you are my one reason for speaking positively is the reason you have heard already i know my child  she turned to me and gave me her hand i kissed it in silence you may go on she said facing the sergeant again as steadily as ever  sergeant cuff bowed my mistress had produced but one effect on him his hatchetface softened for a moment as if he was sorry for her as to shaking him in his own conviction it was plain to see that she had not moved him by a single inch he settled himself in his chair and he began his vile attack on miss rachels character in these words  i must ask your ladyship he said to look this matter in the face from my point of view as well as from yours will you please to suppose yourself coming down here in my place and with my experience and will you allow me to mention very briefly what that experience has been  my mistress signed to him that she would do this the sergeant went on  for the last twenty years he said i have been largely employed in cases of family scandal acting in the capacity of confidential man the one result of my domestic practice which has any bearing on the matter now in hand is a result which i may state in two words it is well within my experience that young ladies of rank and position do occasionally have private debts which they dare not acknowledge to their nearest relatives and friends sometimes the milliner and the jeweller are at the bottom of it sometimes the money is wanted for purposes which i dont suspect in this case and which i wont shock you by mentioning bear in mind what i have said my ladyand now let us see how events in this house have forced me back on my own experience whether i liked it or not  he considered with himself for a moment and went onwith a horrid clearness that obliged you to understand him with an abominable justice that favoured nobody  my first information relating to the loss of the moonstone said the sergeant came to me from superintendent seegrave he proved to my complete satisfaction that he was perfectly incapable of managing the case the one thing he said which struck me as worth listening to was thisthat miss verinder had declined to be questioned by him and had spoken to him with a perfectly incomprehensible rudeness and contempt i thought this curiousbut i attributed it mainly to some clumsiness on the superintendents part which might have offended the young lady after that i put it by in my mind and applied myself singlehanded to the case it ended as you are aware in the discovery of the smear on the door and in mr franklin blakes evidence satisfying me that this same smear and the loss of the diamond were pieces of the same puzzle so far if i suspected anything i suspected that the moonstone had been stolen and that one of the servants might prove to be the thief very good in this state of things what happens miss verinder suddenly comes out of her room and speaks to me i observe three suspicious appearances in that young lady she is still violently agitated though more than fourandtwenty hours have passed since the diamond was lost she treats me as she has already treated superintendent seegrave and she is mortally offended with mr franklin blake very good again here i say to myself is a young lady who has lost a valuable jewela young lady also as my own eyes and ears inform me who is of an impetuous temperament under these circumstances and with that character what does she do she betrays an incomprehensible resentment against mr blake mr superintendent and myselfotherwise the very three people who have all in their different ways been trying to help her to recover her lost jewel having brought my inquiry to that pointthen my lady and not till then i begin to look back into my own mind for my own experience my own experience explains miss verinders otherwise incomprehensible conduct it associates her with those other young ladies that i know of it tells me she has debts she darent acknowledge that must be paid and it sets me asking myself whether the loss of the diamond may not meanthat the diamond must be secretly pledged to pay them that is the conclusion which my experience draws from plain facts what does your ladyships experience say against it  what i have said already answered my mistress the circumstances have misled you  i said nothing on my side robinson crusoegod knows howhad got into my muddled old head if sergeant cuff had found himself at that moment transported to a desert island without a man friday to keep him company or a ship to take him offhe would have found himself exactly where i wished him to be nota benei am an average good christian when you dont push my christianity too far and all the rest of youwhich is a great comfortare in this respect much the same as i am  sergeant cuff went on  right or wrong my lady he said having drawn my conclusion the next thing to do was to put it to the test i suggested to your ladyship the examination of all the wardrobes in the house it was a means of finding the article of dress which had in all probability made the smear and it was a means of putting my conclusion to the test how did it turn out your ladyship consented mr blake consented mr ablewhite consented miss verinder alone stopped the whole proceeding by refusing pointblank that result satisfied me that my view was the right one if your ladyship and mr betteredge persist in not agreeing with me you must be blind to what happened before you this very day in your hearing i told the young lady that her leaving the house as things were then would put an obstacle in the way of my recovering her jewel you saw yourselves that she drove off in the face of that statement you saw yourself that so far from forgiving mr blake for having done more than all the rest of you to put the clue into my hands she publicly insulted mr blake on the steps of her mothers house what do these things mean if miss verinder is not privy to the suppression of the diamond what do these things mean  this time he looked my way it was downright frightful to hear him piling up proof after proof against miss rachel and to know while one was longing to defend her that there was no disputing the truth of what he said i am thank god constitutionally superior to reason this enabled me to hold firm to my ladys view which was my view also this roused my spirit and made me put a bold face on it before sergeant cuff profit good friends i beseech you by my example it will save you from many troubles of the vexing sort cultivate a superiority to reason and see how you pare the claws of all the sensible people when they try to scratch you for your own good  finding that i made no remark and that my mistress made no remark sergeant cuff proceeded lord how it did enrage me to notice that he was not in the least put out by our silence  there is the case my lady as it stands against miss verinder alone he said the next thing is to put the case as it stands against miss verinder and the deceased rosanna spearman taken together we will go back for a moment if you please to your daughters refusal to let her wardrobe be examined my mind being made up after that circumstance i had two questions to consider next first as to the right method of conducting my inquiry second as to whether miss verinder had an accomplice among the female servants in the house after carefully thinking it over i determined to conduct the inquiry in what we should call at our office a highly irregular manner for this reason i had a family scandal to deal with which it was my business to keep within the family limits the less noise made and the fewer strangers employed to help me the better as to the usual course of taking people in custody on suspicion going before the magistrate and all the rest of itnothing of the sort was to be thought of when your ladyships daughter was as i believed at the bottom of the whole business in this case i felt that a person of mr betteredges character and position in the houseknowing the servants as he did and having the honour of the family at heartwould be safer to take as an assistant than any other person whom i could lay my hand on i should have tried mr blake as wellbut for one obstacle in the way he saw the drift of my proceedings at a very early date and with his interest in miss verinder any mutual understanding was impossible between him and me i trouble your ladyship with these particulars to show you that i have kept the family secret within the family circle i am the only outsider who knows itand my professional existence depends on holding my tongue  here i felt that my professional existence depended on not holding my tongue to be held up before my mistress in my old age as a sort of deputypoliceman was once again more than my christianity was strong enough to bear  i beg to inform your ladyship i said that i never to my knowledge helped this abominable detective business in any way from first to last and i summon sergeant cuff to contradict me if he dares  having given vent in those words i felt greatly relieved her ladyship honoured me by a little friendly pat on the shoulder i looked with righteous indignation at the sergeant to see what he thought of such a testimony as that the sergeant looked back like a lamb and seemed to like me better than ever  my lady informed him that he might continue his statement i understand she said that you have honestly done your best in what you believe to be my interest i am ready to hear what you have to say next  what i have to say next answered sergeant cuff relates to rosanna spearman i recognised the young woman as your ladyship may remember when she brought the washingbook into this room up to that time i was inclined to doubt whether miss verinder had trusted her secret to any one when i saw rosanna i altered my mind i suspected her at once of being privy to the suppression of the diamond the poor creature has met her death by a dreadful end and i dont want your ladyship to think now shes gone that i was unduly hard on her if this had been a common case of thieving i should have given rosanna the benefit of the doubt just as freely as i should have given it to any of the other servants in the house our experience of the reformatory woman is that when tried in serviceand when kindly and judiciously treatedthey prove themselves in the majority of cases to be honestly penitent and honestly worthy of the pains taken with them but this was not a common case of thieving it was a casein my mindof a deeply planned fraud with the owner of the diamond at the bottom of it holding this view the first consideration which naturally presented itself to me in connection with rosanna was this would miss verinder be satisfied begging your ladyships pardon with leading us all to think that the moonstone was merely lost or would she go a step further and delude us into believing that the moonstone was stolen in the latter event there was rosanna spearmanwith the character of a thiefready to her hand the person of all others to lead your ladyship off and to lead me off on a false scent  was it possible i asked myself that he could put his case against miss rachel and rosanna in a more horrid point of view than this it was possible as you shall now see  i had another reason for suspecting the deceased woman he said which appears to me to have been stronger still who would be the very person to help miss verinder in raising money privately on the diamond rosanna spearman no young lady in miss verinders position could manage such a risky matter as that by herself a gobetween she must have and who so fit i ask again as rosanna spearman your ladyships deceased housemaid was at the top of her profession when she was a thief she had relations to my certain knowledge with one of the few men in london in the moneylending line who would advance a large sum on such a notable jewel as the moonstone without asking awkward questions or insisting on awkward conditions bear this in mind my lady and now let me show you how my suspicions have been justified by rosannas own acts and by the plain inferences to be drawn from them  he thereupon passed the whole of rosannas proceedings under review you are already as well acquainted with those proceedings as i am and you will understand how unanswerably this part of his report fixed the guilt of being concerned in the disappearance of the moonstone on the memory of the poor dead girl even my mistress was daunted by what he said now she made him no answer when he had done it didnt seem to matter to the sergeant whether he was answered or not on he went devil take him just as steady as ever  having stated the whole case as i understand it he said i have only to tell your ladyship now what i propose to do next i see two ways of bringing this inquiry successfully to an end one of those ways i look upon as a certainty the other i admit is a bold experiment and nothing more your ladyship shall decide shall we take the certainty first  my mistress made him a sign to take his own way and choose for himself  thank you said the sergeant well begin with the certainty as your ladyship is so good as to leave it to me whether miss verinder remains at frizinghall or whether she returns here i propose in either case to keep a careful watch on all her proceedingson the people she sees on the rides and walks she may take and on the letters she may write and receive  what next asked my mistress  i shall next answered the sergeant request your ladyships leave to introduce into the house as a servant in the place of rosanna spearman a woman accustomed to private inquiries of this sort for whose discretion i can answer  what next repeated my mistress  next proceeded the sergeant and last i propose to send one of my brotherofficers to make an arrangement with that moneylender in london whom i mentioned just now as formerly acquainted with rosanna spearmanand whose name and address your ladyship may rely on it have been communicated by rosanna to miss verinder i dont deny that the course of action i am now suggesting will cost money and consume time but the result is certain we run a line round the moonstone and we draw that line closer and closer till we find it in miss verinders possession supposing she decides to keep it if her debts press and she decides on sending it away then we have our man ready and we meet the moonstone on its arrival in london  to hear her own daughter made the subject of such a proposal as this stung my mistress into speaking angrily for the first time  consider your proposal declined in every particular she said and go on to your other way of bringing the inquiry to an end  my other way said the sergeant going on as easy as ever is to try that bold experiment to which i have alluded i think i have formed a pretty correct estimate of miss verinders temperament she is quite capable according to my belief of committing a daring fraud but she is too hot and impetuous in temper and too little accustomed to deceit as a habit to act the hypocrite in small things and to restrain herself under all provocations her feelings in this case have repeatedly got beyond her control at the very time when it was plainly her interest to conceal them it is on this peculiarity in her character that i now propose to act i want to give her a great shock suddenly under circumstances that will touch her to the quick in plain english i want to tell miss verinder without a word of warning of rosannas deathon the chance that her own better feelings will hurry her into making a clean breast of it does your ladyship accept that alternative  my mistress astonished me beyond all power of expression she answered him on the instant  yes i do  the ponychaise is ready said the sergeant i wish your ladyship good morning  my lady held up her hand and stopped him at the door  my daughters better feelings shall be appealed to as you propose she said but i claim the right as her mother of putting her to the test myself you will remain here if you please and i will go to frizinghall  for once in his life the great cuff stood speechless with amazement like an ordinary man  my mistress rang the bell and ordered her waterproof things it was still pouring with rain and the close carriage had gone as you know with miss rachel to frizinghall i tried to dissuade her ladyship from facing the severity of the weather quite useless i asked leave to go with her and hold the umbrella she wouldnt hear of it the ponychaise came round with the groom in charge you may rely on two things she said to sergeant cuff in the hall i will try the experiment on miss verinder as boldly as you could try it yourself and i will inform you of the result either personally or by letter before the last train leaves for london tonight  with that she stepped into the chaise and taking the reins herself drove off to frizinghall    chapter xxii   my mistress having left us i had leisure to think of sergeant cuff i found him sitting in a snug corner of the hall consulting his memorandum book and curling up viciously at the corners of the lips  making notes of the case i asked  no said the sergeant looking to see what my next professional engagement is  oh i said you think its all over then here  i think answered sergeant cuff that lady verinder is one of the cleverest women in england i also think a rose much better worth looking at than a diamond where is the gardener mr betteredge  there was no getting a word more out of him on the matter of the moonstone he had lost all interest in his own inquiry and he would persist in looking for the gardener an hour afterwards i heard them at high words in the conservatory with the dogrose once more at the bottom of the dispute  in the meantime it was my business to find out whether mr franklin persisted in his resolution to leave us by the afternoon train after having been informed of the conference in my ladys room and of how it had ended he immediately decided on waiting to hear the news from frizinghall this very natural alteration in his planswhich with ordinary people would have led to nothing in particularproved in mr franklins case to have one objectionable result it left him unsettled with a legacy of idle time on his hands and in so doing it let out all the foreign sides of his character one on the top of another like rats out of a bag  now as an italianenglishman now as a germanenglishman and now as a frenchenglishman he drifted in and out of all the sittingrooms in the house with nothing to talk of but miss rachels treatment of him and with nobody to address himself to but me i found him for example in the library sitting under the map of modern italy and quite unaware of any other method of meeting his troubles except the method of talking about them i have several worthy aspirations betteredge but what am i to do with them now i am full of dormant good qualities if rachel would only have helped me to bring them out he was so eloquent in drawing the picture of his own neglected merits and so pathetic in lamenting over it when it was done that i felt quite at my wits end how to console him when it suddenly occurred to me that here was a case for the wholesome application of a bit of robinson crusoe i hobbled out to my own room and hobbled back with that immortal book nobody in the library the map of modern italy stared at me and i stared at the map of modern italy  i tried the drawingroom there was his handkerchief on the floor to prove that he had drifted in and there was the empty room to prove that he had drifted out again  i tried the diningroom and discovered samuel with a biscuit and a glass of sherry silently investigating the empty air a minute since mr franklin had rung furiously for a little light refreshment on its production in a violent hurry by samuel mr franklin had vanished before the bell downstairs had quite done ringing with the pull he had given to it  i tried the morningroom and found him at last there he was at the window drawing hieroglyphics with his finger in the damp on the glass  your sherry is waiting for you sir i said to him i might as well have addressed myself to one of the four walls of the room he was down in the bottomless deep of his own meditations past all pulling up how do you explain rachels conduct betteredge was the only answer i received not being ready with the needful reply i produced robinson crusoe in which i am firmly persuaded some explanation might have been found if we had only searched long enough for it mr franklin shut up robinson crusoe and floundered into his germanenglish gibberish on the spot why not look into it he said as if i had personally objected to looking into it why the devil lose your patience betteredge when patience is all thats wanted to arrive at the truth dont interrupt me rachels conduct is perfectly intelligible if you will only do her the common justice to take the objective view first and the subjective view next and the objectivesubjective view to wind up with what do we know we know that the loss of the moonstone on thursday morning last threw her into a state of nervous excitement from which she has not recovered yet do you mean to deny the objective view so far very well thendont interrupt me now being in a state of nervous excitement how are we to expect that she should behave as she might otherwise have behaved to any of the people about her arguing in this way from withinoutwards what do we reach we reach the subjective view i defy you to controvert the subjective view very well thenwhat follows good heavens the objectivesubjective explanation follows of course rachel properly speaking is not rachel but somebody else do i mind being cruelly treated by somebody else you are unreasonable enough betteredge but you can hardly accuse me of that then how does it end it ends in spite of your confounded english narrowness and prejudice in my being perfectly happy and comfortable wheres the sherry  my head was by this time in such a condition that i was not quite sure whether it was my own head or mr franklins in this deplorable state i contrived to do what i take to have been three objective things i got mr franklin his sherry i retired to my own room and i solaced myself with the most composing pipe of tobacco i ever remember to have smoked in my life  dont suppose however that i was quit of mr franklin on such easy terms as these drifting again out of the morningroom into the hall he found his way to the offices next smelt my pipe and was instantly reminded that he had been simple enough to give up smoking for miss rachels sake in the twinkling of an eye he burst in on me with his cigarcase and came out strong on the one everlasting subject in his neat witty unbelieving french way give me a light betteredge is it conceivable that a man can have smoked as long as i have without discovering that there is a complete system for the treatment of women at the bottom of his cigarcase follow me carefully and i will prove it in two words you choose a cigar you try it and it disappoints you what do you do upon that you throw it away and try another now observe the application you choose a woman you try her and she breaks your heart fool take a lesson from your cigarcase throw her away and try another  i shook my head at that wonderfully clever i dare say but my own experience was dead against it in the time of the late mrs betteredge i said i felt pretty often inclined to try your philosophy mr franklin but the law insists on your smoking your cigar sir when you have once chosen it i pointed that observation with a wink mr franklin burst out laughingand we were as merry as crickets until the next new side of his character turned up in due course so things went on with my young master and me and so while the sergeant and the gardener were wrangling over the roses we two spent the interval before the news came back from frizinghall  the ponychaise returned a good half hour before i had ventured to expect it my lady had decided to remain for the present at her sisters house the groom brought two letters from his mistress one addressed to mr franklin and the other to me  mr franklins letter i sent to him in the libraryinto which refuge his driftings had now taken him for the second time my own letter i read in my own room a cheque which dropped out when i opened it informed me before i had mastered the contents that sergeant cuffs dismissal from the inquiry after the moonstone was now a settled thing  i sent to the conservatory to say that i wished to speak to the sergeant directly he appeared with his mind full of the gardener and the dogrose declaring that the equal of mr begbie for obstinacy never had existed yet and never would exist again i requested him to dismiss such wretched trifling as this from our conversation and to give his best attention to a really serious matter upon that he exerted himself sufficiently to notice the letter in my hand ah he said in a weary way you have heard from her ladyship have i anything to do with it mr betteredge  you shall judge for yourself sergeant i thereupon read him the letter with my best emphasis and discretion in the following words  my good gabrieli request that you will inform sergeant cuff that i have performed the promise i made to him with this result so far as rosanna spearman is concerned miss verinder solemnly declares that she has never spoken a word in private to rosanna since that unhappy woman first entered my house they never met even accidentally on the night when the diamond was lost and no communication of any sort whatever took place between them from the thursday morning when the alarm was first raised in the house to this present saturday afternoon when miss verinder left us after telling my daughter suddenly and in so many words of rosanna spearmans suicidethis is what has come of it  having reached that point i looked up and asked sergeant cuff what he thought of the letter so far  i should only offend you if i expressed my opinion answered the sergeant go on mr betteredge he said with the most exasperating resignation go on  when i remembered that this man had had the audacity to complain of our gardeners obstinacy my tongue itched to go on in other words than my mistresss this time however my christianity held firm i proceeded steadily with her ladyships letter  having appealed to miss verinder in the manner which the officer thought most desirable i spoke to her next in the manner which i myself thought most likely to impress her on two different occasions before my daughter left my roof i privately warned her that she was exposing herself to suspicion of the most unendurable and most degrading kind i have now told her in the plainest terms that my apprehensions have been realised  her answer to this on her own solemn affirmation is as plain as words can be in the first place she owes no money privately to any living creature in the second place the diamond is not now and never has been in her possession since she put it into her cabinet on wednesday night  the confidence which my daughter has placed in me goes no further than this she maintains an obstinate silence when i ask her if she can explain the disappearance of the diamond she refuses with tears when i appeal to her to speak out for my sake the day will come when you will know why i am careless about being suspected and why i am silent even to you i have done much to make my mother pity menothing to make my mother blush for me those are my daughters own words  after what has passed between the officer and me i thinkstranger as he isthat he should be made acquainted with what miss verinder has said as well as you read my letter to him and then place in his hands the cheque which i enclose in resigning all further claim on his services i have only to say that i am convinced of his honesty and his intelligence but i am more firmly persuaded than ever that the circumstances in this case have fatally misled him  there the letter ended before presenting the cheque i asked sergeant cuff if he had any remark to make  its no part of my duty mr betteredge he answered to make remarks on a case when i have done with it  i tossed the cheque across the table to him do you believe in that part of her ladyships letter i said indignantly  the sergeant looked at the cheque and lifted up his dismal eyebrows in acknowledgment of her ladyships liberality  this is such a generous estimate of the value of my time he said that i feel bound to make some return for it ill bear in mind the amount in this cheque mr betteredge when the occasion comes round for remembering it  what do you mean i asked  her ladyship has smoothed matters over for the present very cleverly said the sergeant but this family scandal is of the sort that bursts up again when you least expect it we shall have more detectivebusiness on our hands sir before the moonstone is many months older  if those words meant anything and if the manner in which he spoke them meant anythingit came to this my mistresss letter had proved to his mind that miss rachel was hardened enough to resist the strongest appeal that could be addressed to her and that she had deceived her own mother good god under what circumstances by a series of abominable lies how other people in my place might have replied to the sergeant i dont know i answered what he said in these plain terms  sergeant cuff i consider your last observation as an insult to my lady and her daughter  mr betteredge consider it as a warning to yourself and you will be nearer the mark  hot and angry as i was the infernal confidence with which he gave me that answer closed my lips  i walked to the window to compose myself the rain had given over and who should i see in the courtyard but mr begbie the gardener waiting outside to continue the dogrose controversy with sergeant cuff  my compliments to the sairgent said mr begbie the moment he set eyes on me if hes minded to walk to the station im agreeable to go with him  what cries the sergeant behind me are you not convinced yet  the deil a bit im convinced answered mr begbie  then ill walk to the station says the sergeant  then ill meet you at the gate says mr begbie  i was angry enough as you knowbut how was any mans anger to hold out against such an interruption as this sergeant cuff noticed the change in me and encouraged it by a word in season come come he said why not treat my view of the case as her ladyship treats it why not say the circumstances have fatally misled me  to take anything as her ladyship took it was a privilege worth enjoyingeven with the disadvantage of its having been offered to me by sergeant cuff i cooled slowly down to my customary level i regarded any other opinion of miss rachel than my ladys opinion or mine with a lofty contempt the only thing i could not do was to keep off the subject of the moonstone my own good sense ought to have warned me i know to let the matter restbut there the virtues which distinguish the present generation were not invented in my time sergeant cuff had hit me on the raw and though i did look down upon him with contempt the tender place still tingled for all that the end of it was that i perversely led him back to the subject of her ladyships letter i am quite satisfied myself i said but never mind that go on as if i was still open to conviction you think miss rachel is not to be believed on her word and you say we shall hear of the moonstone again back your opinion sergeant i concluded in an airy way back your opinion  instead of taking offence sergeant cuff seized my hand and shook it till my fingers ached again  i declare to heaven says this strange officer solemnly i would take to domestic service tomorrow mr betteredge if i had a chance of being employed along with you to say you are as transparent as a child sir is to pay the children a compliment which nine out of ten of them dont deserve there there we wont begin to dispute again you shall have it out of me on easier terms than that i wont say a word more about her ladyship or about miss verinderill only turn prophet for once in a way and for your sake i have warned you already that you havent done with the moonstone yet very well now ill tell you at parting of three things which will happen in the future and which i believe will force themselves on your attention whether you like it or not  go on i said quite unabashed and just as airy as ever  first said the sergeant you will hear something from the yollandswhen the postman delivers rosannas letter at cobbs hole on monday next  if he had thrown a bucket of cold water over me i doubt if i could have felt it much more unpleasantly than i felt those words miss rachels assertion of her innocence had left rosannas conductthe making the new nightgown the hiding the smeared nightgown and all the rest of itentirely without explanation and this had never occurred to me till sergeant cuff forced it on my mind all in a moment  in the second place proceeded the sergeant you will hear of the three indians again you will hear of them in the neighbourhood if miss rachel remains in the neighbourhood you will hear of them in london if miss rachel goes to london  having lost all interest in the three jugglers and having thoroughly convinced myself of my young ladys innocence i took this second prophecy easily enough so much for two of the three things that are going to happen i said now for the third  third and last said sergeant cuff you will sooner or later hear something of that moneylender in london whom i have twice taken the liberty of mentioning already give me your pocketbook and ill make a note for you of his name and addressso that there may be no mistake about it if the thing really happens  he wrote accordingly on a blank leafmr septimus luker middlesexplace lambeth london  there he said pointing to the address are the last words on the subject of the moonstone which i shall trouble you with for the present time will show whether i am right or wrong in the meanwhile sir i carry away with me a sincere personal liking for you which i think does honour to both of us if we dont meet again before my professional retirement takes place i hope you will come and see me in a little house near london which i have got my eye on there will be grass walks mr betteredge i promise you in my garden and as for the white moss rose  the deil a bit yell get the white moss rose to grow unless you bud him on the doguerose first cried a voice at the window  we both turned round there was the everlasting mr begbie too eager for the controversy to wait any longer at the gate the sergeant wrung my hand and darted out into the courtyard hotter still on his side ask him about the moss rose when he comes back and see if i have left him a leg to stand on cried the great cuff hailing me through the window in his turn gentlemen both i answered moderating them again as i had moderated them once already  in the matter of the moss rose there is a great deal to be said on both sides i might as well as the irish say have whistled jigs to a milestone away they went together fighting the battle of the roses without asking or giving quarter on either side the last i saw of them mr begbie was shaking his obstinate head and sergeant cuff had got him by the arm like a prisoner in charge ah well well i own i couldnt help liking the sergeantthough i hated him all the time  explain that state of mind if you can you will soon be rid now of me and my contradictions when i have reported mr franklins departure the history of the saturdays events will be finished at last and when i have next described certain strange things that happened in the course of the new week i shall have done my part of the story and shall hand over the pen to the person who is appointed to follow my lead if you are as tired of reading this narrative as i am of writing itlord how we shall enjoy ourselves on both sides a few pages further on    chapter xxiii   i had kept the pony chaise ready in case mr franklin persisted in leaving us by the train that night the appearance of the luggage followed downstairs by mr franklin himself informed me plainly enough that he had held firm to a resolution for once in his life  so you have really made up your mind sir i said as we met in the hall why not wait a day or two longer and give miss rachel another chance  the foreign varnish appeared to have all worn off mr franklin now that the time had come for saying goodbye instead of replying to me in words he put the letter which her ladyship had addressed to him into my hand the greater part of it said over again what had been said already in the other communication received by me but there was a bit about miss rachel added at the end which will account for the steadiness of mr franklins determination if it accounts for nothing else  you will wonder i dare say her ladyship wrote at my allowing my own daughter to keep me perfectly in the dark a diamond worth twenty thousand pounds has been lostand i am left to infer that the mystery of its disappearance is no mystery to rachel and that some incomprehensible obligation of silence has been laid on her by some person or persons utterly unknown to me with some object in view at which i cannot even guess is it conceivable that i should allow myself to be trifled with in this way it is quite conceivable in rachels present state she is in a condition of nervous agitation pitiable to see i dare not approach the subject of the moonstone again until time has done something to quiet her to help this end i have not hesitated to dismiss the policeofficer the mystery which baffles us baffles him too this is not a matter in which any stranger can help us he adds to what i have to suffer and he maddens rachel if she only hears his name  my plans for the future are as well settled as they can be my present idea is to take rachel to londonpartly to relieve her mind by a complete change partly to try what may be done by consulting the best medical advice can i ask you to meet us in town my dear franklin you in your way must imitate my patience and wait as i do for a fitter time the valuable assistance which you rendered to the inquiry after the lost jewel is still an unpardoned offence in the present dreadful state of rachels mind moving blindfold in this matter you have added to the burden of anxiety which she has had to bear by innocently threatening her secret with discovery through your exertions it is impossible for me to excuse the perversity that holds you responsible for consequences which neither you nor i could imagine or foresee she is not to be reasoned withshe can only be pitied i am grieved to have to say it but for the present you and rachel are better apart the only advice i can offer you is to give her time  i handed the letter back sincerely sorry for mr franklin for i knew how fond he was of my young lady and i saw that her mothers account of her had cut him to the heart you know the proverb sir was all i said to him when things are at the worst theyre sure to mend things cant be much worse mr franklin than they are now  mr franklin folded up his aunts letter without appearing to be much comforted by the remark which i had ventured on addressing to him  when i came here from london with that horrible diamond he said i dont believe there was a happier household in england than this look at the household now scattered disunitedthe very air of the place poisoned with mystery and suspicion do you remember that morning at the shivering sand when we talked about my uncle herncastle and his birthday gift the moonstone has served the colonels vengeance betteredge by means which the colonel himself never dreamt of  with that he shook me by the hand and went out to the pony chaise  i followed him down the steps it was very miserable to see him leaving the old place where he had spent the happiest years of his life in this way penelope sadly upset by all that had happened in the house came round crying to bid him goodbye mr franklin kissed her i waved my hand as much as to say youre heartily welcome sir some of the other female servants appeared peeping after him round the corner he was one of those men whom the women all like at the last moment i stopped the pony chaise and begged as a favour that he would let us hear from him by letter he didnt seem to heed what i saidhe was looking round from one thing to another taking a sort of farewell of the old house and grounds tell us where you are going to sir i said holding on by the chaise and trying to get at his future plans in that way mr franklin pulled his hat down suddenly over his eyes going says he echoing the word after me i am going to the devil the pony started at the word as if he had felt a christian horror of it god bless you sir go where you may was all i had time to say before he was out of sight and hearing a sweet and pleasant gentleman with all his faults and follies a sweet and pleasant gentleman he left a sad gap behind him when he left my ladys house  it was dull and dreary enough when the long summer evening closed in on that saturday night  i kept my spirits from sinking by sticking fast to my pipe and my robinson crusoe the women excepting penelope beguiled the time by talking of rosannas suicide they were all obstinately of opinion that the poor girl had stolen the moonstone and that she had destroyed herself in terror of being found out my daughter of course privately held fast to what she had said all along her notion of the motive which was really at the bottom of the suicide failed oddly enough just where my young ladys assertion of her innocence failed also it left rosannas secret journey to frizinghall and rosannas proceedings in the matter of the nightgown entirely unaccounted for there was no use in pointing this out to penelope the objection made about as much impression on her as a shower of rain on a waterproof coat the truth is my daughter inherits my superiority to reasonand in respect to that accomplishment has got a long way ahead of her own father  on the next day sunday the close carriage which had been kept at mr ablewhites came back to us empty the coachman brought a message for me and written instructions for my ladys own maid and for penelope  the message informed me that my mistress had determined to take miss rachel to her house in london on the monday the written instructions informed the two maids of the clothing that was wanted and directed them to meet their mistresses in town at a given hour most of the other servants were to follow my lady had found miss rachel so unwilling to return to the house after what had happened in it that she had decided on going to london direct from frizinghall i was to remain in the country until further orders to look after things indoors and out the servants left with me were to be put on board wages  being reminded by all this of what mr franklin had said about our being a scattered and disunited household my mind was led naturally to mr franklin himself the more i thought of him the more uneasy i felt about his future proceedings it ended in my writing by the sundays post to his fathers valet mr jeffco whom i had known in former years to beg he would let me know what mr franklin had settled to do on arriving in london  the sunday evening was if possible duller even than the saturday evening we ended the day of rest as hundreds of thousands of people end it regularly once a week in these islandsthat is to say we all anticipated bedtime and fell asleep in our chairs  how the monday affected the rest of the household i dont know the monday gave me a good shake up the first of sergeant cuffs prophecies of what was to happennamely that i should hear from the yollandscame true on that day  i had seen penelope and my ladys maid off in the railway with the luggage for london and was pottering about the grounds when i heard my name called turning round i found myself face to face with the fishermans daughter limping lucy bating her lame foot and her leanness this last a horrid drawback to a woman in my opinion the girl had some pleasing qualities in the eye of a man a dark keen clever face and a nice clear voice and a beautiful brown head of hair counted among her merits a crutch appeared in the list of her misfortunes and a temper reckoned high in the sum total of her defects  well my dear i said what do you want with me  wheres the man you call franklin blake says the girl fixing me with a fierce look as she rested herself on her crutch  thats not a respectful way to speak of any gentleman i answered if you wish to inquire for my ladys nephew you will please to mention him as mr franklin blake  she limped a step nearer to me and looked as if she could have eaten me alive mr franklin blake she repeated after me murderer franklin blake would be a fitter name for him  my practice with the late mrs betteredge came in handy here whenever a woman tries to put you out of temper turn the tables and put her out of temper instead they are generally prepared for every effort you can make in your own defence but that one word does it as well as a hundred and one word did it with limping lucy i looked her pleasantly in the face and i saidpooh  the girls temper flamed out directly she poised herself on her sound foot and she took her crutch and beat it furiously three times on the ground hes a murderer hes a murderer hes a murderer he has been the death of rosanna spearman she screamed that answer out at the top of her voice one or two of the people at work in the grounds near us looked upsaw it was limping lucyknew what to expect from that quarterand looked away again  he has been the death of rosanna spearman i repeated what makes you say that lucy  what do you care what does any man care oh if she had only thought of the men as i think she might have been living now  she always thought kindly of me poor soul i said and to the best of my ability i always tried to act kindly by her  i spoke those words in as comforting a manner as i could the truth is i hadnt the heart to irritate the girl by another of my smart replies i had only noticed her temper at first i noticed her wretchedness nowand wretchedness is not uncommonly insolent you will find in humble life my answer melted limping lucy she bent her head down and laid it on the top of her crutch  i loved her the girl said softly she had lived a miserable life mr betteredgevile people had illtreated her and led her wrongand it hadnt spoiled her sweet temper she was an angel she might have been happy with me i had a plan for our going to london together like sisters and living by our needles that man came here and spoilt it all he bewitched her dont tell me he didnt mean it and didnt know it he ought to have known it he ought to have taken pity on her i cant live without himand oh lucy he never even looks at me thats what she said cruel cruel cruel i said no man is worth fretting for in that way and she said there are men worth dying for lucy and he is one of them i had saved up a little money i had settled things with father and mother i meant to take her away from the mortification she was suffering here we should have had a little lodging in london and lived together like sisters she had a good education sir as you know and she wrote a good hand she was quick at her needle i have a good education and i write a good hand i am not as quick at my needle as she wasbut i could have done we might have got our living nicely and oh what happens this morning what happens this morning her letter comes and tells me that she has done with the burden of her life her letter comes and bids me goodbye for ever where is he cries the girl lifting her head from the crutch and flaming out again through her tears wheres this gentleman that i mustnt speak of except with respect ha mr betteredge the day is not far off when the poor will rise against the rich i pray heaven they may begin with him i pray heaven they may begin with him  here was another of your average good christians and here was the usual breakdown consequent on that same average christianity being pushed too far the parson himself though i own this is saying a great deal could hardly have lectured the girl in the state she was in now all i ventured to do was to keep her to the pointin the hope of something turning up which might be worth hearing  what do you want with mr franklin blake i asked  i want to see him  for anything particular  i have got a letter to give him  from rosanna spearman  yes  sent to you in your own letter  yes  was the darkness going to lift were all the discoveries that i was dying to make coming and offering themselves to me of their own accord i was obliged to wait a moment sergeant cuff had left his infection behind him certain signs and tokens personal to myself warned me that the detectivefever was beginning to set in again  you cant see mr franklin i said  i must and will see him  he went to london last night  limping lucy looked me hard in the face and saw that i was speaking the truth without a word more she turned about again instantly towards cobbs hole  stop i said i expect news of mr franklin blake tomorrow give me your letter and ill send it on to him by the post  limping lucy steadied herself on her crutch and looked back at me over her shoulder  i am to give it from my hands into his hands she said and i am to give it to him in no other way  shall i write and tell him what you have said  tell him i hate him and you will tell him the truth  yes yes but about the letter  if he wants the letter he must come back here and get it from me  with those words she limped off on the way to cobbs hole the detectivefever burnt up all my dignity on the spot i followed her and tried to make her talk all in vain it was my misfortune to be a manand limping lucy enjoyed disappointing me later in the day i tried my luck with her mother good mrs yolland could only cry and recommend a drop of comfort out of the dutch bottle i found the fisherman on the beach he said it was a bad job and went on mending his net neither father nor mother knew more than i knew the one way left to try was the chance which might come with the morning of writing to mr franklin blake  i leave you to imagine how i watched for the postman on tuesday morning he brought me two letters one from penelope which i had hardly patience enough to read announced that my lady and miss rachel were safely established in london the other from mr jeffco informed me that his masters son had left england already  on reaching the metropolis mr franklin had it appeared gone straight to his fathers residence he arrived at an awkward time mr blake the elder was up to his eyes in the business of the house of commons and was amusing himself at home that night with the favourite parliamentary plaything which they call a private bill mr jeffco himself showed mr franklin into his fathers study my dear franklin why do you surprise me in this way anything wrong yes something wrong with rachel i am dreadfully distressed about it grieved to hear it but i cant listen to you now when can you listen my dear boy i wont deceive you i can listen at the end of the session not a moment before goodnight thank you sir goodnight  such was the conversation inside the study as reported to me by mr jeffco the conversation outside the study was shorter still jeffco see what time the tidal train starts tomorrow morning at sixforty mr franklin have me called at five going abroad sir going jeffco wherever the railway chooses to take me shall i tell your father sir yes tell him at the end of the session  the next morning mr franklin had started for foreign parts to what particular place he was bound nobody himself included could presume to guess we might hear of him next in europe asia africa or america the chances were as equally divided as possible in mr jeffcos opinion among the four quarters of the globe  this newsby closing up all prospects of my bringing limping lucy and mr franklin togetherat once stopped any further progress of mine on the way to discovery penelopes belief that her fellowservant had destroyed herself through unrequited love for mr franklin blake was confirmedand that was all whether the letter which rosanna had left to be given to him after her death did or did not contain the confession which mr franklin had suspected her of trying to make to him in her lifetime it was impossible to say it might be only a farewell word telling nothing but the secret of her unhappy fancy for a person beyond her reach or it might own the whole truth about the strange proceedings in which sergeant cuff had detected her from the time when the moonstone was lost to the time when she rushed to her own destruction at the shivering sand a sealed letter it had been placed in limping lucys hand and a sealed letter it remained to me and to every one about the girl her own parents included we all suspected her of having been in the dead womans confidence we all tried to make her speak we all failed now one and now another of the servantsstill holding to the belief that rosanna had stolen the diamond and had hidden itpeered and poked about the rocks to which she had been traced and peered and poked in vain the tide ebbed and the tide flowed the summer went on and the autumn came and the quicksand which hid her body hid her secret too  the news of mr franklins departure from england on the sunday morning and the news of my ladys arrival in london with miss rachel on the monday afternoon had reached me as you are aware by the tuesdays post the wednesday came and brought nothing the thursday produced a second budget of news from penelope  my girls letter informed me that some great london doctor had been consulted about her young lady and had earned a guinea by remarking that she had better be amused flowershows operas ballsthere was a whole round of gaieties in prospect and miss rachel to her mothers astonishment eagerly took to it all mr godfrey had called evidently as sweet as ever on his cousin in spite of the reception he had met with when he tried his luck on the occasion of the birthday to penelopes great regret he had been most graciously received and had added miss rachels name to one of his ladies charities on the spot my mistress was reported to be out of spirits and to have held two long interviews with her lawyer certain speculations followed referring to a poor relation of the familyone miss clack whom i have mentioned in my account of the birthday dinner as sitting next to mr godfrey and having a pretty taste in champagne penelope was astonished to find that miss clack had not called yet she would surely not be long before she fastened herself on my lady as usualand so forth and so forth in the way women have of girding at each other on and off paper this would not have been worth mentioning i admit but for one reason i hear you are likely to be turned over to miss clack after parting with me in that case just do me the favour of not believing a word she says if she speaks of your humble servant  on friday nothing happenedexcept that one of the dogs showed signs of a breaking out behind the ears i gave him a dose of syrup of buckthorn and put him on a diet of potliquor and vegetables till further orders excuse my mentioning this it has slipped in somehow pass it over please i am fast coming to the end of my offences against your cultivated modern taste besides the dog was a good creature and deserved a good physicking he did indeed  saturday the last day of the week is also the last day in my narrative  the mornings post brought me a surprise in the shape of a london newspaper the handwriting on the direction puzzled me i compared it with the moneylenders name and address as recorded in my pocketbook and identified it at once as the writing of sergeant cuff  looking through the paper eagerly enough after this discovery i found an inkmark drawn round one of the police reports here it is at your service read it as i read it and you will set the right value on the sergeants polite attention in sending me the news of the day  lambethshortly before the closing of the court mr septimus luker the wellknown dealer in ancient gems carvings intagli c c applied to the sitting magistrate for advice the applicant stated that he had been annoyed at intervals throughout the day by the proceedings of some of those strolling indians who infest the streets the persons complained of were three in number after having been sent away by the police they had returned again and again and had attempted to enter the house on pretence of asking for charity warned off in the front they had been discovered again at the back of the premises besides the annoyance complained of mr luker expressed himself as being under some apprehension that robbery might be contemplated his collection contained many unique gems both classical and oriental of the highest value he had only the day before been compelled to dismiss a skilled workman in ivory carving from his employment a native of india as we understood on suspicion of attempted theft and he felt by no means sure that this man and the street jugglers of whom he complained might not be acting in concert it might be their object to collect a crowd and create a disturbance in the street and in the confusion thus caused to obtain access to the house in reply to the magistrate mr luker admitted that he had no evidence to produce of any attempt at robbery being in contemplation he could speak positively to the annoyance and interruption caused by the indians but not to anything else the magistrate remarked that if the annoyance were repeated the applicant could summon the indians to that court where they might easily be dealt with under the act as to the valuables in mr lukers possession mr luker himself must take the best measures for their safe custody he would do well perhaps to communicate with the police and to adopt such additional precautions as their experience might suggest the applicant thanked his worship and withdrew  one of the wise ancients is reported i forget on what occasion as having recommended his fellowcreatures to look to the end looking to the end of these pages of mine and wondering for some days past how i should manage to write it i find my plain statement of facts coming to a conclusion most appropriately of its own self we have gone on in this matter of the moonstone from one marvel to another and here we end with the greatest marvel of allnamely the accomplishment of sergeant cuffs three predictions in less than a week from the time when he had made them  after hearing from the yollands on the monday i had now heard of the indians and heard of the moneylender in the news from londonmiss rachel herself remember being also in london at the time you see i put things at their worst even when they tell dead against my own view if you desert me and side with the sergeant on the evidence before youif the only rational explanation you can see is that miss rachel and mr luker must have got together and that the moonstone must be now in pledge in the moneylenders housei own i cant blame you for arriving at that conclusion in the dark i have brought you thus far in the dark i am compelled to leave you with my best respects  why compelled it may be asked why not take the persons who have gone along with me so far up into those regions of superior enlightenment in which i sit myself  in answer to this i can only state that i am acting under orders and that those orders have been given to me as i understand in the interests of truth i am forbidden to tell more in this narrative than i knew myself at the time or to put it plainer i am to keep strictly within the limits of my own experience and am not to inform you of what other persons told mefor the very sufficient reason that you are to have the information from those other persons themselves at first hand in this matter of the moonstone the plan is not to present reports but to produce witnesses i picture to myself a member of the family reading these pages fifty years hence lord what a compliment he will feel it to be asked to take nothing on hearsay and to be treated in all respects like a judge on the bench  at this place then we partfor the present at leastafter long journeying together with a companionable feeling i hope on both sides the devils dance of the indian diamond has threaded its way to london and to london you must go after it leaving me at the countryhouse please to excuse the faults of this compositionmy talking so much of myself and being too familiar i am afraid with you i mean no harm and i drink most respectfully having just done dinner to your health and prosperity in a tankard of her ladyships ale may you find in these leaves of my writing what robinson crusoe found in his experience on the desert islandnamely something to comfort yourselves from and to set in the description of good and evil on the credit side of the accountfarewell  the end of the first period      second period  the discovery of the truth 18481849  the events related in several narratives     first narrative  contributed by miss clack niece of the late sir john verinder    chapter i   i am indebted to my dear parents both now in heaven for having had habits of order and regularity instilled into me at a very early age  in that happy bygone time i was taught to keep my hair tidy at all hours of the day and night and to fold up every article of my clothing carefully in the same order on the same chair in the same place at the foot of the bed before retiring to rest an entry of the days events in my little diary invariably preceded the folding up the evening hymn repeated in bed invariably followed the folding up and the sweet sleep of childhood invariably followed the evening hymn  in later life alas the hymn has been succeeded by sad and bitter meditations and the sweet sleep has been but ill exchanged for the broken slumbers which haunt the uneasy pillow of care on the other hand i have continued to fold my clothes and to keep my little diary the former habit links me to my happy childhoodbefore papa was ruined the latter habithitherto mainly useful in helping me to discipline the fallen nature which we all inherit from adamhas unexpectedly proved important to my humble interests in quite another way it has enabled poor me to serve the caprice of a wealthy member of the family into which my late uncle married i am fortunate enough to be useful to mr franklin blake  i have been cut off from all news of my relatives by marriage for some time past when we are isolated and poor we are not infrequently forgotten i am now living for economys sake in a little town in brittany inhabited by a select circle of serious english friends and possessed of the inestimable advantages of a protestant clergyman and a cheap market  in this retirementa patmos amid the howling ocean of popery that surrounds usa letter from england has reached me at last i find my insignificant existence suddenly remembered by mr franklin blake my wealthy relativewould that i could add my spirituallywealthy relativewrites without even an attempt at disguising that he wants something of me the whim has seized him to stir up the deplorable scandal of the moonstone and i am to help him by writing the account of what i myself witnessed while visiting at aunt verinders house in london pecuniary remuneration is offered to mewith the want of feeling peculiar to the rich i am to reopen wounds that time has barely closed i am to recall the most intensely painful remembrancesand this done i am to feel myself compensated by a new laceration in the shape of mr blakes cheque my nature is weak it cost me a hard struggle before christian humility conquered sinful pride and selfdenial accepted the cheque  without my diary i doubtpray let me express it in the grossest termsif i could have honestly earned my money with my diary the poor labourer who forgives mr blake for insulting her is worthy of her hire nothing escaped me at the time i was visiting dear aunt verinder everything was entered thanks to my early training day by day as it happened and everything down to the smallest particular shall be told here my sacred regard for truth is thank god far above my respect for persons it will be easy for mr blake to suppress what may not prove to be sufficiently flattering in these pages to the person chiefly concerned in them he has purchased my time but not even his wealth can purchase my conscience too        note added by franklin blakemiss clack may make her      mind quite easy on this point nothing will be added      altered or removed in her manuscript or in any of the      other manuscripts which pass through my hands whatever      opinions any of the writers may express whatever      peculiarities of treatment may mark and perhaps in a      literary sense disfigure the narratives which i am now      collecting not a line will be tampered with anywhere from      first to last as genuine documents they are sent to meand      as genuine documents i shall preserve them endorsed by the      attestations of witnesses who can speak to the facts it      only remains to be added that the person chiefly concerned      in miss clacks narrative is happy enough at the present      moment not only to brave the smartest exercise of miss      clacks pen but even to recognise its unquestionable value      as an instrument for the exhibition of miss clacks      character  my diary informs me that i was accidentally passing aunt verinders house in montagu square on monday 3rd july 1848  seeing the shutters opened and the blinds drawn up i felt that it would be an act of polite attention to knock and make inquiries the person who answered the door informed me that my aunt and her daughter i really cannot call her my cousin had arrived from the country a week since and meditated making some stay in london i sent up a message at once declining to disturb them and only begging to know whether i could be of any use  the person who answered the door took my message in insolent silence and left me standing in the hall she is the daughter of a heathen old man named betteredgelong too long tolerated in my aunts family i sat down in the hall to wait for my answerand having always a few tracts in my bag i selected one which proved to be quite providentially applicable to the person who answered the door the hall was dirty and the chair was hard but the blessed consciousness of returning good for evil raised me quite above any trifling considerations of that kind the tract was one of a series addressed to young women on the sinfulness of dress in style it was devoutly familiar its title was a word with you on your capribbons  my lady is much obliged and begs you will come and lunch tomorrow at two  i passed over the manner in which she gave her message and the dreadful boldness of her look i thanked this young castaway and i said in a tone of christian interest will you favour me by accepting a tract  she looked at the title is it written by a man or a woman miss if its written by a woman i had rather not read it on that account if its written by a man i beg to inform him that he knows nothing about it she handed me back the tract and opened the door we must sow the good seed somehow i waited till the door was shut on me and slipped the tract into the letterbox when i had dropped another tract through the area railings i felt relieved in some small degree of a heavy responsibility towards others  we had a meeting that evening of the select committee of the motherssmallclothesconversionsociety the object of this excellent charity isas all serious people knowto rescue unredeemed fathers trousers from the pawnbroker and to prevent their resumption on the part of the irreclaimable parent by abridging them immediately to suit the proportions of the innocent son i was a member at that time of the select committee and i mention the society here because my precious and admirable friend mr godfrey ablewhite was associated with our work of moral and material usefulness i had expected to see him in the boardroom on the monday evening of which i am now writing and had proposed to tell him when we met of dear aunt verinders arrival in london to my great disappointment he never appeared on my expressing a feeling of surprise at his absence my sisters of the committee all looked up together from their trousers we had a great pressure of business that night and asked in amazement if i had not heard the news i acknowledged my ignorance and was then told for the first time of an event which forms so to speak the startingpoint of this narrative on the previous friday two gentlemenoccupying widelydifferent positions in societyhad been the victims of an outrage which had startled all london one of the gentlemen was mr septimus luker of lambeth the other was mr godfrey ablewhite  living in my present isolation i have no means of introducing the newspaperaccount of the outrage into my narrative i was also deprived at the time of the inestimable advantage of hearing the events related by the fervid eloquence of mr godfrey ablewhite all i can do is to state the facts as they were stated on that monday evening to me proceeding on the plan which i have been taught from infancy to adopt in folding up my clothes everything shall be put neatly and everything shall be put in its place these lines are written by a poor weak woman from a poor weak woman who will be cruel enough to expect more  the datethanks to my dear parents no dictionary that ever was written can be more particular than i am about dateswas friday june 30th 1848  early on that memorable day our gifted mr godfrey happened to be cashing a cheque at a bankinghouse in lombard street the name of the firm is accidentally blotted in my diary and my sacred regard for truth forbids me to hazard a guess in a matter of this kind fortunately the name of the firm doesnt matter what does matter is a circumstance that occurred when mr godfrey had transacted his business on gaining the door he encountered a gentlemana perfect stranger to himwho was accidentally leaving the office exactly at the same time as himself a momentary contest of politeness ensued between them as to who should be the first to pass through the door of the bank the stranger insisted on making mr godfrey precede him mr godfrey said a few civil words they bowed and parted in the street  thoughtless and superficial people may say here is surely a very trumpery little incident related in an absurdly circumstantial manner oh my young friends and fellowsinners beware of presuming to exercise your poor carnal reason oh be morally tidy let your faith be as your stockings and your stockings as your faith both ever spotless and both ready to put on at a moments notice  i beg a thousand pardons i have fallen insensibly into my sundayschool style most inappropriate in such a record as this let me try to be worldlylet me say that trifles in this case as in many others led to terrible results merely premising that the polite stranger was mr luker of lambeth we will now follow mr godfrey home to his residence at kilburn  he found waiting for him in the hall a poorly clad but delicate and interestinglooking little boy the boy handed him a letter merely mentioning that he had been entrusted with it by an old lady whom he did not know and who had given him no instructions to wait for an answer such incidents as these were not uncommon in mr godfreys large experience as a promoter of public charities he let the boy go and opened the letter  the handwriting was entirely unfamiliar to him it requested his attendance within an hours time at a house in northumberland street strand which he had never had occasion to enter before the object sought was to obtain from the worthy manager certain details on the subject of the motherssmallclothesconversionsociety and the information was wanted by an elderly lady who proposed adding largely to the resources of the charity if her questions were met by satisfactory replies she mentioned her name and she added that the shortness of her stay in london prevented her from giving any longer notice to the eminent philanthropist whom she addressed  ordinary people might have hesitated before setting aside their own engagements to suit the convenience of a stranger the christian hero never hesitates where good is to be done mr godfrey instantly turned back and proceeded to the house in northumberland street a most respectable though somewhat corpulent man answered the door and on hearing mr godfreys name immediately conducted him into an empty apartment at the back on the drawingroom floor he noticed two unusual things on entering the room one of them was a faint odour of musk and camphor the other was an ancient oriental manuscript richly illuminated with indian figures and devices that lay open to inspection on a table  he was looking at the book the position of which caused him to stand with his back turned towards the closed folding doors communicating with the front room when without the slightest previous noise to warn him he felt himself suddenly seized round the neck from behind he had just time to notice that the arm round his neck was naked and of a tawnybrown colour before his eyes were bandaged his mouth was gagged and he was thrown helpless on the floor by as he judged two men a third rifled his pockets andif as a lady i may venture to use such an expressionsearched him without ceremony through and through to his skin  here i should greatly enjoy saying a few cheering words on the devout confidence which could alone have sustained mr godfrey in an emergency so terrible as this perhaps however the position and appearance of my admirable friend at the culminating period of the outrage as above described are hardly within the proper limits of female discussion let me pass over the next few moments and return to mr godfrey at the time when the odious search of his person had been completed the outrage had been perpetrated throughout in dead silence at the end of it some words were exchanged among the invisible wretches in a language which he did not understand but in tones which were plainly expressive to his cultivated ear of disappointment and rage he was suddenly lifted from the ground placed in a chair and bound there hand and foot the next moment he felt the air flowing in from the open door listened and concluded that he was alone again in the room  an interval elapsed and he heard a sound below like the rustling sound of a womans dress it advanced up the stairs and stopped a female scream rent the atmosphere of guilt a mans voice below exclaimed hullo a mans feet ascended the stairs mr godfrey felt christian fingers unfastening his bandage and extracting his gag he looked in amazement at two respectable strangers and faintly articulated what does it mean the two respectable strangers looked back and said exactly the question we were going to ask you  the inevitable explanation followed no let me be scrupulously particular sal volatile and water followed to compose dear mr godfreys nerves the explanation came next  it appeared from the statement of the landlord and landlady of the house persons of good repute in the neighbourhood that their first and second floor apartments had been engaged on the previous day for a week certain by a most respectablelooking gentlemanthe same who has been already described as answering the door to mr godfreys knock the gentleman had paid the weeks rent and all the weeks extras in advance stating that the apartments were wanted for three oriental noblemen friends of his who were visiting england for the first time early on the morning of the outrage two of the oriental strangers accompanied by their respectable english friend took possession of the apartments the third was expected to join them shortly and the luggage reported as very bulky was announced to follow when it had passed through the customhouse late in the afternoon not more than ten minutes previous to mr godfreys visit the third foreigner had arrived nothing out of the common had happened to the knowledge of the landlord and landlady downstairs until within the last five minuteswhen they had seen the three foreigners accompanied by their respectable english friend all leave the house together walking quietly in the direction of the strand remembering that a visitor had called and not having seen the visitor also leave the house the landlady had thought it rather strange that the gentleman should be left by himself upstairs after a short discussion with her husband she had considered it advisable to ascertain whether anything was wrong the result had followed as i have already attempted to describe it and there the explanation of the landlord and the landlady came to an end  an investigation was next made in the room dear mr godfreys property was found scattered in all directions when the articles were collected however nothing was missing his watch chain purse keys pockethandkerchief notebook and all his loose papers had been closely examined and had then been left unharmed to be resumed by the owner in the same way not the smallest morsel of property belonging to the proprietors of the house had been abstracted the oriental noblemen had removed their own illuminated manuscript and had removed nothing else  what did it mean taking the worldly point of view it appeared to mean that mr godfrey had been the victim of some incomprehensible error committed by certain unknown men a dark conspiracy was on foot in the midst of us and our beloved and innocent friend had been entangled in its meshes when the christian hero of a hundred charitable victories plunges into a pitfall that has been dug for him by mistake oh what a warning it is to the rest of us to be unceasingly on our guard how soon may our own evil passions prove to be oriental noblemen who pounce on us unawares  i could write pages of affectionate warning on this one theme but alas i am not permitted to improvei am condemned to narrate my wealthy relatives chequehenceforth the incubus of my existencewarns me that i have not done with this record of violence yet we must leave mr godfrey to recover in northumberland street and must follow the proceedings of mr luker at a later period of the day  after leaving the bank mr luker had visited various parts of london on business errands returning to his own residence he found a letter waiting for him which was described as having been left a short time previously by a boy in this case as in mr godfreys case the handwriting was strange but the name mentioned was the name of one of mr lukers customers his correspondent announced writing in the third personapparently by the hand of a deputy that he had been unexpectedly summoned to london he had just established himself in lodgings in alfred place tottenham court road and he desired to see mr luker immediately on the subject of a purchase which he contemplated making the gentleman was an enthusiastic collector of oriental antiquities and had been for many years a liberal patron of the establishment in lambeth oh when shall we wean ourselves from the worship of mammon mr luker called a cab and drove off instantly to his liberal patron  exactly what had happened to mr godfrey in northumberland street now happened to mr luker in alfred place once more the respectable man answered the door and showed the visitor upstairs into the back drawingroom there again lay the illuminated manuscript on a table mr lukers attention was absorbed as mr godfreys attention had been absorbed by this beautiful work of indian art he too was aroused from his studies by a tawny naked arm round his throat by a bandage over his eyes and by a gag in his mouth he too was thrown prostrate and searched to the skin a longer interval had then elapsed than had passed in the experience of mr godfrey but it had ended as before in the persons of the house suspecting something wrong and going upstairs to see what had happened precisely the same explanation which the landlord in northumberland street had given to mr godfrey the landlord in alfred place now gave to mr luker both had been imposed on in the same way by the plausible address and wellfilled purse of the respectable stranger who introduced himself as acting for his foreign friends the one point of difference between the two cases occurred when the scattered contents of mr lukers pockets were being collected from the floor his watch and purse were safe but less fortunate than mr godfrey one of the loose papers that he carried about him had been taken away the paper in question acknowledged the receipt of a valuable of great price which mr luker had that day left in the care of his bankers this document would be useless for purposes of fraud inasmuch as it provided that the valuable should only be given up on the personal application of the owner as soon as he recovered himself mr luker hurried to the bank on the chance that the thieves who had robbed him might ignorantly present themselves with the receipt nothing had been seen of them when he arrived at the establishment and nothing was seen of them afterwards their respectable english friend had in the opinion of the bankers looked the receipt over before they attempted to make use of it and had given them the necessary warning in good time  information of both outrages was communicated to the police and the needful investigations were pursued i believe with great energy the authorities held that a robbery had been planned on insufficient information received by the thieves they had been plainly not sure whether mr luker had or had not trusted the transmission of his precious gem to another person and poor polite mr godfrey had paid the penalty of having been seen accidentally speaking to him add to this that mr godfreys absence from our monday evening meeting had been occasioned by a consultation of the authorities at which he was requested to assistand all the explanations required being now given i may proceed with the simpler story of my own little personal experiences in montagu square  i was punctual to the luncheon hour on tuesday reference to my diary shows this to have been a chequered daymuch in it to be devoutly regretted much in it to be devoutly thankful for  dear aunt verinder received me with her usual grace and kindness but i noticed after a little while that something was wrong certain anxious looks escaped my aunt all of which took the direction of her daughter i never see rachel myself without wondering how it can be that so insignificantlooking a person should be the child of such distinguished parents as sir john and lady verinder on this occasion however she not only disappointedshe really shocked me there was an absence of all ladylike restraint in her language and manner most painful to see she was possessed by some feverish excitement which made her distressingly loud when she laughed and sinfully wasteful and capricious in what she ate and drank at lunch i felt deeply for her poor mother even before the true state of the case had been confidentially made known to me  luncheon over my aunt said remember what the doctor told you rachel about quieting yourself with a book after taking your meals  ill go into the library mamma she answered but if godfrey calls mind i am told of it i am dying for more news of him after his adventure in northumberland street she kissed her mother on the forehead and looked my way goodbye clack she said carelessly her insolence roused no angry feeling in me i only made a private memorandum to pray for her  when we were left by ourselves my aunt told me the whole horrible story of the indian diamond which i am happy to know it is not necessary to repeat here she did not conceal from me that she would have preferred keeping silence on the subject but when her own servants all knew of the loss of the moonstone and when some of the circumstances had actually found their way into the newspaperswhen strangers were speculating whether there was any connection between what had happened at lady verinders countryhouse and what had happened in northumberland street and alfred placeconcealment was not to be thought of and perfect frankness became a necessity as well as a virtue  some persons hearing what i now heard would have been probably overwhelmed with astonishment for my own part knowing rachels spirit to have been essentially unregenerate from her childhood upwards i was prepared for whatever my aunt could tell me on the subject of her daughter it might have gone on from bad to worse till it ended in murder and i should still have said to myself the natural result oh dear dear the natural result the one thing that did shock me was the course my aunt had taken under the circumstances here surely was a case for a clergyman if ever there was one yet lady verinder had thought it a case for a physician all my poor aunts early life had been passed in her fathers godless household the natural result again oh dear dear the natural result again  the doctors recommend plenty of exercise and amusement for rachel and strongly urge me to keep her mind as much as possible from dwelling on the past said lady verinder  oh what heathen advice i thought to myself in this christian country what heathen advice  my aunt went on i do my best to carry out my instructions but this strange adventure of godfreys happens at a most unfortunate time rachel has been incessantly restless and excited since she first heard of it she left me no peace till i had written and asked my nephew ablewhite to come here she even feels an interest in the other person who was roughly usedmr luker or some such namethough the man is of course a total stranger to her  your knowledge of the world dear aunt is superior to mine i suggested diffidently but there must be a reason surely for this extraordinary conduct on rachels part she is keeping a sinful secret from you and from everybody may there not be something in these recent events which threatens her secret with discovery  discovery repeated my aunt what can you possibly mean discovery through mr luker discovery through my nephew  as the word passed her lips a special providence occurred the servant opened the door and announced mr godfrey ablewhite    chapter ii   mr godfrey followed the announcement of his nameas mr godfrey does everything elseexactly at the right time he was not so close on the servants heels as to startle us he was not so far behind as to cause us the double inconvenience of a pause and an open door it is in the completeness of his daily life that the true christian appears this dear man was very complete  go to miss verinder said my aunt addressing the servant and tell her mr ablewhite is here  we both inquired after his health we both asked him together whether he felt like himself again after his terrible adventure of the past week with perfect tact he contrived to answer us at the same moment lady verinder had his reply in words i had his charming smile  what he cried with infinite tenderness have i done to deserve all this sympathy my dear aunt my dear miss clack i have merely been mistaken for somebody else i have only been blindfolded i have only been strangled i have only been thrown flat on my back on a very thin carpet covering a particularly hard floor just think how much worse it might have been i might have been murdered i might have been robbed what have i lost nothing but nervous forcewhich the law doesnt recognise as property so that strictly speaking i have lost nothing at all if i could have had my own way i would have kept my adventure to myselfi shrink from all this fuss and publicity but mr luker made his injuries public and my injuries as the necessary consequence have been proclaimed in their turn i have become the property of the newspapers until the gentle reader gets sick of the subject i am very sick indeed of it myself may the gentle reader soon be like me and how is dear rachel still enjoying the gaieties of london so glad to hear it miss clack i need all your indulgence i am sadly behindhand with my committee work and my dear ladies but i really do hope to look in at the motherssmallclothes next week did you make cheering progress at mondays committee was the board hopeful about future prospects and are we nicely off for trousers  the heavenly gentleness of his smile made his apologies irresistible the richness of his deep voice added its own indescribable charm to the interesting business question which he had just addressed to me in truth we were almost too nicely off for trousers we were quite overwhelmed by them i was just about to say so when the door opened again and an element of worldly disturbance entered the room in the person of miss verinder  she approached dear mr godfrey at a most unladylike rate of speed with her hair shockingly untidy and her face what i should call unbecomingly flushed  i am charmed to see you godfrey she said addressing him i grieve to add in the offhand manner of one young man talking to another i wish you had brought mr luker with you you and he as long as our present excitement lasts are the two most interesting men in all london its morbid to say this its unhealthy its all that a wellregulated mind like miss clacks most instinctively shudders at never mind that tell me the whole of the northumberland street story directly i know the newspapers have left some of it out  even dear mr godfrey partakes of the fallen nature which we all inherit from adamit is a very small share of our human legacy but alas he has it i confess it grieved me to see him take rachels hand in both of his own hands and lay it softly on the left side of his waistcoat it was a direct encouragement to her reckless way of talking and her insolent reference to me  dearest rachel he said in the same voice which had thrilled me when he spoke of our prospects and our trousers the newspapers have told you everythingand they have told it much better than i can  godfrey thinks we all make too much of the matter my aunt remarked he has just been saying that he doesnt care to speak of it  why  she put the question with a sudden flash in her eyes and a sudden look up into mr godfreys face on his side he looked down at her with an indulgence so injudicious and so illdeserved that i really felt called on to interfere  rachel darling i remonstrated gently true greatness and true courage are ever modest  you are a very good fellow in your way godfrey she saidnot taking the smallest notice observe of me and still speaking to her cousin as if she was one young man addressing another but i am quite sure you are not great i dont believe you possess any extraordinary courage and i am firmly persuadedif you ever had any modestythat your ladyworshippers relieved you of that virtue a good many years since you have some private reason for not talking of your adventure in northumberland street and i mean to know it  my reason is the simplest imaginable and the most easily acknowledged he answered still bearing with her i am tired of the subject  you are tired of the subject my dear godfrey i am going to make a remark  what is it  you live a great deal too much in the society of women and you have contracted two very bad habits in consequence you have learnt to talk nonsense seriously and you have got into a way of telling fibs for the pleasure of telling them you cant go straight with your ladyworshippers i mean to make you go straight with me come and sit down i am brimful of downright questions and i expect you to be brimful of downright answers  she actually dragged him across the room to a chair by the window where the light would fall on his face i deeply feel being obliged to report such language and to describe such conduct but hemmed in as i am between mr franklin blakes cheque on one side and my own sacred regard for truth on the other what am i to do i looked at my aunt she sat unmoved apparently in no way disposed to interfere i had never noticed this kind of torpor in her before it was perhaps the reaction after the trying time she had had in the country not a pleasant symptom to remark be it what it might at dear lady verinders age and with dear lady verinders autumnal exuberance of figure  in the meantime rachel had settled herself at the window with our amiable and forbearingour too forbearingmr godfrey she began the string of questions with which she had threatened him taking no more notice of her mother or of myself than if we had not been in the room  have the police done anything godfrey  nothing whatever  it is certain i suppose that the three men who laid the trap for you were the same three men who afterwards laid the trap for mr luker  humanly speaking my dear rachel there can be no doubt of it  and not a trace of them has been discovered  not a trace  it is thoughtis it notthat these three men are the three indians who came to our house in the country  some people think so  do you think so  my dear rachel they blindfolded me before i could see their faces i know nothing whatever of the matter how can i offer an opinion on it  even the angelic gentleness of mr godfrey was you see beginning to give way at last under the persecution inflicted on him whether unbridled curiosity or ungovernable dread dictated miss verinders questions i do not presume to inquire i only report that on mr godfreys attempting to rise after giving her the answer just described she actually took him by the two shoulders and pushed him back into his chairoh dont say this was immodest dont even hint that the recklessness of guilty terror could alone account for such conduct as i have described we must not judge others my christian friends indeed indeed indeed we must not judge others  she went on with her questions unabashed earnest biblical students will perhaps be remindedas i was remindedof the blinded children of the devil who went on with their orgies unabashed in the time before the flood  i want to know something about mr luker godfrey  i am again unfortunate rachel no man knows less of mr luker than i do  you never saw him before you and he met accidentally at the bank  never  you have seen him since  yes we have been examined together as well as separately to assist the police  mr luker was robbed of a receipt which he had got from his bankerswas he not what was the receipt for  for a valuable gem which he had placed in the safe keeping of the bank  thats what the newspapers say it may be enough for the general reader but it is not enough for me the bankers receipt must have mentioned what the gem was  the bankers receipt rachelas i have heard it describedmentioned nothing of the kind a valuable gem belonging to mr luker deposited by mr luker sealed with mr lukers seal and only to be given up on mr lukers personal application that was the form and that is all i know about it  she waited a moment after he had said that she looked at her mother and sighed she looked back again at mr godfrey and went on  some of our private affairs at home she said seem to have got into the newspapers  i grieve to say it is so  and some idle people perfect strangers to us are trying to trace a connexion between what happened at our house in yorkshire and what has happened since here in london  the public curiosity in certain quarters is i fear taking that turn  the people who say that the three unknown men who illused you and mr luker are the three indians also say that the valuable gem  there she stopped she had become gradually within the last few moments whiter and whiter in the face the extraordinary blackness of her hair made this paleness by contrast so ghastly to look at that we all thought she would faint at the moment when she checked herself in the middle of her question dear mr godfrey made a second attempt to leave his chair my aunt entreated her to say no more i followed my aunt with a modest medicinal peaceoffering in the shape of a bottle of salts we none of us produced the slightest effect on her godfrey stay where you are mamma there is not the least reason to be alarmed about me clack youre dying to hear the end of iti wont faint expressly to oblige you  those were the exact words she usedtaken down in my diary the moment i got home but oh dont let us judge my christian friends dont let us judge  she turned once more to mr godfrey with an obstinacy dreadful to see she went back again to the place where she had checked herself and completed her question in these words  i spoke to you a minute since about what people were saying in certain quarters tell me plainly godfrey do they any of them say that mr lukers valuable gem isthe moonstone  as the name of the indian diamond passed her lips i saw a change come over my admirable friend his complexion deepened he lost the genial suavity of manner which is one of his greatest charms a noble indignation inspired his reply  they do say it he answered there are people who dont hesitate to accuse mr luker of telling a falsehood to serve some private interests of his own he has over and over again solemnly declared that until this scandal assailed him he had never even heard of the moonstone and these vile people reply without a shadow of proof to justify them he has his reasons for concealment we decline to believe him on his oath shameful shameful  rachel looked at him very strangelyi cant well describe howwhile he was speaking when he had done she said considering that mr luker is only a chance acquaintance of yours you take up his cause godfrey rather warmly  my gifted friend made her one of the most truly evangelical answers i ever heard in my life  i hope rachel i take up the cause of all oppressed people rather warmly he said  the tone in which those words were spoken might have melted a stone but oh dear what is the hardness of stone nothing compared to the hardness of the unregenerate human heart she sneered i blush to record itshe sneered at him to his face  keep your noble sentiments for your ladies committees godfrey i am certain that the scandal which has assailed mr luker has not spared you  even my aunts torpor was roused by those words  my dear rachel she remonstrated you have really no right to say that  i mean no harm mammai mean good have a moments patience with me and you will see  she looked back at mr godfrey with what appeared to be a sudden pity for him she went the lengththe very unladylike lengthof taking him by the hand  i am certain she said that i have found out the true reason of your unwillingness to speak of this matter before my mother and before me an unlucky accident has associated you in peoples minds with mr luker you have told me what scandal says of him what does scandal say of you  even at the eleventh hour dear mr godfreyalways ready to return good for eviltried to spare her  dont ask me he said its better forgotten rachelit is indeed  i will hear it she cried out fiercely at the top of her voice  tell her godfrey entreated my aunt nothing can do her such harm as your silence is doing now  mr godfreys fine eyes filled with tears he cast one last appealing look at herand then he spoke the fatal words  if you will have it rachelscandal says that the moonstone is in pledge to mr luker and that i am the man who has pawned it  she started to her feet with a scream she looked backwards and forwards from mr godfrey to my aunt and from my aunt to mr godfrey in such a frantic manner that i really thought she had gone mad  dont speak to me dont touch me she exclaimed shrinking back from all of us i declare like some hunted animal into a corner of the room this is my fault i must set it right i have sacrificed myselfi had a right to do that if i liked but to let an innocent man be ruined to keep a secret which destroys his character for lifeoh good god its too horrible i cant bear it  my aunt half rose from her chair then suddenly sat down again she called to me faintly and pointed to a little phial in her workbox  quick she whispered six drops in water dont let rachel see  under other circumstances i should have thought this strange there was no time now to thinkthere was only time to give the medicine dear mr godfrey unconsciously assisted me in concealing what i was about from rachel by speaking composing words to her at the other end of the room  indeed indeed you exaggerate i heard him say my reputation stands too high to be destroyed by a miserable passing scandal like this it will be all forgotten in another week let us never speak of it again she was perfectly inaccessible even to such generosity as this she went on from bad to worse  i must and will stop it she said mamma hear what i say miss clack hear what i say i know the hand that took the moonstone i know she laid a strong emphasis on the words she stamped her foot in the rage that possessed heri know that godfrey ablewhite is innocent take me to the magistrate godfrey take me to the magistrate and i will swear it  my aunt caught me by the hand and whispered stand between us for a minute or two dont let rachel see me i noticed a bluish tinge in her face which alarmed me she saw i was startled the drops will put me right in a minute or two she said and so closed her eyes and waited a little  while this was going on i heard dear mr godfrey still gently remonstrating  you must not appear publicly in such a thing as this he said your reputation dearest rachel is something too pure and too sacred to be trifled with  my reputation she burst out laughing why i am accused godfrey as well as you the best detective officer in england declares that i have stolen my own diamond ask him what he thinksand he will tell you that i have pledged the moonstone to pay my private debts she stopped ran across the roomand fell on her knees at her mothers feet oh mamma mamma mamma i must be madmustnt inot to own the truth now she was too vehement to notice her mothers conditionshe was on her feet again and back with mr godfrey in an instant i wont let youi wont let any innocent manbe accused and disgraced through my fault if you wont take me before the magistrate draw out a declaration of your innocence on paper and i will sign it do as i tell you godfrey or ill write it to the newspapers ill go out and cry it in the streets  we will not say this was the language of remorsewe will say it was the language of hysterics indulgent mr godfrey pacified her by taking a sheet of paper and drawing out the declaration she signed it in a feverish hurry show it everywheredont think of me she said as she gave it to him i am afraid godfrey i have not done you justice hitherto in my thoughts you are more unselfishyou are a better man than i believed you to be come here when you can and i will try and repair the wrong i have done you  she gave him her hand alas for our fallen nature alas for mr godfrey he not only forgot himself so far as to kiss her handhe adopted a gentleness of tone in answering her which in such a case was little better than a compromise with sin i will come dearest he said on condition that we dont speak of this hateful subject again never had i seen and heard our christian hero to less advantage than on this occasion  before another word could be said by anybody a thundering knock at the street door startled us all i looked through the window and saw the world the flesh and the devil waiting before the houseas typified in a carriage and horses a powdered footman and three of the most audaciously dressed women i ever beheld in my life  rachel started and composed herself she crossed the room to her mother  they have come to take me to the flowershow she said one word mamma before i go i have not distressed you have i  is the bluntness of moral feeling which could ask such a question as that after what had just happened to be pitied or condemned i like to lean towards mercy let us pity it  the drops had produced their effect my poor aunts complexion was like itself again no no my dear she said go with our friends and enjoy yourself  her daughter stooped and kissed her i had left the window and was near the door when rachel approached it to go out another change had come over hershe was in tears i looked with interest at the momentary softening of that obdurate heart i felt inclined to say a few earnest words alas my wellmeant sympathy only gave offence what do you mean by pitying me she asked in a bitter whisper as she passed to the door dont you see how happy i am im going to the flowershow clack and ive got the prettiest bonnet in london she completed the hollow mockery of that address by blowing me a kissand so left the room  i wish i could describe in words the compassion i felt for this miserable and misguided girl but i am almost as poorly provided with words as with money permit me to saymy heart bled for her  returning to my aunts chair i observed dear mr godfrey searching for something softly here and there in different parts of the room before i could offer to assist him he had found what he wanted he came back to my aunt and me with his declaration of innocence in one hand and with a box of matches in the other  dear aunt a little conspiracy he said dear miss clack a pious fraud which even your high moral rectitude will excuse will you leave rachel to suppose that i accept the generous selfsacrifice which has signed this paper and will you kindly bear witness that i destroy it in your presence before i leave the house he kindled a match and lighting the paper laid it to burn in a plate on the table any trifling inconvenience that i may suffer is as nothing he remarked compared with the importance of preserving that pure name from the contaminating contact of the world there we have reduced it to a little harmless heap of ashes and our dear impulsive rachel will never know what we have done how do you feel my precious friends how do you feel for my poor part i am as lighthearted as a boy  he beamed on us with his beautiful smile he held out a hand to my aunt and a hand to me i was too deeply affected by his noble conduct to speak i closed my eyes i put his hand in a kind of spiritual selfforgetfulness to my lips he murmured a soft remonstrance oh the ecstasy the pure unearthly ecstasy of that moment i sati hardly know on whatquite lost in my own exalted feelings when i opened my eyes again it was like descending from heaven to earth there was nobody but my aunt in the room he had gone  i should like to stop herei should like to close my narrative with the record of mr godfreys noble conduct unhappily there is more much more which the unrelenting pecuniary pressure of mr blakes cheque obliges me to tell the painful disclosures which were to reveal themselves in my presence during that tuesdays visit to montagu square were not at an end yet  finding myself alone with lady verinder i turned naturally to the subject of her health touching delicately on the strange anxiety which she had shown to conceal her indisposition and the remedy applied to it from the observation of her daughter  my aunts reply greatly surprised me  drusilla she said if i have not already mentioned that my christian name is drusilla permit me to mention it now you are touching quite innocently i knowon a very distressing subject  i rose immediately delicacy left me but one alternativethe alternative after first making my apologies of taking my leave lady verinder stopped me and insisted on my sitting down again  you have surprised a secret she said which i had confided to my sister mrs ablewhite and to my lawyer mr bruff and to no one else i can trust in their discretion and i am sure when i tell you the circumstances i can trust in yours have you any pressing engagement drusilla or is your time your own this afternoon  it is needless to say that my time was entirely at my aunts disposal  keep me company then she said for another hour i have something to tell you which i believe you will be sorry to hear and i shall have a service to ask of you afterwards if you dont object to assist me  it is again needless to say that so far from objecting i was all eagerness to assist her  you can wait here she went on till mr bruff comes at five and you can be one of the witnesses drusilla when i sign my will  her will i thought of the drops which i had seen in her workbox i thought of the bluish tinge which i had noticed in her complexion a light which was not of this worlda light shining prophetically from an unmade gravedawned on my mind my aunts secret was a secret no longer    chapter iii   consideration for poor lady verinder forbade me even to hint that i had guessed the melancholy truth before she opened her lips i waited her pleasure in silence and having privately arranged to say a few sustaining words at the first convenient opportunity felt prepared for any duty that could claim me no matter how painful it might be  i have been seriously ill drusilla for some time past my aunt began and strange to say without knowing it myself  i thought of the thousands and thousands of perishing human creatures who were all at that moment spiritually ill without knowing it themselves and i greatly feared that my poor aunt might be one of the number yes dear i said sadly yes  i brought rachel to london as you know for medical advice she went on i thought it right to consult two doctors  two doctors and oh me in rachels state not one clergyman yes dear i said once more yes  one of the two medical men proceeded my aunt was a stranger to me the other had been an old friend of my husbands and had always felt a sincere interest in me for my husbands sake after prescribing for rachel he said he wished to speak to me privately in another room i expected of course to receive some special directions for the management of my daughters health to my surprise he took me gravely by the hand and said i have been looking at you lady verinder with a professional as well as a personal interest you are i am afraid far more urgently in need of medical advice than your daughter he put some questions to me which i was at first inclined to treat lightly enough until i observed that my answers distressed him it ended in his making an appointment to come and see me accompanied by a medical friend on the next day at an hour when rachel would not be at home the result of that visitmost kindly and gently conveyed to mesatisfied both the physicians that there had been precious time lost which could never be regained and that my case had now passed beyond the reach of their art for more than two years i have been suffering under an insidious form of heart disease which without any symptoms to alarm me has by little and little fatally broken me down i may live for some months or i may die before another day has passed over my headthe doctors cannot and dare not speak more positively than this it would be vain to say my dear that i have not had some miserable moments since my real situation has been made known to me but i am more resigned than i was and i am doing my best to set my worldly affairs in order my one great anxiety is that rachel should be kept in ignorance of the truth if she knew it she would at once attribute my broken health to anxiety about the diamond and would reproach herself bitterly poor child for what is in no sense her fault both the doctors agree that the mischief began two if not three years since i am sure you will keep my secret drusillafor i am sure i see sincere sorrow and sympathy for me in your face  sorrow and sympathy oh what pagan emotions to expect from a christian englishwoman anchored firmly on her faith  little did my poor aunt imagine what a gush of devout thankfulness thrilled through me as she approached the close of her melancholy story here was a career of usefulness opened before me here was a beloved relative and perishing fellowcreature on the eve of the great change utterly unprepared and led providentially led to reveal her situation to me how can i describe the joy with which i now remembered that the precious clerical friends on whom i could rely were to be counted not by ones or twos but by tens and twenties i took my aunt in my armsmy overflowing tenderness was not to be satisfied now with anything less than an embrace oh i said to her fervently the indescribable interest with which you inspire me oh the good i mean to do you dear before we part after another word or two of earnest prefatory warning i gave her her choice of three precious friends all plying the work of mercy from morning to night in her own neighbourhood all equally inexhaustible in exhortation all affectionately ready to exercise their gifts at a word from me alas the result was far from encouraging poor lady verinder looked puzzled and frightened and met everything i could say to her with the purely worldly objection that she was not strong enough to face strangers i yieldedfor the moment only of course my large experience as reader and visitor under not less first and last than fourteen beloved clerical friends informed me that this was another case for preparation by books i possessed a little library of works all suitable to the present emergency all calculated to arouse convince prepare enlighten and fortify my aunt you will read dear wont you i said in my most winning way you will read if i bring you my own precious books turned down at all the right places aunt and marked in pencil where you are to stop and ask yourself does this apply to me even that simple appealso absolutely heathenising is the influence of the worldappeared to startle my aunt she said i will do what i can drusilla to please you with a look of surprise which was at once instructive and terrible to see not a moment was to be lost the clock on the mantelpiece informed me that i had just time to hurry home to provide myself with a first series of selected readings say a dozen only and to return in time to meet the lawyer and witness lady verinders will promising faithfully to be back by five oclock i left the house on my errand of mercy  when no interests but my own are involved i am humbly content to get from place to place by the omnibus permit me to give an idea of my devotion to my aunts interests by recording that on this occasion i committed the prodigality of taking a cab  i drove home selected and marked my first series of readings and drove back to montagu square with a dozen works in a carpetbag the like of which i firmly believe are not to be found in the literature of any other country in europe i paid the cabman exactly his fare he received it with an oath upon which i instantly gave him a tract if i had presented a pistol at his head this abandoned wretch could hardly have exhibited greater consternation he jumped up on his box and with profane exclamations of dismay drove off furiously quite useless i am happy to say i sowed the good seed in spite of him by throwing a second tract in at the window of the cab  the servant who answered the doornot the person with the capribbons to my great relief but the footmaninformed me that the doctor had called and was still shut up with lady verinder mr bruff the lawyer had arrived a minute since and was waiting in the library i was shown into the library to wait too  mr bruff looked surprised to see me he is the family solicitor and we had met more than once on previous occasions under lady verinders roof a man i grieve to say grown old and grizzled in the service of the world a man who in his hours of business was the chosen prophet of law and mammon and who in his hours of leisure was equally capable of reading a novel and of tearing up a tract  have you come to stay here miss clack he asked with a look at my carpetbag  to reveal the contents of my precious bag to such a person as this would have been simply to invite an outburst of profanity i lowered myself to his own level and mentioned my business in the house  my aunt has informed me that she is about to sign her will i answered she has been so good as to ask me to be one of the witnesses  aye aye well miss clack you will do you are over twentyone and you have not the slightest pecuniary interest in lady verinders will  not the slightest pecuniary interest in lady verinders will oh how thankful i felt when i heard that if my aunt possessed of thousands had remembered poor me to whom five pounds is an objectif my name had appeared in the will with a little comforting legacy attached to itmy enemies might have doubted the motive which had loaded me with the choicest treasures of my library and had drawn upon my failing resources for the prodigal expenses of a cab not the cruellest scoffer of them all could doubt now much better as it was oh surely surely much better as it was  i was aroused from these consoling reflections by the voice of mr bruff my meditative silence appeared to weigh upon the spirits of this worldling and to force him as it were into talking to me against his own will  well miss clack whats the last news in the charitable circles how is your friend mr godfrey ablewhite after the mauling he got from the rogues in northumberland street egad theyre telling a pretty story about that charitable gentleman at my club  i had passed over the manner in which this person had remarked that i was more than twentyone and that i had no pecuniary interest in my aunts will but the tone in which he alluded to dear mr godfrey was too much for my forbearance feeling bound after what had passed in my presence that afternoon to assert the innocence of my admirable friend whenever i found it called in questioni own to having also felt bound to include in the accomplishment of this righteous purpose a stinging castigation in the case of mr bruff  i live very much out of the world i said and i dont possess the advantage sir of belonging to a club but i happen to know the story to which you allude and i also know that a viler falsehood than that story never was told  yes yes miss clackyou believe in your friend natural enough mr godfrey ablewhite wont find the world in general quite so easy to convince as a committee of charitable ladies appearances are dead against him he was in the house when the diamond was lost and he was the first person in the house to go to london afterwards those are ugly circumstances maam viewed by the light of later events  i ought i know to have set him right before he went any farther i ought to have told him that he was speaking in ignorance of a testimony to mr godfreys innocence offered by the only person who was undeniably competent to speak from a positive knowledge of the subject alas the temptation to lead the lawyer artfully on to his own discomfiture was too much for me i asked what he meant by later eventswith an appearance of the utmost innocence  by later events miss clack i mean events in which the indians are concerned proceeded mr bruff getting more and more superior to poor me the longer he went on what do the indians do the moment they are let out of the prison at frizinghall they go straight to london and fix on mr luker what follows mr luker feels alarmed for the safety of a valuable of great price which he has got in the house he lodges it privately under a general description in his bankers strongroom wonderfully clever of him but the indians are just as clever on their side they have their suspicions that the valuable of great price is being shifted from one place to another and they hit on a singularly bold and complete way of clearing those suspicions up whom do they seize and search not mr luker onlywhich would be intelligible enoughbut mr godfrey ablewhite as well why mr ablewhites explanation is that they acted on blind suspicion after seeing him accidentally speaking to mr luker absurd halfadozen other people spoke to mr luker that morning why were they not followed home too and decoyed into the trap no no the plain inference is that mr ablewhite had his private interest in the valuable as well as mr luker and that the indians were so uncertain as to which of the two had the disposal of it that there was no alternative but to search them both public opinion says that miss clack and public opinion on this occasion is not easily refuted  he said those last words looking so wonderfully wise in his own worldly conceit that i really to my shame be it spoken could not resist leading him a little farther still before i overwhelmed him with the truth  i dont presume to argue with a clever lawyer like you i said but is it quite fair sir to mr ablewhite to pass over the opinion of the famous london police officer who investigated this case not the shadow of a suspicion rested upon anybody but miss verinder in the mind of sergeant cuff  do you mean to tell me miss clack that you agree with the sergeant  i judge nobody sir and i offer no opinion  and i commit both those enormities maam i judge the sergeant to have been utterly wrong and i offer the opinion that if he had known rachels character as i know it he would have suspected everybody in the house but her i admit that she has her faultsshe is secret and selfwilled odd and wild and unlike other girls of her age but true as steel and highminded and generous to a fault if the plainest evidence in the world pointed one way and if nothing but rachels word of honour pointed the other i would take her word before the evidence lawyer as i am strong language miss clack but i mean it  would you object to illustrate your meaning mr bruff so that i may be sure i understand it suppose you found miss verinder quite unaccountably interested in what has happened to mr ablewhite and mr luker suppose she asked the strangest questions about this dreadful scandal and displayed the most ungovernable agitation when she found out the turn it was taking  suppose anything you please miss clack it wouldnt shake my belief in rachel verinder by a hairsbreadth  she is so absolutely to be relied on as that  so absolutely to be relied on as that  then permit me to inform you mr bruff that mr godfrey ablewhite was in this house not two hours since and that his entire innocence of all concern in the disappearance of the moonstone was proclaimed by miss verinder herself in the strongest language i ever heard used by a young lady in my life  i enjoyed the triumphthe unholy triumph i fear i must admitof seeing mr bruff utterly confounded and overthrown by a few plain words from me he started to his feet and stared at me in silence i kept my seat undisturbed and related the whole scene as it had occurred and what do you say about mr ablewhite now i asked with the utmost possible gentleness as soon as i had done  if rachel has testified to his innocence miss clack i dont scruple to say that i believe in his innocence as firmly as you do i have been misled by appearances like the rest of the world and i will make the best atonement i can by publicly contradicting the scandal which has assailed your friend wherever i meet with it in the meantime allow me to congratulate you on the masterly manner in which you have opened the full fire of your batteries on me at the moment when i least expected it you would have done great things in my profession maam if you had happened to be a man  with those words he turned away from me and began walking irritably up and down the room  i could see plainly that the new light i had thrown on the subject had greatly surprised and disturbed him certain expressions dropped from his lips as he became more and more absorbed in his own thoughts which suggested to my mind the abominable view that he had hitherto taken of the mystery of the lost moonstone he had not scrupled to suspect dear mr godfrey of the infamy of stealing the diamond and to attribute rachels conduct to a generous resolution to conceal the crime on miss verinders own authoritya perfectly unassailable authority as you are aware in the estimation of mr bruffthat explanation of the circumstances was now shown to be utterly wrong the perplexity into which i had plunged this high legal authority was so overwhelming that he was quite unable to conceal it from notice what a case i heard him say to himself stopping at the window in his walk and drumming on the glass with his fingers it not only defies explanation its even beyond conjecture  there was nothing in these words which made any reply at all needful on my partand yet i answered them it seems hardly credible that i should not have been able to let mr bruff alone even now it seems almost beyond mere mortal perversity that i should have discovered in what he had just said a new opportunity of making myself personally disagreeable to him butah my friends nothing is beyond mortal perversity and anything is credible when our fallen natures get the better of us  pardon me for intruding on your reflections i said to the unsuspecting mr bruff but surely there is a conjecture to make which has not occurred to us yet  maybe miss clack i own i dont know what it is  before i was so fortunate sir as to convince you of mr ablewhites innocence you mentioned it as one of the reasons for suspecting him that he was in the house at the time when the diamond was lost permit me to remind you that mr franklin blake was also in the house at the time when the diamond was lost  the old worldling left the window took a chair exactly opposite to mine and looked at me steadily with a hard and vicious smile  you are not so good a lawyer miss clack he remarked in a meditative manner as i supposed you dont know how to let well alone  i am afraid i fail to follow you mr bruff i said modestly  it wont do miss clackit really wont do a second time franklin blake is a prime favourite of mine as you are well aware but that doesnt matter ill adopt your view on this occasion before you have time to turn round on me youre quite right maam i have suspected mr ablewhite on grounds which abstractedly justify suspecting mr blake too very goodlets suspect them together its quite in his character we will say to be capable of stealing the moonstone the only question is whether it was his interest to do so  mr franklin blakes debts i remarked are matters of family notoriety  and mr godfrey ablewhites debts have not arrived at that stage of development yet quite true but there happen to be two difficulties in the way of your theory miss clack i manage franklin blakes affairs and i beg to inform you that the vast majority of his creditors knowing his father to be a rich man are quite content to charge interest on their debts and to wait for their money there is the first difficultywhich is tough enough you will find the second tougher still i have it on the authority of lady verinder herself that her daughter was ready to marry franklin blake before that infernal indian diamond disappeared from the house she had drawn him on and put him off again with the coquetry of a young girl but she had confessed to her mother that she loved cousin franklin and her mother had trusted cousin franklin with the secret so there he was miss clack with his creditors content to wait and with the certain prospect before him of marrying an heiress by all means consider him a scoundrel but tell me if you please why he should steal the moonstone  the human heart is unsearchable i said gently who is to fathom it  in other words maamthough he hadnt the shadow of a reason for taking the diamondhe might have taken it nevertheless through natural depravity very well say he did why the devil  i beg your pardon mr bruff if i hear the devil referred to in that manner i must leave the room  i beg your pardon miss clackill be more careful in my choice of language for the future all i meant to ask was this whyeven supposing he did take the diamondshould franklin blake make himself the most prominent person in the house in trying to recover it you may tell me he cunningly did that to divert suspicion from himself i answer that he had no need to divert suspicionbecause nobody suspected him he first steals the moonstone without the slightest reason through natural depravity and he then acts a part in relation to the loss of the jewel which there is not the slightest necessity to act and which leads to his mortally offending the young lady who would otherwise have married him that is the monstrous proposition which you are driven to assert if you attempt to associate the disappearance of the moonstone with franklin blake no no miss clack after what has passed here today between us two the deadlock in this case is complete rachels own innocence is as her mother knows and as i know beyond a doubt mr ablewhites innocence is equally certainor rachel would never have testified to it and franklin blakes innocence as you have just seen unanswerably asserts itself on the one hand we are morally certain of all these things and on the other hand we are equally sure that somebody has brought the moonstone to london and that mr luker or his banker is in private possession of it at this moment what is the use of my experience what is the use of any persons experience in such a case as that it baffles me it baffles you it baffles everybody  nonot everybody it had not baffled sergeant cuff i was about to mention this with all possible mildness and with every necessary protest against being supposed to cast a slur upon rachelwhen the servant came in to say that the doctor had gone and that my aunt was waiting to receive us  this stopped the discussion mr bruff collected his papers looking a little exhausted by the demands which our conversation had made on him i took up my bagfull of precious publications feeling as if i could have gone on talking for hours we proceeded in silence to lady verinders room  permit me to add here before my narrative advances to other events that i have not described what passed between the lawyer and me without having a definite object in view i am ordered to include in my contribution to the shocking story of the moonstone a plain disclosure not only of the turn which suspicion took but even of the names of the persons on whom suspicion rested at the time when the indian diamond was believed to be in london a report of my conversation in the library with mr bruff appeared to me to be exactly what was wanted to answer this purposewhile at the same time it possessed the great moral advantage of rendering a sacrifice of sinful selfesteem essentially necessary on my part i have been obliged to acknowledge that my fallen nature got the better of me in making that humiliating confession i get the better of my fallen nature the moral balance is restored the spiritual atmosphere feels clear once more dear friends we may go on again    chapter iv   the signing of the will was a much shorter matter than i had anticipated it was hurried over to my thinking in indecent haste samuel the footman was sent for to act as second witnessand the pen was put at once into my aunts hand i felt strongly urged to say a few appropriate words on this solemn occasion but mr bruffs manner convinced me that it was wisest to check the impulse while he was in the room in less than two minutes it was all overand samuel unbenefited by what i might have said had gone downstairs again  mr bruff folded up the will and then looked my way apparently wondering whether i did or did not mean to leave him alone with my aunt i had my mission of mercy to fulfil and my bag of precious publications ready on my lap he might as well have expected to move st pauls cathedral by looking at it as to move me there was one merit about him due no doubt to his worldly training which i have no wish to deny he was quick at seeing things i appeared to produce almost the same impression on him which i had produced on the cabman he too uttered a profane expression and withdrew in a violent hurry and left me mistress of the field  as soon as we were alone my aunt reclined on the sofa and then alluded with some appearance of confusion to the subject of her will  i hope you wont think yourself neglected drusilla she said i mean to give you your little legacy my dear with my own hand  here was a golden opportunity i seized it on the spot in other words i instantly opened my bag and took out the top publication it proved to be an early editiononly the twentyfifthof the famous anonymous work believed to be by precious miss bellows entitled the serpent at home the design of the bookwith which the worldly reader may not be acquaintedis to show how the evil one lies in wait for us in all the most apparently innocent actions of our daily lives the chapters best adapted to female perusal are satan in the hair brush satan behind the looking glass satan under the tea table satan out of the windowand many others  give your attention dear aunt to this precious bookand you will give me all i ask with those words i handed it to her open at a marked passageone continuous burst of burning eloquence subject satan among the sofa cushions  poor lady verinder reclining thoughtlessly on her own sofa cushions glanced at the book and handed it back to me looking more confused than ever  im afraid drusilla she said i must wait till i am a little better before i can read that the doctor  the moment she mentioned the doctors name i knew what was coming over and over again in my past experience among my perishing fellowcreatures the members of the notoriously infidel profession of medicine had stepped between me and my mission of mercyon the miserable pretence that the patient wanted quiet and that the disturbing influence of all others which they most dreaded was the influence of miss clack and her books precisely the same blinded materialism working treacherously behind my back now sought to rob me of the only right of property that my poverty could claimmy right of spiritual property in my perishing aunt  the doctor tells me my poor misguided relative went on that i am not so well today he forbids me to see any strangers and he orders me if i read at all only to read the lightest and the most amusing books do nothing lady verinder to weary your head or to quicken your pulsethose were his last words drusilla when he left me today  there was no help for it but to yield againfor the moment only as before any open assertion of the infinitely superior importance of such a ministry as mine compared with the ministry of the medical man would only have provoked the doctor to practise on the human weakness of his patient and to threaten to throw up the case happily there are more ways than one of sowing the good seed and few persons are better versed in those ways than myself  you might feel stronger dear in an hour or two i said or you might wake tomorrow morning with a sense of something wanting and even this unpretending volume might be able to supply it you will let me leave the book aunt the doctor can hardly object to that  i slipped it under the sofa cushions half in and half out close by her handkerchief and her smellingbottle every time her hand searched for either of these it would touch the book and sooner or later who knows the book might touch her after making this arrangement i thought it wise to withdraw let me leave you to repose dear aunt i will call again tomorrow i looked accidentally towards the window as i said that it was full of flowers in boxes and pots lady verinder was extravagantly fond of these perishable treasures and had a habit of rising every now and then and going to look at them and smell them a new idea flashed across my mind oh may i take a flower i saidand got to the window unsuspected in that way instead of taking away a flower i added one in the shape of another book from my bag which i left to surprise my aunt among the geraniums and roses the happy thought followed why not do the same for her poor dear in every other room that she enters i immediately said goodbye and crossing the hall slipped into the library samuel coming up to let me out and supposing i had gone went downstairs again on the library table i noticed two of the amusing books which the infidel doctor had recommended i instantly covered them from sight with two of my own precious publications in the breakfastroom i found my aunts favourite canary singing in his cage she was always in the habit of feeding the bird herself some groundsel was strewed on a table which stood immediately under the cage i put a book among the groundsel in the drawingroom i found more cheering opportunities of emptying my bag my aunts favourite musical pieces were on the piano i slipped in two more books among the music i disposed of another in the back drawingroom under some unfinished embroidery which i knew to be of lady verinders working a third little room opened out of the back drawingroom from which it was shut off by curtains instead of a door my aunts plain oldfashioned fan was on the chimneypiece i opened my ninth book at a very special passage and put the fan in as a marker to keep the place the question then came whether i should go higher still and try the bedroom floorat the risk undoubtedly of being insulted if the person with the capribbons happened to be in the upper regions of the house and to find me out but oh what of that it is a poor christian that is afraid of being insulted i went upstairs prepared to bear anything all was silent and solitaryit was the servants teatime i suppose my aunts room was in front the miniature of my late dear uncle sir john hung on the wall opposite the bed it seemed to smile at me it seemed to say drusilla deposit a book there were tables on either side of my aunts bed she was a bad sleeper and wanted or thought she wanted many things at night i put a book near the matches on one side and a book under the box of chocolate drops on the other whether she wanted a light or whether she wanted a drop there was a precious publication to meet her eye or to meet her hand and to say with silent eloquence in either case come try me try me but one book was now left at the bottom of my bag and but one apartment was still unexploredthe bathroom which opened out of the bedroom i peeped in and the holy inner voice that never deceives whispered to me you have met her drusilla everywhere else meet her at the bath and the work is done i observed a dressinggown thrown across a chair it had a pocket in it and in that pocket i put my last book can words express my exquisite sense of duty done when i had slipped out of the house unsuspected by any of them and when i found myself in the street with my empty bag under my arm oh my worldly friends pursuing the phantom pleasure through the guilty mazes of dissipation how easy it is to be happy if you will only be good  when i folded up my things that nightwhen i reflected on the true riches which i had scattered with such a lavish hand from top to bottom of the house of my wealthy aunti declare i felt as free from all anxiety as if i had been a child again i was so lighthearted that i sang a verse of the evening hymn i was so lighthearted that i fell asleep before i could sing another quite like a child again quite like a child again  so i passed that blissful night on rising the next morning how young i felt i might add how young i looked if i were capable of dwelling on the concerns of my own perishable body but i am not capableand i add nothing  towards luncheon timenot for the sake of the creaturecomforts but for the certainty of finding dear aunti put on my bonnet to go to montagu square just as i was ready the maid at the lodgings in which i then lived looked in at the door and said lady verinders servant to see miss clack  i occupied the parlourfloor at that period of my residence in london the front parlour was my sittingroom very small very low in the ceiling very poorly furnishedbut oh so neat i looked into the passage to see which of lady verinders servants had asked for me it was the young footman samuela civil freshcoloured person with a teachable look and a very obliging manner i had always felt a spiritual interest in samuel and a wish to try him with a few serious words on this occasion i invited him into my sittingroom  he came in with a large parcel under his arm when he put the parcel down it appeared to frighten him my ladys love miss and i was to say that you would find a letter inside having given that message the freshcoloured young footman surprised me by looking as if he would have liked to run away  i detained him to make a few kind inquiries could i see my aunt if i called in montagu square no she had gone out for a drive miss rachel had gone with her and mr ablewhite had taken a seat in the carriage too knowing how sadly dear mr godfreys charitable work was in arrear i thought it odd that he should be going out driving like an idle man i stopped samuel at the door and made a few more kind inquiries miss rachel was going to a ball that night and mr ablewhite had arranged to come to coffee and go with her there was a morning concert advertised for tomorrow and samuel was ordered to take places for a large party including a place for mr ablewhite all the tickets may be gone miss said this innocent youth if i dont run and get them at once he ran as he said the wordsand i found myself alone again with some anxious thoughts to occupy me  we had a special meeting of the motherssmallclothesconversion society that night summoned expressly with a view to obtaining mr godfreys advice and assistance instead of sustaining our sisterhood under an overwhelming flow of trousers which quite prostrated our little community he had arranged to take coffee in montagu square and to goto a ball afterwards the afternoon of the next day had been selected for the festival of the britishladiesservantssundaysweetheartsupervision society instead of being present the life and soul of that struggling institution he had engaged to make one of a party of worldlings at a morning concert i asked myself what did it mean alas it meant that our christian hero was to reveal himself to me in a new character and to become associated in my mind with one of the most awful backslidings of modern times  to return however to the history of the passing day on finding myself alone in my room i naturally turned my attention to the parcel which appeared to have so strangely intimidated the freshcoloured young footman had my aunt sent me my promised legacy and had it taken the form of castoff clothes or wornout silver spoons or unfashionable jewellery or anything of that sort prepared to accept all and to resent nothing i opened the parceland what met my view the twelve precious publications which i had scattered through the house on the previous day all returned to me by the doctors orders well might the youthful samuel shrink when he brought his parcel into my room well might he run when he had performed his miserable errand as to my aunts letter it simply amounted poor soul to thisthat she dare not disobey her medical man  what was to be done now with my training and my principles i never had a moments doubt  once selfsupported by conscience once embarked on a career of manifest usefulness the true christian never yields neither public nor private influences produce the slightest effect on us when we have once got our mission taxation may be the consequence of a mission riots may be the consequence of a mission wars may be the consequence of a mission we go on with our work irrespective of every human consideration which moves the world outside us we are above reason we are beyond ridicule we see with nobodys eyes we hear with nobodys ears we feel with nobodys hearts but our own glorious glorious privilege and how is it earned ah my friends you may spare yourselves the useless inquiry we are the only people who can earn itfor we are the only people who are always right  in the case of my misguided aunt the form which pious perseverance was next to take revealed itself to me plainly enough  preparation by clerical friends had failed owing to lady verinders own reluctance preparation by books had failed owing to the doctors infidel obstinacy so be it what was the next thing to try the next thing to try waspreparation by little notes in other words the books themselves having been sent back select extracts from the books copied by different hands and all addressed as letters to my aunt were some to be sent by post and some to be distributed about the house on the plan i had adopted on the previous day as letters they would excite no suspicion as letters they would be openedand once opened might be read some of them i wrote myself dear aunt may i ask your attention to a few lines c dear aunt i was reading last night and i chanced on the following passage c other letters were written for me by my valued fellowworkers the sisterhood at the motherssmallclothes dear madam pardon the interest taken in you by a true though humble friend dear madam may a serious person surprise you by saying a few cheering words using these and other similar forms of courteous appeal we reintroduced all my precious passages under a form which not even the doctors watchful materialism could suspect before the shades of evening had closed around us i had a dozen awakening letters for my aunt instead of a dozen awakening books six i made immediate arrangements for sending through the post and six i kept in my pocket for personal distribution in the house the next day  soon after two oclock i was again on the field of pious conflict addressing more kind inquiries to samuel at lady verinders door  my aunt had had a bad night she was again in the room in which i had witnessed her will resting on the sofa and trying to get a little sleep  i said i would wait in the library on the chance of seeing her in the fervour of my zeal to distribute the letters it never occurred to me to inquire about rachel the house was quiet and it was past the hour at which the musical performance began i took it for granted that she and her party of pleasureseekers mr godfrey alas included were all at the concert and eagerly devoted myself to my good work while time and opportunity were still at my own disposal  my aunts correspondence of the morningincluding the six awakening letters which i had posted overnightwas lying unopened on the library table she had evidently not felt herself equal to dealing with a large mass of lettersand she might be daunted by the number of them if she entered the library later in the day i put one of my second set of six letters on the chimneypiece by itself leaving it to attract her curiosity by means of its solitary position apart from the rest a second letter i put purposely on the floor in the breakfastroom the first servant who went in after me would conclude that my aunt had dropped it and would be specially careful to restore it to her the field thus sown on the basement story i ran lightly upstairs to scatter my mercies next over the drawingroom floor  just as i entered the front room i heard a double knock at the streetdoora soft fluttering considerate little knock before i could think of slipping back to the library in which i was supposed to be waiting the active young footman was in the hall answering the door it mattered little as i thought in my aunts state of health visitors in general were not admitted to my horror and amazement the performer of the soft little knock proved to be an exception to general rules samuels voice below me after apparently answering some questions which i did not hear said unmistakably upstairs if you please sir the next moment i heard footstepsa mans footstepsapproaching the drawingroom floor who could this favoured male visitor possibly be almost as soon as i asked myself the question the answer occurred to me who could it be but the doctor  in the case of any other visitor i should have allowed myself to be discovered in the drawingroom there would have been nothing out of the common in my having got tired of the library and having gone upstairs for a change but my own selfrespect stood in the way of my meeting the person who had insulted me by sending me back my books i slipped into the little third room which i have mentioned as communicating with the back drawingroom and dropped the curtains which closed the open doorway if i only waited there for a minute or two the usual result in such cases would take place that is to say the doctor would be conducted to his patients room  i waited a minute or two and more than a minute or two i heard the visitor walking restlessly backwards and forwards i also heard him talking to himself i even thought i recognised the voice had i made a mistake was it not the doctor but somebody else mr bruff for instance no an unerring instinct told me it was not mr bruff whoever he was he was still talking to himself i parted the heavy curtains the least little morsel in the world and listened  the words i heard were ill do it today and the voice that spoke them was mr godfrey ablewhites    chapter v   my hand dropped from the curtain but dont supposeoh dont supposethat the dreadful embarrassment of my situation was the uppermost idea in my mind so fervent still was the sisterly interest i felt in mr godfrey that i never stopped to ask myself why he was not at the concert no i thought only of the wordsthe startling wordswhich had just fallen from his lips he would do it today he had said in a tone of terrible resolution he would do it today what oh what would he do something even more deplorably unworthy of him than what he had done already would he apostatise from the faith would he abandon us at the motherssmallclothes had we seen the last of his angelic smile in the committeeroom had we heard the last of his unrivalled eloquence at exeter hall i was so wrought up by the bare idea of such awful eventualities as these in connection with such a man that i believe i should have rushed from my place of concealment and implored him in the name of all the ladies committees in london to explain himselfwhen i suddenly heard another voice in the room it penetrated through the curtains it was loud it was bold it was wanting in every female charm the voice of rachel verinder  why have you come up here godfrey she asked why didnt you go into the library  he laughed softly and answered miss clack is in the library  clack in the library she instantly seated herself on the ottoman in the back drawingroom you are quite right godfrey we had much better stop here  i had been in a burning fever a moment since and in some doubt what to do next i became extremely cold now and felt no doubt whatever to show myself after what i had heard was impossible to retreatexcept into the fireplacewas equally out of the question a martyrdom was before me in justice to myself i noiselessly arranged the curtains so that i could both see and hear and then i met my martyrdom with the spirit of a primitive christian  dont sit on the ottoman the young lady proceeded bring a chair godfrey i like people to be opposite to me when i talk to them  he took the nearest seat it was a low chair he was very tall and many sizes too large for it i never saw his legs to such disadvantage before  well she went on what did you say to them  just what you said dear rachel to me  that mamma was not at all well today and that i didnt quite like leaving her to go to the concert  those were the words they were grieved to lose you at the concert but they quite understood all sent their love and all expressed a cheering belief that lady verinders indisposition would soon pass away  you dont think its serious do you godfrey  far from it in a few days i feel quite sure all will be well again  i think so too i was a little frightened at first but i think so too it was very kind to go and make my excuses for me to people who are almost strangers to you but why not have gone with them to the concert it seems very hard that you should miss the music too  dont say that rachel if you only knew how much happier i amhere with you  he clasped his hands and looked at her in the position which he occupied when he did that he turned my way can words describe how i sickened when i noticed exactly the same pathetic expression on his face which had charmed me when he was pleading for destitute millions of his fellowcreatures on the platform at exeter hall  its hard to get over ones bad habits godfrey but do try to get over the habit of paying complimentsdo to please me  i never paid you a compliment rachel in my life successful love may sometimes use the language of flattery i admit but hopeless love dearest always speaks the truth  he drew his chair close and took her hand when he said hopeless love there was a momentary silence he who thrilled everybody had doubtless thrilled her i thought i now understood the words which had dropped from him when he was alone in the drawingroom ill do it today alas the most rigid propriety could hardly have failed to discover that he was doing it now  have you forgotten what we agreed on godfrey when you spoke to me in the country we agreed that we were to be cousins and nothing more  i break the agreement rachel every time i see you  then dont see me  quite useless i break the agreement every time i think of you oh rachel how kindly you told me only the other day that my place in your estimation was a higher place than it had ever been yet am i mad to build the hopes i do on those dear words am i mad to dream of some future day when your heart may soften to me dont tell me so if i am leave me my delusion dearest i must have that to cherish and to comfort me if i have nothing else  his voice trembled and he put his white handkerchief to his eyes exeter hall again nothing wanting to complete the parallel but the audience the cheers and the glass of water  even her obdurate nature was touched i saw her lean a little nearer to him i heard a new tone of interest in her next words  are you really sure godfrey that you are so fond of me as that  sure you know what i was rachel let me tell you what i am i have lost every interest in life but my interest in you a transformation has come over me which i cant account for myself would you believe it my charitable business is an unendurable nuisance to me and when i see a ladies committee now i wish myself at the uttermost ends of the earth  if the annals of apostasy offer anything comparable to such a declaration as that i can only say that the case in point is not producible from the stores of my reading i thought of the motherssmallclothes i thought of the sundaysweetheartsupervision i thought of the other societies too numerous to mention all built up on this man as on a tower of strength i thought of the struggling female boards who so to speak drew the breath of their businesslife through the nostrils of mr godfreyof that same mr godfrey who had just reviled our good work as a nuisanceand just declared that he wished he was at the uttermost ends of the earth when he found himself in our company my young female friends will feel encouraged to persevere when i mention that it tried even my discipline before i could devour my own righteous indignation in silence at the same time it is only justice to myself to add that i didnt lose a syllable of the conversation rachel was the next to speak  you have made your confession she said i wonder whether it would cure you of your unhappy attachment to me if i made mine  he started i confess i started too he thought and i thought that she was about to divulge the mystery of the moonstone  would you think to look at me she went on that i am the wretchedest girl living its true godfrey what greater wretchedness can there be than to live degraded in your own estimation that is my life now  my dear rachel its impossible you can have any reason to speak of yourself in that way  how do you know i have no reason  can you ask me the question i know it because i know you your silence dearest has never lowered you in the estimation of your true friends the disappearance of your precious birthday gift may seem strange your unexplained connection with that event may seem stranger still  are you speaking of the moonstone godfrey  i certainly thought that you referred  i referred to nothing of the sort i can hear of the loss of the moonstone let who will speak of it without feeling degraded in my own estimation if the story of the diamond ever comes to light it will be known that i accepted a dreadful responsibility it will be known that i involved myself in the keeping of a miserable secretbut it will be as clear as the sun at noonday that i did nothing mean you have misunderstood me godfrey its my fault for not speaking more plainly cost me what it may i will be plainer now suppose you were not in love with me suppose you were in love with some other woman  yes  suppose you discovered that woman to be utterly unworthy of you suppose you were quite convinced that it was a disgrace to you to waste another thought on her suppose the bare idea of ever marrying such a person made your face burn only with thinking of it  yes  and suppose in spite of all thatyou couldnt tear her from your heart suppose the feeling she had roused in you in the time when you believed in her was not a feeling to be hidden suppose the love this wretch had inspired in you oh how can i find words to say it in how can i make a man understand that a feeling which horrifies me at myself can be a feeling that fascinates me at the same time its the breath of my life godfrey and its the poison that kills meboth in one go away i must be out of my mind to talk as i am talking now no you mustnt leave meyou mustnt carry away a wrong impression i must say what is to be said in my own defence mind this he doesnt knowhe never will know what i have told you i will never see himi dont care what happensi will never never never see him again dont ask me his name dont ask me any more lets change the subject are you doctor enough godfrey to tell me why i feel as if i was stifling for want of breath is there a form of hysterics that bursts into words instead of tears i dare say what does it matter you will get over any trouble i have caused you easily enough now i have dropped to my right place in your estimation havent i dont notice me dont pity me for gods sake go away  she turned round on a sudden and beat her hands wildly on the back of the ottoman her head dropped on the cushions and she burst out crying before i had time to feel shocked at this i was horrorstruck by an entirely unexpected proceeding on the part of mr godfrey will it be credited that he fell on his knees at her feeton both knees i solemnly declare may modesty mention that he put his arms round her next and may reluctant admiration acknowledge that he electrified her with two words  noble creature  no more than that but he did it with one of the bursts which have made his fame as a public speaker she sat either quite thunderstruck or quite fascinatedi dont know whichwithout even making an effort to put his arms back where his arms ought to have been as for me my sense of propriety was completely bewildered i was so painfully uncertain whether it was my first duty to close my eyes or to stop my ears that i did neither i attribute my being still able to hold the curtain in the right position for looking and listening entirely to suppressed hysterics in suppressed hysterics it is admitted even by the doctors that one must hold something  yes he said with all the fascination of his evangelical voice and manner you are a noble creature a woman who can speak the truth for the truths own sakea woman who will sacrifice her pride rather than sacrifice an honest man who loves heris the most priceless of all treasures when such a woman marries if her husband only wins her esteem and regard he wins enough to ennoble his whole life you have spoken dearest of your place in my estimation judge what that place iswhen i implore you on my knees to let the cure of your poor wounded heart be my care rachel will you honour me will you bless me by being my wife  by this time i should certainly have decided on stopping my ears if rachel had not encouraged me to keep them open by answering him in the first sensible words i had ever heard fall from her lips  godfrey she said you must be mad  i never spoke more reasonably dearestin your interests as well as in mine look for a moment to the future is your happiness to be sacrificed to a man who has never known how you feel towards him and whom you are resolved never to see again is it not your duty to yourself to forget this illfated attachment and is forgetfulness to be found in the life you are leading now you have tried that life and you are wearying of it already surround yourself with nobler interests than the wretched interests of the world a heart that loves and honours you a home whose peaceful claims and happy duties win gently on you day by daytry the consolation rachel which is to be found there i dont ask for your lovei will be content with your affection and regard let the rest be left confidently left to your husbands devotion and to time that heals even wounds as deep as yours  she began to yield already oh what a bringingup she must have had oh how differently i should have acted in her place  dont tempt me godfrey she said i am wretched enough and reckless enough as it is dont tempt me to be more wretched and more wreckless still  one question rachel have you any personal objection to me  i i always liked you after what you have just said to me i should be insensible indeed if i didnt respect and admire you as well  do you know many wives my dear rachel who respect and admire their husbands and yet they and their husbands get on very well how many brides go to the altar with hearts that would bear inspection by the men who take them there and yet it doesnt end unhappilysomehow or other the nuptial establishment jogs on the truth is that women try marriage as a refuge far more numerously than they are willing to admit and what is more they find that marriage has justified their confidence in it look at your own case once again at your age and with your attractions is it possible for you to sentence yourself to a single life trust my knowledge of the worldnothing is less possible it is merely a question of time you may marry some other man some years hence or you may marry the man dearest who is now at your feet and who prizes your respect and admiration above the love of any other woman on the face of the earth  gently godfrey you are putting something into my head which i never thought of before you are tempting me with a new prospect when all my other prospects are closed before me i tell you again i am miserable enough and desperate enough if you say another word to marry you on your own terms take the warning and go  i wont even rise from my knees till you have said yes  if i say yes you will repent and i shall repent when it is too late  we shall both bless the day darling when i pressed and when you yielded  do you feel as confidently as you speak  you shall judge for yourself i speak from what i have seen in my own family tell me what you think of our household at frizinghall do my father and mother live unhappily together  far from itso far as i can see  when my mother was a girl rachel it is no secret in the family she had loved as you loveshe had given her heart to a man who was unworthy of her she married my father respecting him admiring him but nothing more your own eyes have seen the result is there no encouragement in it for you and for me         see betteredges narrative chapter viii  you wont hurry me godfrey  my time shall be yours  you wont ask me for more than i can give  my angel i only ask you to give me yourself  take me  in those two words she accepted him  he had another bursta burst of unholy rapture this time he drew her nearer and nearer to him till her face touched his and thenno i really cannot prevail upon myself to carry this shocking disclosure any farther let me only say that i tried to close my eyes before it happened and that i was just one moment too late i had calculated you see on her resisting she submitted to every rightfeeling person of my own sex volumes could say no more  even my innocence in such matters began to see its way to the end of the interview now they understood each other so thoroughly by this time that i fully expected to see them walk off together arm in arm to be married there appeared however judging by mr godfreys next words to be one more trifling formality which it was necessary to observe he seated himselfunforbidden this timeon the ottoman by her side shall i speak to your dear mother he asked or will you  she declined both alternatives  let my mother hear nothing from either of us until she is better i wish it to be kept a secret for the present godfrey go now and come back this evening we have been here alone together quite long enough  she rose and in rising looked for the first time towards the little room in which my martyrdom was going on  who has drawn those curtains she exclaimed  the room is close enough as it is without keeping the air out of it in that way  she advanced to the curtains at the moment when she laid her hand on themat the moment when the discovery of me appeared to be quite inevitablethe voice of the freshcoloured young footman on the stairs suddenly suspended any further proceedings on her side or on mine it was unmistakably the voice of a man in great alarm  miss rachel he called out where are you miss rachel  she sprang back from the curtains and ran to the door  the footman came just inside the room his ruddy colour was all gone he said please to come downstairs miss my lady has fainted and we cant bring her to again  in a moment more i was alone and free to go downstairs in my turn quite unobserved  mr godfrey passed me in the hall hurrying out to fetch the doctor go in and help them he said pointing to the room i found rachel on her knees by the sofa with her mothers head on her bosom one look at my aunts face knowing what i knew was enough to warn me of the dreadful truth i kept my thoughts to myself till the doctor came in it was not long before he arrived he began by sending rachel out of the roomand then he told the rest of us that lady verinder was no more serious persons in search of proofs of hardened scepticism may be interested in hearing that he showed no signs of remorse when he looked at me  at a later hour i peeped into the breakfastroom and the library my aunt had died without opening one of the letters which i had addressed to her i was so shocked at this that it never occurred to me until some days afterwards that she had also died without giving me my little legacy    chapter vi   1 miss clack presents her compliments to mr franklin blake and in sending him the fifth chapter of her humble narrative begs to say that she feels quite unequal to enlarge as she could wish on an event so awful under the circumstances as lady verinders death she has therefore attached to her own manuscripts copious extracts from precious publications in her possession all bearing on this terrible subject and may those extracts miss clack fervently hopes sound as the blast of a trumpet in the ears of her respected kinsman mr franklin blake  2 mr franklin blake presents his compliments to miss clack and begs to thank her for the fifth chapter of her narrative in returning the extracts sent with it he will refrain from mentioning any personal objection which he may entertain to this species of literature and will merely say that the proposed additions to the manuscript are not necessary to the fulfilment of the purpose that he has in view  3 miss clack begs to acknowledge the return of her extracts she affectionately reminds mr franklin blake that she is a christian and that it is therefore quite impossible for him to offend her miss c persists in feeling the deepest interest in mr blake and pledges herself on the first occasion when sickness may lay him low to offer him the use of her extracts for the second time in the meanwhile she would be glad to know before beginning the final chapters of her narrative whether she may be permitted to make her humble contribution complete by availing herself of the light which later discoveries have thrown on the mystery of the moonstone  4 mr franklin blake is sorry to disappoint miss clack he can only repeat the instructions which he had the honour of giving her when she began her narrative she is requested to limit herself to her own individual experience of persons and events as recorded in her diary later discoveries she will be good enough to leave to the pens of those persons who can write in the capacity of actual witnesses  5 miss clack is extremely sorry to trouble mr franklin blake with another letter her extracts have been returned and the expression of her matured views on the subject of the moonstone has been forbidden miss clack is painfully conscious that she ought in the worldly phrase to feel herself put down but nomiss c has learnt perseverance in the school of adversity her object in writing is to know whether mr blake who prohibits everything else prohibits the appearance of the present correspondence in miss clacks narrative some explanation of the position in which mr blakes interference has placed her as an authoress seems due on the ground of common justice and miss clack on her side is most anxious that her letters should be produced to speak for themselves  6 mr franklin blake agrees to miss clacks proposal on the understanding that she will kindly consider this intimation of his consent as closing the correspondence between them  7 miss clack feels it an act of christian duty before the correspondence closes to inform mr franklin blake that his last letterevidently intended to offend herhas not succeeded in accomplishing the object of the writer she affectionately requests mr blake to retire to the privacy of his own room and to consider with himself whether the training which can thus elevate a poor weak woman above the reach of insult be not worthy of greater admiration than he is now disposed to feel for it on being favoured with an intimation to that effect miss c solemnly pledges herself to send back the complete series of her extracts to mr franklin blake  to this letter no answer was received comment is needless  signed drusilla clack    chapter vii   the foregoing correspondence will sufficiently explain why no choice is left to me but to pass over lady verinders death with the simple announcement of the fact which ends my fifth chapter  keeping myself for the future strictly within the limits of my own personal experience i have next to relate that a month elapsed from the time of my aunts decease before rachel verinder and i met again that meeting was the occasion of my spending a few days under the same roof with her in the course of my visit something happened relative to her marriageengagement with mr godfrey ablewhite which is important enough to require special notice in these pages when this last of many painful family circumstances has been disclosed my task will be completed for i shall then have told all that i know as an actual and most unwilling witness of events  my aunts remains were removed from london and were buried in the little cemetery attached to the church in her own park i was invited to the funeral with the rest of the family but it was impossible with my religious views to rouse myself in a few days only from the shock which this death had caused me i was informed moreover that the rector of frizinghall was to read the service having myself in past times seen this clerical castaway making one of the players at lady verinders whisttable i doubt even if i had been fit to travel whether i should have felt justified in attending the ceremony  lady verinders death left her daughter under the care of her brotherinlaw mr ablewhite the elder he was appointed guardian by the will until his niece married or came of age under these circumstances mr godfrey informed his father i suppose of the new relation in which he stood towards rachel at any rate in ten days from my aunts death the secret of the marriageengagement was no secret at all within the circle of the family and the grand question for mr ablewhite senioranother confirmed castawaywas how to make himself and his authority most agreeable to the wealthy young lady who was going to marry his son  rachel gave him some trouble at the outset about the choice of a place in which she could be prevailed upon to reside the house in montagu square was associated with the calamity of her mothers death the house in yorkshire was associated with the scandalous affair of the lost moonstone her guardians own residence at frizinghall was open to neither of these objections but rachels presence in it after her recent bereavement operated as a check on the gaieties of her cousins the miss ablewhitesand she herself requested that her visit might be deferred to a more favourable opportunity it ended in a proposal emanating from old mr ablewhite to try a furnished house at brighton his wife an invalid daughter and rachel were to inhabit it together and were to expect him to join them later in the season they would see no society but a few old friends and they would have his son godfrey travelling backwards and forwards by the london train always at their disposal  i describe this aimless flitting about from one place of residence to anotherthis insatiate restlessness of body and appalling stagnation of soulmerely with the view to arriving at results the event which under providence proved to be the means of bringing rachel verinder and myself together again was no other than the hiring of the house at brighton  my aunt ablewhite is a large silent faircomplexioned woman with one noteworthy point in her character from the hour of her birth she has never been known to do anything for herself she has gone through life accepting everybodys help and adopting everybodys opinions a more hopeless person in a spiritual point of view i have never met withthere is absolutely in this perplexing case no obstructive material to work upon aunt ablewhite would listen to the grand lama of thibet exactly as she listens to me and would reflect his views quite as readily as she reflects mine she found the furnished house at brighton by stopping at an hotel in london composing herself on a sofa and sending for her son she discovered the necessary servants by breakfasting in bed one morning still at the hotel and giving her maid a holiday on condition that the girl would begin enjoying herself by fetching miss clack i found her placidly fanning herself in her dressinggown at eleven oclock drusilla dear i want some servants you are so cleverplease get them for me i looked round the untidy room the churchbells were going for a weekday service they suggested a word of affectionate remonstrance on my part oh aunt i said sadly is this worthy of a christian englishwoman is the passage from time to eternity to be made in this manner my aunt answered ill put on my gown drusilla if you will be kind enough to help me what was to be said after that i have done wonders with murderessesi have never advanced an inch with aunt ablewhite where is the list i asked of the servants whom you require my aunt shook her head she hadnt even energy enough to keep the list rachel has got it dear she said in the next room i went into the next room and so saw rachel again for the first time since we had parted in montagu square  she looked pitiably small and thin in her deep mourning if i attached any serious importance to such a perishable trifle as personal appearance i might be inclined to add that hers was one of those unfortunate complexions which always suffer when not relieved by a border of white next the skin but what are our complexions and our looks hindrances and pitfalls dear girls which beset us on our way to higher things greatly to my surprise rachel rose when i entered the room and came forward to meet me with outstretched hand  i am glad to see you she said drusilla i have been in the habit of speaking very foolishly and very rudely to you on former occasions i beg your pardon i hope you will forgive me  my face i suppose betrayed the astonishment i felt at this she coloured up for a moment and then proceeded to explain herself  in my poor mothers lifetime she went on her friends were not always my friends too now i have lost her my heart turns for comfort to the people she liked she liked you try to be friends with me drusilla if you can  to any rightlyconstituted mind the motive thus acknowledged was simply shocking here in christian england was a young woman in a state of bereavement with so little idea of where to look for true comfort that she actually expected to find it among her mothers friends here was a relative of mine awakened to a sense of her shortcomings towards others under the influence not of conviction and duty but of sentiment and impulse most deplorable to think ofbut still suggestive of something hopeful to a person of my experience in plying the good work there could be no harm i thought in ascertaining the extent of the change which the loss of her mother had wrought in rachels character i decided as a useful test to probe her on the subject of her marriageengagement to mr godfrey ablewhite  having first met her advances with all possible cordiality i sat by her on the sofa at her own request we discussed family affairs and future plansalways excepting that one future plan which was to end in her marriage try as i might to turn the conversation that way she resolutely declined to take the hint any open reference to the question on my part would have been premature at this early stage of our reconciliation besides i had discovered all i wanted to know she was no longer the reckless defiant creature whom i had heard and seen on the occasion of my martyrdom in montagu square this was of itself enough to encourage me to take her future conversion in handbeginning with a few words of earnest warning directed against the hasty formation of the marriage tie and so getting on to higher things looking at her now with this new interestand calling to mind the headlong suddenness with which she had met mr godfreys matrimonial viewsi felt the solemn duty of interfering with a fervour which assured me that i should achieve no common results rapidity of proceeding was as i believed of importance in this case i went back at once to the question of the servants wanted for the furnished house  where is the list dear  rachel produced it  cook kitchenmaid housemaid and footman i read my dear rachel these servants are only wanted for a termthe term during which your guardian has taken the house we shall have great difficulty in finding persons of character and capacity to accept a temporary engagement of that sort if we try in london has the house in brighton been found yet  yes godfrey has taken it and persons in the house wanted him to hire them as servants he thought they would hardly do for us and came back having settled nothing  and you have no experience yourself in these matters rachel  none whatever  and aunt ablewhite wont exert herself  no poor dear dont blame her drusilla i think she is the only really happy woman i have ever met with  there are degrees in happiness darling we must have a little talk some day on that subject in the meantime i will undertake to meet the difficulty about the servants your aunt will write a letter to the people of the house  she will sign a letter if i write it for her which comes to the same thing  quite the same thing i shall get the letter and i will go to brighton tomorrow  how extremely kind of you we will join you as soon as you are ready for us and you will stay i hope as my guest brighton is so lively you are sure to enjoy it  in those words the invitation was given and the glorious prospect of interference was opened before me  it was then the middle of the week by saturday afternoon the house was ready for them in that short interval i had sifted not the characters only but the religious views as well of all the disengaged servants who applied to me and had succeeded in making a selection which my conscience approved i also discovered and called on two serious friends of mine residents in the town to whom i knew i could confide the pious object which had brought me to brighton one of thema clerical friendkindly helped me to take sittings for our little party in the church in which he himself ministered the othera single lady like myselfplaced the resources of her library composed throughout of precious publications entirely at my disposal i borrowed halfadozen works all carefully chosen with a view to rachel when these had been judiciously distributed in the various rooms she would be likely to occupy i considered that my preparations were complete sound doctrine in the servants who waited on her sound doctrine in the minister who preached to her sound doctrine in the books that lay on her tablesuch was the treble welcome which my zeal had prepared for the motherless girl a heavenly composure filled my mind on that saturday afternoon as i sat at the window waiting the arrival of my relatives the giddy throng passed and repassed before my eyes alas how many of them felt my exquisite sense of duty done an awful question let us not pursue it  between six and seven the travellers arrived to my indescribable surprise they were escorted not by mr godfrey as i had anticipated but by the lawyer mr bruff  how do you do miss clack he said i mean to stay this time  that reference to the occasion on which i had obliged him to postpone his business to mine when we were both visiting in montagu square satisfied me that the old worldling had come to brighton with some object of his own in view i had prepared quite a little paradise for my beloved racheland here was the serpent already  godfrey was very much vexed drusilla not to be able to come with us said my aunt ablewhite there was something in the way which kept him in town mr bruff volunteered to take his place and make a holiday of it till monday morning bytheby mr bruff im ordered to take exercise and i dont like it that added aunt ablewhite pointing out of window to an invalid going by in a chair on wheels drawn by a man is my idea of exercise if its air you want you get it in your chair and if its fatigue you want i am sure its fatigue enough to look at the man  rachel stood silent at a window by herself with her eyes fixed on the sea  tired love i inquired  no only a little out of spirits she answered i have often seen the sea on our yorkshire coast with that light on it and i was thinking drusilla of the days that can never come again  mr bruff remained to dinner and stayed through the evening the more i saw of him the more certain i felt that he had some private end to serve in coming to brighton i watched him carefully he maintained the same appearance of ease and talked the same godless gossip hour after hour until it was time to take leave as he shook hands with rachel i caught his hard and cunning eyes resting on her for a moment with a peculiar interest and attention she was plainly concerned in the object that he had in view he said nothing out of the common to her or to anyone on leaving he invited himself to luncheon the next day and then he went away to his hotel  it was impossible the next morning to get my aunt ablewhite out of her dressinggown in time for church her invalid daughter suffering from nothing in my opinion but incurable laziness inherited from her mother announced that she meant to remain in bed for the day rachel and i went alone together to church a magnificent sermon was preached by my gifted friend on the heathen indifference of the world to the sinfulness of little sins for more than an hour his eloquence assisted by his glorious voice thundered through the sacred edifice i said to rachel when we came out has it found its way to your heart dear and she answered no it has only made my head ache this might have been discouraging to some people but once embarked on a career of manifest usefulness nothing discourages me  we found aunt ablewhite and mr bruff at luncheon when rachel declined eating anything and gave as a reason for it that she was suffering from a headache the lawyers cunning instantly saw and seized the chance that she had given him  there is only one remedy for a headache said this horrible old man a walk miss rachel is the thing to cure you i am entirely at your service if you will honour me by accepting my arm  with the greatest pleasure a walk is the very thing i was longing for  its past two i gently suggested and the afternoon service rachel begins at three  how can you expect me to go to church again she asked petulantly with such a headache as mine  mr bruff officiously opened the door for her in another minute more they were both out of the house i dont know when i have felt the solemn duty of interfering so strongly as i felt it at that moment but what was to be done nothing was to be done but to interfere at the first opportunity later in the day  on my return from the afternoon service i found that they had just got back one look at them told me that the lawyer had said what he wanted to say i had never before seen rachel so silent and so thoughtful i had never before seen mr bruff pay her such devoted attention and look at her with such marked respect he had or pretended that he had an engagement to dinner that dayand he took an early leave of us all intending to go back to london by the first train the next morning  are you sure of your own resolution he said to rachel at the door  quite sure she answeredand so they parted  the moment his back was turned rachel withdrew to her own room she never appeared at dinner her maid the person with the capribbons was sent downstairs to announce that her headache had returned i ran up to her and made all sorts of sisterly offers through the door it was locked and she kept it locked plenty of obstructive material to work on here i felt greatly cheered and stimulated by her locking the door  when her cup of tea went up to her the next morning i followed it in i sat by her bedside and said a few earnest words she listened with languid civility i noticed my serious friends precious publications huddled together on a table in a corner had she chanced to look into themi asked yesand they had not interested her would she allow me to read a few passages of the deepest interest which had probably escaped her eye no not nowshe had other things to think of she gave these answers with her attention apparently absorbed in folding and refolding the frilling on her nightgown it was plainly necessary to rouse her by some reference to those worldly interests which she still had at heart  do you know love i said i had an odd fancy yesterday about mr bruff i thought when i saw you after your walk with him that he had been telling you some bad news  her fingers dropped from the frilling of her nightgown and her fierce black eyes flashed at me  quite the contrary she said it was news i was interested in hearingand i am deeply indebted to mr bruff for telling me of it  yes i said in a tone of gentle interest  her fingers went back to the frilling and she turned her head sullenly away from me i had been met in this manner in the course of plying the good work hundreds of times she merely stimulated me to try again in my dauntless zeal for her welfare i ran the great risk and openly alluded to her marriage engagement  news you were interested in hearing i repeated i suppose my dear rachel that must be news of mr godfrey ablewhite  she started up in the bed and turned deadly pale it was evidently on the tip of her tongue to retort on me with the unbridled insolence of former times she checked herselflaid her head back on the pillowconsidered a minuteand then answered in these remarkable words  i shall never marry mr godfrey ablewhite  it was my turn to start at that  what can you possibly mean i exclaimed the marriage is considered by the whole family as a settled thing  mr godfrey ablewhite is expected here today she said doggedly wait till he comesand you will see  but my dear rachel  she rang the bell at the head of her bed the person with the capribbons appeared  penelope my bath  let me give her her due in the state of my feelings at that moment i do sincerely believe that she had hit on the only possible way of forcing me to leave the room  by the mere worldly mind my position towards rachel might have been viewed as presenting difficulties of no ordinary kind i had reckoned on leading her to higher things by means of a little earnest exhortation on the subject of her marriage and now if she was to be believed no such event as her marriage was to take place at all but ah my friends a working christian of my experience with an evangelising prospect before her takes broader views than these supposing rachel really broke off the marriage on which the ablewhites father and son counted as a settled thing what would be the result it could only end if she held firm in an exchanging of hard words and bitter accusations on both sides and what would be the effect on rachel when the stormy interview was over a salutary moral depression would be the effect her pride would be exhausted her stubbornness would be exhausted by the resolute resistance which it was in her character to make under the circumstances she would turn for sympathy to the nearest person who had sympathy to offer and i was that nearest personbrimful of comfort charged to overflowing with seasonable and reviving words never had the evangelising prospect looked brighter to my eyes than it looked now  she came down to breakfast but she ate nothing and hardly uttered a word  after breakfast she wandered listlessly from room to roomthen suddenly roused herself and opened the piano the music she selected to play was of the most scandalously profane sort associated with performances on the stage which it curdles ones blood to think of it would have been premature to interfere with her at such a time as this i privately ascertained the hour at which mr godfrey ablewhite was expected and then i escaped the music by leaving the house  being out alone i took the opportunity of calling upon my two resident friends it was an indescribable luxury to find myself indulging in earnest conversation with serious persons infinitely encouraged and refreshed i turned my steps back again to the house in excellent time to await the arrival of our expected visitor i entered the diningroom always empty at that hour of the day and found myself face to face with mr godfrey ablewhite  he made no attempt to fly the place quite the contrary he advanced to meet me with the utmost eagerness  dear miss clack i have been only waiting to see you chance set me free of my london engagements today sooner than i had expected and i have got here in consequence earlier than my appointed time  not the slightest embarrassment encumbered his explanation though this was his first meeting with me after the scene in montagu square he was not aware it is true of my having been a witness of that scene but he knew on the other hand that my attendances at the mothers smallclothes and my relations with friends attached to other charities must have informed me of his shameless neglect of his ladies and of his poor and yet there he was before me in full possession of his charming voice and his irresistible smile  have you seen rachel yet i asked  he sighed gently and took me by the hand i should certainly have snatched my hand away if the manner in which he gave his answer had not paralysed me with astonishment  i have seen rachel he said with perfect tranquillity you are aware dear friend that she was engaged to me well she has taken a sudden resolution to break the engagement reflection has convinced her that she will best consult her welfare and mine by retracting a rash promise and leaving me free to make some happier choice elsewhere that is the only reason she will give and the only answer she will make to every question that i can ask of her  what have you done on your side i inquired have you submitted  yes he said with the most unruffled composure i have submitted  his conduct under the circumstances was so utterly inconceivable that i stood bewildered with my hand in his it is a piece of rudeness to stare at anybody and it is an act of indelicacy to stare at a gentleman i committed both those improprieties and i said as if in a dream what does it mean  permit me to tell you he replied and suppose we sit down  he led me to a chair i have an indistinct remembrance that he was very affectionate i dont think he put his arm round my waist to support mebut i am not sure i was quite helpless and his ways with ladies were very endearing at any rate we sat down i can answer for that if i can answer for nothing more    chapter viii   i have lost a beautiful girl an excellent social position and a handsome income mr godfrey began and i have submitted to it without a struggle what can be the motive for such extraordinary conduct as that my precious friend there is no motive  no motive i repeated  let me appeal my dear miss clack to your experience of children he went on a child pursues a certain course of conduct you are greatly struck by it and you attempt to get at the motive the dear little thing is incapable of telling you its motive you might as well ask the grass why it grows or the birds why they sing well in this matter i am like the dear little thinglike the grasslike the birds i dont know why i made a proposal of marriage to miss verinder i dont know why i have shamefully neglected my dear ladies i dont know why i have apostatised from the mothers smallclothes you say to the child why have you been naughty and the little angel puts its finger into its mouth and doesnt know my case exactly miss clack i couldnt confess it to anybody else i feel impelled to confess it to you  i began to recover myself a mental problem was involved here i am deeply interested in mental problemsand i am not it is thought without some skill in solving them  best of friends exert your intellect and help me he proceeded tell mewhy does a time come when these matrimonial proceedings of mine begin to look like something done in a dream why does it suddenly occur to me that my true happiness is in helping my dear ladies in going my modest round of useful work in saying my few earnest words when called on by my chairman what do i want with a position i have got a position what do i want with an income i can pay for my bread and cheese and my nice little lodging and my two coats a year what do i want with miss verinder she has told me with her own lips this dear lady is between ourselves that she loves another man and that her only idea in marrying me is to try and put that other man out of her head what a horrid union is this oh dear me what a horrid union is this such are my reflections miss clack on my way to brighton i approach rachel with the feeling of a criminal who is going to receive his sentence when i find that she has changed her mind toowhen i hear her propose to break the engagementi experience there is no sort of doubt about it a most overpowering sense of relief a month ago i was pressing her rapturously to my bosom an hour ago the happiness of knowing that i shall never press her again intoxicates me like strong liquor the thing seems impossiblethe thing cant be and yet there are the facts as i had the honour of stating them when we first sat down together in these two chairs i have lost a beautiful girl an excellent social position and a handsome income and i have submitted to it without a struggle can you account for it dear friend its quite beyond me  his magnificent head sank on his breast and he gave up his own mental problem in despair  i was deeply touched the case if i may speak as a spiritual physician was now quite plain to me it is no uncommon event in the experience of us all to see the possessors of exalted ability occasionally humbled to the level of the most poorlygifted people about them the object no doubt in the wise economy of providence is to remind greatness that it is mortal and that the power which has conferred it can also take it away it was nowto my mindeasy to discern one of these salutary humiliations in the deplorable proceedings on dear mr godfreys part of which i had been the unseen witness and it was equally easy to recognise the welcome reappearance of his own finer nature in the horror with which he recoiled from the idea of a marriage with rachel and in the charming eagerness which he showed to return to his ladies and his poor  i put this view before him in a few simple and sisterly words his joy was beautiful to see he compared himself as i went on to a lost man emerging from the darkness into the light when i answered for a loving reception of him at the mothers smallclothes the grateful heart of our christian hero overflowed he pressed my hands alternately to his lips overwhelmed by the exquisite triumph of having got him back among us i let him do what he liked with my hands i closed my eyes i felt my head in an ecstasy of spiritual selfforgetfulness sinking on his shoulder in a moment more i should certainly have swooned away in his arms but for an interruption from the outer world which brought me to myself again a horrid rattling of knives and forks sounded outside the door and the footman came in to lay the table for luncheon  mr godfrey started up and looked at the clock on the mantelpiece  how time flies with you he exclaimed i shall barely catch the train  i ventured on asking why he was in such a hurry to get back to town his answer reminded me of family difficulties that were still to be reconciled and of family disagreements that were yet to come  i have heard from my father he said business obliges him to leave frizinghall for london today and he proposes coming on here either this evening or tomorrow i must tell him what has happened between rachel and me his heart is set on our marriagethere will be great difficulty i fear in reconciling him to the breakingoff of the engagement i must stop him for all our sakes from coming here till he is reconciled best and dearest of friends we shall meet again  with those words he hurried out in equal haste on my side i ran upstairs to compose myself in my own room before meeting aunt ablewhite and rachel at the luncheontable  i am well awareto dwell for a moment yet on the subject of mr godfreythat the allprofaning opinion of the world has charged him with having his own private reasons for releasing rachel from her engagement at the first opportunity she gave him it has also reached my ears that his anxiety to recover his place in my estimation has been attributed in certain quarters to a mercenary eagerness to make his peace through me with a venerable committeewoman at the mothers smallclothes abundantly blessed with the goods of this world and a beloved and intimate friend of my own i only notice these odious slanders for the sake of declaring that they never had a moments influence on my mind in obedience to my instructions i have exhibited the fluctuations in my opinion of our christian hero exactly as i find them recorded in my diary in justice to myself let me here add that once reinstated in his place in my estimation my gifted friend never lost that place again i write with the tears in my eyes burning to say more but noi am cruelly limited to my actual experience of persons and things in less than a month from the time of which i am now writing events in the moneymarket which diminished even my miserable little income forced me into foreign exile and left me with nothing but a loving remembrance of mr godfrey which the slander of the world has assailed and assailed in vain  let me dry my eyes and return to my narrative  i went downstairs to luncheon naturally anxious to see how rachel was affected by her release from her marriage engagement  it appeared to mebut i own i am a poor authority in such mattersthat the recovery of her freedom had set her thinking again of that other man whom she loved and that she was furious with herself for not being able to control a revulsion of feeling of which she was secretly ashamed who was the man i had my suspicionsbut it was needless to waste time in idle speculation when i had converted her she would as a matter of course have no concealments from me i should hear all about the man i should hear all about the moonstone if i had had no higher object in stirring her up to a sense of spiritual things the motive of relieving her mind of its guilty secrets would have been enough of itself to encourage me to go on  aunt ablewhite took her exercise in the afternoon in an invalid chair rachel accompanied her i wish i could drag the chair she broke out recklessly i wish i could fatigue myself till i was ready to drop  she was in the same humour in the evening i discovered in one of my friends precious publicationsthe life letters and labours of miss jane ann stamper fortyfourth editionpassages which bore with a marvellous appropriateness on rachels present position upon my proposing to read them she went to the piano conceive how little she must have known of serious people if she supposed that my patience was to be exhausted in that way i kept miss jane ann stamper by me and waited for events with the most unfaltering trust in the future  old mr ablewhite never made his appearance that night but i knew the importance which his worldly greed attached to his sons marriage with miss verinderand i felt a positive conviction do what mr godfrey might to prevent it that we should see him the next day with his interference in the matter the storm on which i had counted would certainly come and the salutary exhaustion of rachels resisting powers would as certainly follow i am not ignorant that old mr ablewhite has the reputation generally especially among his inferiors of being a remarkably goodnatured man according to my observation of him he deserves his reputation as long as he has his own way and not a moment longer  the next day exactly as i had foreseen aunt ablewhite was as near to being astonished as her nature would permit by the sudden appearance of her husband he had barely been a minute in the house before he was followed to my astonishment this time by an unexpected complication in the shape of mr bruff  i never remember feeling the presence of the lawyer to be more unwelcome than i felt it at that moment he looked ready for anything in the way of an obstructive proceedingcapable even of keeping the peace with rachel for one of the combatants  this is a pleasant surprise sir said mr ablewhite addressing himself with his deceptive cordiality to mr bruff when i left your office yesterday i didnt expect to have the honour of seeing you at brighton today  i turned over our conversation in my mind after you had gone replied mr bruff and it occurred to me that i might perhaps be of some use on this occasion i was just in time to catch the train and i had no opportunity of discovering the carriage in which you were travelling  having given that explanation he seated himself by rachel i retired modestly to a cornerwith miss jane ann stamper on my lap in case of emergency my aunt sat at the window placidly fanning herself as usual mr ablewhite stood up in the middle of the room with his bald head much pinker than i had ever seen it yet and addressed himself in the most affectionate manner to his niece  rachel my dear he said i have heard some very extraordinary news from godfrey and i am here to inquire about it you have a sittingroom of your own in this house will you honour me by showing me the way to it  rachel never moved whether she was determined to bring matters to a crisis or whether she was prompted by some private sign from mr bruff is more than i can tell she declined doing old mr ablewhite the honour of conducting him into her sittingroom  whatever you wish to say to me she answered can be said herein the presence of my relatives and in the presence she looked at mr bruff of my mothers trusted old friend  just as you please my dear said the amiable mr ablewhite he took a chair the rest of them looked at his faceas if they expected it after seventy years of worldly training to speak the truth i looked at the top of his bald head having noticed on other occasions that the temper which was really in him had a habit of registering itself there  some weeks ago pursued the old gentleman my son informed me that miss verinder had done him the honour to engage herself to marry him is it possible rachel that he can have misinterpretedor presumed uponwhat you really said to him  certainly not she replied i did engage myself to marry him  very frankly answered said mr ablewhite and most satisfactory my dear so far in respect to what happened some weeks since godfrey has made no mistake the error is evidently in what he told me yesterday i begin to see it now you and he have had a lovers quarreland my foolish son has interpreted it seriously ah i should have known better than that at his age  the fallen nature in rachelthe mother eve so to speakbegan to chafe at this  pray let us understand each other mr ablewhite she said nothing in the least like a quarrel took place yesterday between your son and me if he told you that i proposed breaking off our marriage engagement and that he agreed on his sidehe told you the truth  the selfregistering thermometer at the top of mr ablewhites bald head began to indicate a rise of temper his face was more amiable than everbut there was the pink at the top of his face a shade deeper already  come come my dear he said in his most soothing manner now dont be angry and dont be hard on poor godfrey he has evidently said some unfortunate thing he was always clumsy from a childbut he means well rachel he means well  mr ablewhite i have either expressed myself very badly or you are purposely mistaking me once for all it is a settled thing between your son and myself that we remain for the rest of our lives cousins and nothing more is that plain enough  the tone in which she said those words made it impossible even for old mr ablewhite to mistake her any longer his thermometer went up another degree and his voice when he next spoke ceased to be the voice which is appropriate to a notoriously goodnatured man  i am to understand then he said that your marriage engagement is broken off  you are to understand that mr ablewhite if you please  i am also to take it as a matter of fact that the proposal to withdraw from the engagement came in the first instance from you  it came in the first instance from me and it met as i have told you with your sons consent and approval  the thermometer went up to the top of the register i mean the pink changed suddenly to scarlet  my son is a meanspirited hound cried this furious old worldling in justice to myself as his fathernot in justice to himi beg to ask you miss verinder what complaint you have to make of mr godfrey ablewhite  here mr bruff interfered for the first time  you are not bound to answer that question he said to rachel  old mr ablewhite fastened on him instantly  dont forget sir he said that you are a selfinvited guest here your interference would have come with a better grace if you had waited until it was asked for  mr bruff took no notice the smooth varnish on his wicked old face never cracked rachel thanked him for the advice he had given to her and then turned to old mr ablewhitepreserving her composure in a manner which having regard to her age and her sex was simply awful to see  your son put the same question to me which you have just asked she said i had only one answer for him and i have only one answer for you i proposed that we should release each other because reflection had convinced me that i should best consult his welfare and mine by retracting a rash promise and leaving him free to make his choice elsewhere  what has my son done persisted mr ablewhite i have a right to know that what has my son done  she persisted just as obstinately on her side  you have had the only explanation which i think it necessary to give to you or to him she answered  in plain english its your sovereign will and pleasure miss verinder to jilt my son  rachel was silent for a moment sitting close behind her i heard her sigh mr bruff took her hand and gave it a little squeeze she recovered herself and answered mr ablewhite as boldly as ever  i have exposed myself to worse misconstruction than that she said and i have borne it patiently the time has gone by when you could mortify me by calling me a jilt  she spoke with a bitterness of tone which satisfied me that the scandal of the moonstone had been in some way recalled to her mind i have no more to say she added wearily not addressing the words to anyone in particular and looking away from us all out of the window that was nearest to her  mr ablewhite got upon his feet and pushed away his chair so violently that it toppled over and fell on the floor  i have something more to say on my side he announced bringing down the flat of his hand on the table with a bang i have to say that if my son doesnt feel this insult i do  rachel started and looked at him in sudden surprise  insult she repeated what do you mean  insult reiterated mr ablewhite i know your motive miss verinder for breaking your promise to my son i know it as certainly as if you had confessed it in so many words your cursed family pride is insulting godfrey as it insulted me when i married your aunt her familyher beggarly familyturned their backs on her for marrying an honest man who had made his own place and won his own fortune i had no ancestors i wasnt descended from a set of cutthroat scoundrels who lived by robbery and murder i couldnt point to the time when the ablewhites hadnt a shirt to their backs and couldnt sign their own names ha ha i wasnt good enough for the herncastles when i married and now it comes to the pinch my son isnt good enough for you i suspected it all along you have got the herncastle blood in you my young lady i suspected it all along  a very unworthy suspicion remarked mr bruff i am astonished that you have the courage to acknowledge it  before mr ablewhite could find words to answer in rachel spoke in a tone of the most exasperating contempt  surely she said to the lawyer this is beneath notice if he can think in that way let us leave him to think as he pleases  from scarlet mr ablewhite was now becoming purple he gasped for breath he looked backwards and forwards from rachel to mr bruff in such a frenzy of rage with both of them that he didnt know which to attack first his wife who had sat impenetrably fanning herself up to this time began to be alarmed and attempted quite uselessly to quiet him i had throughout this distressing interview felt more than one inward call to interfere with a few earnest words and had controlled myself under a dread of the possible results very unworthy of a christian englishwoman who looks not to what is meanly prudent but to what is morally right at the point at which matters had now arrived i rose superior to all considerations of mere expediency if i had contemplated interposing any remonstrance of my own humble devising i might possibly have still hesitated but the distressing domestic emergency which now confronted me was most marvellously and beautifully provided for in the correspondence of miss jane ann stamperletter one thousand and one on peace in families i rose in my modest corner and i opened my precious book  dear mr ablewhite i said one word  when i first attracted the attention of the company by rising i could see that he was on the point of saying something rude to me my sisterly form of address checked him he stared at me in heathen astonishment  as an affectionate wellwisher and friend i proceeded and as one long accustomed to arouse convince prepare enlighten and fortify others permit me to take the most pardonable of all libertiesthe liberty of composing your mind  he began to recover himself he was on the point of breaking outhe would have broken out with anybody else but my voice habitually gentle possesses a high note or so in emergencies in this emergency i felt imperatively called upon to have the highest voice of the two  i held up my precious book before him i rapped the open page impressively with my forefinger not my words i exclaimed in a burst of fervent interruption oh dont suppose that i claim attention for my humble words manna in the wilderness mr ablewhite dew on the parched earth words of comfort words of wisdom words of lovethe blessed blessed blessed words of miss jane ann stamper  i was stopped there by a momentary impediment of the breath before i could recover myself this monster in human form shouted out furiously  miss jane ann stamper be  it is impossible for me to write the awful word which is here represented by a blank i shrieked as it passed his lips i flew to my little bag on the side table i shook out all my tracts i seized the one particular tract on profane swearing entitled hush for heavens sake i handed it to him with an expression of agonised entreaty he tore it in two and threw it back at me across the table the rest of them rose in alarm not knowing what might happen next i instantly sat down again in my corner there had once been an occasion under somewhat similar circumstances when miss jane ann stamper had been taken by the two shoulders and turned out of a room i waited inspired by her spirit for a repetition of her martyrdom  but noit was not to be his wife was the next person whom he addressed whowhowho he said stammering with rage who asked this impudent fanatic into the house did you  before aunt ablewhite could say a word rachel answered for her  miss clack is here she said as my guest  those words had a singular effect on mr ablewhite they suddenly changed him from a man in a state of redhot anger to a man in a state of icycold contempt it was plain to everybody that rachel had said somethingshort and plain as her answer had beenwhich gave him the upper hand of her at last  oh he said miss clack is here as your guestin my house  it was rachels turn to lose her temper at that her colour rose and her eyes brightened fiercely she turned to the lawyer and pointing to mr ablewhite asked haughtily what does he mean  mr bruff interfered for the third time  you appear to forget he said addressing mr ablewhite that you took this house as miss verinders guardian for miss verinders use  not quite so fast interposed mr ablewhite i have a last word to say which i should have said some time since if this he looked my way pondering what abominable name he should call meif this rampant spinster had not interrupted us i beg to inform you sir that if my son is not good enough to be miss verinders husband i cannot presume to consider his father good enough to be miss verinders guardian understand if you please that i refuse to accept the position which is offered to me by lady verinders will in your legal phrase i decline to act this house has necessarily been hired in my name i take the entire responsibility of it on my shoulders it is my house i can keep it or let it just as i please i have no wish to hurry miss verinder on the contrary i beg her to remove her guest and her luggage at her own entire convenience he made a low bow and walked out of the room  that was mr ablewhites revenge on rachel for refusing to marry his son  the instant the door closed aunt ablewhite exhibited a phenomenon which silenced us all she became endowed with energy enough to cross the room  my dear she said taking rachel by the hand i should be ashamed of my husband if i didnt know that it is his temper which has spoken to you and not himself you continued aunt ablewhite turning on me in my corner with another endowment of energy in her looks this time instead of her limbsyou are the mischievous person who irritated him i hope i shall never see you or your tracts again she went back to rachel and kissed her i beg your pardon my dear she said in my husbands name what can i do for you  consistently perverse in everythingcapricious and unreasonable in all the actions of her liferachel melted into tears at those commonplace words and returned her aunts kiss in silence  if i may be permitted to answer for miss verinder said mr bruff might i ask you mrs ablewhite to send penelope down with her mistresss bonnet and shawl leave us ten minutes together he added in a lower tone and you may rely on my setting matters right to your satisfaction as well as to rachels  the trust of the family in this man was something wonderful to see without a word more on her side aunt ablewhite left the room  ah said mr bruff looking after her the herncastle blood has its drawbacks i admit but there is something in good breeding after all  having made that purely worldly remark he looked hard at my corner as if he expected me to go my interest in rachelan infinitely higher interest than hisriveted me to my chair  mr bruff gave it up exactly as he had given it up at aunt verinders in montagu square he led rachel to a chair by the window and spoke to her there  my dear young lady he said mr ablewhites conduct has naturally shocked you and taken you by surprise if it was worth while to contest the question with such a man we might soon show him that he is not to have things all his own way but it isnt worth while you were quite right in what you said just now he is beneath our notice  he stopped and looked round at my corner i sat there quite immovable with my tracts at my elbow and with miss jane ann stamper on my lap  you know he resumed turning back again to rachel that it was part of your poor mothers fine nature always to see the best of the people about her and never the worst she named her brotherinlaw your guardian because she believed in him and because she thought it would please her sister i had never liked mr ablewhite myself and i induced your mother to let me insert a clause in the will empowering her executors in certain events to consult with me about the appointment of a new guardian one of those events has happened today and i find myself in a position to end all these dry business details i hope agreeably with a message from my wife will you honour mrs bruff by becoming her guest and will you remain under my roof and be one of my family until we wise people have laid our heads together and have settled what is to be done next  at those words i rose to interfere mr bruff had done exactly what i had dreaded he would do when he asked mrs ablewhite for rachels bonnet and shawl  before i could interpose a word rachel had accepted his invitation in the warmest terms if i suffered the arrangement thus made between them to be carried outif she once passed the threshold of mr bruffs doorfarewell to the fondest hope of my life the hope of bringing my lost sheep back to the fold the bare idea of such a calamity as this quite overwhelmed me i cast the miserable trammels of worldly discretion to the winds and spoke with the fervour that filled me in the words that came first  stop i saidstop i must be heard mr bruff you are not related to her and i am i invite heri summon the executors to appoint me guardian rachel dearest rachel i offer you my modest home come to london by the next train love and share it with me  mr bruff said nothing rachel looked at me with a cruel astonishment which she made no effort to conceal  you are very kind drusilla she said i shall hope to visit you whenever i happen to be in london but i have accepted mr bruffs invitation and i think it will be best for the present if i remain under mr bruffs care  oh dont say so i pleaded i cant part with you racheli cant part with you  i tried to fold her in my arms but she drew back my fervour did not communicate itself it only alarmed her  surely she said this is a very unnecessary display of agitation i dont understand it  no more do i said mr bruff  their hardnesstheir hideous worldly hardnessrevolted me  oh rachel rachel i burst out havent you seen yet that my heart yearns to make a christian of you has no inner voice told you that i am trying to do for you what i was trying to do for your dear mother when death snatched her out of my hands  rachel advanced a step nearer and looked at me very strangely  i dont understand your reference to my mother she said miss clack will you have the goodness to explain yourself  before i could answer mr bruff came forward and offering his arm to rachel tried to lead her out of the room  you had better not pursue the subject my dear he said and miss clack had better not explain herself  if i had been a stock or a stone such an interference as this must have roused me into testifying to the truth i put mr bruff aside indignantly with my own hand and in solemn and suitable language i stated the view with which sound doctrine does not scruple to regard the awful calamity of dying unprepared  rachel started back from mei blush to writewith a scream of horror  come away she said to mr bruff come away for gods sake before that woman can say any more oh think of my poor mothers harmless useful beautiful life you were at the funeral mr bruff you saw how everybody loved her you saw the poor helpless people crying at her grave over the loss of their best friend and that wretch stands there and tries to make me doubt that my mother who was an angel on earth is an angel in heaven now dont stop to talk about it come away it stifles me to breathe the same air with her it frightens me to feel that we are in the same room together  deaf to all remonstrance she ran to the door  at the same moment her maid entered with her bonnet and shawl she huddled them on anyhow pack my things she said and bring them to mr bruffs i attempted to approach heri was shocked and grieved but it is needless to say not offended i only wished to say to her may your hard heart be softened i freely forgive you she pulled down her veil and tore her shawl away from my hand and hurrying out shut the door in my face i bore the insult with my customary fortitude i remember it now with my customary superiority to all feeling of offence  mr bruff had his parting word of mockery for me before he too hurried out in his turn  you had better not have explained yourself miss clack he said and bowed and left the room  the person with the capribbons followed  its easy to see who has set them all by the ears together she said im only a poor servantbut i declare im ashamed of you she too went out and banged the door after her  i was left alone in the room reviled by them all deserted by them all i was left alone in the room  is there more to be added to this plain statement of factsto this touching picture of a christian persecuted by the world no my diary reminds me that one more of the many chequered chapters in my life ends here from that day forth i never saw rachel verinder again she had my forgiveness at the time when she insulted me she has had my prayerful good wishes ever since and when i dieto complete the return on my part of good for evilshe will have the life letters and labours of miss jane ann stamper left her as a legacy by my will    second narrative  contributed by mathew bruff solicitor of grays inn square  chapter i   my fair friend miss clack having laid down the pen there are two reasons for my taking it up next in my turn  in the first place i am in a position to throw the necessary light on certain points of interest which have thus far been left in the dark miss verinder had her own private reason for breaking her marriage engagementand i was at the bottom of it mr godfrey ablewhite had his own private reason for withdrawing all claim to the hand of his charming cousinand i discovered what it was  in the second place it was my good or ill fortune i hardly know which to find myself personally involvedat the period of which i am now writingin the mystery of the indian diamond i had the honour of an interview at my own office with an oriental stranger of distinguished manners who was no other unquestionably than the chief of the three indians add to this that i met with the celebrated traveller mr murthwaite the day afterwards and that i held a conversation with him on the subject of the moonstone which has a very important bearing on later events and there you have the statement of my claims to fill the position which i occupy in these pages    the true story of the broken marriage engagement comes first in point of time and must therefore take the first place in the present narrative tracing my way back along the chain of events from one end to the other i find it necessary to open the scene oddly enough as you will think at the bedside of my excellent client and friend the late sir john verinder  sir john had his shareperhaps rather a large shareof the more harmless and amiable of the weaknesses incidental to humanity among these i may mention as applicable to the matter in hand an invincible reluctanceso long as he enjoyed his usual good healthto face the responsibility of making his will lady verinder exerted her influence to rouse him to a sense of duty in this matter and i exerted my influence he admitted the justice of our viewsbut he went no further than that until he found himself afflicted with the illness which ultimately brought him to his grave then i was sent for at last to take my clients instructions on the subject of his will they proved to be the simplest instructions i had ever received in the whole of my professional career  sir john was dozing when i entered the room he roused himself at the sight of me  how do you do mr bruff he said i shant be very long about this and then ill go to sleep again he looked on with great interest while i collected pens ink and paper are you ready he asked i bowed and took a dip of ink and waited for my instructions  i leave everything to my wife said sir john thats all he turned round on his pillow and composed himself to sleep again  i was obliged to disturb him  am i to understand i asked that you leave the whole of the property of every sort and description of which you die possessed absolutely to lady verinder  yes said sir john only i put it shorter why cant you put it shorter and let me go to sleep again everything to my wife thats my will  his property was entirely at his own disposal and was of two kinds property in land i purposely abstain from using technical language and property in money in the majority of cases i am afraid i should have felt it my duty to my client to ask him to reconsider his will in the case of sir john i knew lady verinder to be not only worthy of the unreserved trust which her husband had placed in her all good wives are worthy of thatbut to be also capable of properly administering a trust which in my experience of the fair sex not one in a thousand of them is competent to do in ten minutes sir johns will was drawn and executed and sir john himself good man was finishing his interrupted nap  lady verinder amply justified the confidence which her husband had placed in her in the first days of her widowhood she sent for me and made her will the view she took of her position was so thoroughly sound and sensible that i was relieved of all necessity for advising her my responsibility began and ended with shaping her instructions into the proper legal form before sir john had been a fortnight in his grave the future of his daughter had been most wisely and most affectionately provided for  the will remained in its fireproof box at my office through more years than i like to reckon up it was not till the summer of eighteen hundred and fortyeight that i found occasion to look at it again under very melancholy circumstances  at the date i have mentioned the doctors pronounced the sentence on poor lady verinder which was literally a sentence of death i was the first person whom she informed of her situation and i found her anxious to go over her will again with me  it was impossible to improve the provisions relating to her daughter but in the lapse of time her wishes in regard to certain minor legacies left to different relatives had undergone some modification and it became necessary to add three or four codicils to the original document having done this at once for fear of accident i obtained her ladyships permission to embody her recent instructions in a second will my object was to avoid certain inevitable confusions and repetitions which now disfigured the original document and which to own the truth grated sadly on my professional sense of the fitness of things  the execution of this second will has been described by miss clack who was so obliging as to witness it so far as regarded rachel verinders pecuniary interests it was word for word the exact counterpart of the first will the only changes introduced related to the appointment of a guardian and to certain provisions concerning that appointment which were made under my advice on lady verinders death the will was placed in the hands of my proctor to be proved as the phrase is in the usual way  in about three weeks from that timeas well as i can rememberthe first warning reached me of something unusual going on under the surface i happened to be looking in at my friend the proctors office and i observed that he received me with an appearance of greater interest than usual  i have some news for you he said what do you think i heard at doctors commons this morning lady verinders will has been asked for and examined already  this was news indeed there was absolutely nothing which could be contested in the will and there was nobody i could think of who had the slightest interest in examining it i shall perhaps do well if i explain in this place for the benefit of the few people who dont know it already that the law allows all wills to be examined at doctors commons by anybody who applies on the payment of a shilling fee  did you hear who asked for the will i asked  yes the clerk had no hesitation in telling me mr smalley of the firm of skipp and smalley asked for it the will has not been copied yet into the great folio registers so there was no alternative but to depart from the usual course and to let him see the original document he looked it over carefully and made a note in his pocketbook have you any idea of what he wanted with it  i shook my head i shall find out i answered before i am a day older with that i went back at once to my own office  if any other firm of solicitors had been concerned in this unaccountable examination of my deceased clients will i might have found some difficulty in making the necessary discovery but i had a hold over skipp and smalley which made my course in this matter a comparatively easy one my commonlaw clerk a most competent and excellent man was a brother of mr smalleys and owing to this sort of indirect connection with me skipp and smalley had for some years past picked up the crumbs that fell from my table in the shape of cases brought to my office which for various reasons i did not think it worth while to undertake my professional patronage was in this way of some importance to the firm i intended if necessary to remind them of that patronage on the present occasion  the moment i got back i spoke to my clerk and after telling him what had happened i sent him to his brothers office with mr bruffs compliments and he would be glad to know why messrs skipp and smalley had found it necessary to examine lady verinders will  this message brought mr smalley back to my office in company with his brother he acknowledged that he had acted under instructions received from a client and then he put it to me whether it would not be a breach of professional confidence on his part to say more  we had a smart discussion upon that he was right no doubt and i was wrong the truth is i was angry and suspiciousand i insisted on knowing more worse still i declined to consider any additional information offered me as a secret placed in my keeping i claimed perfect freedom to use my own discretion worse even than that i took an unwarrantable advantage of my position choose sir i said to mr smalley between the risk of losing your clients business and the risk of losing mine quite indefensible i admitan act of tyranny and nothing less like other tyrants i carried my point mr smalley chose his alternative without a moments hesitation  he smiled resignedly and gave up the name of his client  mr godfrey ablewhite  that was enough for mei wanted to know no more  having reached this point in my narrative it now becomes necessary to place the reader of these linesso far as lady verinders will is concernedon a footing of perfect equality in respect of information with myself  let me state then in the fewest possible words that rachel verinder had nothing but a lifeinterest in the property her mothers excellent sense and my long experience had combined to relieve her of all responsibility and to guard her from all danger of becoming the victim in the future of some needy and unscrupulous man neither she nor her husband if she married could raise sixpence either on the property in land or on the property in money they would have the houses in london and in yorkshire to live in and they would have the handsome incomeand that was all  when i came to think over what i had discovered i was sorely perplexed what to do next  hardly a week had passed since i had heard to my surprise and distress of miss verinders proposed marriage i had the sincerest admiration and affection for her and i had been inexpressibly grieved when i heard that she was about to throw herself away on mr godfrey ablewhite and now here was the manwhom i had always believed to be a smoothtongued impostorjustifying the very worst that i had thought of him and plainly revealing the mercenary object of the marriage on his side and what of thatyou may replythe thing is done every day granted my dear sir but would you think of it quite as lightly as you do if the thing was done let us say with your own sister  the first consideration which now naturally occurred to me was this would mr godfrey ablewhite hold to his engagement after what his lawyer had discovered for him  it depended entirely on his pecuniary position of which i knew nothing if that position was not a desperate one it would be well worth his while to marry miss verinder for her income alone if on the other hand he stood in urgent need of realising a large sum by a given time then lady verinders will would exactly meet the case and would preserve her daughter from falling into a scoundrels hands  in the latter event there would be no need for me to distress miss rachel in the first days of her mourning for her mother by an immediate revelation of the truth in the former event if i remained silent i should be conniving at a marriage which would make her miserable for life  my doubts ended in my calling at the hotel in london at which i knew mrs ablewhite and miss verinder to be staying they informed me that they were going to brighton the next day and that an unexpected obstacle prevented mr godfrey ablewhite from accompanying them i at once proposed to take his place while i was only thinking of rachel verinder it was possible to hesitate when i actually saw her my mind was made up directly come what might of it to tell her the truth  i found my opportunity when i was out walking with her on the day after my arrival  may i speak to you i asked about your marriage engagement  yes she said indifferently if you have nothing more interesting to talk about  will you forgive an old friend and servant of your family miss rachel if i venture on asking whether your heart is set on this marriage  i am marrying in despair mr bruffon the chance of dropping into some sort of stagnant happiness which may reconcile me to my life  strong language and suggestive of something below the surface in the shape of a romance but i had my own object in view and i declined as we lawyers say to pursue the question into its side issues  mr godfrey ablewhite can hardly be of your way of thinking i said his heart must be set on the marriage at any rate  he says so and i suppose i ought to believe him he would hardly marry me after what i have owned to him unless he was fond of me  poor thing the bare idea of a man marrying her for his own selfish and mercenary ends had never entered her head the task i had set myself began to look like a harder task than i had bargained for  it sounds strangely i went on in my oldfashioned ears  what sounds strangely she asked  to hear you speak of your future husband as if you were not quite sure of the sincerity of his attachment are you conscious of any reason in your own mind for doubting him  her astonishing quickness of perception detected a change in my voice or my manner when i put that question which warned her that i had been speaking all along with some ulterior object in view she stopped and taking her arm out of mine looked me searchingly in the face  mr bruff she said you have something to tell me about godfrey ablewhite tell it  i knew her well enough to take her at her word i told it  she put her arm again into mine and walked on with me slowly i felt her hand tightening its grasp mechanically on my arm and i saw her getting paler and paler as i went onbut not a word passed her lips while i was speaking when i had done she still kept silence her head drooped a little and she walked by my side unconscious of my presence unconscious of everything about her lostburied i might almost sayin her own thoughts  i made no attempt to disturb her my experience of her disposition warned me on this as on former occasions to give her time  the first instinct of girls in general on being told of anything which interests them is to ask a multitude of questions and then to run off and talk it all over with some favourite friend rachel verinders first instinct under similar circumstances was to shut herself up in her own mind and to think it over by herself this absolute selfdependence is a great virtue in a man in a woman it has a serious drawback of morally separating her from the mass of her sex and so exposing her to misconstruction by the general opinion i strongly suspect myself of thinking as the rest of the world think in this matterexcept in the case of rachel verinder the selfdependence in her character was one of its virtues in my estimation partly no doubt because i sincerely admired and liked her partly because the view i took of her connexion with the loss of the moonstone was based on my own special knowledge of her disposition badly as appearances might look in the matter of the diamondshocking as it undoubtedly was to know that she was associated in any way with the mystery of an undiscovered thefti was satisfied nevertheless that she had done nothing unworthy of her because i was also satisfied that she had not stirred a step in the business without shutting herself up in her own mind and thinking it over first  we had walked on for nearly a mile i should say before rachel roused herself she suddenly looked up at me with a faint reflection of her smile of happier timesthe most irresistible smile i have ever seen on a womans face  i owe much already to your kindness she said and i feel more deeply indebted to it now than ever if you hear any rumours of my marriage when you get back to london contradict them at once on my authority  have you resolved to break your engagement i asked  can you doubt it she returned proudly after what you have told me  my dear miss rachel you are very youngand you may find more difficulty in withdrawing from your present position than you anticipate have you no onei mean a lady of coursewhom you could consult  no one she answered  it distressed me it did indeed distress me to hear her say that she was so young and so lonelyand she bore it so well the impulse to help her got the better of any sense of my own unfitness which i might have felt under the circumstances and i stated such ideas on the subject as occurred to me on the spur of the moment to the best of my ability i have advised a prodigious number of clients and have dealt with some exceedingly awkward difficulties in my time but this was the first occasion on which i had ever found myself advising a young lady how to obtain her release from a marriage engagement the suggestion i offered amounted briefly to this i recommended her to tell mr godfrey ablewhiteat a private interview of coursethat he had to her certain knowledge betrayed the mercenary nature of the motive on his side she was then to add that their marriage after what she had discovered was a simple impossibilityand she was to put it to him whether he thought it wisest to secure her silence by falling in with her views or to force her by opposing them to make the motive under which she was acting generally known if he attempted to defend himself or to deny the facts she was in that event to refer him to me  miss verinder listened attentively till i had done she then thanked me very prettily for my advice but informed me at the same time that it was impossible for her to follow it  may i ask i said what objection you see to following it  she hesitatedand then met me with a question on her side  suppose you were asked to express your opinion of mr godfrey ablewhites conduct she began  yes  what would you call it  i should call it the conduct of a meanly deceitful man  mr bruff i have believed in that man i have promised to marry that man how can i tell him he is mean how can i tell him he has deceived me how can i disgrace him in the eyes of the world after that i have degraded myself by ever thinking of him as my husband if i say what you tell me to say to himi am owning that i have degraded myself to his face i cant do that after what has passed between us i cant do that the shame of it would be nothing to him but the shame of it would be unendurable to me  here was another of the marked peculiarities in her character disclosing itself to me without reserve here was her sensitive horror of the bare contact with anything mean blinding her to every consideration of what she owed to herself hurrying her into a false position which might compromise her in the estimation of all her friends up to this time i had been a little diffident about the propriety of the advice i had given to her but after what she had just said i had no sort of doubt that it was the best advice that could have been offered and i felt no sort of hesitation in pressing it on her again  she only shook her head and repeated her objection in other words  he has been intimate enough with me to ask me to be his wife he has stood high enough in my estimation to obtain my consent i cant tell him to his face that he is the most contemptible of living creatures after that  but my dear miss rachel i remonstrated its equally impossible for you to tell him that you withdraw from your engagement without giving some reason for it  i shall say that i have thought it over and that i am satisfied it will be best for both of us if we part  no more than that  no more  have you thought of what he may say on his side  he may say what he pleases  it was impossible not to admire her delicacy and her resolution and it was equally impossible not to feel that she was putting herself in the wrong i entreated her to consider her own position i reminded her that she would be exposing herself to the most odious misconstruction of her motives you cant brave public opinion i said at the command of private feeling  i can she answered i have done it already  what do you mean  you have forgotten the moonstone mr bruff have i not braved public opinion there with my own private reasons for it  her answer silenced me for the moment it set me trying to trace the explanation of her conduct at the time of the loss of the moonstone out of the strange avowal which had just escaped her i might perhaps have done it when i was younger i certainly couldnt do it now  i tried a last remonstrance before we returned to the house she was just as immovable as ever my mind was in a strange conflict of feelings about her when i left her that day she was obstinate she was wrong she was interesting she was admirable she was deeply to be pitied i made her promise to write to me the moment she had any news to send and i went back to my business in london with a mind exceedingly ill at ease  on the evening of my return before it was possible for me to receive my promised letter i was surprised by a visit from mr ablewhite the elder and was informed that mr godfrey had got his dismissaland had accepted itthat very day  with the view i already took of the case the bare fact stated in the words that i have underlined revealed mr godfrey ablewhites motive for submission as plainly as if he had acknowledged it himself he needed a large sum of money and he needed it by a given time rachels income which would have helped him to anything else would not help him here and rachel had accordingly released herself without encountering a moments serious opposition on his part if i am told that this is a mere speculation i ask in my turn what other theory will account for his giving up a marriage which would have maintained him in splendour for the rest of his life  any exultation i might otherwise have felt at the lucky turn which things had now taken was effectually checked by what passed at my interview with old mr ablewhite  he came of course to know whether i could give him any explanation of miss verinders extraordinary conduct it is needless to say that i was quite unable to afford him the information he wanted the annoyance which i thus inflicted following on the irritation produced by a recent interview with his son threw mr ablewhite off his guard both his looks and his language convinced me that miss verinder would find him a merciless man to deal with when he joined the ladies at brighton the next day  i had a restless night considering what i ought to do next how my reflections ended and how thoroughly well founded my distrust of mr ablewhite proved to be are items of information which as i am told have already been put tidily in their proper places by that exemplary person miss clack i have only to addin completion of her narrativethat miss verinder found the quiet and repose which she sadly needed poor thing in my house at hampstead she honoured us by making a long stay my wife and daughters were charmed with her and when the executors decided on the appointment of a new guardian i feel sincere pride and pleasure in recording that my guest and my family parted like old friends on either side    chapter ii   the next thing i have to do is to present such additional information as i possess on the subject of the moonstone or to speak more correctly on the subject of the indian plot to steal the diamond the little that i have to tell is as i think i have already said of some importance nevertheless in respect of its bearing very remarkably on events which are still to come  about a week or ten days after miss verinder had left us one of my clerks entered the private room at my office with a card in his hand and informed me that a gentleman was below who wanted to speak to me  i looked at the card there was a foreign name written on it which has escaped my memory it was followed by a line written in english at the bottom of the card which i remember perfectly well  recommended by mr septimus luker  the audacity of a person in mr lukers position presuming to recommend anybody to me took me so completely by surprise that i sat silent for the moment wondering whether my own eyes had not deceived me the clerk observing my bewilderment favoured me with the result of his own observation of the stranger who was waiting downstairs  he is rather a remarkablelooking man sir so dark in the complexion that we all set him down in the office for an indian or something of that sort  associating the clerks idea with the line inscribed on the card in my hand i thought it possible that the moonstone might be at the bottom of mr lukers recommendation and of the strangers visit at my office to the astonishment of my clerk i at once decided on granting an interview to the gentleman below  in justification of the highly unprofessional sacrifice to mere curiosity which i thus made permit me to remind anybody who may read these lines that no living person in england at any rate can claim to have had such an intimate connexion with the romance of the indian diamond as mine has been i was trusted with the secret of colonel herncastles plan for escaping assassination i received the colonels letters periodically reporting himself a living man i drew his will leaving the moonstone to miss verinder i persuaded his executor to act on the chance that the jewel might prove to be a valuable acquisition to the family and lastly i combated mr franklin blakes scruples and induced him to be the means of transporting the diamond to lady verinders house if anyone can claim a prescriptive right of interest in the moonstone and in everything connected with it i think it is hardly to be denied that i am the man  the moment my mysterious client was shown in i felt an inner conviction that i was in the presence of one of the three indiansprobably of the chief he was carefully dressed in european costume but his swarthy complexion his long lithe figure and his grave and graceful politeness of manner were enough to betray his oriental origin to any intelligent eyes that looked at him  i pointed to a chair and begged to be informed of the nature of his business with me  after first apologisingin an excellent selection of english wordsfor the liberty which he had taken in disturbing me the indian produced a small parcel the outer covering of which was of cloth of gold removing this and a second wrapping of some silken fabric he placed a little box or casket on my table most beautifully and richly inlaid in jewels on an ebony ground  i have come sir he said to ask you to lend me some money and i leave this as an assurance to you that my debt will be paid back  i pointed to his card and you apply to me i rejoined at mr lukers recommendation  the indian bowed  may i ask how it is that mr luker himself did not advance the money that you require  mr luker informed me sir that he had no money to lend  and so he recommended you to come to me  the indian in his turn pointed to the card it is written there he said  briefly answered and thoroughly to the purpose if the moonstone had been in my possession this oriental gentleman would have murdered me i am well aware without a moments hesitation at the same time and barring that slight drawback i am bound to testify that he was the perfect model of a client he might not have respected my life but he did what none of my own countrymen had ever done in all my experience of themhe respected my time  i am sorry i said that you should have had the trouble of coming to me mr luker is quite mistaken in sending you here i am trusted like other men in my profession with money to lend but i never lend it to strangers and i never lend it on such a security as you have produced  far from attempting as other people would have done to induce me to relax my own rules the indian only made me another bow and wrapped up his box in its two coverings without a word of protest he rosethis admirable assassin rose to go the moment i had answered him  will your condescension towards a stranger excuse my asking one question he said before i take my leave  i bowed on my side only one question at parting the average in my experience was fifty  supposing sir it had been possible and customary for you to lend me the money he said in what space of time would it have been possible and customary for me to pay it back  according to the usual course pursued in this country i answered you would have been entitled to pay the money back if you liked in one years time from the date at which it was first advanced to you  the indian made me a last bow the lowest of alland suddenly and softly walked out of the room  it was done in a moment in a noiseless supple catlike way which a little startled me i own as soon as i was composed enough to think i arrived at one distinct conclusion in reference to the otherwise incomprehensible visitor who had favoured me with a call  his face voice and mannerwhile i was in his companywere under such perfect control that they set all scrutiny at defiance but he had given me one chance of looking under the smooth outer surface of him for all that he had not shown the slightest sign of attempting to fix anything that i had said to him in his mind until i mentioned the time at which it was customary to permit the earliest repayment on the part of a debtor of money that had been advanced as a loan when i gave him that piece of information he looked me straight in the face while i was speaking for the first time the inference i drew from this wasthat he had a special purpose in asking me his last question and a special interest in hearing my answer to it the more carefully i reflected on what had passed between us the more shrewdly i suspected the production of the casket and the application for the loan of having been mere formalities designed to pave the way for the parting inquiry addressed to me  i had satisfied myself of the correctness of this conclusionand was trying to get on a step further and penetrate the indians motives nextwhen a letter was brought to me which proved to be from no less a person that mr septimus luker himself he asked my pardon in terms of sickening servility and assured me that he could explain matters to my satisfaction if i would honour him by consenting to a personal interview  i made another unprofessional sacrifice to mere curiosity i honoured him by making an appointment at my office for the next day  mr luker was in every respect such an inferior creature to the indianhe was so vulgar so ugly so cringing and so prosythat he is quite unworthy of being reported at any length in these pages the substance of what he had to tell me may be fairly stated as follows  the day before i had received the visit of the indian mr luker had been favoured with a call from that accomplished gentleman in spite of his european disguise mr luker had instantly identified his visitor with the chief of the three indians who had formerly annoyed him by loitering about his house and who had left him no alternative but to consult a magistrate from this startling discovery he had rushed to the conclusion naturally enough i own that he must certainly be in the company of one of the three men who had blindfolded him gagged him and robbed him of his bankers receipt the result was that he became quite paralysed with terror and that he firmly believed his last hour had come  on his side the indian preserved the character of a perfect stranger he produced the little casket and made exactly the same application which he had afterwards made to me as the speediest way of getting rid of him mr luker had at once declared that he had no money the indian had thereupon asked to be informed of the best and safest person to apply to for the loan he wanted mr luker had answered that the best and safest person in such cases was usually a respectable solicitor asked to name some individual of that character and profession mr luker had mentioned mefor the one simple reason that in the extremity of his terror mine was the first name which occurred to him the perspiration was pouring off me like rain sir the wretched creature concluded i didnt know what i was talking about and i hope youll look over it mr bruff sir in consideration of my having been really and truly frightened out of my wits  i excused the fellow graciously enough it was the readiest way of releasing myself from the sight of him before he left me i detained him to make one inquiry  had the indian said anything noticeable at the moment of quitting mr lukers house  yes the indian had put precisely the same question to mr luker at parting which he had put to me receiving of course the same answer as the answer which i had given him  what did it mean mr lukers explanation gave me no assistance towards solving the problem my own unaided ingenuity consulted next proved quite unequal to grapple with the difficulty i had a dinner engagement that evening and i went upstairs in no very genial frame of mind little suspecting that the way to my dressingroom and the way to discovery meant on this particular occasion one and the same thing    chapter iii   the prominent personage among the guests at the dinner party i found to be mr murthwaite  on his appearance in england after his wanderings society had been greatly interested in the traveller as a man who had passed through many dangerous adventures and who had escaped to tell the tale he had now announced his intention of returning to the scene of his exploits and of penetrating into regions left still unexplored this magnificent indifference to placing his safety in peril for the second time revived the flagging interest of the worshippers in the hero the law of chances was clearly against his escaping on this occasion it is not every day that we can meet an eminent person at dinner and feel that there is a reasonable prospect of the news of his murder being the news that we hear of him next  when the gentlemen were left by themselves in the diningroom i found myself sitting next to mr murthwaite the guests present being all english it is needless to say that as soon as the wholesome check exercised by the presence of the ladies was removed the conversation turned on politics as a necessary result  in respect to this allabsorbing national topic i happen to be one of the most unenglish englishmen living as a general rule political talk appears to me to be of all talk the most dreary and the most profitless glancing at mr murthwaite when the bottles had made their first round of the table i found that he was apparently of my way of thinking he was doing it very dexterouslywith all possible consideration for the feelings of his hostbut it is not the less certain that he was composing himself for a nap it struck me as an experiment worth attempting to try whether a judicious allusion to the subject of the moonstone would keep him awake and if it did to see what he thought of the last new complication in the indian conspiracy as revealed in the prosaic precincts of my office  if i am not mistaken mr murthwaite i began you were acquainted with the late lady verinder and you took some interest in the strange succession of events which ended in the loss of the moonstone  the eminent traveller did me the honour of waking up in an instant and asking me who i was  i informed him of my professional connection with the herncastle family not forgetting the curious position which i had occupied towards the colonel and his diamond in the bygone time  mr murthwaite shifted round in his chair so as to put the rest of the company behind him conservatives and liberals alike and concentrated his whole attention on plain mr bruff of grays inn square  have you heard anything lately of the indians he asked  i have every reason to believe i answered that one of them had an interview with me in my office yesterday  mr murthwaite was not an easy man to astonish but that last answer of mine completely staggered him i described what had happened to mr luker and what had happened to myself exactly as i have described it here it is clear that the indians parting inquiry had an object i added why should he be so anxious to know the time at which a borrower of money is usually privileged to pay the money back  is it possible that you dont see his motive mr bruff  i am ashamed of my stupidity mr murthwaitebut i certainly dont see it  the great traveller became quite interested in sounding the immense vacuity of my dulness to its lowest depths  let me ask you one question he said in what position does the conspiracy to seize the moonstone now stand  i cant say i answered the indian plot is a mystery to me  the indian plot mr bruff can only be a mystery to you because you have never seriously examined it shall we run it over together from the time when you drew colonel herncastles will to the time when the indian called at your office in your position it may be of very serious importance to the interests of miss verinder that you should be able to take a clear view of this matter in case of need tell me bearing that in mind whether you will penetrate the indians motive for yourself or whether you wish me to save you the trouble of making any inquiry into it  it is needless to say that i thoroughly appreciated the practical purpose which i now saw that he had in view and that the first of the two alternatives was the alternative i chose  very good said mr murthwaite we will take the question of the ages of the three indians first i can testify that they all look much about the same ageand you can decide for yourself whether the man whom you saw was or was not in the prime of life not forty you think my idea too we will say not forty now look back to the time when colonel herncastle came to england and when you were concerned in the plan he adopted to preserve his life i dont want you to count the years i will only say it is clear that these present indians at their age must be the successors of three other indians high caste brahmins all of them mr bruff when they left their native country who followed the colonel to these shores very well these present men of ours have succeeded to the men who were here before them if they had only done that the matter would not have been worth inquiring into but they have done more they have succeeded to the organisation which their predecessors established in this country dont start the organisation is a very trumpery affair according to our ideas i have no doubt i should reckon it up as including the command of money the services when needed of that shady sort of englishman who lives in the byways of foreign life in london and lastly the secret sympathy of such few men of their own country and formerly at least of their own religion as happen to be employed in ministering to some of the multitudinous wants of this great city nothing very formidable as you see but worth notice at starting because we may find occasion to refer to this modest little indian organisation as we go on having now cleared the ground i am going to ask you a question and i expect your experience to answer it what was the event which gave the indians their first chance of seizing the diamond  i understood the allusion to my experience  the first chance they got i replied was clearly offered to them by colonel herncastles death they would be aware of his death i suppose as a matter of course  as a matter of course and his death as you say gave them their first chance up to that time the moonstone was safe in the strongroom of the bank you drew the colonels will leaving his jewel to his niece and the will was proved in the usual way as a lawyer you can be at no loss to know what course the indians would take under english advice after that  they would provide themselves with a copy of the will from doctors commons i said  exactly one or other of those shady englishmen to whom i have alluded would get them the copy you have described that copy would inform them that the moonstone was bequeathed to the daughter of lady verinder and that mr blake the elder or some person appointed by him was to place it in her hands you will agree with me that the necessary information about persons in the position of lady verinder and mr blake would be perfectly easy information to obtain the one difficulty for the indians would be to decide whether they should make their attempt on the diamond when it was in course of removal from the keeping of the bank or whether they should wait until it was taken down to yorkshire to lady verinders house the second way would be manifestly the safest wayand there you have the explanation of the appearance of the indians at frizinghall disguised as jugglers and waiting their time in london it is needless to say they had their organisation at their disposal to keep them informed of events two men would do it one to follow anybody who went from mr blakes house to the bank and one to treat the lower men servants with beer and to hear the news of the house these commonplace precautions would readily inform them that mr franklin blake had been to the bank and that mr franklin blake was the only person in the house who was going to visit lady verinder what actually followed upon that discovery you remember no doubt quite as correctly as i do  i remembered that franklin blake had detected one of the spies in the streetthat he had in consequence advanced the time of his arrival in yorkshire by some hoursand that thanks to old betteredges excellent advice he had lodged the diamond in the bank at frizinghall before the indians were so much as prepared to see him in the neighbourhood all perfectly clear so far but the indians being ignorant of the precautions thus taken how was it that they had made no attempt on lady verinders house in which they must have supposed the diamond to be through the whole of the interval that elapsed before rachels birthday  in putting this difficulty to mr murthwaite i thought it right to add that i had heard of the little boy and the drop of ink and the rest of it and that any explanation based on the theory of clairvoyance was an explanation which would carry no conviction whatever with it to my mind  nor to mine either said mr murthwaite the clairvoyance in this case is simply a development of the romantic side of the indian character it would be refreshment and an encouragement to those menquite inconceivable i grant you to the english mindto surround their wearisome and perilous errand in this country with a certain halo of the marvellous and the supernatural their boy is unquestionably a sensitive subject to the mesmeric influenceand under that influence he has no doubt reflected what was already in the mind of the person mesmerising him i have tested the theory of clairvoyanceand i have never found the manifestations get beyond that point the indians dont investigate the matter in this way the indians look upon their boy as a seer of things invisible to their eyesand i repeat in that marvel they find the source of a new interest in the purpose that unites them i only notice this as offering a curious view of human character which must be quite new to you we have nothing whatever to do with clairvoyance or with mesmerism or with anything else that is hard of belief to a practical man in the inquiry that we are now pursuing my object in following the indian plot step by step is to trace results back by rational means to natural causes have i succeeded to your satisfaction so far  not a doubt of it mr murthwaite i am waiting however with some anxiety to hear the rational explanation of the difficulty which i have just had the honour of submitting to you  mr murthwaite smiled its the easiest difficulty to deal with of all he said permit me to begin by admitting your statement of the case as a perfectly correct one the indians were undoubtedly not aware of what mr franklin blake had done with the diamondfor we find them making their first mistake on the first night of mr blakes arrival at his aunts house  their first mistake i repeated  certainly the mistake of allowing themselves to be surprised lurking about the terrace at night by gabriel betteredge however they had the merit of seeing for themselves that they had taken a false stepfor as you say again with plenty of time at their disposal they never came near the house for weeks afterwards  why mr murthwaite thats what i want to know why  because no indian mr bruff ever runs an unnecessary risk the clause you drew in colonel herncastles will informed them didnt it that the moonstone was to pass absolutely into miss verinders possession on her birthday very well tell me which was the safest course for men in their position to make their attempt on the diamond while it was under the control of mr franklin blake who had shown already that he could suspect and outwit them or to wait till the diamond was at the disposal of a young girl who would innocently delight in wearing the magnificent jewel at every possible opportunity perhaps you want a proof that my theory is correct take the conduct of the indians themselves as the proof they appeared at the house after waiting all those weeks on miss verinders birthday and they were rewarded for the patient accuracy of their calculations by seeing the moonstone in the bosom of her dress when i heard the story of the colonel and the diamond later in the evening i felt so sure about the risk mr franklin blake had run they would have certainly attacked him if he had not happened to ride back to lady verinders in the company of other people and i was so strongly convinced of the worse risk still in store for miss verinder that i recommended following the colonels plan and destroying the identity of the gem by having it cut into separate stones how its extraordinary disappearance that night made my advice useless and utterly defeated the hindoo plotand how all further action on the part of the indians was paralysed the next day by their confinement in prison as rogues and vagabondsyou know as well as i do the first act in the conspiracy closes there before we go on to the second may i ask whether i have met your difficulty with an explanation which is satisfactory to the mind of a practical man  it was impossible to deny that he had met my difficulty fairly thanks to his superior knowledge of the indian characterand thanks to his not having had hundreds of other wills to think of since colonel herncastles time  so far so good resumed mr murthwaite the first chance the indians had of seizing the diamond was a chance lost on the day when they were committed to the prison at frizinghall when did the second chance offer itself the second chance offered itselfas i am in a condition to provewhile they were still in confinement  he took out his pocketbook and opened it at a particular leaf before he went on  i was staying he resumed with some friends at frizinghall at the time a day or two before the indians were set free on a monday i think the governor of the prison came to me with a letter it had been left for the indians by one mrs macann of whom they had hired the lodging in which they lived and it had been delivered at mrs macanns door in ordinary course of post on the previous morning the prison authorities had noticed that the postmark was lambeth and that the address on the outside though expressed in correct english was in form oddly at variance with the customary method of directing a letter on opening it they had found the contents to be written in a foreign language which they rightly guessed at as hindustani their object in coming to me was of course to have the letter translated to them i took a copy in my pocketbook of the original and of my translationand there they are at your service  he handed me the open pocketbook the address on the letter was the first thing copied it was all written in one paragraph without any attempt at punctuation thus to the three indian men living with the lady called macann at frizinghall in yorkshire the hindoo characters followed and the english translation appeared at the end expressed in these mysterious words  in the name of the regent of the night whose seat is on the antelope whose arms embrace the four corners of the earth  brothers turn your faces to the south and come to me in the street of many noises which leads down to the muddy river  the reason is this  my own eyes have seen it  there the letter ended without either date or signature i handed it back to mr murthwaite and owned that this curious specimen of hindoo correspondence rather puzzled me  i can explain the first sentence to you he said and the conduct of the indians themselves will explain the rest the god of the moon is represented in the hindoo mythology as a fourarmed deity seated on an antelope and one of his titles is the regent of the night here then to begin with is something which looks suspiciously like an indirect reference to the moonstone now let us see what the indians did after the prison authorities had allowed them to receive their letter on the very day when they were set free they went at once to the railway station and took their places in the first train that started for london we all thought it a pity at frizinghall that their proceedings were not privately watched but after lady verinder had dismissed the policeofficer and had stopped all further inquiry into the loss of the diamond no one else could presume to stir in the matter the indians were free to go to london and to london they went what was the next news we heard of them mr bruff  they were annoying mr luker i answered by loitering about the house at lambeth  did you read the report of mr lukers application to the magistrate  yes  in the course of his statement he referred if you remember to a foreign workman in his employment whom he had just dismissed on suspicion of attempted theft and whom he also distrusted as possibly acting in collusion with the indians who had annoyed him the inference is pretty plain mr bruff as to who wrote that letter which puzzled you just now and as to which of mr lukers oriental treasures the workman had attempted to steal  the inference as i hastened to acknowledge was too plain to need being pointed out i had never doubted that the moonstone had found its way into mr lukers hands at the time mr murthwaite alluded to my only question had been how had the indians discovered the circumstance this question the most difficult to deal with of all as i had thought had now received its answer like the rest lawyer as i was i began to feel that i might trust mr murthwaite to lead me blindfold through the last windings of the labyrinth along which he had guided me thus far i paid him the compliment of telling him this and found my little concession very graciously received  you shall give me a piece of information in your turn before we go on he said somebody must have taken the moonstone from yorkshire to london and somebody must have raised money on it or it would never have been in mr lukers possession has there been any discovery made of who that person was  none that i know of  there was a story was there not about mr godfrey ablewhite i am told he is an eminent philanthropistwhich is decidedly against him to begin with  i heartily agreed in this with mr murthwaite at the same time i felt bound to inform him without it is needless to say mentioning miss verinders name that mr godfrey ablewhite had been cleared of all suspicion on evidence which i could answer for as entirely beyond dispute  very well said mr murthwaite quietly let us leave it to time to clear the matter up in the meanwhile mr bruff we must get back again to the indians on your account their journey to london simply ended in their becoming the victims of another defeat the loss of their second chance of seizing the diamond is mainly attributable as i think to the cunning and foresight of mr lukerwho doesnt stand at the top of the prosperous and ancient profession of usury for nothing by the prompt dismissal of the man in his employment he deprived the indians of the assistance which their confederate would have rendered them in getting into the house by the prompt transport of the moonstone to his bankers he took the conspirators by surprise before they were prepared with a new plan for robbing him how the indians in this latter case suspected what he had done and how they contrived to possess themselves of his bankers receipt are events too recent to need dwelling on let it be enough to say that they know the moonstone to be once more out of their reach deposited under the general description of a valuable of great price in a bankers strong room now mr bruff what is their third chance of seizing the diamond and when will it come  as the question passed his lips i penetrated the motive of the indians visit to my office at last  i see it i exclaimed the indians take it for granted as we do that the moonstone has been pledged and they want to be certainly informed of the earliest period at which the pledge can be redeemedbecause that will be the earliest period at which the diamond can be removed from the safe keeping of the bank  i told you you would find it out for yourself mr bruff if i only gave you a fair chance in a year from the time when the moonstone was pledged the indians will be on the watch for their third chance mr lukers own lips have told them how long they will have to wait and your respectable authority has satisfied them that mr luker has spoken the truth when do we suppose at a rough guess that the diamond found its way into the moneylenders hands  towards the end of last june i answered as well as i can reckon it  and we are now in the year fortyeight very good if the unknown person who has pledged the moonstone can redeem it in a year the jewel will be in that persons possession again at the end of june fortynine i shall be thousands of miles from england and english news at that date but it may be worth your while to take a note of it and to arrange to be in london at the time  you think something serious will happen i said  i think i shall be safer he answered among the fiercest fanatics of central asia than i should be if i crossed the door of the bank with the moonstone in my pocket the indians have been defeated twice running mr bruff its my firm belief that they wont be defeated a third time  those were the last words he said on the subject the coffee came in the guests rose and dispersed themselves about the room and we joined the ladies of the dinnerparty upstairs  i made a note of the date and it may not be amiss if i close my narrative by repeating that note here  june fortynine expect news of the indians towards the end of the month  and that done i hand the pen which i have now no further claim to use to the writer who follows me next     third narrative  contributed by franklin blake    chapter i   in the spring of the year eighteen hundred and fortynine i was wandering in the east and had then recently altered the travelling plans which i had laid out some months before and which i had communicated to my lawyer and my banker in london  this change made it necessary for me to send one of my servants to obtain my letters and remittances from the english consul in a certain city which was no longer included as one of my restingplaces in my new travelling scheme the man was to join me again at an appointed place and time an accident for which he was not responsible delayed him on his errand for a week i and my people waited encamped on the borders of a desert at the end of that time the missing man made his appearance with the money and the letters at the entrance of my tent  i am afraid i bring you bad news sir he said and pointed to one of the letters which had a mourning border round it and the address on which was in the handwriting of mr bruff  i know nothing in a case of this kind so unendurable as suspense the letter with the mourning border was the letter that i opened first  it informed me that my father was dead and that i was heir to his great fortune the wealth which had thus fallen into my hands brought its responsibilities with it and mr bruff entreated me to lose no time in returning to england  by daybreak the next morning i was on my way back to my own country  the picture presented of me by my old friend betteredge at the time of my departure from england is as i think a little overdrawn he has in his own quaint way interpreted seriously one of his young mistresss many satirical references to my foreign education and has persuaded himself that he actually saw those french german and italian sides to my character which my lively cousin only professed to discover in jest and which never had any real existence except in our good betteredges own brain but barring this drawback i am bound to own that he has stated no more than the truth in representing me as wounded to the heart by rachels treatment and as leaving england in the first keenness of suffering caused by the bitterest disappointment of my life  i went abroad resolvedif change and absence could help meto forget her it is i am persuaded no true view of human nature which denies that change and absence do help a man under these circumstances they force his attention away from the exclusive contemplation of his own sorrow i never forgot her but the pang of remembrance lost its worst bitterness little by little as time distance and novelty interposed themselves more and more effectually between rachel and me  on the other hand it is no less certain that with the act of turning homeward the remedy which had gained its ground so steadily began now just as steadily to drop back the nearer i drew to the country which she inhabited and to the prospect of seeing her again the more irresistibly her influence began to recover its hold on me on leaving england she was the last person in the world whose name i would have suffered to pass my lips on returning to england she was the first person i inquired after when mr bruff and i met again  i was informed of course of all that had happened in my absence in other words of all that has been related here in continuation of betteredges narrativeone circumstance only being excepted mr bruff did not at that time feel himself at liberty to inform me of the motives which had privately influenced rachel and godfrey ablewhite in recalling the marriage promise on either side i troubled him with no embarrassing questions on this delicate subject it was relief enough to me after the jealous disappointment caused by hearing that she had ever contemplated being godfreys wife to know that reflection had convinced her of acting rashly and that she had effected her own release from her marriage engagement  having heard the story of the past my next inquiries still inquiries after rachel advanced naturally to the present time under whose care had she been placed after leaving mr bruffs house and where was she living now  she was living under the care of a widowed sister of the late sir john verinderone mrs merridewwhom her mothers executors had requested to act as guardian and who had accepted the proposal they were reported to me as getting on together admirably well and as being now established for the season in mrs merridews house in portland place  half an hour after receiving this information i was on my way to portland placewithout having had the courage to own it to mr bruff  the man who answered the door was not sure whether miss verinder was at home or not i sent him upstairs with my card as the speediest way of setting the question at rest the man came down again with an impenetrable face and informed me that miss verinder was out  i might have suspected other people of purposely denying themselves to me but it was impossible to suspect rachel i left word that i would call again at six oclock that evening  at six oclock i was informed for the second time that miss verinder was not at home had any message been left for me no message had been left for me had miss verinder not received my card the servant begged my pardonmiss verinder had received it  the inference was too plain to be resisted rachel declined to see me  on my side i declined to be treated in this way without making an attempt at least to discover a reason for it i sent up my name to mrs merridew and requested her to favour me with a personal interview at any hour which it might be most convenient to her to name  mrs merridew made no difficulty about receiving me at once i was shown into a comfortable little sittingroom and found myself in the presence of a comfortable little elderly lady she was so good as to feel great regret and much surprise entirely on my account she was at the same time however not in a position to offer me any explanation or to press rachel on a matter which appeared to relate to a question of private feeling alone this was said over and over again with a polite patience that nothing could tire and this was all i gained by applying to mrs merridew  my last chance was to write to rachel my servant took a letter to her the next day with strict instructions to wait for an answer  the answer came back literally in one sentence  miss verinder begs to decline entering into any correspondence with mr franklin blake  fond as i was of her i felt indignantly the insult offered to me in that reply mr bruff came in to speak to me on business before i had recovered possession of myself i dismissed the business on the spot and laid the whole case before him he proved to be as incapable of enlightening me as mrs merridew herself i asked him if any slander had been spoken of me in rachels hearing mr bruff was not aware of any slander of which i was the object had she referred to me in any way while she was staying under mr bruffs roof never had she not so much as asked during all my long absence whether i was living or dead no such question had ever passed her lips i took out of my pocketbook the letter which poor lady verinder had written to me from frizinghall on the day when i left her house in yorkshire and i pointed mr bruffs attention to these two sentences in it  the valuable assistance which you rendered to the inquiry after the lost jewel is still an unpardoned offence in the present dreadful state of rachels mind moving blindfold in this matter you have added to the burden of anxiety which she has had to bear by innocently threatening her secret with discovery through your exertions  is it possible i asked that the feeling towards me which is there described is as bitter as ever against me now  mr bruff looked unaffectedly distressed  if you insist on an answer he said i own i can place no other interpretation on her conduct than that  i rang the bell and directed my servant to pack my portmanteau and to send out for a railway guide mr bruff asked in astonishment what i was going to do  i am going to yorkshire i answered by the next train  may i ask for what purpose  mr bruff the assistance i innocently rendered to the inquiry after the diamond was an unpardoned offence in rachels mind nearly a year since and it remains an unpardoned offence still i wont accept that position i am determined to find out the secret of her silence towards her mother and her enmity towards me if time pains and money can do it i will lay my hand on the thief who took the moonstone  the worthy old gentleman attempted to remonstrateto induce me to listen to reasonto do his duty towards me in short i was deaf to everything that he could urge no earthly consideration would at that moment have shaken the resolution that was in me  i shall take up the inquiry again i went on at the point where i dropped it and i shall follow it onwards step by step till i come to the present time there are missing links in the evidence as i left it which gabriel betteredge can supply and to gabriel betteredge i go  towards sunset that evening i stood again on the wellremembered terrace and looked once more at the peaceful old country house the gardener was the first person whom i saw in the deserted grounds he had left betteredge an hour since sunning himself in the customary corner of the back yard i knew it well and i said i would go and seek him myself  i walked round by the familiar paths and passages and looked in at the open gate of the yard  there he wasthe dear old friend of the happy days that were never to come againthere he was in the old corner on the old beehive chair with his pipe in his mouth and his robinson crusoe on his lap and his two friends the dogs dozing on either side of him in the position in which i stood my shadow was projected in front of me by the last slanting rays of the sun either the dogs saw it or their keen scent informed them of my approach they started up with a growl starting in his turn the old man quieted them by a word and then shaded his failing eyes with his hand and looked inquiringly at the figure at the gate  my own eyes were full of tears i was obliged to wait a moment before i could trust myself to speak to him    chapter ii   betteredge i said pointing to the wellremembered book on his knee has robinson crusoe informed you this evening that you might expect to see franklin blake  by the lord harry mr franklin cried the old man thats exactly what robinson crusoe has done  he struggled to his feet with my assistance and stood for a moment looking backwards and forwards between robinson crusoe and me apparently at a loss to discover which of us had surprised him most the verdict ended in favour of the book holding it open before him in both hands he surveyed the wonderful volume with a stare of unutterable anticipationas if he expected to see robinson crusoe himself walk out of the pages and favour us with a personal interview  heres the bit mr franklin he said as soon as he had recovered the use of his speech as i live by bread sir heres the bit i was reading the moment before you came in page one hundred and fiftysix as followsi stood like one thunderstruck or as if i had seen an apparition if that isnt as much as to say expect the sudden appearance of mr franklin blaketheres no meaning in the english language said betteredge closing the book with a bang and getting one of his hands free at last to take the hand which i offered him  i had expected him naturally enough under the circumstances to overwhelm me with questions but nothe hospitable impulse was the uppermost impulse in the old servants mind when a member of the family appeared no matter how as a visitor at the house  walk in mr franklin he said opening the door behind him with his quaint oldfashioned bow ill ask what brings you here afterwardsi must make you comfortable first there have been sad changes since you went away the house is shut up and the servants are gone never mind that ill cook your dinner and the gardeners wife will make your bedand if theres a bottle of our famous latour claret left in the cellar down your throat mr franklin that bottle shall go i bid you welcome sir i bid you heartily welcome said the poor old fellow fighting manfully against the gloom of the deserted house and receiving me with the sociable and courteous attention of the bygone time  it vexed me to disappoint him but the house was rachels house now could i eat in it or sleep in it after what had happened in london the commonest sense of selfrespect forbade meproperly forbade meto cross the threshold  i took betteredge by the arm and led him out into the garden there was no help for it i was obliged to tell him the truth between his attachment to rachel and his attachment to me he was sorely puzzled and distressed at the turn things had taken his opinion when he expressed it was given in his usual downright manner and was agreeably redolent of the most positive philosophy i knowthe philosophy of the betteredge school  miss rachel has her faultsive never denied it he began and riding the high horse now and then is one of them she has been trying to ride over youand you have put up with it lord mr franklin dont you know women by this time better than that you have heard me talk of the late mrs betteredge  i had heard him talk of the late mrs betteredge pretty ofteninvariably producing her as his one undeniable example of the inbred frailty and perversity of the other sex in that capacity he exhibited her now  very well mr franklin now listen to me different women have different ways of riding the high horse the late mrs betteredge took her exercise on that favourite female animal whenever i happened to deny her anything that she had set her heart on so sure as i came home from my work on these occasions so sure was my wife to call to me up the kitchen stairs and to say that after my brutal treatment of her she hadnt the heart to cook me my dinner i put up with it for some timejust as you are putting up with it now from miss rachel at last my patience wore out i went downstairs and i took mrs betteredgeaffectionately you understandup in my arms and carried her holusbolus into the best parlour where she received her company i said thats the right place for you my dear and so went back to the kitchen i locked myself in and took off my coat and turned up my shirtsleeves and cooked my own dinner when it was done i served it up in my best manner and enjoyed it most heartily i had my pipe and my drop of grog afterwards and then i cleared the table and washed the crockery and cleaned the knives and forks and put the things away and swept up the hearth when things were as bright and clean again as bright and clean could be i opened the door and let mrs betteredge in ive had my dinner my dear i said and i hope you will find that i have left the kitchen all that your fondest wishes can desire for the rest of that womans life mr franklin i never had to cook my dinner again moral you have put up with miss rachel in london dont put up with her in yorkshire come back to the house  quite unanswerable i could only assure my good friend that even his powers of persuasion were in this case thrown away on me  its a lovely evening i said i shall walk to frizinghall and stay at the hotel and you must come tomorrow morning and breakfast with me i have something to say to you  betteredge shook his head gravely  i am heartily sorry for this he said i had hoped mr franklin to hear that things were all smooth and pleasant again between you and miss rachel if you must have your own way sir he continued after a moments reflection there is no need to go to frizinghall tonight for a bed its to be had nearer than that theres hotherstones farm barely two miles from here you can hardly object to that on miss rachels account the old man added slily hotherstone lives mr franklin on his own freehold  i remembered the place the moment betteredge mentioned it the farmhouse stood in a sheltered inland valley on the banks of the prettiest stream in that part of yorkshire and the farmer had a spare bedroom and parlour which he was accustomed to let to artists anglers and tourists in general a more agreeable place of abode during my stay in the neighbourhood i could not have wished to find  are the rooms to let i inquired  mrs hotherstone herself sir asked for my good word to recommend the rooms yesterday  ill take them betteredge with the greatest pleasure  we went back to the yard in which i had left my travellingbag after putting a stick through the handle and swinging the bag over his shoulder betteredge appeared to relapse into the bewilderment which my sudden appearance had caused when i surprised him in the beehive chair he looked incredulously at the house and then he wheeled about and looked more incredulously still at me  ive lived a goodish long time in the world said this best and dearest of all old servantsbut the like of this i never did expect to see there stands the house and here stands mr franklin blakeand damme if one of them isnt turning his back on the other and going to sleep in a lodging  he led the way out wagging his head and growling ominously theres only one more miracle that can happen he said to me over his shoulder the next thing youll do mr franklin will be to pay me back that sevenandsixpence you borrowed of me when you were a boy  this stroke of sarcasm put him in a better humour with himself and with me we left the house and passed through the lodge gates once clear of the grounds the duties of hospitality in betteredges code of morals ceased and the privileges of curiosity began  he dropped back so as to let me get on a level with him fine evening for a walk mr franklin he said as if we had just accidentally encountered each other at that moment supposing you had gone to the hotel at frizinghall sir  yes  i should have had the honour of breakfasting with you tomorrow morning  come and breakfast with me at hotherstones farm instead  much obliged to you for your kindness mr franklin but it wasnt exactly breakfast that i was driving at i think you mentioned that you had something to say to me if its no secret sir said betteredge suddenly abandoning the crooked way and taking the straight one im burning to know whats brought you down here if you please in this sudden way  what brought me here before i asked  the moonstone mr franklin but what brings you now sir  the moonstone again betteredge  the old man suddenly stood still and looked at me in the grey twilight as if he suspected his own ears of deceiving him  if thats a joke sir he said im afraid im getting a little dull in my old age i dont take it  its no joke i answered i have come here to take up the inquiry which was dropped when i left england i have come here to do what nobody has done yetto find out who took the diamond  let the diamond be mr franklin take my advice and let the diamond be that cursed indian jewel has misguided everybody who has come near it dont waste your money and your temperin the fine spring time of your life sirby meddling with the moonstone how can you hope to succeed saving your presence when sergeant cuff himself made a mess of it sergeant cuff repeated betteredge shaking his forefinger at me sternly the greatest policeman in england  my mind is made up my old friend even sergeant cuff doesnt daunt me bythebye i may want to speak to him sooner or later have you heard anything of him lately  the sergeant wont help you mr franklin  why not  there has been an event sir in the policecircles since you went away the great cuff has retired from business he has got a little cottage at dorking and hes up to his eyes in the growing of roses i have it in his own handwriting mr franklin he has grown the white moss rose without budding it on the dogrose first and mr begbie the gardener is to go to dorking and own that the sergeant has beaten him at last  it doesnt much matter i said i must do without sergeant cuffs help and i must trust to you at starting  it is likely enough that i spoke rather carelessly  at any rate betteredge seemed to be piqued by something in the reply which i had just made to him you might trust to worse than me mr franklini can tell you that he said a little sharply  the tone in which he retorted and a certain disturbance after he had spoken which i detected in his manner suggested to me that he was possessed of some information which he hesitated to communicate  i expect you to help me i said in picking up the fragments of evidence which sergeant cuff has left behind him i know you can do that can you do no more  what more can you expect from me sir asked betteredge with an appearance of the utmost humility  i expect morefrom what you said just now  mere boasting mr franklin returned the old man obstinately some people are born boasters and they never get over it to their dying day im one of them  there was only one way to take with him i appealed to his interest in rachel and his interest in me  betteredge would you be glad to hear that rachel and i were good friends again  i have served your family sir to mighty little purpose if you doubt it  do you remember how rachel treated me before i left england  as well as if it was yesterday my lady herself wrote you a letter about it and you were so good as to show the letter to me it said that miss rachel was mortally offended with you for the part you had taken in trying to recover her jewel and neither my lady nor you nor anybody else could guess why  quite true betteredge and i come back from my travels and find her mortally offended with me still i knew that the diamond was at the bottom of it last year and i know that the diamond is at the bottom of it now i have tried to speak to her and she wont see me i have tried to write to her and she wont answer me how in heavens name am i to clear the matter up the chance of searching into the loss of the moonstone is the one chance of inquiry that rachel herself has left me  those words evidently put the case before him as he had not seen it yet he asked a question which satisfied me that i had shaken him  there is no illfeeling in this mr franklin on your sideis there  there was some anger i answered when i left london but that is all worn out now i want to make rachel come to an understanding with meand i want nothing more  you dont feel any fear sirsupposing you make any discoveriesin regard to what you may find out about miss rachel  i understood the jealous belief in his young mistress which prompted those words  i am as certain of her as you are i answered the fullest disclosure of her secret will reveal nothing that can alter her place in your estimation or in mine  betteredges lastleft scruples vanished at that  if i am doing wrong to help you mr franklin he exclaimed all i can say isi am as innocent of seeing it as the babe unborn i can put you on the road to discovery if you can only go on by yourself you remember that poor girl of oursrosanna spearman  of course  you always thought she had some sort of confession in regard to this matter of the moonstone which she wanted to make to you  i certainly couldnt account for her strange conduct in any other way  you may set that doubt at rest mr franklin whenever you please  it was my turn to come to a standstill now i tried vainly in the gathering darkness to see his face in the surprise of the moment i asked a little impatiently what he meant  steady sir proceeded betteredge i mean what i say rosanna spearman left a sealed letter behind hera letter addressed to you  where is it  in the possession of a friend of hers at cobbs hole you must have heard tell when you were here last sir of limping lucya lame girl with a crutch  the fishermans daughter  the same mr franklin  why wasnt the letter forwarded to me  limping lucy has a will of her own sir she wouldnt give it into any hands but yours and you had left england before i could write to you  lets go back betteredge and get it at once  too late sir tonight theyre great savers of candles along our coast and they go to bed early at cobbs hole  nonsense we might get there in half an hour  you might sir and when you did get there you would find the door locked he pointed to a light glimmering below us and at the same moment i heard through the stillness of the evening the bubbling of a stream theres the farm mr franklin make yourself comfortable for tonight and come to me tomorrow morning if youll be so kind  you will go with me to the fishermans cottage  yes sir  early  as early mr franklin as you like  we descended the path that led to the farm    chapter iii   i have only the most indistinct recollection of what happened at hotherstones farm  i remember a hearty welcome a prodigious supper which would have fed a whole village in the east a delightfully clean bedroom with nothing in it to regret but that detestable product of the folly of our forefathersa featherbed a restless night with much kindling of matches and many lightings of one little candle and an immense sensation of relief when the sun rose and there was a prospect of getting up  it had been arranged overnight with betteredge that i was to call for him on our way to cobbs hole as early as i likedwhich interpreted by my impatience to get possession of the letter meant as early as i could without waiting for breakfast at the farm i took a crust of bread in my hand and set forth in some doubt whether i should not surprise the excellent betteredge in his bed to my great relief he proved to be quite as excited about the coming event as i was i found him ready and waiting for me with his stick in his hand  how are you this morning betteredge  very poorly sir  sorry to hear it what do you complain of  i complain of a new disease mr franklin of my own inventing i dont want to alarm you but youre certain to catch it before the morning is out  the devil i am  do you feel an uncomfortable heat at the pit of your stomach sir and a nasty thumping at the top of your head ah not yet it will lay hold of you at cobbs hole mr franklin i call it the detectivefever and i first caught it in the company of sergeant cuff  aye aye and the cure in this instance is to open rosanna spearmans letter i suppose come along and lets get it  early as it was we found the fishermans wife astir in her kitchen on my presentation by betteredge good mrs yolland performed a social ceremony strictly reserved as i afterwards learnt for strangers of distinction she put a bottle of dutch gin and a couple of clean pipes on the table and opened the conversation by saying what news from london sir  before i could find an answer to this immensely comprehensive question an apparition advanced towards me out of a dark corner of the kitchen a wan wild haggard girl with remarkably beautiful hair and with a fierce keenness in her eyes came limping up on a crutch to the table at which i was sitting and looked at me as if i was an object of mingled interest and horror which it quite fascinated her to see  mr betteredge she said without taking her eyes off me mention his name again if you please  this gentlemans name answered betteredge with a strong emphasis on gentleman is mr franklin blake  the girl turned her back on me and suddenly left the room good mrs yollandas i believemade some apologies for her daughters odd behaviour and betteredge probably translated them into polite english i speak of this in complete uncertainty my attention was absorbed in following the sound of the girls crutch thumpthump up the wooden stairs thumpthump across the room above our heads thumpthump down the stairs againand there stood the apparition at the open door with a letter in its hand beckoning me out  i left more apologies in course of delivery behind me and followed this strange creaturelimping on before me faster and fasterdown the slope of the beach she led me behind some boats out of sight and hearing of the few people in the fishingvillage and then stopped and faced me for the first time  stand there she said i want to look at you  there was no mistaking the expression on her face i inspired her with the strongest emotions of abhorrence and disgust let me not be vain enough to say that no woman had ever looked at me in this manner before i will only venture on the more modest assertion that no woman had ever let me perceive it yet there is a limit to the length of the inspection which a man can endure under certain circumstances i attempted to direct limping lucys attention to some less revolting object than my face  i think you have got a letter to give me i began is it the letter there in your hand  say that again was the only answer i received  i repeated the words like a good child learning its lesson  no said the girl speaking to herself but keeping her eyes still mercilessly fixed on me i cant find out what she saw in his face i cant guess what she heard in his voice she suddenly looked away from me and rested her head wearily on the top of her crutch oh my poor dear she said in the first soft tones which had fallen from her in my hearing oh my lost darling what could you see in this man she lifted her head again fiercely and looked at me once more can you eat and drink she asked  i did my best to preserve my gravity and answered yes  can you sleep  yes  when you see a poor girl in service do you feel no remorse  certainly not why should i  she abruptly thrust the letter as the phrase is into my face  take it she exclaimed furiously i never set eyes on you before god almighty forbid i should ever set eyes on you again  with those parting words she limped away from me at the top of her speed the one interpretation that i could put on her conduct has no doubt been anticipated by everybody i could only suppose that she was mad  having reached that inevitable conclusion i turned to the more interesting object of investigation which was presented to me by rosanna spearmans letter the address was written as followsfor franklin blake esq to be given into his own hands and not to be trusted to any one else by lucy yolland  i broke the seal the envelope contained a letter and this in its turn contained a slip of paper i read the letter first  sirif you are curious to know the meaning of my behaviour to you whilst you were staying in the house of my mistress lady verinder do what you are told to do in the memorandum enclosed with thisand do it without any person being present to overlook you your humble servant  rosanna spearman  i turned to the slip of paper next here is the literal copy of it word for word  memorandumto go to the shivering sand at the turn of the tide to walk out on the south spit until i get the south spit beacon and the flagstaff at the coastguard station above cobbs hole in a line together to lay down on the rocks a stick or any straight thing to guide my hand exactly in the line of the beacon and the flagstaff to take care in doing this that one end of the stick shall be at the edge of the rocks on the side of them which overlooks the quicksand to feel along the stick among the seaweed beginning from the end of the stick which points towards the beacon for the chain to run my hand along the chain when found until i come to the part of it which stretches over the edge of the rocks down into the quicksand and then to pull the chain  just as i had read the last wordsunderlined in the originali heard the voice of betteredge behind me the inventor of the detectivefever had completely succumbed to that irresistible malady i cant stand it any longer mr franklin what does her letter say for mercys sake sir tell us what does her letter say  i handed him the letter and the memorandum he read the first without appearing to be much interested in it but the secondthe memorandumproduced a strong impression on him  the sergeant said it cried betteredge from first to last sir the sergeant said she had got a memorandum of the hidingplace and here it is lord save us mr franklin here is the secret that puzzled everybody from the great cuff downwards ready and waiting as one may say to show itself to you its the ebb now sir as anybody may see for themselves how long will it be till the turn of the tide he looked up and observed a lad at work at some little distance from us mending a net tammie bright he shouted at the top of his voice  i hear you tammie shouted back  whens the turn of the tide  in an hours time  we both looked at our watches  we can go round by the coast mr franklin said betteredge and get to the quicksand in that way with plenty of time to spare what do you say sir  come along  on our way to the shivering sand i applied to betteredge to revive my memory of events as affecting rosanna spearman at the period of sergeant cuffs inquiry with my old friends help i soon had the succession of circumstances clearly registered in my mind rosannas journey to frizinghall when the whole household believed her to be ill in her own roomrosannas mysterious employment of the nighttime with her door locked and her candle burning till the morningrosannas suspicious purchase of the japanned tin case and the two dogs chains from mrs yollandthe sergeants positive conviction that rosanna had hidden something at the shivering sand and the sergeants absolute ignorance as to what that something might beall these strange results of the abortive inquiry into the loss of the moonstone were clearly present to me again when we reached the quicksand and walked out together on the low ledge of rocks called the south spit  with betteredges help i soon stood in the right position to see the beacon and the coastguard flagstaff in a line together following the memorandum as our guide we next laid my stick in the necessary direction as neatly as we could on the uneven surface of the rocks and then we looked at our watches once more  it wanted nearly twenty minutes yet of the turn of the tide i suggested waiting through this interval on the beach instead of on the wet and slippery surface of the rocks having reached the dry sand i prepared to sit down and greatly to my surprise betteredge prepared to leave me  what are you going away for i asked  look at the letter again sir and you will see  a glance at the letter reminded me that i was charged when i made my discovery to make it alone  its hard enough for me to leave you at such a time as this said betteredge but she died a dreadful death poor souland i feel a kind of call on me mr franklin to humour that fancy of hers besides he added confidentially theres nothing in the letter against your letting out the secret afterwards ill hang about in the fir plantation and wait till you pick me up dont be longer than you can help sir the detectivefever isnt an easy disease to deal with under these circumstances  with that parting caution he left me  the interval of expectation short as it was when reckoned by the measure of time assumed formidable proportions when reckoned by the measure of suspense this was one of the occasions on which the invaluable habit of smoking becomes especially precious and consolatory i lit a cigar and sat down on the slope of the beach  the sunlight poured its unclouded beauty on every object that i could see the exquisite freshness of the air made the mere act of living and breathing a luxury even the lonely little bay welcomed the morning with a show of cheerfulness and the bared wet surface of the quicksand itself glittering with a golden brightness hid the horror of its false brown face under a passing smile it was the finest day i had seen since my return to england  the turn of the tide came before my cigar was finished i saw the preliminary heaving of the sand and then the awful shiver that crept over its surfaceas if some spirit of terror lived and moved and shuddered in the fathomless deeps beneath i threw away my cigar and went back again to the rocks  my directions in the memorandum instructed me to feel along the line traced by the stick beginning with the end which was nearest to the beacon  i advanced in this manner more than half way along the stick without encountering anything but the edges of the rocks an inch or two further on however my patience was rewarded in a narrow little fissure just within reach of my forefinger i felt the chain attempting next to follow it by touch in the direction of the quicksand i found my progress stopped by a thick growth of seaweedwhich had fastened itself into the fissure no doubt in the time that had elapsed since rosanna spearman had chosen her hidingplace  it was equally impossible to pull up the seaweed or to force my hand through it after marking the spot indicated by the end of the stick which was placed nearest to the quicksand i determined to pursue the search for the chain on a plan of my own my idea was to sound immediately under the rocks on the chance of recovering the lost trace of the chain at the point at which it entered the sand i took up the stick and knelt down on the brink of the south spit  in this position my face was within a few feet of the surface of the quicksand the sight of it so near me still disturbed at intervals by its hideous shivering fit shook my nerves for the moment a horrible fancy that the dead woman might appear on the scene of her suicide to assist my searchan unutterable dread of seeing her rise through the heaving surface of the sand and point to the placeforced itself into my mind and turned me cold in the warm sunlight i own i closed my eyes at the moment when the point of the stick first entered the quicksand  the instant afterwards before the stick could have been submerged more than a few inches i was free from the hold of my own superstitious terror and was throbbing with excitement from head to foot sounding blindfold at my first attemptat that first attempt i had sounded right the stick struck the chain  taking a firm hold of the roots of the seaweed with my left hand i laid myself down over the brink and felt with my right hand under the overhanging edges of the rock my right hand found the chain  i drew it up without the slightest difficulty and there was the japanned tin case fastened to the end of it  the action of the water had so rusted the chain that it was impossible for me to unfasten it from the hasp which attached it to the case putting the case between my knees and exerting my utmost strength i contrived to draw off the cover some white substance filled the whole interior when i looked in i put in my hand and found it to be linen  in drawing out the linen i also drew out a letter crumpled up with it after looking at the direction and discovering that it bore my name i put the letter in my pocket and completely removed the linen it came out in a thick roll moulded of course to the shape of the case in which it had been so long confined and perfectly preserved from any injury by the sea  i carried the linen to the dry sand of the beach and there unrolled and smoothed it out there was no mistaking it as an article of dress it was a nightgown  the uppermost side when i spread it out presented to view innumerable folds and creases and nothing more i tried the undermost side nextand instantly discovered the smear of the paint from the door of rachels boudoir  my eyes remained riveted on the stain and my mind took me back at a leap from present to past the very words of sergeant cuff recurred to me as if the man himself was at my side again pointing to the unanswerable inference which he drew from the smear on the door  find out whether there is any article of dress in this house with the stain of paint on it find out who that dress belongs to find out how the person can account for having been in the room and smeared the paint between midnight and three in the morning if the person cant satisfy you you havent far to look for the hand that took the diamond  one after another those words travelled over my memory repeating themselves again and again with a wearisome mechanical reiteration i was roused from what felt like a trance of many hoursfrom what was really no doubt the pause of a few moments onlyby a voice calling to me i looked up and saw that betteredges patience had failed him at last he was just visible between the sandhills returning to the beach  the old mans appearance recalled me the moment i perceived it to my sense of present things and reminded me that the inquiry which i had pursued thus far still remained incomplete i had discovered the smear on the nightgown to whom did the nightgown belong  my first impulse was to consult the letter in my pocketthe letter which i had found in the case  as i raised my hand to take it out i remembered that there was a shorter way to discovery than this the nightgown itself would reveal the truth for in all probability the nightgown was marked with its owners name  i took it up from the sand and looked for the mark  i found the mark and readmy own name  there were the familiar letters which told me that the nightgown was mine i looked up from them there was the sun there were the glittering waters of the bay there was old betteredge advancing nearer and nearer to me i looked back again at the letters my own name plainly confronting memy own name  if time pains and money can do it i will lay my hand on the thief who took the moonstonei had left london with those words on my lips i had penetrated the secret which the quicksand had kept from every other living creature and on the unanswerable evidence of the paintstain i had discovered myself as the thief    chapter iv   i have not a word to say about my own sensations  my impression is that the shock inflicted on me completely suspended my thinking and feeling power i certainly could not have known what i was about when betteredge joined mefor i have it on his authority that i laughed when he asked what was the matter and putting the nightgown into his hands told him to read the riddle for himself  of what was said between us on the beach i have not the faintest recollection the first place in which i can now see myself again plainly is the plantation of firs betteredge and i are walking back together to the house and betteredge is telling me that i shall be able to face it and he will be able to face it when we have had a glass of grog    the scene shifts from the plantation to betteredges little sittingroom my resolution not to enter rachels house is forgotten i feel gratefully the coolness and shadiness and quiet of the room i drink the grog a perfectly new luxury to me at that time of day which my good old friend mixes with icycold water from the well under any other circumstances the drink would simply stupefy me as things are it strings up my nerves i begin to face it as betteredge has predicted and betteredge on his side begins to face it too  the picture which i am now presenting of myself will i suspect be thought a very strange one to say the least of it placed in a situation which may i think be described as entirely without parallel what is the first proceeding to which i resort do i seclude myself from all human society do i set my mind to analyse the abominable impossibility which nevertheless confronts me as an undeniable fact do i hurry back to london by the first train to consult the highest authorities and to set a searching inquiry on foot immediately no i accept the shelter of a house which i had resolved never to degrade myself by entering again and i sit tippling spirits and water in the company of an old servant at ten oclock in the morning is this the conduct that might have been expected from a man placed in my horrible position i can only answer that the sight of old betteredges familiar face was an inexpressible comfort to me and that the drinking of old betteredges grog helped me as i believe nothing else would have helped me in the state of complete bodily and mental prostration into which i had fallen i can only offer this excuse for myself and i can only admire that invariable preservation of dignity and that strictly logical consistency of conduct which distinguish every man and woman who may read these lines in every emergency of their lives from the cradle to the grave  now mr franklin theres one thing certain at any rate said betteredge throwing the nightgown down on the table between us and pointing to it as if it was a living creature that could hear him hes a liar to begin with  this comforting view of the matter was not the view that presented itself to my mind  i am as innocent of all knowledge of having taken the diamond as you are i said but there is the witness against me the paint on the nightgown and the name on the nightgown are facts  betteredge lifted my glass and put it persuasively into my hand  facts he repeated take a drop more grog mr franklin and youll get over the weakness of believing in facts foul play sir he continued dropping his voice confidentially that is how i read the riddle foul play somewhereand you and i must find it out was there nothing else in the tin case when you put your hand into it  the question instantly reminded me of the letter in my pocket i took it out and opened it it was a letter of many pages closely written i looked impatiently for the signature at the end rosanna spearman  as i read the name a sudden remembrance illuminated my mind and a sudden suspicion rose out of the new light  stop i exclaimed rosanna spearman came to my aunt out of a reformatory rosanna spearman had once been a thief  theres no denying that mr franklin what of it now if you please  what of it now how do we know she may not have stolen the diamond after all how do we know she may not have smeared my nightgown purposely with the paint  betteredge laid his hand on my arm and stopped me before i could say any more  you will be cleared of this mr franklin beyond all doubt but i hope you wont be cleared in that way see what the letter says sir in justice to the girls memory see what it says  i felt the earnestness with which he spokefelt it as a friendly rebuke to me you shall form your own judgment on her letter i said i will read it out  i beganand read these lines  siri have something to own to you a confession which means much misery may sometimes be made in very few words this confession can be made in three words i love you  the letter dropped from my hand i looked at betteredge in the name of heaven i said what does it mean  he seemed to shrink from answering the question  you and limping lucy were alone together this morning sir he said did she say nothing about rosanna spearman  she never even mentioned rosanna spearmans name  please to go back to the letter mr franklin i tell you plainly i cant find it in my heart to distress you after what you have had to bear already let her speak for herself sir and get on with your grog for your own sake get on with your grog  i resumed the reading of the letter  it would be very disgraceful to me to tell you this if i was a living woman when you read it i shall be dead and gone sir when you find my letter it is that which makes me bold not even my grave will be left to tell of me i may own the truthwith the quicksand waiting to hide me when the words are written  besides you will find your nightgown in my hidingplace with the smear of the paint on it and you will want to know how it came to be hidden by me and why i said nothing to you about it in my lifetime i have only one reason to give i did these strange things because i loved you  i wont trouble you with much about myself or my life before you came to my ladys house lady verinder took me out of a reformatory i had gone to the reformatory from the prison i was put in the prison because i was a thief i was a thief because my mother went on the streets when i was quite a little girl my mother went on the streets because the gentleman who was my father deserted her there is no need to tell such a common story as this at any length it is told quite often enough in the newspapers  lady verinder was very kind to me and mr betteredge was very kind to me those two and the matron at the reformatory are the only good people i have ever met with in all my life i might have got on in my placenot happilybut i might have got on if you had not come visiting i dont blame you sir its my faultall my fault  do you remember when you came out on us from among the sand hills that morning looking for mr betteredge you were like a prince in a fairystory you were like a lover in a dream you were the most adorable human creature i had ever seen something that felt like the happy life i had never led yet leapt up in me at the instant i set eyes on you dont laugh at this if you can help it oh if i could only make you feel how serious it is to me  i went back to the house and wrote your name and mine in my workbox and drew a true lovers knot under them then some devilno i ought to say some good angelwhispered to me go and look in the glass the glass told menever mind what i was too foolish to take the warning i went on getting fonder and fonder of you just as if i was a lady in your own rank of life and the most beautiful creature your eyes ever rested on i triedoh dear how i triedto get you to look at me if you had known how i used to cry at night with the misery and the mortification of your never taking any notice of me you would have pitied me perhaps and have given me a look now and then to live on  it would have been no very kind look perhaps if you had known how i hated miss rachel i believe i found out you were in love with her before you knew it yourself she used to give you roses to wear in your buttonhole ah mr franklin you wore my roses oftener than either you or she thought the only comfort i had at that time was putting my rose secretly in your glass of water in place of hersand then throwing her rose away  if she had been really as pretty as you thought her i might have borne it better no i believe i should have been more spiteful against her still suppose you put miss rachel into a servants dress and took her ornaments off i dont know what is the use of my writing in this way it cant be denied that she had a bad figure she was too thin but who can tell what the men like and young ladies may behave in a manner which would cost a servant her place its no business of mine i cant expect you to read my letter if i write it in this way but it does stir one up to hear miss rachel called pretty when one knows all the time that its her dress does it and her confidence in herself  try not to lose patience with me sir i will get on as fast as i can to the time which is sure to interest youthe time when the diamond was lost  but there is one thing which i have got it on my mind to tell you first  my life was not a very hard life to bear while i was a thief it was only when they had taught me at the reformatory to feel my own degradation and to try for better things that the days grew long and weary thoughts of the future forced themselves on me now i felt the dreadful reproach that honest peopleeven the kindest of honest peoplewere to me in themselves a heartbreaking sensation of loneliness kept with me go where i might and do what i might and see what persons i might it was my duty i know to try and get on with my fellowservants in my new place somehow i couldnt make friends with them they looked or i thought they looked as if they suspected what i had been i dont regret far from it having been roused to make the effort to be a reformed womanbut indeed indeed it was a weary life you had come across it like a beam of sunshine at firstand then you too failed me i was mad enough to love you and i couldnt even attract your notice there was great miserythere really was great misery in that  now i am coming to what i wanted to tell you in those days of bitterness i went two or three times when it was my turn to go out to my favourite placethe beach above the shivering sand and i said to myself i think it will end here when i can bear it no longer i think it will end here you will understand sir that the place had laid a kind of spell on me before you came i had always had a notion that something would happen to me at the quicksand but i had never looked at it with the thought of its being the means of my making away with myself till the time came of which i am now writing then i did think that here was a place which would end all my troubles for me in a moment or twoand hide me for ever afterwards  this is all i have to say about myself reckoning from the morning when i first saw you to the morning when the alarm was raised in the house that the diamond was lost  i was so aggravated by the foolish talk among the women servants all wondering who was to be suspected first and i was so angry with you knowing no better at that time for the pains you took in hunting for the jewel and sending for the police that i kept as much as possible away by myself until later in the day when the officer from frizinghall came to the house  mr seegrave began as you may remember by setting a guard on the womens bedrooms and the women all followed him upstairs in a rage to know what he meant by the insult he had put on them i went with the rest because if i had done anything different from the rest mr seegrave was the sort of man who would have suspected me directly we found him in miss rachels room he told us he wouldnt have a lot of women there and he pointed to the smear on the painted door and said some of our petticoats had done the mischief and sent us all downstairs again  after leaving miss rachels room i stopped a moment on one of the landings by myself to see if i had got the paintstain by any chance on my gown penelope betteredge the only one of the women with whom i was on friendly terms passed and noticed what i was about  you neednt trouble yourself rosanna she said the paint on miss rachels door has been dry for hours if mr seegrave hadnt set a watch on our bedrooms i might have told him as much i dont know what you thinki was never so insulted before in my life  penelope was a hottempered girl i quieted her and brought her back to what she had said about the paint on the door having been dry for hours  how do you know that i asked  i was with miss rachel and mr franklin all yesterday morning penelope said mixing the colours while they finished the door i heard miss rachel ask whether the door would be dry that evening in time for the birthday company to see it and mr franklin shook his head and said it wouldnt be dry in less than twelve hours it was long past luncheontimeit was three oclock before they had done what does your arithmetic say rosanna mine says the door was dry by three this morning  did some of the ladies go upstairs yesterday evening to see it i asked i thought i heard miss rachel warning them to keep clear of the door  none of the ladies made the smear penelope answered i left miss rachel in bed at twelve last night and i noticed the door and there was nothing wrong with it then  oughtnt you to mention this to mr seegrave penelope  i wouldnt say a word to help mr seegrave for anything that could be offered to me  she went to her work and i went to mine  my work sir was to make your bed and to put your room tidy it was the happiest hour i had in the whole day i used to kiss the pillow on which your head had rested all night no matter who has done it since you have never had your clothes folded as nicely as i folded them for you of all the little knickknacks in your dressingcase there wasnt one that had so much as a speck on it you never noticed it any more than you noticed me i beg your pardon i am forgetting myself i will make haste and go on again  well i went in that morning to do my work in your room there was your nightgown tossed across the bed just as you had thrown it off i took it up to fold itand i saw the stain of the paint from miss rachels door  i was so startled by the discovery that i ran out with the nightgown in my hand and made for the back stairs and locked myself into my own room to look at it in a place where nobody could intrude and interrupt me  as soon as i got my breath again i called to mind my talk with penelope and i said to myself heres the proof that he was in miss rachels sittingroom between twelve last night and three this morning  i shall not tell you in plain words what was the first suspicion that crossed my mind when i had made that discovery you would only be angryand if you were angry you might tear my letter up and read no more of it  let it be enough if you please to say only this after thinking it over to the best of my ability i made it out that the thing wasnt likely for a reason that i will tell you if you had been in miss rachels sittingroom at that time of night with miss rachels knowledge and if you had been foolish enough to forget to take care of the wet door she would have reminded youshe would never have let you carry away such a witness against her as the witness i was looking at now at the same time i own i was not completely certain in my own mind that i had proved my own suspicion to be wrong you will not have forgotten that i have owned to hating miss rachel try to think if you can that there was a little of that hatred in all this it ended in my determining to keep the nightgown and to wait and watch and see what use i might make of it at that time please to remember not the ghost of an idea entered my head that you had stolen the diamond  there i broke off in the reading of the letter for the second time  i had read those portions of the miserable womans confession which related to myself with unaffected surprise and i can honestly add with sincere distress i had regretted truly regretted the aspersion which i had thoughtlessly cast on her memory before i had seen a line of her letter but when i had advanced as far as the passage which is quoted above i own i felt my mind growing bitterer and bitterer against rosanna spearman as i went on read the rest for yourself i said handing the letter to betteredge across the table if there is anything in it that i must look at you can tell me as you go on  i understand you mr franklin he answered its natural sir in you and god help us all he added in a lower tone its no less natural in her  i proceed to copy the continuation of the letter from the original in my own possession  having determined to keep the nightgown and to see what use my love or my revenge i hardly know which could turn it to in the future the next thing to discover was how to keep it without the risk of being found out  there was only one wayto make another nightgown exactly like it before saturday came and brought the laundrywoman and her inventory to the house  i was afraid to put it off till next day the friday being in doubt lest some accident might happen in the interval i determined to make the new nightgown on that same day the thursday while i could count if i played my cards properly on having my time to myself the first thing to do after locking up your nightgown in my drawer was to go back to your bedroomnot so much to put it to rights penelope would have done that for me if i had asked her as to find out whether you had smeared off any of the paintstain from your nightgown on the bed or on any piece of furniture in the room  i examined everything narrowly and at last i found a few streaks of the paint on the inside of your dressinggownnot the linen dressinggown you usually wore in that summer season but a flannel dressinggown which you had with you also i suppose you felt chilly after walking to and fro in nothing but your nightdress and put on the warmest thing you could find at any rate there were the stains just visible on the inside of the dressinggown i easily got rid of these by scraping away the stuff of the flannel this done the only proof left against you was the proof locked up in my drawer  i had just finished your room when i was sent for to be questioned by mr seegrave along with the rest of the servants next came the examination of all our boxes and then followed the most extraordinary event of the dayto mesince i had found the paint on your nightgown this event came out of the second questioning of penelope betteredge by superintendent seegrave  penelope returned to us quite beside herself with rage at the manner in which mr seegrave had treated her he had hinted beyond the possibility of mistaking him that he suspected her of being the thief we were all equally astonished at hearing this and we all asked why  because the diamond was in miss rachels sittingroom penelope answered and because i was the last person in the sittingroom at night  almost before the words had left her lips i remembered that another person had been in the sittingroom later than penelope that person was yourself my head whirled round and my thoughts were in dreadful confusion in the midst of it all something in my mind whispered to me that the smear on your nightgown might have a meaning entirely different to the meaning which i had given to it up to that time if the last person who was in the room is the person to be suspected i thought to myself the thief is not penelope but mr franklin blake  in the case of any other gentleman i believe i should have been ashamed of suspecting him of theft almost as soon as the suspicion had passed through my mind  but the bare thought that you had let yourself down to my level and that i in possessing myself of your nightgown had also possessed myself of the means of shielding you from being discovered and disgraced for lifei say sir the bare thought of this seemed to open such a chance before me of winning your good will that i passed blindfold as one may say from suspecting to believing i made up my mind on the spot that you had shown yourself the busiest of anybody in fetching the police as a blind to deceive us all and that the hand which had taken miss rachels jewel could by no possibility be any other hand than yours  the excitement of this new discovery of mine must i think have turned my head for a while i felt such a devouring eagerness to see youto try you with a word or two about the diamond and to make you look at me and speak to me in that waythat i put my hair tidy and made myself as nice as i could and went to you boldly in the library where i knew you were writing  you had left one of your rings upstairs which made as good an excuse for my intrusion as i could have desired but oh sir if you have ever loved you will understand how it was that all my courage cooled when i walked into the room and found myself in your presence and then you looked up at me so coldly and you thanked me for finding your ring in such an indifferent manner that my knees trembled under me and i felt as if i should drop on the floor at your feet when you had thanked me you looked back if you remember at your writing i was so mortified at being treated in this way that i plucked up spirit enough to speak i said this is a strange thing about the diamond sir and you looked up again and said yes it is you spoke civilly i cant deny that but still you kept a distancea cruel distance between us believing as i did that you had got the lost diamond hidden about you while you were speaking your coolness so provoked me that i got bold enough in the heat of the moment to give you a hint i said they will never find the diamond sir will they no nor the person who took itill answer for that i nodded and smiled at you as much as to say i know this time you looked up at me with something like interest in your eyes and i felt that a few more words on your side and mine might bring out the truth just at that moment mr betteredge spoilt it all by coming to the door i knew his footstep and i also knew that it was against his rules for me to be in the library at that time of daylet alone being there along with you i had only just time to get out of my own accord before he could come in and tell me to go i was angry and disappointed but i was not entirely without hope for all that the ice you see was broken between usand i thought i would take care on the next occasion that mr betteredge was out of the way  when i got back to the servants hall the bell was going for our dinner afternoon already and the materials for making the new nightgown were still to be got there was but one chance of getting them i shammed ill at dinner and so secured the whole of the interval from then till teatime to my own use  what i was about while the household believed me to be lying down in my own room and how i spent the night after shamming ill again at teatime and having been sent up to bed there is no need to tell you sergeant cuff discovered that much if he discovered nothing more and i can guess how i was detected though i kept my veil down in the drapers shop at frizinghall there was a glass in front of me at the counter where i was buying the longcloth andin that glassi saw one of the shopmen point to my shoulder and whisper to another at night again when i was secretly at work locked into my room i heard the breathing of the women servants who suspected me outside my door  it didnt matter then it doesnt matter now on the friday morning hours before sergeant cuff entered the house there was the new nightgownto make up your number in place of the nightgown that i had gotmade wrung out dried ironed marked and folded as the laundry woman folded all the others safe in your drawer there was no fear if the linen in the house was examined of the newness of the nightgown betraying me all your underclothing had been renewed when you came to our housei suppose on your return home from foreign parts  the next thing was the arrival of sergeant cuff and the next great surprise was the announcement of what he thought about the smear on the door  i had believed you to be guilty as i have owned more because i wanted you to be guilty than for any other reason and now the sergeant had come round by a totally different way to the same conclusion respecting the nightgown as mine and i had got the dress that was the only proof against you and not a living creature knew ityourself included i am afraid to tell you how i felt when i called these things to mindyou would hate my memory for ever afterwards  at that place betteredge looked up from the letter  not a glimmer of light so far mr franklin said the old man taking off his heavy tortoiseshell spectacles and pushing rosanna spearmans confession a little away from him have you come to any conclusion sir in your own mind while i have been reading  finish the letter first betteredge there may be something to enlighten us at the end of it i shall have a word or two to say to you after that  very good sir ill just rest my eyes and then ill go on again in the meantime mr franklini dont want to hurry youbut would you mind telling me in one word whether you see your way out of this dreadful mess yet  i see my way back to london i said to consult mr bruff if he cant help me  yes sir  and if the sergeant wont leave his retirement at dorking  he wont mr franklin  then betteredgeas far as i can see nowi am at the end of my resources after mr bruff and the sergeant i dont know of a living creature who can be of the slightest use to me  as the words passed my lips some person outside knocked at the door of the room  betteredge looked surprised as well as annoyed by the interruption  come in he called out irritably whoever you are  the door opened and there entered to us quietly the most remarkablelooking man that i had ever seen judging him by his figure and his movements he was still young judging him by his face and comparing him with betteredge he looked the elder of the two his complexion was of a gipsy darkness his fleshless cheeks had fallen into deep hollows over which the bone projected like a penthouse his nose presented the fine shape and modelling so often found among the ancient people of the east so seldom visible among the newer races of the west his forehead rose high and straight from the brow his marks and wrinkles were innumerable from this strange face eyes stranger still of the softest browneyes dreamy and mournful and deeply sunk in their orbitslooked out at you and in my case at least took your attention captive at their will add to this a quantity of thick closelycurling hair which by some freak of nature had lost its colour in the most startlingly partial and capricious manner over the top of his head it was still of the deep black which was its natural colour round the sides of his headwithout the slightest gradation of grey to break the force of the extraordinary contrastit had turned completely white the line between the two colours preserved no sort of regularity at one place the white hair ran up into the black at another the black hair ran down into the white i looked at the man with a curiosity which i am ashamed to say i found it quite impossible to control his soft brown eyes looked back at me gently and he met my involuntary rudeness in staring at him with an apology which i was conscious that i had not deserved  i beg your pardon he said i had no idea that mr betteredge was engaged he took a slip of paper from his pocket and handed it to betteredge the list for next week he said his eyes just rested on me againand he left the room as quietly as he had entered it  who is that i asked  mr candys assistant said betteredge bythebye mr franklin you will be sorry to hear that the little doctor has never recovered that illness he caught going home from the birthday dinner hes pretty well in health but he lost his memory in the fever and he has never recovered more than the wreck of it since the work all falls on his assistant not much of it now except among the poor they cant help themselves you know they must put up with the man with the piebald hair and the gipsy complexionor they would get no doctoring at all  you dont seem to like him betteredge  nobody likes him sir  why is he so unpopular  well mr franklin his appearance is against him to begin with and then theres a story that mr candy took him with a very doubtful character nobody knows who he isand he hasnt a friend in the place how can you expect one to like him after that  quite impossible of course may i ask what he wanted with you when he gave you that bit of paper  only to bring me the weekly list of the sick people about here sir who stand in need of a little wine my lady always had a regular distribution of good sound port and sherry among the infirm poor and miss rachel wishes the custom to be kept up times have changed times have changed i remember when mr candy himself brought the list to my mistress now its mr candys assistant who brings the list to me ill go on with the letter if you will allow me sir said betteredge drawing rosanna spearmans confession back to him it isnt lively reading i grant you but there it keeps me from getting sour with thinking of the past he put on his spectacles and wagged his head gloomily theres a bottom of good sense mr franklin in our conduct to our mothers when they first start us on the journey of life we are all of us more or less unwilling to be brought into the world and we are all of us right  mr candys assistant had produced too strong an impression on me to be immediately dismissed from my thoughts i passed over the last unanswerable utterance of the betteredge philosophy and returned to the subject of the man with the piebald hair  what is his name i asked  as ugly a name as need be betteredge answered gruffly ezra jennings    chapter v   having told me the name of mr candys assistant betteredge appeared to think that we had wasted enough of our time on an insignificant subject he resumed the perusal of rosanna spearmans letter  on my side i sat at the window waiting until he had done little by little the impression produced on me by ezra jenningsit seemed perfectly unaccountable in such a situation as mine that any human being should have produced an impression on me at allfaded from my mind my thoughts flowed back into their former channel once more i forced myself to look my own incredible position resolutely in the face once more i reviewed in my own mind the course which i had at last summoned composure enough to plan out for the future  to go back to london that day to put the whole case before mr bruff and last and most important to obtain no matter by what means or at what sacrifice a personal interview with rachelthis was my plan of action so far as i was capable of forming it at the time there was more than an hour still to spare before the train started and there was the bare chance that betteredge might discover something in the unread portion of rosanna spearmans letter which it might be useful for me to know before i left the house in which the diamond had been lost for that chance i was now waiting  the letter ended in these terms  you have no need to be angry mr franklin even if i did feel some little triumph at knowing that i held all your prospects in life in my own hands anxieties and fears soon came back to me with the view sergeant cuff took of the loss of the diamond he would be sure to end in examining our linen and our dresses there was no place in my roomthere was no place in the housewhich i could feel satisfied would be safe from him how to hide the nightgown so that not even the sergeant could find it and how to do that without losing one moment of precious timethese were not easy questions to answer my uncertainties ended in my taking a way that may make you laugh i undressed and put the nightgown on me you had worn itand i had another little moment of pleasure in wearing it after you  the next news that reached us in the servants hall showed that i had not made sure of the nightgown a moment too soon sergeant cuff wanted to see the washingbook  i found it and took it to him in my ladys sittingroom the sergeant and i had come across each other more than once in former days i was certain he would know me againand i was not certain of what he might do when he found me employed as servant in a house in which a valuable jewel had been lost in this suspense i felt it would be a relief to me to get the meeting between us over and to know the worst of it at once  he looked at me as if i was a stranger when i handed him the washingbook and he was very specially polite in thanking me for bringing it i thought those were both bad signs there was no knowing what he might say of me behind my back there was no knowing how soon i might not find myself taken in custody on suspicion and searched it was then time for your return from seeing mr godfrey ablewhite off by the railway and i went to your favourite walk in the shrubbery to try for another chance of speaking to youthe last chance for all i knew to the contrary that i might have  you never appeared and what was worse still mr betteredge and sergeant cuff passed by the place where i was hidingand the sergeant saw me  i had no choice after that but to return to my proper place and my proper work before more disasters happened to me just as i was going to step across the path you came back from the railway you were making straight for the shrubbery when you saw mei am certain sir you saw meand you turned away as if i had got the plague and went into the house        note by franklin blakethe writer is entirely mistaken      poor creature i never noticed her my intention was      certainly to have taken a turn in the shrubbery but      remembering at the same moment that my aunt might wish to      see me after my return from the railway i altered my mind      and went into the house  i made the best of my way indoors again returning by the servants entrance there was nobody in the laundryroom at that time and i sat down there alone i have told you already of the thoughts which the shivering sand put into my head those thoughts came back to me now i wondered in myself which it would be harder to do if things went on in this mannerto bear mr franklin blakes indifference to me or to jump into the quicksand and end it for ever in that way  its useless to ask me to account for my own conduct at this time i tryand i cant understand it myself  why didnt i stop you when you avoided me in that cruel manner why didnt i call out mr franklin i have got something to say to you it concerns yourself and you must and shall hear it you were at my mercyi had got the whiphand of you as they say and better than that i had the means if i could only make you trust me of being useful to you in the future of course i never supposed that youa gentlemanhad stolen the diamond for the mere pleasure of stealing it no penelope had heard miss rachel and i had heard mr betteredge talk about your extravagance and your debts it was plain enough to me that you had taken the diamond to sell it or pledge it and so to get the money of which you stood in need well i could have told you of a man in london who would have advanced a good large sum on the jewel and who would have asked no awkward questions about it either  why didnt i speak to you why didnt i speak to you  i wonder whether the risks and difficulties of keeping the nightgown were as much as i could manage without having other risks and difficulties added to them this might have been the case with some womenbut how could it be the case with me in the days when i was a thief i had run fifty times greater risks and found my way out of difficulties to which this difficulty was mere childs play i had been apprenticed as you may say to frauds and deceptionssome of them on such a grand scale and managed so cleverly that they became famous and appeared in the newspapers was such a little thing as the keeping of the nightgown likely to weigh on my spirits and to set my heart sinking within me at the time when i ought to have spoken to you what nonsense to ask the question the thing couldnt be  where is the use of my dwelling in this way on my own folly the plain truth is plain enough surely behind your back i loved you with all my heart and soul before your facetheres no denying iti was frightened of you frightened of making you angry with me frightened of what you might say to me though you had taken the diamond if i presumed to tell you that i had found it out i had gone as near to it as i dared when i spoke to you in the library you had not turned your back on me then you had not started away from me as if i had got the plague i tried to provoke myself into feeling angry with you and to rouse up my courage in that way no i couldnt feel anything but the misery and the mortification of it youre a plain girl you have got a crooked shoulder youre only a housemaidwhat do you mean by attempting to speak to me you never uttered a word of that mr franklin but you said it all to me nevertheless is such madness as this to be accounted for no there is nothing to be done but to confess it and let it be  i ask your pardon once more for this wandering of my pen there is no fear of its happening again i am close at the end now  the first person who disturbed me by coming into the empty room was penelope she had found out my secret long since and she had done her best to bring me to my sensesand done it kindly too  ah she said i know why youre sitting here and fretting all by yourself the best thing that can happen for your advantage rosanna will be for mr franklins visit here to come to an end its my belief that he wont be long now before he leaves the house  in all my thoughts of you i had never thought of your going away i couldnt speak to penelope i could only look at her  ive just left miss rachel penelope went on and a hard matter i have had of it to put up with her temper she says the house is unbearable to her with the police in it and shes determined to speak to my lady this evening and to go to her aunt ablewhite tomorrow if she does that mr franklin will be the next to find a reason for going away you may depend on it  i recovered the use of my tongue at that do you mean to say mr franklin will go with her i asked  only too gladly if she would let him but she wont he has been made to feel her temper he is in her black books tooand that after having done all he can to help her poor fellow no no if they dont make it up before tomorrow you will see miss rachel go one way and mr franklin another where he may betake himself to i cant say but he will never stay here rosanna after miss rachel has left us  i managed to master the despair i felt at the prospect of your going away to own the truth i saw a little glimpse of hope for myself if there was really a serious disagreement between miss rachel and you do you know i asked what the quarrel is between them  it is all on miss rachels side penelope said and for anything i know to the contrary its all miss rachels temper and nothing else i am loth to distress you rosanna but dont run away with the notion that mr franklin is ever likely to quarrel with her hes a great deal too fond of her for that  she had only just spoken those cruel words when there came a call to us from mr betteredge all the indoor servants were to assemble in the hall and then we were to go in one by one and be questioned in mr betteredges room by sergeant cuff  it came to my turn to go in after her ladyships maid and the upper housemaid had been questioned first sergeant cuffs inquiriesthough he wrapped them up very cunninglysoon showed me that those two women the bitterest enemies i had in the house had made their discoveries outside my door on the tuesday afternoon and again on the thursday night they had told the sergeant enough to open his eyes to some part of the truth he rightly believed me to have made a new nightgown secretly but he wrongly believed the paintstained nightgown to be mine i felt satisfied of another thing from what he said which it puzzled me to understand he suspected me of course of being concerned in the disappearance of the diamond but at the same time he let me seepurposely as i thoughtthat he did not consider me as the person chiefly answerable for the loss of the jewel he appeared to think that i had been acting under the direction of somebody else who that person might be i couldnt guess then and cant guess now  in this uncertainty one thing was plainthat sergeant cuff was miles away from knowing the whole truth you were safe as long as the nightgown was safeand not a moment longer  i quite despair of making you understand the distress and terror which pressed upon me now it was impossible for me to risk wearing your nightgown any longer i might find myself taken off at a moments notice to the police court at frizinghall to be charged on suspicion and searched accordingly while sergeant cuff still left me free i had to chooseand at oncebetween destroying the nightgown or hiding it in some safe place at some safe distance from the house  if i had only been a little less fond of you i think i should have destroyed it but oh how could i destroy the only thing i had which proved that i had saved you from discovery if we did come to an explanation together and if you suspected me of having some bad motive and denied it all how could i win upon you to trust me unless i had the nightgown to produce was it wronging you to believe as i did and do still that you might hesitate to let a poor girl like me be the sharer of your secret and your accomplice in the theft which your moneytroubles had tempted you to commit think of your cold behaviour to me sir and you will hardly wonder at my unwillingness to destroy the only claim on your confidence and your gratitude which it was my fortune to possess  i determined to hide it and the place i fixed on was the place i knew bestthe shivering sand  as soon as the questioning was over i made the first excuse that came into my head and got leave to go out for a breath of fresh air i went straight to cobbs hole to mr yollands cottage his wife and daughter were the best friends i had dont suppose i trusted them with your secreti have trusted nobody all i wanted was to write this letter to you and to have a safe opportunity of taking the nightgown off me suspected as i was i could do neither of those things with any sort of security at the house  and now i have nearly got through my long letter writing it alone in lucy yollands bedroom when it is done i shall go downstairs with the nightgown rolled up and hidden under my cloak i shall find the means i want for keeping it safe and dry in its hidingplace among the litter of old things in mrs yollands kitchen and then i shall go to the shivering sanddont be afraid of my letting my footmarks betray meand hide the nightgown down in the sand where no living creature can find it without being first let into the secret by myself  and when thats done what then  then mr franklin i shall have two reasons for making another attempt to say the words to you which i have not said yet if you leave the house as penelope believes you will leave it and if i havent spoken to you before that i shall lose my opportunity forever that is one reason then again there is the comforting knowledgeif my speaking does make you angrythat i have got the nightgown ready to plead my cause for me as nothing else can that is my other reason if these two together dont harden my heart against the coldness which has hitherto frozen it up i mean the coldness of your treatment of me there will be the end of my effortsand the end of my life  yes if i miss my next opportunityif you are as cruel as ever and if i feel it again as i have felt it alreadygoodbye to the world which has grudged me the happiness that it gives to others goodbye to life which nothing but a little kindness from you can ever make pleasurable to me again dont blame yourself sir if it ends in this way but trydo tryto feel some forgiving sorrow for me i shall take care that you find out what i have done for you when i am past telling you of it myself will you say something kind of me thenin the same gentle way that you have when you speak to miss rachel if you do that and if there are such things as ghosts i believe my ghost will hear it and tremble with the pleasure of it  its time i left off i am making myself cry how am i to see my way to the hidingplace if i let these useless tears come and blind me  besides why should i look at the gloomy side why not believe while i can that it will end well after all i may find you in a good humour tonightor if not i may succeed better tomorrow morning i shant improve my plain face by frettingshall i who knows but i may have filled all these weary long pages of paper for nothing they will go for safetys sake never mind now for what other reason into the hidingplace along with the nightgown it has been hard hard work writing my letter oh if we only end in understanding each other how i shall enjoy tearing it up  i beg to remain sir your true lover and humble servant  rosanna spearman  the reading of the letter was completed by betteredge in silence after carefully putting it back in the envelope he sat thinking with his head bowed down and his eyes on the ground  betteredge i said is there any hint to guide me at the end of the letter  he looked up slowly with a heavy sigh  there is nothing to guide you mr franklin he answered if you take my advice you will keep the letter in the cover till these present anxieties of yours have come to an end it will sorely distress you whenever you read it dont read it now  i put the letter away in my pocketbook  a glance back at the sixteenth and seventeenth chapters of betteredges narrative will show that there really was a reason for my thus sparing myself at a time when my fortitude had been already cruelly tried twice over the unhappy woman had made her last attempt to speak to me and twice over it had been my misfortune god knows how innocently to repel the advances she had made to me on the friday night as betteredge truly describes it she had found me alone at the billiardtable her manner and language suggested to me and would have suggested to any man under the circumstancesthat she was about to confess a guilty knowledge of the disappearance of the diamond for her own sake i had purposely shown no special interest in what was coming for her own sake i had purposely looked at the billiardballs instead of looking at herand what had been the result i had sent her away from me wounded to the heart on the saturday againon the day when she must have foreseen after what penelope had told her that my departure was close at handthe same fatality still pursued us she had once more attempted to meet me in the shrubbery walk and she had found me there in company with betteredge and sergeant cuff in her hearing the sergeant with his own underhand object in view had appealed to my interest in rosanna spearman again for the poor creatures own sake i had met the policeofficer with a flat denial and had declaredloudly declared so that she might hear me toothat i felt no interest whatever in rosanna spearman at those words solely designed to warn her against attempting to gain my private ear she had turned away and left the place cautioned of her danger as i then believed selfdoomed to destruction as i know now from that point i have already traced the succession of events which led me to the astounding discovery at the quicksand the retrospect is now complete i may leave the miserable story of rosanna spearmanto which even at this distance of time i cannot revert without a pang of distressto suggest for itself all that is here purposely left unsaid i may pass from the suicide at the shivering sand with its strange and terrible influence on my present position and future prospects to interests which concern the living people of this narrative and to events which were already paving my way for the slow and toilsome journey from the darkness to the light    chapter vi   i walked to the railway station accompanied it is needless to say by gabriel betteredge i had the letter in my pocket and the nightgown safely packed in a little bagboth to be submitted before i slept that night to the investigation of mr bruff  we left the house in silence for the first time in my experience of him i found old betteredge in my company without a word to say to me having something to say on my side i opened the conversation as soon as we were clear of the lodge gates  before i go to london i began i have two questions to ask you they relate to myself and i believe they will rather surprise you  if they will put that poor creatures letter out of my head mr franklin they may do anything else they like with me please to begin surprising me sir as soon as you can  my first question betteredge is this was i drunk on the night of rachels birthday  you drunk exclaimed the old man why its the great defect of your character mr franklin that you only drink with your dinner and never touch a drop of liquor afterwards  but the birthday was a special occasion i might have abandoned my regular habits on that night of all others  betteredge considered for a moment  you did go out of your habits sir he said and ill tell you how you looked wretchedly illand we persuaded you to have a drop of brandy and water to cheer you up a little  i am not used to brandy and water it is quite possible  wait a bit mr franklin i knew you were not used too i poured you out half a wineglassfull of our fifty year old cognac and more shame for me i drowned that noble liquor in nigh on a tumblerfull of cold water a child couldnt have got drunk on itlet alone a grown man  i knew i could depend on his memory in a matter of this kind it was plainly impossible that i could have been intoxicated i passed on to the second question  before i was sent abroad betteredge you saw a great deal of me when i was a boy now tell me plainly do you remember anything strange of me after i had gone to bed at night did you ever discover me walking in my sleep  betteredge stopped looked at me for a moment nodded his head and walked on again  i see your drift now mr franklin he said youre trying to account for how you got the paint on your nightgown without knowing it yourself it wont do sir youre miles away still from getting at the truth walk in your sleep you never did such a thing in your life  here again i felt that betteredge must be right neither at home nor abroad had my life ever been of the solitary sort if i had been a sleepwalker there were hundreds on hundreds of people who must have discovered me and who in the interest of my own safety would have warned me of the habit and have taken precautions to restrain it  still admitting all this i clungwith an obstinacy which was surely natural and excusable under the circumstancesto one or other of the only two explanations that i could see which accounted for the unendurable position in which i then stood observing that i was not yet satisfied betteredge shrewdly adverted to certain later events in the history of the moonstone and scattered both my theories to the wind at once and for ever  lets try it another way sir he said keep your own opinion and see how far it will take you towards finding out the truth if we are to believe the nightgownwhich i dont for oneyou not only smeared off the paint from the door without knowing it but you also took the diamond without knowing it is that right so far  quite right go on  very good sir well say you were drunk or walking in your sleep when you took the jewel that accounts for the night and morning after the birthday but how does it account for what has happened since that time the diamond has been taken to london since that time the diamond has been pledged to mr luker since that time did you do those two things without knowing it too were you drunk when i saw you off in the ponychaise on that saturday evening and did you walk in your sleep to mr lukers when the train had brought you to your journeys end excuse me for saying it mr franklin but this business has so upset you that youre not fit yet to judge for yourself the sooner you lay your head alongside mr bruffs head the sooner you will see your way out of the deadlock that has got you now  we reached the station with only a minute or two to spare  i hurriedly gave betteredge my address in london so that he might write to me if necessary promising on my side to inform him of any news which i might have to communicate this done and just as i was bidding him farewell i happened to glance towards the bookandnewspaper stall there was mr candys remarkablelooking assistant again speaking to the keeper of the stall our eyes met at the same moment ezra jennings took off his hat to me i returned the salute and got into a carriage just as the train started it was a relief to my mind i suppose to dwell on any subject which appeared to be personally of no sort of importance to me at all events i began the momentous journey back which was to take me to mr bruff wonderingabsurdly enough i admitthat i should have seen the man with the piebald hair twice in one day  the hour at which i arrived in london precluded all hope of my finding mr bruff at his place of business i drove from the railway to his private residence at hampstead and disturbed the old lawyer dozing alone in his diningroom with his favourite pugdog on his lap and his bottle of wine at his elbow  i shall best describe the effect which my story produced on the mind of mr bruff by relating his proceedings when he had heard it to the end he ordered lights and strong tea to be taken into his study and he sent a message to the ladies of his family forbidding them to disturb us on any pretence whatever these preliminaries disposed of he first examined the nightgown and then devoted himself to the reading of rosanna spearmans letter  the reading completed mr bruff addressed me for the first time since we had been shut up together in the seclusion of his own room  franklin blake said the old gentleman this is a very serious matter in more respects than one in my opinion it concerns rachel quite as nearly as it concerns you her extraordinary conduct is no mystery now she believes you have stolen the diamond  i had shrunk from reasoning my own way fairly to that revolting conclusion but it had forced itself on me nevertheless my resolution to obtain a personal interview with rachel rested really and truly on the ground just stated by mr bruff  the first step to take in this investigation the lawyer proceeded is to appeal to rachel she has been silent all this time from motives which i who know her character can readily understand it is impossible after what has happened to submit to that silence any longer she must be persuaded to tell us or she must be forced to tell us on what grounds she bases her belief that you took the moonstone the chances are that the whole of this case serious as it seems now will tumble to pieces if we can only break through rachels inveterate reserve and prevail upon her to speak out  that is a very comforting opinion for me i said i own i should like to know  you would like to know how i can justify it interposed mr bruff i can tell you in two minutes understand in the first place that i look at this matter from a lawyers point of view its a question of evidence with me very well the evidence breaks down at the outset on one important point  on what point  you shall hear i admit that the mark of the name proves the nightgown to be yours i admit that the mark of the paint proves the nightgown to have made the smear on rachels door but what evidence is there to prove that you are the person who wore it on the night when the diamond was lost  the objection struck me all the more forcibly that it reflected an objection which i had felt myself  as to this pursued the lawyer taking up rosanna spearmans confession i can understand that the letter is a distressing one to you i can understand that you may hesitate to analyse it from a purely impartial point of view but i am not in your position i can bring my professional experience to bear on this document just as i should bring it to bear on any other without alluding to the womans career as a thief i will merely remark that her letter proves her to have been an adept at deception on her own showing and i argue from that that i am justified in suspecting her of not having told the whole truth i wont start any theory at present as to what she may or may not have done i will only say that if rachel has suspected you on the evidence of the nightgown only the chances are ninetynine to a hundred that rosanna spearman was the person who showed it to her in that case there is the womans letter confessing that she was jealous of rachel confessing that she changed the roses confessing that she saw a glimpse of hope for herself in the prospect of a quarrel between rachel and you i dont stop to ask who took the moonstone as a means to her end rosanna spearman would have taken fifty moonstonesi only say that the disappearance of the jewel gave this reclaimed thief who was in love with you an opportunity of setting you and rachel at variance for the rest of your lives she had not decided on destroying herself then remember and having the opportunity i distinctly assert that it was in her character and in her position at the time to take it what do you say to that  some such suspicion i answered crossed my own mind as soon as i opened the letter  exactly and when you had read the letter you pitied the poor creature and couldnt find it in your heart to suspect her does you credit my dear sirdoes you credit  but suppose it turns out that i did wear the nightgown what then  i dont see how the fact can be proved said mr bruff but assuming the proof to be possible the vindication of your innocence would be no easy matter we wont go into that now let us wait and see whether rachel hasnt suspected you on the evidence of the nightgown only  good god how coolly you talk of rachel suspecting me i broke out what right has she to suspect me on any evidence of being a thief  a very sensible question my dear sir rather hotly putbut well worth considering for all that what puzzles you puzzles me too search your memory and tell me this did anything happen while you were staying at the housenot of course to shake rachels belief in your honourbut let us say to shake her belief no matter with how little reason in your principles generally  i started in ungovernable agitation to my feet the lawyers question reminded me for the first time since i had left england that something had happened  in the eighth chapter of betteredges narrative an allusion will be found to the arrival of a foreigner and a stranger at my aunts house who came to see me on business the nature of his business was this  i had been foolish enough being as usual straitened for money at the time to accept a loan from the keeper of a small restaurant in paris to whom i was well known as a customer a time was settled between us for paying the money back and when the time came i found it as thousands of other honest men have found it impossible to keep my engagement i sent the man a bill my name was unfortunately too well known on such documents he failed to negotiate it his affairs had fallen into disorder in the interval since i had borrowed of him bankruptcy stared him in the face and a relative of his a french lawyer came to england to find me and to insist upon the payment of my debt he was a man of violent temper and he took the wrong way with me high words passed on both sides and my aunt and rachel were unfortunately in the next room and heard us lady verinder came in and insisted on knowing what was the matter the frenchman produced his credentials and declared me to be responsible for the ruin of a poor man who had trusted in my honour my aunt instantly paid him the money and sent him off she knew me better of course than to take the frenchmans view of the transaction but she was shocked at my carelessness and justly angry with me for placing myself in a position which but for her interference might have become a very disgraceful one either her mother told her or rachel heard what passedi cant say which she took her own romantic highflown view of the matter i was heartless i was dishonourable i had no principle there was no knowing what i might do nextin short she said some of the severest things to me which i had ever heard from a young ladys lips the breach between us lasted for the whole of the next day the day after i succeeded in making my peace and thought no more of it had rachel reverted to this unlucky accident at the critical moment when my place in her estimation was again and far more seriously assailed mr bruff when i had mentioned the circumstances to him answered the question at once in the affirmative  it would have its effect on her mind he said gravely and i wish for your sake the thing had not happened however we have discovered that there was a predisposing influence against youand there is one uncertainty cleared out of our way at any rate i see nothing more that we can do now our next step in this inquiry must be the step that takes us to rachel  he rose and began walking thoughtfully up and down the room twice i was on the point of telling him that i had determined on seeing rachel personally and twice having regard to his age and his character i hesitated to take him by surprise at an unfavourable moment  the grand difficulty is he resumed how to make her show her whole mind in this matter without reserve have you any suggestions to offer  i have made up my mind mr bruff to speak to rachel myself  you he suddenly stopped in his walk and looked at me as if he thought i had taken leave of my senses you of all the people in the world he abruptly checked himself and took another turn in the room wait a little he said in cases of this extraordinary kind the rash way is sometimes the best way he considered the question for a moment or two under that new light and ended boldly by a decision in my favour nothing venture nothing have the old gentleman resumed you have a chance in your favour which i dont possessand you shall be the first to try the experiment  a chance in my favour i repeated in the greatest surprise  mr bruffs face softened for the first time into a smile  this is how it stands he said i tell you fairly i dont trust your discretion and i dont trust your temper but i do trust in rachels still preserving in some remote little corner of her heart a certain perverse weakness for you touch thatand trust to the consequences for the fullest disclosures that can flow from a womans lips the question ishow are you to see her  she has been a guest of yours at this house i answered may i venture to suggestif nothing was said about me beforehandthat i might see her here  cool said mr bruff with that one word of comment on the reply that i had made to him he took another turn up and down the room  in plain english he said my house is to be turned into a trap to catch rachel with a bait to tempt her in the shape of an invitation from my wife and daughters if you were anybody else but franklin blake and if this matter was one atom less serious than it really is i should refuse pointblank as things are i firmly believe rachel will live to thank me for turning traitor to her in my old age consider me your accomplice rachel shall be asked to spend the day here and you shall receive due notice of it  when tomorrow  tomorrow wont give us time enough to get her answer say the day after  how shall i hear from you  stay at home all the morning and expect me to call on you  i thanked him for the inestimable assistance which he was rendering to me with the gratitude that i really felt and declining a hospitable invitation to sleep that night at hampstead returned to my lodgings in london  of the day that followed i have only to say that it was the longest day of my life innocent as i knew myself to be certain as i was that the abominable imputation which rested on me must sooner or later be cleared off there was nevertheless a sense of selfabasement in my mind which instinctively disinclined me to see any of my friends we often hear almost invariably however from superficial observers that guilt can look like innocence i believe it to be infinitely the truer axiom of the two that innocence can look like guilt i caused myself to be denied all day to every visitor who called and i only ventured out under cover of the night  the next morning mr bruff surprised me at the breakfasttable he handed me a large key and announced that he felt ashamed of himself for the first time in his life  is she coming  she is coming today to lunch and spend the afternoon with my wife and my girls  are mrs bruff and your daughters in the secret  inevitably but women as you may have observed have no principles my family dont feel my pangs of conscience the end being to bring you and rachel together again my wife and daughters pass over the means employed to gain it as composedly as if they were jesuits  i am infinitely obliged to them what is this key  the key of the gate in my backgarden wall be there at three this afternoon let yourself into the garden and make your way in by the conservatory door cross the small drawingroom and open the door in front of you which leads into the musicroom there you will find racheland find her alone  how can i thank you  i will tell you how dont blame me for what happens afterwards  with those words he went out  i had many weary hours still to wait through to while away the time i looked at my letters among them was a letter from betteredge  i opened it eagerly to my surprise and disappointment it began with an apology warning me to expect no news of any importance in the next sentence the everlasting ezra jennings appeared again he had stopped betteredge on the way out of the station and had asked who i was informed on this point he had mentioned having seen me to his master mr candy mr candy hearing of this had himself driven over to betteredge to express his regret at our having missed each other he had a reason for wishing particularly to speak to me and when i was next in the neighbourhood of frizinghall he begged i would let him know apart from a few characteristic utterances of the betteredge philosophy this was the sum and substance of my correspondents letter the warmhearted faithful old man acknowledged that he had written mainly for the pleasure of writing to me  i crumpled up the letter in my pocket and forgot it the moment after in the allabsorbing interest of my coming interview with rachel  as the clock of hampstead church struck three i put mr bruffs key into the lock of the door in the wall when i first stepped into the garden and while i was securing the door again on the inner side i own to having felt a certain guilty doubtfulness about what might happen next i looked furtively on either side of me suspicious of the presence of some unexpected witness in some unknown corner of the garden nothing appeared to justify my apprehensions the walks were one and all solitudes and the birds and the bees were the only witnesses  i passed through the garden entered the conservatory and crossed the small drawingroom as i laid my hand on the door opposite i heard a few plaintive chords struck on the piano in the room within she had often idled over the instrument in this way when i was staying at her mothers house i was obliged to wait a little to steady myself the past and present rose side by side at that supreme momentand the contrast shook me  after the lapse of a minute i roused my manhood and opened the door    chapter vii   at the moment when i showed myself in the doorway rachel rose from the piano  i closed the door behind me we confronted each other in silence with the full length of the room between us the movement she had made in rising appeared to be the one exertion of which she was capable all use of every other faculty bodily or mental seemed to be merged in the mere act of looking at me  a fear crossed my mind that i had shown myself too suddenly i advanced a few steps towards her i said gently rachel  the sound of my voice brought the life back to her limbs and the colour to her face she advanced on her side still without speaking slowly as if acting under some influence independent of her own will she came nearer and nearer to me the warm dusky colour flushing her cheeks the light of reviving intelligence brightening every instant in her eyes i forgot the object that had brought me into her presence i forgot the vile suspicion that rested on my good name i forgot every consideration past present and future which i was bound to remember i saw nothing but the woman i loved coming nearer and nearer to me she trembled she stood irresolute i could resist it no longeri caught her in my arms and covered her face with kisses  there was a moment when i thought the kisses were returned a moment when it seemed as if she too might have forgotten almost before the idea could shape itself in my mind her first voluntary action made me feel that she remembered with a cry which was like a cry of horrorwith a strength which i doubt if i could have resisted if i had triedshe thrust me back from her i saw merciless anger in her eyes i saw merciless contempt on her lips she looked me over from head to foot as she might have looked at a stranger who had insulted her  you coward she said you mean miserable heartless coward  those were her first words the most unendurable reproach that a woman can address to a man was the reproach that she picked out to address to me  i remember the time rachel i said when you could have told me that i had offended you in a worthier way than that i beg your pardon  something of the bitterness that i felt may have communicated itself to my voice at the first words of my reply her eyes which had been turned away the moment before looked back at me unwillingly she answered in a low tone with a sullen submission of manner which was quite new in my experience of her  perhaps there is some excuse for me she said after what you have done is it a manly action on your part to find your way to me as you have found it today it seems a cowardly experiment to try an experiment on my weakness for you it seems a cowardly surprise to surprise me into letting you kiss me but that is only a womans view i ought to have known it couldnt be your view i should have done better if i had controlled myself and said nothing  the apology was more unendurable than the insult the most degraded man living would have felt humiliated by it  if my honour was not in your hands i said i would leave you this instant and never see you again you have spoken of what i have done what have i done  what have you done you ask that question of me  i ask it  i have kept your infamy a secret she answered and i have suffered the consequences of concealing it have i no claim to be spared the insult of your asking me what you have done is all sense of gratitude dead in you you were once a gentleman you were once dear to my mother and dearer still to me  her voice failed her she dropped into a chair and turned her back on me and covered her face with her hands  i waited a little before i trusted myself to say any more in that moment of silence i hardly know which i felt most keenlythe sting which her contempt had planted in me or the proud resolution which shut me out from all community with her distress  if you will not speak first i said i must i have come here with something serious to say to you will you do me the common justice of listening while i say it  she neither moved nor answered i made no second appeal to her i never advanced an inch nearer to her chair with a pride which was as obstinate as her pride i told her of my discovery at the shivering sand and of all that had led to it the narrative of necessity occupied some little time from beginning to end she never looked round at me and she never uttered a word  i kept my temper my whole future depended in all probability on my not losing possession of myself at that moment the time had come to put mr bruffs theory to the test in the breathless interest of trying that experiment i moved round so as to place myself in front of her  i have a question to ask you i said it obliges me to refer again to a painful subject did rosanna spearman show you the nightgown yes or no  she started to her feet and walked close up to me of her own accord her eyes looked me searchingly in the face as if to read something there which they had never read yet  are you mad she asked  i still restrained myself i said quietly rachel will you answer my question  she went on without heeding me  have you some object to gain which i dont understand some mean fear about the future in which i am concerned they say your fathers death has made you a rich man have you come here to compensate me for the loss of my diamond and have you heart enough left to feel ashamed of your errand is that the secret of your pretence of innocence and your story about rosanna spearman is there a motive of shame at the bottom of all the falsehood this time  i stopped her there i could control myself no longer  you have done me an infamous wrong i broke out hotly you suspect me of stealing your diamond i have a right to know and i will know the reason why  suspect you she exclaimed her anger rising with mine you villain i saw you take the diamond with my own eyes  the revelation which burst upon me in those words the overthrow which they instantly accomplished of the whole view of the case on which mr bruff had relied struck me helpless innocent as i was i stood before her in silence to her eyes to any eyes i must have looked like a man overwhelmed by the discovery of his own guilt  she drew back from the spectacle of my humiliation and of her triumph the sudden silence that had fallen upon me seemed to frighten her i spared you at the time she said i would have spared you now if you had not forced me to speak she moved away as if to leave the roomand hesitated before she got to the door why did you come here to humiliate yourself she asked why did you come here to humiliate me she went on a few steps and paused once more for gods sake say something she exclaimed passionately if you have any mercy left dont let me degrade myself in this way say somethingand drive me out of the room  i advanced towards her hardly conscious of what i was doing i had possibly some confused idea of detaining her until she had told me more from the moment when i knew that the evidence on which i stood condemned in rachels mind was the evidence of her own eyes nothingnot even my conviction of my own innocencewas clear to my mind i took her by the hand i tried to speak firmly and to the purpose all i could say was rachel you once loved me  she shuddered and looked away from me her hand lay powerless and trembling in mine let go of it she said faintly  my touch seemed to have the same effect on her which the sound of my voice had produced when i first entered the room after she had said the word which called me a coward after she had made the avowal which branded me as a thiefwhile her hand lay in mine i was her master still  i drew her gently back into the middle of the room i seated her by the side of me rachel i said i cant explain the contradiction in what i am going to tell you i can only speak the truth as you have spoken it you saw mewith your own eyes you saw me take the diamond before god who hears us i declare that i now know i took it for the first time do you doubt me still  she had neither heeded nor heard me let go of my hand she repeated faintly that was her only answer her head sank on my shoulder and her hand unconsciously closed on mine at the moment when she asked me to release it  i refrained from pressing the question but there my forbearance stopped my chance of ever holding up my head again among honest men depended on my chance of inducing her to make her disclosure complete the one hope left for me was the hope that she might have overlooked something in the chain of evidencesome mere trifle perhaps which might nevertheless under careful investigation be made the means of vindicating my innocence in the end i own i kept possession of her hand i own i spoke to her with all that i could summon back of the sympathy and confidence of the bygone time  i want to ask you something i said i want you to tell me everything that happened from the time when we wished each other good night to the time when you saw me take the diamond  she lifted her head from my shoulder and made an effort to release her hand oh why go back to it she said why go back to it  i will tell you why rachel you are the victim and i am the victim of some monstrous delusion which has worn the mask of truth if we look at what happened on the night of your birthday together we may end in understanding each other yet  her head dropped back on my shoulder the tears gathered in her eyes and fell slowly over her cheeks oh she said have i never had that hope have i not tried to see it as you are trying now  you have tried by yourself i answered you have not tried with me to help you  those words seemed to awaken in her something of the hope which i felt myself when i uttered them she replied to my questions with more than docilityshe exerted her intelligence she willingly opened her whole mind to me  let us begin i said with what happened after we had wished each other good night did you go to bed or did you sit up  i went to bed  did you notice the time was it late  not very about twelve oclock i think  did you fall asleep  no i couldnt sleep that night  you were restless  i was thinking of you  the answer almost unmanned me something in the tone even more than in the words went straight to my heart it was only after pausing a little first that i was able to go on  had you any light in your room i asked  noneuntil i got up again and lit my candle  how long was that after you had gone to bed  about an hour after i think about one oclock  did you leave your bedroom  i was going to leave it i had put on my dressinggown and i was going into my sittingroom to get a book  had you opened your bedroom door  i had just opened it  but you had not gone into the sittingroom  noi was stopped from going into it  what stopped you  i saw a light under the door and i heard footsteps approaching it  were you frightened  not then i knew my poor mother was a bad sleeper and i remembered that she had tried hard that evening to persuade me to let her take charge of my diamond she was unreasonably anxious about it as i thought and i fancied she was coming to me to see if i was in bed and to speak to me about the diamond again if she found that i was up  what did you do  i blew out my candle so that she might think i was in bed i was unreasonable on my sidei was determined to keep my diamond in the place of my own choosing  after blowing out the candle did you go back to bed  i had no time to go back at the moment when i blew the candle out the sittingroom door opened and i saw  you saw  you  dressed as usual  no  in my nightgown  in your nightgownwith your bedroom candle in your hand  alone  alone  could you see my face  yes  plainly  quite plainly the candle in your hand showed it to me  were my eyes open  yes  did you notice anything strange in them anything like a fixed vacant expression  nothing of the sort your eyes were brightbrighter than usual you looked about in the room as if you knew you were where you ought not to be and as if you were afraid of being found out  did you observe one thing when i came into the roomdid you observe how i walked  you walked as you always do you came in as far as the middle of the roomand then you stopped and looked about you  what did you do on first seeing me  i could do nothing i was petrified i couldnt speak i couldnt call out i couldnt even move to shut my door  could i see you where you stood  you might certainly have seen me but you never looked towards me its useless to ask the question i am sure you never saw me  how are you sure  would you have taken the diamond would you have acted as you did afterwards would you be here nowif you had seen that i was awake and looking at you dont make me talk of that part of it i want to answer you quietly help me to keep as calm as i can go on to something else  she was rightin every way right i went on to other things  what did i do after i had got to the middle of the room and had stopped there  you turned away and went straight to the corner near the windowwhere my indian cabinet stands  when i was at the cabinet my back must have been turned towards you how did you see what i was doing  when you moved i moved  so as to see what i was about with my hands  there are three glasses in my sittingroom as you stood there i saw all that you did reflected in one of them  what did you see  you put your candle on the top of the cabinet you opened and shut one drawer after another until you came to the drawer in which i had put my diamond you looked at the open drawer for a moment and then you put your hand in and took the diamond out  how do you know i took the diamond out  i saw your hand go into the drawer and i saw the gleam of the stone between your finger and thumb when you took your hand out  did my hand approach the drawer againto close it for instance  no you had the diamond in your right hand and you took the candle from the top of the cabinet with your left hand  did i look about me again after that  no  did i leave the room immediately  no you stood quite still for what seemed a long time i saw your face sideways in the glass you looked like a man thinking and dissatisfied with his own thoughts  what happened next  you roused yourself on a sudden and you went straight out of the room  did i close the door after me  no you passed out quickly into the passage and left the door open  and then  then your light disappeared and the sound of your steps died away and i was left alone in the dark  did nothing happenfrom that time to the time when the whole house knew that the diamond was lost  nothing  are you sure of that might you not have been asleep a part of the time  i never slept i never went back to my bed nothing happened until penelope came in at the usual time in the morning  i dropped her hand and rose and took a turn in the room every question that i could put had been answered every detail that i could desire to know had been placed before me i had even reverted to the idea of sleepwalking and the idea of intoxication and again the worthlessness of the one theory and the other had been provedon the authority this time of the witness who had seen me what was to be said next what was to be done next there rose the horrible fact of the theftthe one visible tangible object that confronted me in the midst of the impenetrable darkness which enveloped all besides not a glimpse of light to guide me when i had possessed myself of rosanna spearmans secret at the shivering sand and not a glimpse of light now when i had appealed to rachel herself and had heard the hateful story of the night from her own lips  she was the first this time to break the silence  well she said you have asked and i have answered you have made me hope something from all this because you hoped something from it what have you to say now  the tone in which she spoke warned me that my influence over her was a lost influence once more  we were to look at what happened on my birthday night together she went on and we were then to understand each other have we done that  she waited pitilessly for my reply in answering her i committed a fatal errori let the exasperating helplessness of my situation get the better of my selfcontrol rashly and uselessly i reproached her for the silence which had kept me until that moment in ignorance of the truth  if you had spoken when you ought to have spoken i began if you had done me the common justice to explain yourself  she broke in on me with a cry of fury the few words i had said seemed to have lashed her on the instant into a frenzy of rage  explain myself she repeated oh is there another man like this in the world i spare him when my heart is breaking i screen him when my own character is at stake and heof all human beings heturns on me now and tells me that i ought to have explained myself after believing in him as i did after loving him as i did after thinking of him by day and dreaming of him by nighthe wonders i didnt charge him with his disgrace the first time we met my hearts darling you are a thief my hero whom i love and honour you have crept into my room under cover of the night and stolen my diamond that is what i ought to have said you villain you mean mean mean villain i would have lost fifty diamonds rather than see your face lying to me as i see it lying now  i took up my hat in mercy to heryes i can honestly say itin mercy to her i turned away without a word and opened the door by which i had entered the room  she followed and snatched the door out of my hand she closed it and pointed back to the place that i had left  no she said not yet it seems that i owe a justification of my conduct to you you shall stay and hear it or you shall stoop to the lowest infamy of all and force your way out  it wrung my heart to see her it wrung my heart to hear her i answered by a signit was all i could dothat i submitted myself to her will  the crimson flush of anger began to fade out of her face as i went back and took my chair in silence she waited a little and steadied herself when she went on but one sign of feeling was discernible in her she spoke without looking at me her hands were fast clasped in her lap and her eyes were fixed on the ground  i ought to have done you the common justice to explain myself she said repeating my own words you shall see whether i did try to do you justice or not i told you just now that i never slept and never returned to my bed after you had left my sittingroom its useless to trouble you by dwelling on what i thoughtyou would not understand my thoughtsi will only tell you what i did when time enough had passed to help me to recover myself i refrained from alarming the house and telling everybody what had happenedas i ought to have done in spite of what i had seen i was fond enough of you to believeno matter whatany impossibility rather than admit it to my own mind that you were deliberately a thief i thought and thoughtand i ended in writing to you  i never received the letter  i know you never received it wait a little and you shall hear why my letter would have told you nothing openly it would not have ruined you for life if it had fallen into some other persons hands it would only have saidin a manner which you yourself could not possibly have mistakenthat i had reason to know you were in debt and that it was in my experience and in my mothers experience of you that you were not very discreet or very scrupulous about how you got money when you wanted it you would have remembered the visit of the french lawyer and you would have known what i referred to if you had read on with some interest after that you would have come to an offer i had to make to youthe offer privately not a word mind to be said openly about it between us of the loan of as large a sum of money as i could getand i would have got it she exclaimed her colour beginning to rise again and her eyes looking up at me once more i would have pledged the diamond myself if i could have got the money in no other way in those words i wrote to you wait i did more than that i arranged with penelope to give you the letter when nobody was near i planned to shut myself into my bedroom and to have the sittingroom left open and empty all the morning and i hopedwith all my heart and soul i hopedthat you would take the opportunity and put the diamond back secretly in the drawer  i attempted to speak she lifted her hand impatiently and stopped me in the rapid alternations of her temper her anger was beginning to rise again she got up from her chair and approached me  i know what you are going to say she went on you are going to remind me again that you never received my letter i can tell you why i tore it up  for what reason i asked  for the best of reasons i preferred tearing it up to throwing it away upon such a man as you what was the first news that reached me in the morning just as my little plan was complete what did i hear i heard that youyouwere the foremost person in the house in fetching the police you were the active man you were the leader you were working harder than any of them to recover the jewel you even carried your audacity far enough to ask to speak to me about the loss of the diamondthe diamond which you yourself had stolen the diamond which was all the time in your own hands after that proof of your horrible falseness and cunning i tore up my letter but even theneven when i was maddened by the searching and questioning of the policeman whom you had sent ineven then there was some infatuation in my mind which wouldnt let me give you up i said to myself he has played his vile farce before everybody else in the house let me try if he can play it before me somebody told me you were on the terrace i went down to the terrace i forced myself to look at you i forced myself to speak to you have you forgotten what i said  i might have answered that i remembered every word of it but what purpose at that moment would the answer have served  how could i tell her that what she had said had astonished me had distressed me had suggested to me that she was in a state of dangerous nervous excitement had even roused a moments doubt in my mind whether the loss of the jewel was as much a mystery to her as to the rest of usbut had never once given me so much as a glimpse at the truth without the shadow of a proof to produce in vindication of my innocence how could i persuade her that i knew no more than the veriest stranger could have known of what was really in her thoughts when she spoke to me on the terrace  it may suit your convenience to forget it suits my convenience to remember she went on i know what i saidfor i considered it with myself before i said it i gave you one opportunity after another of owning the truth i left nothing unsaid that i could sayshort of actually telling you that i knew you had committed the theft and all the return you made was to look at me with your vile pretence of astonishment and your false face of innocencejust as you have looked at me today just as you are looking at me now i left you that morning knowing you at last for what you werefor what you areas base a wretch as ever walked the earth  if you had spoken out at the time you might have left me rachel knowing that you had cruelly wronged an innocent man  if i had spoken out before other people she retorted with another burst of indignation you would have been disgraced for life if i had spoken out to no ears but yours you would have denied it as you are denying it now do you think i should have believed you would a man hesitate at a lie who had done what i saw you dowho had behaved about it afterwards as i saw you behave i tell you again i shrank from the horror of hearing you lie after the horror of seeing you thieve you talk as if this was a misunderstanding which a few words might have set right well the misunderstanding is at an end is the thing set right no the thing is just where it was i dont believe you now i dont believe you found the nightgown i dont believe in rosanna spearmans letter i dont believe a word you have said you stole iti saw you you affected to help the policei saw you you pledged the diamond to the moneylender in londoni am sure of it you cast the suspicion of your disgrace thanks to my base silence on an innocent man you fled to the continent with your plunder the next morning after all that vileness there was but one thing more you could do you could come here with a last falsehood on your lipsyou could come here and tell me that i have wronged you  if i had stayed a moment more i know not what words might have escaped me which i should have remembered with vain repentance and regret i passed by her and opened the door for the second time for the second timewith the frantic perversity of a roused womanshe caught me by the arm and barred my way out  let me go rachel i said it will be better for both of us let me go  the hysterical passion swelled in her bosomher quickened convulsive breathing almost beat on my face as she held me back at the door  why did you come here she persisted desperately i ask you againwhy did you come here are you afraid i shall expose you now you are a rich man now you have got a place in the world now you may marry the best lady in the landare you afraid i shall say the words which i have never said yet to anybody but you i cant say the words i cant expose you i am worse if worse can be than you are yourself sobs and tears burst from her she struggled with them fiercely she held me more and more firmly i cant tear you out of my heart she said even now you may trust in the shameful shameful weakness which can only struggle against you in this way she suddenly let go of meshe threw up her hands and wrung them frantically in the air any other woman living would shrink from the disgrace of touching him she exclaimed oh god i despise myself even more heartily than i despise him  the tears were forcing their way into my eyes in spite of methe horror of it was to be endured no longer  you shall know that you have wronged me yet i said or you shall never see me again  with those words i left her she started up from the chair on which she had dropped the moment before she started upthe noble creatureand followed me across the outer room with a last merciful word at parting  franklin she said i forgive you oh franklin franklin we shall never meet again say you forgive me  i turned so as to let my face show her that i was past speakingi turned and waved my hand and saw her dimly as in a vision through the tears that had conquered me at last  the next moment the worst bitterness of it was over i was out in the garden again i saw her and heard her no more    chapter viii   late that evening i was surprised at my lodgings by a visit from mr bruff  there was a noticeable change in the lawyers manner it had lost its usual confidence and spirit he shook hands with me for the first time in his life in silence  are you going back to hampstead i asked by way of saying something  i have just left hampstead he answered i know mr franklin that you have got at the truth at last but i tell you plainly if i could have foreseen the price that was to be paid for it i should have preferred leaving you in the dark  you have seen rachel  i have come here after taking her back to portland place it was impossible to let her return in the carriage by herself i can hardly hold you responsibleconsidering that you saw her in my house and by my permissionfor the shock that this unlucky interview has inflicted on her all i can do is to provide against a repetition of the mischief she is youngshe has a resolute spiritshe will get over this with time and rest to help her i want to be assured that you will do nothing to hinder her recovery may i depend on your making no second attempt to see herexcept with my sanction and approval  after what she has suffered and after what i have suffered i said you may rely on me  i have your promise  you have my promise  mr bruff looked relieved he put down his hat and drew his chair nearer to mine  thats settled he said now about the futureyour future i mean to my mind the result of the extraordinary turn which the matter has now taken is briefly this in the first place we are sure that rachel has told you the whole truth as plainly as words can tell it in the second placethough we know that there must be some dreadful mistake somewherewe can hardly blame her for believing you to be guilty on the evidence of her own senses backed as that evidence has been by circumstances which appear on the face of them to tell dead against you  there i interposed i dont blame rachel i said i only regret that she could not prevail on herself to speak more plainly to me at the time  you might as well regret that rachel is not somebody else rejoined mr bruff and even then i doubt if a girl of any delicacy whose heart had been set on marrying you could have brought herself to charge you to your face with being a thief anyhow it was not in rachels nature to do it in a very different matter to this matter of yourswhich placed her however in a position not altogether unlike her position towards youi happen to know that she was influenced by a similar motive to the motive which actuated her conduct in your case besides as she told me herself on our way to town this evening if she had spoken plainly she would no more have believed your denial then than she believes it now what answer can you make to that there is no answer to be made to it come come mr franklin my view of the case has been proved to be all wrong i admitbut as things are now my advice may be worth having for all that i tell you plainly we shall be wasting our time and cudgelling our brains to no purpose if we attempt to try back and unravel this frightful complication from the beginning let us close our minds resolutely to all that happened last year at lady verinders country house and let us look to what we can discover in the future instead of to what we can not discover in the past  surely you forget i said that the whole thing is essentially a matter of the pastso far as i am concerned  answer me this retorted mr bruff is the moonstone at the bottom of all the mischiefor is it not  it isof course  very good what do we believe was done with the moonstone when it was taken to london  it was pledged to mr luker  we know that you are not the person who pledged it do we know who did  no  where do we believe the moonstone to be now  deposited in the keeping of mr lukers bankers  exactly now observe we are already in the month of june towards the end of the month i cant be particular to a day a year will have elapsed from the time when we believe the jewel to have been pledged there is a chanceto say the leastthat the person who pawned it may be prepared to redeem it when the years time has expired if he redeems it mr luker must himselfaccording to the terms of his own arrangementtake the diamond out of his bankers hands under these circumstances i propose setting a watch at the bank as the present month draws to an end and discovering who the person is to whom mr luker restores the moonstone do you see it now  i admitted a little unwillingly that the idea was a new one at any rate  its mr murthwaites idea quite as much as mine said mr bruff it might have never entered my head but for a conversation we had together some time since if mr murthwaite is right the indians are likely to be on the lookout at the bank towards the end of the month tooand something serious may come of it what comes of it doesnt matter to you and me except as it may help us to lay our hands on the mysterious somebody who pawned the diamond that person you may rely on it is responsible i dont pretend to know how for the position in which you stand at this moment and that person alone can set you right in rachels estimation  i cant deny i said that the plan you propose meets the difficulty in a way that is very daring and very ingenious and very new but  but you have an objection to make  yes my objection is that your proposal obliges us to wait  granted as i reckon the time it requires you to wait about a fortnightmore or less is that so very long  its a lifetime mr bruff in such a situation as mine my existence will be simply unendurable to me unless i do something towards clearing my character at once  well well i understand that have you thought yet of what you can do  i have thought of consulting sergeant cuff  he has retired from the police its useless to expect the sergeant to help you  i know where to find him and i can but try  try said mr bruff after a moments consideration the case has assumed such an extraordinary aspect since sergeant cuffs time that you may revive his interest in the inquiry try and let me hear the result in the meanwhile he continued rising if you make no discoveries between this and the end of the month am i free to try on my side what can be done by keeping a lookout at the bank  certainly i answeredunless i relieve you of all necessity for trying the experiment in the interval  mr bruff smiled and took up his hat  tell sergeant cuff he rejoined that i say the discovery of the truth depends on the discovery of the person who pawned the diamond and let me hear what the sergeants experience says to that  so we parted  early the next morning i set forth for the little town of dorkingthe place of sergeant cuffs retirement as indicated to me by betteredge  inquiring at the hotel i received the necessary directions for finding the sergeants cottage it was approached by a quiet byeroad a little way out of the town and it stood snugly in the middle of its own plot of garden ground protected by a good brick wall at the back and the sides and by a high quickset hedge in front the gate ornamented at the upper part by smartlypainted trelliswork was locked after ringing at the bell i peered through the trelliswork and saw the great cuffs favourite flower everywhere blooming in his garden clustering over his door looking in at his windows far from the crimes and the mysteries of the great city the illustrious thieftaker was placidly living out the last sybarite years of his life smothered in roses  a decent elderly woman opened the gate to me and at once annihilated all the hopes i had built on securing the assistance of sergeant cuff he had started only the day before on a journey to ireland  has he gone there on business i asked  the woman smiled he has only one business now sir she said and thats roses some great mans gardener in ireland has found out something new in the growing of rosesand mr cuffs away to inquire into it  do you know when he will be back  its quite uncertain sir mr cuff said he should come back directly or be away some time just according as he found the new discovery worth nothing or worth looking into if you have any message to leave for him ill take care sir that he gets it  i gave her my card having first written on it in pencil i have something to say about the moonstone let me hear from you as soon as you get back that done there was nothing left but to submit to circumstances and return to london  in the irritable condition of my mind at the time of which i am now writing the abortive result of my journey to the sergeants cottage simply aggravated the restless impulse in me to be doing something on the day of my return from dorking i determined that the next morning should find me bent on a new effort at forcing my way through all obstacles from the darkness to the light  what form was my next experiment to take  if the excellent betteredge had been present while i was considering that question and if he had been let into the secret of my thoughts he would no doubt have declared that the german side of me was on this occasion my uppermost side to speak seriously it is perhaps possible that my german training was in some degree responsible for the labyrinth of useless speculations in which i now involved myself for the greater part of the night i sat smoking and building up theories one more profoundly improbable than another when i did get to sleep my waking fancies pursued me in dreams i rose the next morning with objectivesubjective and subjectiveobjective inextricably entangled together in my mind and i began the day which was to witness my next effort at practical action of some kind by doubting whether i had any sort of right on purely philosophical grounds to consider any sort of thing the diamond included as existing at all  how long i might have remained lost in the mist of my own metaphysics if i had been left to extricate myself it is impossible for me to say as the event proved accident came to my rescue and happily delivered me i happened to wear that morning the same coat which i had worn on the day of my interview with rachel searching for something else in one of the pockets i came upon a crumpled piece of paper and taking it out found betteredges forgotten letter in my hand  it seemed hard on my good old friend to leave him without a reply i went to my writingtable and read his letter again  a letter which has nothing of the slightest importance in it is not always an easy letter to answer betteredges present effort at corresponding with me came within this category mr candys assistant otherwise ezra jennings had told his master that he had seen me and mr candy in his turn wanted to see me and say something to me when i was next in the neighbourhood of frizinghall what was to be said in answer to that which would be worth the paper it was written on i sat idly drawing likenesses from memory of mr candys remarkablelooking assistant on the sheet of paper which i had vowed to dedicate to betteredgeuntil it suddenly occurred to me that here was the irrepressible ezra jennings getting in my way again i threw a dozen portraits at least of the man with the piebald hair the hair in every case remarkably like into the wastepaper basketand then and there wrote my answer to betteredge it was a perfectly commonplace letterbut it had one excellent effect on me the effort of writing a few sentences in plain english completely cleared my mind of the cloudy nonsense which had filled it since the previous day  devoting myself once more to the elucidation of the impenetrable puzzle which my own position presented to me i now tried to meet the difficulty by investigating it from a plainly practical point of view the events of the memorable night being still unintelligible to me i looked a little farther back and searched my memory of the earlier hours of the birthday for any incident which might prove of some assistance to me in finding the clue  had anything happened while rachel and i were finishing the painted door or later when i rode over to frizinghall or afterwards when i went back with godfrey ablewhite and his sisters or later again when i put the moonstone into rachels hands or later still when the company came and we all assembled round the dinnertable my memory disposed of that string of questions readily enough until i came to the last looking back at the social event of the birthday dinner i found myself brought to a standstill at the outset of the inquiry i was not even capable of accurately remembering the number of the guests who had sat at the same table with me  to feel myself completely at fault here and to conclude thereupon that the incidents of the dinner might especially repay the trouble of investigating them formed parts of the same mental process in my case i believe other people in a similar situation would have reasoned as i did when the pursuit of our own interests causes us to become objects of inquiry to ourselves we are naturally suspicious of what we dont know once in possession of the names of the persons who had been present at the dinner i resolvedas a means of enriching the deficient resources of my own memoryto appeal to the memory of the rest of the guests to write down all that they could recollect of the social events of the birthday and to test the result thus obtained by the light of what had happened afterwards when the company had left the house  this last and newest of my many contemplated experiments in the art of inquirywhich betteredge would probably have attributed to the clearheaded or french side of me being uppermost for the momentmay fairly claim record here on its own merits unlikely as it may seem i had now actually groped my way to the root of the matter at last all i wanted was a hint to guide me in the right direction at starting before another day had passed over my head that hint was given me by one of the company who had been present at the birthday feast  with the plan of proceeding which i now had in view it was first necessary to possess the complete list of the guests this i could easily obtain from gabriel betteredge i determined to go back to yorkshire on that day and to begin my contemplated investigation the next morning  it was just too late to start by the train which left london before noon there was no alternative but to wait nearly three hours for the departure of the next train was there anything i could do in london which might usefully occupy this interval of time  my thoughts went back again obstinately to the birthday dinner  though i had forgotten the numbers and in many cases the names of the guests i remembered readily enough that by far the larger proportion of them came from frizinghall or from its neighbourhood but the larger proportion was not all some few of us were not regular residents in the country i myself was one of the few mr murthwaite was another godfrey ablewhite was a third mr bruffno i called to mind that business had prevented mr bruff from making one of the party had any ladies been present whose usual residence was in london i could only remember miss clack as coming within this latter category however here were three of the guests at any rate whom it was clearly advisable for me to see before i left town i drove off at once to mr bruffs office not knowing the addresses of the persons of whom i was in search and thinking it probable that he might put me in the way of finding them  mr bruff proved to be too busy to give me more than a minute of his valuable time in that minute however he contrived to disposein the most discouraging mannerof all the questions i had to put to him  in the first place he considered my newlydiscovered method of finding a clue to the mystery as something too purely fanciful to be seriously discussed in the second third and fourth places mr murthwaite was now on his way back to the scene of his past adventures miss clack had suffered losses and had settled from motives of economy in france mr godfrey ablewhite might or might not be discoverable somewhere in london suppose i inquired at his club and suppose i excused mr bruff if he went back to his business and wished me good morning  the field of inquiry in london being now so narrowed as only to include the one necessity of discovering godfreys address i took the lawyers hint and drove to his club  in the hall i met with one of the members who was an old friend of my cousins and who was also an acquaintance of my own this gentleman after enlightening me on the subject of godfreys address told me of two recent events in his life which were of some importance in themselves and which had not previously reached my ears  it appeared that godfrey far from being discouraged by rachels withdrawal from her engagement to him had made matrimonial advances soon afterwards to another young lady reputed to be a great heiress his suit had prospered and his marriage had been considered as a settled and certain thing but here again the engagement had been suddenly and unexpectedly broken offowing it was said on this occasion to a serious difference of opinion between the bridegroom and the ladys father on the question of settlements  as some compensation for this second matrimonial disaster godfrey had soon afterwards found himself the object of fond pecuniary remembrance on the part of one of his many admirers a rich old ladyhighly respected at the mothers smallclothesconversionsociety and a great friend of miss clacks to whom she left nothing but a mourning ringhad bequeathed to the admirable and meritorious godfrey a legacy of five thousand pounds after receiving this handsome addition to his own modest pecuniary resources he had been heard to say that he felt the necessity of getting a little respite from his charitable labours and that his doctor prescribed a run on the continent as likely to be productive of much future benefit to his health if i wanted to see him it would be advisable to lose no time in paying my contemplated visit  i went then and there to pay my visit  the same fatality which had made me just one day too late in calling on sergeant cuff made me again one day too late in calling on godfrey he had left london on the previous morning by the tidal train for dover he was to cross to ostend and his servant believed he was going on to brussels the time of his return was rather uncertain but i might be sure he would be away at least three months  i went back to my lodgings a little depressed in spirits three of the guests at the birthday dinnerand those three all exceptionally intelligent peoplewere out of my reach at the very time when it was most important to be able to communicate with them my last hopes now rested on betteredge and on the friends of the late lady verinder whom i might still find living in the neighbourhood of rachels country house  on this occasion i travelled straight to frizinghallthe town being now the central point in my field of inquiry i arrived too late in the evening to be able to communicate with betteredge the next morning i sent a messenger with a letter requesting him to join me at the hotel at his earliest convenience  having taken the precautionpartly to save time partly to accommodate betteredgeof sending my messenger in a fly i had a reasonable prospect if no delays occurred of seeing the old man within less than two hours from the time when i had sent for him during this interval i arranged to employ myself in opening my contemplated inquiry among the guests present at the birthday dinner who were personally known to me and who were easily within my reach these were my relatives the ablewhites and mr candy the doctor had expressed a special wish to see me and the doctor lived in the next street so to mr candy i went first  after what betteredge had told me i naturally anticipated finding traces in the doctors face of the severe illness from which he had suffered but i was utterly unprepared for such a change as i saw in him when he entered the room and shook hands with me his eyes were dim his hair had turned completely grey his face was wizen his figure had shrunk i looked at the once lively rattlepated humorous little doctorassociated in my remembrance with the perpetration of incorrigible social indiscretions and innumerable boyish jokesand i saw nothing left of his former self but the old tendency to vulgar smartness in his dress the man was a wreck but his clothes and his jewelleryin cruel mockery of the change in himwere as gay and as gaudy as ever  i have often thought of you mr blake he said and i am heartily glad to see you again at last if there is anything i can do for you pray command my services sirpray command my services  he said those few commonplace words with needless hurry and eagerness and with a curiosity to know what had brought me to yorkshire which he was perfectlyi might say childishlyincapable of concealing from notice  with the object that i had in view i had of course foreseen the necessity of entering into some sort of personal explanation before i could hope to interest people mostly strangers to me in doing their best to assist my inquiry on the journey to frizinghall i had arranged what my explanation was to beand i seized the opportunity now offered to me of trying the effect of it on mr candy  i was in yorkshire the other day and i am in yorkshire again now on rather a romantic errand i said it is a matter mr candy in which the late lady verinders friends all took some interest you remember the mysterious loss of the indian diamond now nearly a year since circumstances have lately happened which lead to the hope that it may yet be foundand i am interesting myself as one of the family in recovering it among the obstacles in my way there is the necessity of collecting again all the evidence which was discovered at the time and more if possible there are peculiarities in this case which make it desirable to revive my recollection of everything that happened in the house on the evening of miss verinders birthday and i venture to appeal to her late mothers friends who were present on that occasion to lend me the assistance of their memories  i had got as far as that in rehearsing my explanatory phrases when i was suddenly checked by seeing plainly in mr candys face that my experiment on him was a total failure  the little doctor sat restlessly picking at the points of his fingers all the time i was speaking his dim watery eyes were fixed on my face with an expression of vacant and wistful inquiry very painful to see what he was thinking of it was impossible to divine the one thing clearly visible was that i had failed after the first two or three words in fixing his attention the only chance of recalling him to himself appeared to lie in changing the subject i tried a new topic immediately  so much i said gaily for what brings me to frizinghall now mr candy its your turn you sent me a message by gabriel betteredge  he left off picking at his fingers and suddenly brightened up  yes yes yes he exclaimed eagerly thats it i sent you a message  and betteredge duly communicated it by letter i went on you had something to say to me the next time i was in your neighbourhood well mr candy here i am  here you are echoed the doctor and betteredge was quite right i had something to say to you that was my message betteredge is a wonderful man what a memory at his age what a memory  he dropped back into silence and began picking at his fingers again recollecting what i had heard from betteredge about the effect of the fever on his memory i went on with the conversation in the hope that i might help him at starting  its a long time since we met i said we last saw each other at the last birthday dinner my poor aunt was ever to give  thats it cried mr candy the birthday dinner he started impulsively to his feet and looked at me a deep flush suddenly overspread his faded face and he abruptly sat down again as if conscious of having betrayed a weakness which he would fain have concealed it was plain pitiably plain that he was aware of his own defect of memory and that he was bent on hiding it from the observation of his friends  thus far he had appealed to my compassion only but the words he had just saidfew as they wereroused my curiosity instantly to the highest pitch the birthday dinner had already become the one event in the past at which i looked back with strangelymixed feelings of hope and distrust and here was the birthday dinner unmistakably proclaiming itself as the subject on which mr candy had something important to say to me  i attempted to help him out once more but this time my own interests were at the bottom of my compassionate motive and they hurried me on a little too abruptly to the end i had in view  its nearly a year now i said since we sat at that pleasant table have you made any memorandumin your diary or otherwiseof what you wanted to say to me  mr candy understood the suggestion and showed me that he understood it as an insult  i require no memorandum mr blake he said stiffly enough i am not such a very old man yetand my memory thank god is to be thoroughly depended on  it is needless to say that i declined to understand that he was offended with me  i wish i could say the same of my memory i answered when i try to think of matters that are a year old i seldom find my remembrance as vivid as i could wish it to be take the dinner at lady verinders for instance  mr candy brightened up again the moment the allusion passed my lips  ah the dinner the dinner at lady verinders he exclaimed more eagerly than ever i have got something to say to you about that  his eyes looked at me again with the painful expression of inquiry so wistful so vacant so miserably helpless to see he was evidently trying hard and trying in vain to recover the lost recollection it was a very pleasant dinner he burst out suddenly with an air of saying exactly what he wanted to say a very pleasant dinner mr blake wasnt it he nodded and smiled and appeared to think poor fellow that he had succeeded in concealing the total failure of his memory by a welltimed exertion of his own presence of mind  it was so distressing that i at once shifted the talkdeeply as i was interested in his recovering the lost remembranceto topics of local interest  here he got on glibly enough trumpery little scandals and quarrels in the town some of them as much as a month old appeared to recur to his memory readily he chattered on with something of the smooth gossiping fluency of former times but there were moments even in the full flow of his talkativeness when he suddenly hesitatedlooked at me for a moment with the vacant inquiry once more in his eyescontrolled himselfand went on again i submitted patiently to my martyrdom it is surely nothing less than martyrdom to a man of cosmopolitan sympathies to absorb in silent resignation the news of a country town until the clock on the chimneypiece told me that my visit had been prolonged beyond half an hour having now some right to consider the sacrifice as complete i rose to take leave as we shook hands mr candy reverted to the birthday festival of his own accord  i am so glad we have met again he said i had it on my mindi really had it on my mind mr blake to speak to you about the dinner at lady verinders you know a pleasant dinnerreally a pleasant dinner now wasnt it  on repeating the phrase he seemed to feel hardly as certain of having prevented me from suspecting his lapse of memory as he had felt on the first occasion the wistful look clouded his face again and after apparently designing to accompany me to the street door he suddenly changed his mind rang the bell for the servant and remained in the drawingroom  i went slowly down the doctors stairs feeling the disheartening conviction that he really had something to say which it was vitally important to me to hear and that he was morally incapable of saying it the effort of remembering that he wanted to speak to me was but too evidently the only effort that his enfeebled memory was now able to achieve  just as i reached the bottom of the stairs and had turned a corner on my way to the outer hall a door opened softly somewhere on the ground floor of the house and a gentle voice said behind me  i am afraid sir you find mr candy sadly changed  i turned round and found myself face to face with ezra jennings    chapter ix   the doctors pretty housemaid stood waiting for me with the street door open in her hand pouring brightly into the hall the morning light fell full on the face of mr candys assistant when i turned and looked at him  it was impossible to dispute betteredges assertion that the appearance of ezra jennings speaking from a popular point of view was against him his gipsycomplexion his fleshless cheeks his gaunt facial bones his dreamy eyes his extraordinary particoloured hair the puzzling contradiction between his face and figure which made him look old and young both togetherwere all more or less calculated to produce an unfavourable impression of him on a strangers mind and yetfeeling this as i certainly didit is not to be denied that ezra jennings made some inscrutable appeal to my sympathies which i found it impossible to resist while my knowledge of the world warned me to answer the question which he had put acknowledging that i did indeed find mr candy sadly changed and then to proceed on my way out of the housemy interest in ezra jennings held me rooted to the place and gave him the opportunity of speaking to me in private about his employer for which he had been evidently on the watch  are you walking my way mr jennings i said observing that he held his hat in his hand i am going to call on my aunt mrs ablewhite  ezra jennings replied that he had a patient to see and that he was walking my way  we left the house together i observed that the pretty servant girlwho was all smiles and amiability when i wished her good morning on my way outreceived a modest little message from ezra jennings relating to the time at which he might be expected to return with pursedup lips and with eyes which ostentatiously looked anywhere rather than look in his face the poor wretch was evidently no favourite in the house out of the house i had betteredges word for it that he was unpopular everywhere what a life i thought to myself as we descended the doctors doorsteps  having already referred to mr candys illness on his side ezra jennings now appeared determined to leave it to me to resume the subject his silence said significantly its your turn now i too had my reasons for referring to the doctors illness and i readily accepted the responsibility of speaking first  judging by the change i see in him i began mr candys illness must have been far more serious that i had supposed  it is almost a miracle said ezra jennings that he lived through it  is his memory never any better than i have found it today he has been trying to speak to me  of something which happened before he was taken ill asked the assistant observing that i hesitated  yes  his memory of events at that past time is hopelessly enfeebled said ezra jennings it is almost to be deplored poor fellow that even the wreck of it remains while he remembers dimly plans that he formedthings here and there that he had to say or do before his illnesshe is perfectly incapable of recalling what the plans were or what the thing was that he had to say or do he is painfully conscious of his own deficiency and painfully anxious as you must have seen to hide it from observation if he could only have recovered in a complete state of oblivion as to the past he would have been a happier man perhaps we should all be happier he added with a sad smile if we could but completely forget  there are some events surely in all mens lives i replied the memory of which they would be unwilling entirely to lose  that is i hope to be said of most men mr blake i am afraid it cannot truly be said of all have you any reason to suppose that the lost remembrance which mr candy tried to recoverwhile you were speaking to him just nowwas a remembrance which it was important to you that he should recall  in saying those words he had touched of his own accord on the very point upon which i was anxious to consult him the interest i felt in this strange man had impelled me in the first instance to give him the opportunity of speaking to me reserving what i might have to say on my side in relation to his employer until i was first satisfied that he was a person in whose delicacy and discretion i could trust the little that he had said thus far had been sufficient to convince me that i was speaking to a gentleman he had what i may venture to describe as the unsought selfpossession which is a sure sign of good breeding not in england only but everywhere else in the civilised world whatever the object which he had in view in putting the question that he had just addressed to me i felt no doubt that i was justifiedso farin answering him without reserve  i believe i have a strong interest i said in tracing the lost remembrance which mr candy was unable to recall may i ask whether you can suggest to me any method by which i might assist his memory  ezra jennings looked at me with a sudden flash of interest in his dreamy brown eyes  mr candys memory is beyond the reach of assistance he said i have tried to help it often enough since his recovery to be able to speak positively on that point  this disappointed me and i owned it  i confess you led me to hope for a less discouraging answer than that i said  ezra jennings smiled it may not perhaps be a final answer mr blake it may be possible to trace mr candys lost recollection without the necessity of appealing to mr candy himself  indeed is it an indiscretion on my part to ask how  by no means my only difficulty in answering your question is the difficulty of explaining myself may i trust to your patience if i refer once more to mr candys illness and if i speak of it this time without sparing you certain professional details  pray go on you have interested me already in hearing the details  my eagerness seemed to amuseperhaps i might rather say to please him he smiled again we had by this time left the last houses in the town behind us ezra jennings stopped for a moment and picked some wild flowers from the hedge by the roadside how beautiful they are he said simply showing his little nosegay to me and how few people in england seem to admire them as they deserve  you have not always been in england i said  no i was born and partly brought up in one of our colonies my father was an englishman but my motherwe are straying away from our subject mr blake and it is my fault the truth is i have associations with these modest little hedgeside flowersit doesnt matter we were speaking of mr candy to mr candy let us return  connecting the few words about himself which thus reluctantly escaped him with the melancholy view of life which led him to place the conditions of human happiness in complete oblivion of the past i felt satisfied that the story which i had read in his face was in two particulars at least the story that it really told he had suffered as few men suffer and there was the mixture of some foreign race in his english blood  you have heard i dare say of the original cause of mr candys illness he resumed the night of lady verinders dinnerparty was a night of heavy rain my employer drove home through it in his gig and reached the house wetted to the skin he found an urgent message from a patient waiting for him and he most unfortunately went at once to visit the sick person without stopping to change his clothes i was myself professionally detained that night by a case at some distance from frizinghall when i got back the next morning i found mr candys groom waiting in great alarm to take me to his masters room by that time the mischief was done the illness had set in  the illness has only been described to me in general terms as a fever i said  i can add nothing which will make the description more accurate answered ezra jennings from first to last the fever assumed no specific form i sent at once to two of mr candys medical friends in the town both physicians to come and give me their opinion of the case they agreed with me that it looked serious but they both strongly dissented from the view i took of the treatment we differed entirely in the conclusions which we drew from the patients pulse the two doctors arguing from the rapidity of the beat declared that a lowering treatment was the only treatment to be adopted on my side i admitted the rapidity of the pulse but i also pointed to its alarming feebleness as indicating an exhausted condition of the system and as showing a plain necessity for the administration of stimulants the two doctors were for keeping him on gruel lemonade barleywater and so on i was for giving him champagne or brandy ammonia and quinine a serious difference of opinion as you see a difference between two physicians of established local repute and a stranger who was only an assistant in the house for the first few days i had no choice but to give way to my elders and betters the patient steadily sinking all the time i made a second attempt to appeal to the plain undeniably plain evidence of the pulse its rapidity was unchecked and its feebleness had increased the two doctors took offence at my obstinacy they said mr jennings either we manage this case or you manage it which is it to be i said gentlemen give me five minutes to consider and that plain question shall have a plain reply when the time expired i was ready with my answer i said you positively refuse to try the stimulant treatment they refused in so many words i mean to try it at once gentlementry it mr jennings and we withdraw from the case i sent down to the cellar for a bottle of champagne and i administered half a tumblerfull of it to the patient with my own hand the two physicians took up their hats in silence and left the house  you had assumed a serious responsibility i said in your place i am afraid i should have shrunk from it  in my place mr blake you would have remembered that mr candy had taken you into his employment under circumstances which made you his debtor for life in my place you would have seen him sinking hour by hour and you would have risked anything rather than let the one man on earth who had befriended you die before your eyes dont suppose that i had no sense of the terrible position in which i had placed myself there were moments when i felt all the misery of my friendlessness all the peril of my dreadful responsibility if i had been a happy man if i had led a prosperous life i believe i should have sunk under the task i had imposed on myself but i had no happy time to look back at no past peace of mind to force itself into contrast with my present anxiety and suspenseand i held firm to my resolution through it all i took an interval in the middle of the day when my patients condition was at its best for the repose i needed for the rest of the fourandtwenty hours as long as his life was in danger i never left his bedside towards sunset as usual in such cases the delirium incidental to the fever came on it lasted more or less through the night and then intermitted at that terrible time in the early morningfrom two oclock to fivewhen the vital energies even of the healthiest of us are at their lowest it is then that death gathers in his human harvest most abundantly it was then that death and i fought our fight over the bed which should have the man who lay on it i never hesitated in pursuing the treatment on which i had staked everything when wine failed i tried brandy when the other stimulants lost their influence i doubled the dose after an interval of suspensethe like of which i hope to god i shall never feel againthere came a day when the rapidity of the pulse slightly but appreciably diminished and better still there came also a change in the beatan unmistakable change to steadiness and strength then i knew that i had saved him and then i own i broke down i laid the poor fellows wasted hand back on the bed and burst out crying an hysterical relief mr blakenothing more physiology says and says truly that some men are born with female constitutionsand i am one of them  he made that bitterly professional apology for his tears speaking quietly and unaffectedly as he had spoken throughout his tone and manner from beginning to end showed him to be especially almost morbidly anxious not to set himself up as an object of interest to me  you may well ask why i have wearied you with all these details he went on it is the only way i can see mr blake of properly introducing to you what i have to say next now you know exactly what my position was at the time of mr candys illness you will the more readily understand the sore need i had of lightening the burden on my mind by giving it at intervals some sort of relief i have had the presumption to occupy my leisure for some years past in writing a book addressed to the members of my professiona book on the intricate and delicate subject of the brain and the nervous system my work will probably never be finished and it will certainly never be published it has none the less been the friend of many lonely hours and it helped me to while away the anxious timethe time of waiting and nothing elseat mr candys bedside i told you he was delirious i think and i mentioned the time at which his delirium came on  yes  well i had reached a section of my book at that time which touched on this same question of delirium i wont trouble you at any length with my theory on the subjecti will confine myself to telling you only what it is your present interest to know it has often occurred to me in the course of my medical practice to doubt whether we can justifiably inferin cases of deliriumthat the loss of the faculty of speaking connectedly implies of necessity the loss of the faculty of thinking connectedly as well poor mr candys illness gave me an opportunity of putting this doubt to the test i understand the art of writing in shorthand and i was able to take down the patients wanderings exactly as they fell from his lipsdo you see mr blake what i am coming to at last  i saw it clearly and waited with breathless interest to hear more  at odds and ends of time ezra jennings went on i reproduced my shorthand notes in the ordinary form of writingleaving large spaces between the broken phrases and even the single words as they had fallen disconnectedly from mr candys lips i then treated the result thus obtained on something like the principle which one adopts in putting together a childs puzzle it is all confusion to begin with but it may be all brought into order and shape if you can only find the right way acting on this plan i filled in each blank space on the paper with what the words or phrases on either side of it suggested to me as the speakers meaning altering over and over again until my additions followed naturally on the spoken words which came before them and fitted naturally into the spoken words which came after them the result was that i not only occupied in this way many vacant and anxious hours but that i arrived at something which was as it seemed to me a confirmation of the theory that i held in plainer words after putting the broken sentences together i found the superior faculty of thinking going on more or less connectedly in my patients mind while the inferior faculty of expression was in a state of almost complete incapacity and confusion  one word i interposed eagerly did my name occur in any of his wanderings  you shall hear mr blake among my written proofs of the assertion which i have just advancedor i ought to say among the written experiments tending to put my assertion to the proofthere is one in which your name occurs for nearly the whole of one night mr candys mind was occupied with something between himself and you i have got the broken words as they dropped from his lips on one sheet of paper and i have got the links of my own discovering which connect those words together on another sheet of paper the product as the arithmeticians would say is an intelligible statementfirst of something actually done in the past secondly of something which mr candy contemplated doing in the future if his illness had not got in the way and stopped him the question is whether this does or does not represent the lost recollection which he vainly attempted to find when you called on him this morning  not a doubt of it i answered let us go back directly and look at the papers  quite impossible mr blake  why  put yourself in my position for a moment said ezra jennings would you disclose to another person what had dropped unconsciously from the lips of your suffering patient and your helpless friend without first knowing that there was a necessity to justify you in opening your lips  i felt that he was unanswerable here but i tried to argue the question nevertheless  my conduct in such a delicate matter as you describe i replied would depend greatly on whether the disclosure was of a nature to compromise my friend or not  i have disposed of all necessity for considering that side of the question long since said ezra jennings wherever my notes included anything which mr candy might have wished to keep secret those notes have been destroyed my manuscript experiments at my friends bedside include nothing now which he would have hesitated to communicate to others if he had recovered the use of his memory in your case i have every reason to suppose that my notes contain something which he actually wished to say to you  and yet you hesitate  and yet i hesitate remember the circumstances under which i obtained the information which i possess harmless as it is i cannot prevail upon myself to give it up to you unless you first satisfy me that there is a reason for doing so he was so miserably ill mr blake and he was so helplessly dependent upon me is it too much to ask if i request you only to hint to me what your interest is in the lost recollectionor what you believe that lost recollection to be  to have answered him with the frankness which his language and his manner both claimed from me would have been to commit myself to openly acknowledging that i was suspected of the theft of the diamond strongly as ezra jennings had intensified the first impulsive interest which i had felt in him he had not overcome my unconquerable reluctance to disclose the degrading position in which i stood i took refuge once more in the explanatory phrases with which i had prepared myself to meet the curiosity of strangers  this time i had no reason to complain of a want of attention on the part of the person to whom i addressed myself ezra jennings listened patiently even anxiously until i had done  i am sorry to have raised your expectations mr blake only to disappoint them he said throughout the whole period of mr candys illness from first to last not one word about the diamond escaped his lips the matter with which i heard him connect your name has i can assure you no discoverable relation whatever with the loss or the recovery of miss verinders jewel  we arrived as he said those words at a place where the highway along which we had been walking branched off into two roads one led to mr ablewhites house and the other to a moorland village some two or three miles off ezra jennings stopped at the road which led to the village  my way lies in this direction he said i am really and truly sorry mr blake that i can be of no use to you  his voice told me that he spoke sincerely his soft brown eyes rested on me for a moment with a look of melancholy interest he bowed and went without another word on his way to the village  for a minute or more i stood and watched him walking farther and farther away from me carrying farther and farther away with him what i now firmly believed to be the clue of which i was in search he turned after walking on a little way and looked back seeing me still standing at the place where we had parted he stopped as if doubting whether i might not wish to speak to him again there was no time for me to reason out my own situationto remind myself that i was losing my opportunity at what might be the turning point of my life and all to flatter nothing more important than my own selfesteem there was only time to call him back first and to think afterwards i suspect i am one of the rashest of existing men i called him backand then i said to myself now there is no help for it i must tell him the truth  he retraced his steps directly i advanced along the road to meet him  mr jennings i said i have not treated you quite fairly my interest in tracing mr candys lost recollection is not the interest of recovering the moonstone a serious personal matter is at the bottom of my visit to yorkshire i have but one excuse for not having dealt frankly with you in this matter it is more painful to me than i can say to mention to anybody what my position really is  ezra jennings looked at me with the first appearance of embarrassment which i had seen in him yet  i have no right mr blake and no wish he said to intrude myself into your private affairs allow me to ask your pardon on my side for having most innocently put you to a painful test  you have a perfect right i rejoined to fix the terms on which you feel justified in revealing what you heard at mr candys bedside i understand and respect the delicacy which influences you in this matter how can i expect to be taken into your confidence if i decline to admit you into mine you ought to know and you shall know why i am interested in discovering what mr candy wanted to say to me if i turn out to be mistaken in my anticipations and if you prove unable to help me when you are really aware of what i want i shall trust to your honour to keep my secretand something tells me that i shall not trust in vain  stop mr blake i have a word to say which must be said before you go any farther i looked at him in astonishment the grip of some terrible emotion seemed to have seized him and shaken him to the soul his gipsy complexion had altered to a livid greyish paleness his eyes had suddenly become wild and glittering his voice had dropped to a tonelow stern and resolutewhich i now heard for the first time the latent resources in the man for good or for evilit was hard at that moment to say whichleapt up in him and showed themselves to me with the suddenness of a flash of light  before you place any confidence in me he went on you ought to know and you must know under what circumstances i have been received into mr candys house it wont take long i dont profess sir to tell my story as the phrase is to any man my story will die with me all i ask is to be permitted to tell you what i have told mr candy if you are still in the mind when you have heard that to say what you have proposed to say you will command my attention and command my services shall we walk on  the suppressed misery in his face silenced me i answered his question by a sign we walked on  after advancing a few hundred yards ezra jennings stopped at a gap in the rough stone wall which shut off the moor from the road at this part of it  do you mind resting a little mr blake he asked i am not what i wasand some things shake me  i agreed of course he led the way through the gap to a patch of turf on the heathy ground screened by bushes and dwarf trees on the side nearest to the road and commanding in the opposite direction a grandly desolate view over the broad brown wilderness of the moor the clouds had gathered within the last half hour the light was dull the distance was dim the lovely face of nature met us soft and still colourlessmet us without a smile  we sat down in silence ezra jennings laid aside his hat and passed his hand wearily over his forehead wearily through his startling white and black hair he tossed his little nosegay of wild flowers away from him as if the remembrances which it recalled were remembrances which hurt him now  mr blake he said suddenly you are in bad company the cloud of a horrible accusation has rested on me for years i tell you the worst at once i am a man whose life is a wreck and whose character is gone  i attempted to speak he stopped me  no he said pardon me not yet dont commit yourself to expressions of sympathy which you may afterwards wish to recall i have mentioned an accusation which has rested on me for years there are circumstances in connexion with it that tell against me i cannot bring myself to acknowledge what the accusation is and i am incapable perfectly incapable of proving my innocence i can only assert my innocence i assert it sir on my oath as a christian it is useless to appeal to my honour as a man  he paused again i looked round at him he never looked at me in return his whole being seemed to be absorbed in the agony of recollecting and in the effort to speak  there is much that i might say he went on about the merciless treatment of me by my own family and the merciless enmity to which i have fallen a victim but the harm is done the wrong is beyond all remedy i decline to weary or distress you sir if i can help it at the outset of my career in this country the vile slander to which i have referred struck me down at once and for ever i resigned my aspirations in my professionobscurity was the only hope left for me i parted with the woman i lovedhow could i condemn her to share my disgrace a medical assistants place offered itself in a remote corner of england i got the place it promised me peace it promised me obscurity as i thought i was wrong evil report with time and chance to help it travels patiently and travels far the accusation from which i had fled followed me i got warning of its approach i was able to leave my situation voluntarily with the testimonials that i had earned they got me another situation in another remote district time passed again and again the slander that was death to my character found me out on this occasion i had no warning my employer said mr jennings i have no complaint to make against you but you must set yourself right or leave me i had but one choicei left him its useless to dwell on what i suffered after that i am only forty years old now look at my face and let it tell for me the story of some miserable years it ended in my drifting to this place and meeting with mr candy he wanted an assistant i referred him on the question of capacity to my last employer the question of character remained i told him what i have told youand more i warned him that there were difficulties in the way even if he believed me here as elsewhere i said i scorn the guilty evasion of living under an assumed name i am no safer at frizinghall than at other places from the cloud that follows me go where i may he answered i dont do things by halvesi believe you and i pity you if you will risk what may happen i will risk it too god almighty bless him he has given me shelter he has given me employment he has given me rest of mindand i have the certain conviction i have had it for some months past that nothing will happen now to make him regret it  the slander has died out i said  the slander is as active as ever but when it follows me here it will come too late  you will have left the place  no mr blakei shall be dead for ten years past i have suffered from an incurable internal complaint i dont disguise from you that i should have let the agony of it kill me long since but for one last interest in life which makes my existence of some importance to me still i want to provide for a personvery dear to mewhom i shall never see again my own little patrimony is hardly sufficient to make her independent of the world the hope if i could only live long enough of increasing it to a certain sum has impelled me to resist the disease by such palliative means as i could devise the one effectual palliative in my case isopium to that allpotent and allmerciful drug i am indebted for a respite of many years from my sentence of death but even the virtues of opium have their limit the progress of the disease has gradually forced me from the use of opium to the abuse of it i am feeling the penalty at last my nervous system is shattered my nights are nights of horror the end is not far off now let it comei have not lived and worked in vain the little sum is nearly made up and i have the means of completing it if my last reserves of life fail me sooner than i expect i hardly know how i have wandered into telling you this i dont think i am mean enough to appeal to your pity perhaps i fancy you may be all the readier to believe me if you know that what i have said to you i have said with the certain knowledge in me that i am a dying man there is no disguising mr blake that you interest me i have attempted to make my poor friends loss of memory the means of bettering my acquaintance with you i have speculated on the chance of your feeling a passing curiosity about what he wanted to say and of my being able to satisfy it is there no excuse for my intruding myself on you perhaps there is some excuse a man who has lived as i have lived has his bitter moments when he ponders over human destiny you have youth health riches a place in the world a prospect before you you and such as you show me the sunny side of human life and reconcile me with the world that i am leaving before i go however this talk between us may end i shall not forget that you have done me a kindness in doing that it rests with you sir to say what you proposed saying or to wish me good morning  i had but one answer to make to that appeal without a moments hesitation i told him the truth as unreservedly as i have told it in these pages  he started to his feet and looked at me with breathless eagerness as i approached the leading incident of my story  it is certain that i went into the room i said it is certain that i took the diamond i can only meet those two plain facts by declaring that do what i might i did it without my own knowledge  ezra jennings caught me excitedly by the arm  stop he said you have suggested more to me than you suppose have you ever been accustomed to the use of opium  i never tasted it in my life  were your nerves out of order at this time last year were you unusually restless and irritable  yes  did you sleep badly  wretchedly many nights i never slept at all  was the birthday night an exception try and remember did you sleep well on that one occasion  i do remember i slept soundly  he dropped my arm as suddenly as he had taken itand looked at me with the air of a man whose mind was relieved of the last doubt that rested on it  this is a marked day in your life and in mine he said gravely i am absolutely certain mr blake of one thingi have got what mr candy wanted to say to you this morning in the notes that i took at my patients bedside wait that is not all i am firmly persuaded that i can prove you to have been unconscious of what you were about when you entered the room and took the diamond give me time to think and time to question you i believe the vindication of your innocence is in my hands  explain yourself for gods sake what do you mean  in the excitement of our colloquy we had walked on a few steps beyond the clump of dwarf trees which had hitherto screened us from view before ezra jennings could answer me he was hailed from the high road by a man in great agitation who had been evidently on the lookout for him  i am coming he called back i am coming as fast as i can he turned to me there is an urgent case waiting for me at the village yonder i ought to have been there half an hour sincei must attend to it at once give me two hours from this time and call at mr candys againand i will engage to be ready for you  how am i to wait i exclaimed impatiently cant you quiet my mind by a word of explanation before we part  this is far too serious a matter to be explained in a hurry mr blake i am not wilfully trying your patiencei should only be adding to your suspense if i attempted to relieve it as things are now at frizinghall sir in two hours time  the man on the high road hailed him again he hurried away and left me    chapter x   how the interval of suspense in which i was now condemned might have affected other men in my position i cannot pretend to say the influence of the two hours probation upon my temperament was simply this i felt physically incapable of remaining still in any one place and morally incapable of speaking to any one human being until i had first heard all that ezra jennings had to say to me  in this frame of mind i not only abandoned my contemplated visit to mrs ablewhitei even shrank from encountering gabriel betteredge himself  returning to frizinghall i left a note for betteredge telling him that i had been unexpectedly called away for a few hours but that he might certainly expect me to return towards three oclock in the afternoon i requested him in the interval to order his dinner at the usual hour and to amuse himself as he pleased he had as i well knew hosts of friends in frizinghall and he would be at no loss how to fill up his time until i returned to the hotel  this done i made the best of my way out of the town again and roamed the lonely moorland country which surrounds frizinghall until my watch told me that it was time at last to return to mr candys house  i found ezra jennings ready and waiting for me  he was sitting alone in a bare little room which communicated by a glazed door with a surgery hideous coloured diagrams of the ravages of hideous diseases decorated the barren buffcoloured walls a bookcase filled with dingy medical works and ornamented at the top with a skull in place of the customary bust a large deal table copiously splashed with ink wooden chairs of the sort that are seen in kitchens and cottages a threadbare drugget in the middle of the floor a sink of water with a basin and wastepipe roughly let into the wall horribly suggestive of its connection with surgical operationscomprised the entire furniture of the room the bees were humming among a few flowers placed in pots outside the window the birds were singing in the garden and the faint intermittent jingle of a tuneless piano in some neighbouring house forced itself now and again on the ear in any other place these everyday sounds might have spoken pleasantly of the everyday world outside here they came in as intruders on a silence which nothing but human suffering had the privilege to disturb i looked at the mahogany instrument case and at the huge roll of lint occupying places of their own on the bookshelves and shuddered inwardly as i thought of the sounds familiar and appropriate to the everyday use of ezra jennings room  i make no apology mr blake for the place in which i am receiving you he said it is the only room in the house at this hour of the day in which we can feel quite sure of being left undisturbed here are my papers ready for you and here are two books to which we may have occasion to refer before we have done bring your chair to the table and we shall be able to consult them together  i drew up to the table and ezra jennings handed me his manuscript notes they consisted of two large folio leaves of paper one leaf contained writing which only covered the surface at intervals the other presented writing in red and black ink which completely filled the page from top to bottom in the irritated state of my curiosity at that moment i laid aside the second sheet of paper in despair  have some mercy on me i said tell me what i am to expect before i attempt to read this  willingly mr blake do you mind my asking you one or two more questions  ask me anything you like  he looked at me with the sad smile on his lips and the kindly interest in his soft brown eyes  you have already told me he said that you have neverto your knowledgetasted opium in your life  to my knowledge i repeated  you will understand directly why i speak with that reservation let us go on you are not aware of ever having taken opium at this time last year you were suffering from nervous irritation and you slept wretchedly at night on the night of the birthday however there was an exception to the ruleyou slept soundly am i right so far  quite right  can you assign any cause for the nervous suffering and your want of sleep  i can assign no cause old betteredge made a guess at the cause i remember but that is hardly worth mentioning  pardon me anything is worth mentioning in such a case as this betteredge attributed your sleeplessness to something to what  to my leaving off smoking  had you been an habitual smoker  yes  did you leave off the habit suddenly  yes  betteredge was perfectly right mr blake when smoking is a habit a man must have no common constitution who can leave it off suddenly without some temporary damage to his nervous system your sleepless nights are accounted for to my mind my next question refers to mr candy do you remember having entered into anything like a dispute with himat the birthday dinner or afterwardson the subject of his profession  the question instantly awakened one of my dormant remembrances in connection with the birthday festival the foolish wrangle which took place on that occasion between mr candy and myself will be found described at much greater length than it deserves in the tenth chapter of betteredges narrative the details there presented of the disputeso little had i thought of it afterwardsentirely failed to recur to my memory all that i could now recall and all that i could tell ezra jennings was that i had attacked the art of medicine at the dinnertable with sufficient rashness and sufficient pertinacity to put even mr candy out of temper for the moment i also remembered that lady verinder had interfered to stop the dispute and that the little doctor and i had made it up again as the children say and had become as good friends as ever before we shook hands that night  there is one thing more said ezra jennings which it is very important i should know had you any reason for feeling any special anxiety about the diamond at this time last year  i had the strongest reasons for feeling anxiety about the diamond i knew it to be the object of a conspiracy and i was warned to take measures for miss verinders protection as the possessor of the stone  was the safety of the diamond the subject of conversation between you and any other person immediately before you retired to rest on the birthday night  it was the subject of a conversation between lady verinder and her daughter  which took place in your hearing  yes  ezra jennings took up his notes from the table and placed them in my hands  mr blake he said if you read those notes now by the light which my questions and your answers have thrown on them you will make two astounding discoveries concerning yourself you will findfirst that you entered miss verinders sittingroom and took the diamond in a state of trance produced by opium secondly that the opium was given to you by mr candywithout your own knowledgeas a practical refutation of the opinions which you had expressed to him at the birthday dinner  i sat with the papers in my hand completely stupefied  try and forgive poor mr candy said the assistant gently he has done dreadful mischief i own but he has done it innocently if you will look at the notes you will see thatbut for his illnesshe would have returned to lady verinders the morning after the party and would have acknowledged the trick that he had played you miss verinder would have heard of it and miss verinder would have questioned himand the truth which has laid hidden for a year would have been discovered in a day  i began to regain my selfpossession mr candy is beyond the reach of my resentment i said angrily but the trick that he played me is not the less an act of treachery for all that i may forgive but i shall not forget it  every medical man commits that act of treachery mr blake in the course of his practice the ignorant distrust of opium in england is by no means confined to the lower and less cultivated classes every doctor in large practice finds himself every now and then obliged to deceive his patients as mr candy deceived you i dont defend the folly of playing you a trick under the circumstances i only plead with you for a more accurate and more merciful construction of motives  how was it done i asked who gave me the laudanum without my knowing it myself  i am not able to tell you nothing relating to that part of the matter dropped from mr candys lips all through his illness perhaps your own memory may point to the person to be suspected  no  it is useless in that case to pursue the inquiry the laudanum was secretly given to you in some way let us leave it there and go on to matters of more immediate importance read my notes if you can familiarise your mind with what has happened in the past i have something very bold and very startling to propose to you which relates to the future  those last words roused me  i looked at the papers in the order in which ezra jennings had placed them in my hands the paper which contained the smaller quantity of writing was the uppermost of the two on this the disconnected words and fragments of sentences which had dropped from mr candy in his delirium appeared as follows   mr franklin blake  and agreeable  down a peg  medicine  confesses  sleep at night  tell him  out of order  medicine  he tells me  and groping in the dark mean one and the same thing  all the company at the dinnertable  i say  groping after sleep  nothing but medicine  he says  leading the blind  know what it means  witty  a nights rest in spite of his teeth  wants sleep  lady verinders medicine chest  fiveandtwenty minims  without his knowing it  tomorrow morning  well mr blake  medicine today  never  without it  out mr candy  excellent  without it  down on him  truth  something besides  excellent  dose of laudanum sir  bed  what  medicine now  there the first of the two sheets of paper came to an end i handed it back to ezra jennings  that is what you heard at his bedside i said  literally and exactly what i heard he answeredexcept that the repetitions are not transferred here from my shorthand notes he reiterated certain words and phrases a dozen times over fifty times over just as he attached more or less importance to the idea which they represented the repetitions in this sense were of some assistance to me in putting together those fragments dont suppose he added pointing to the second sheet of paper that i claim to have reproduced the expressions which mr candy himself would have used if he had been capable of speaking connectedly i only say that i have penetrated through the obstacle of the disconnected expression to the thought which was underlying it connectedly all the time judge for yourself  i turned to the second sheet of paper which i now knew to be the key to the first  once more mr candys wanderings appeared copied in black ink the intervals between the phrases being filled up by ezra jennings in red ink i reproduce the result here in one plain form the original language and the interpretation of it coming close enough together in these pages to be easily compared and verified   mr franklin blake is clever and agreeable but he wants taking down a peg when he talks of medicine he confesses that he has been suffering from want of sleep at night i tell him that his nerves are out of order and that he ought to take medicine he tells me that taking medicine and groping in the dark mean one and the same thing this before all the company at the dinnertable i say to him you are groping after sleep and nothing but medicine can help you to find it he says to me i have heard of the blind leading the blind and now i know what it means wittybut i can give him a nights rest in spite of his teeth he really wants sleep and lady verinders medicine chest is at my disposal give him fiveandtwenty minims of laudanum tonight without his knowing it and then call tomorrow morning well mr blake will you try a little medicine today you will never sleep without itthere you are out mr candy i have had an excellent nights rest without it then come down on him with the truth you have had something besides an excellent nights rest you had a dose of laudanum sir before you went to bed what do you say to the art of medicine now  admiration of the ingenuity which had woven this smooth and finished texture out of the ravelled skein was naturally the first impression that i felt on handing the manuscript back to ezra jennings he modestly interrupted the first few words in which my sense of surprise expressed itself by asking me if the conclusion which he had drawn from his notes was also the conclusion at which my own mind had arrived  do you believe as i believe he said that you were acting under the influence of the laudanum in doing all that you did on the night of miss verinders birthday in lady verinders house  i am too ignorant of the influence of laudanum to have an opinion of my own i answered i can only follow your opinion and feel convinced that you are right  very well the next question is this you are convinced and i am convincedhow are we to carry our conviction to the minds of other people  i pointed to the two manuscripts lying on the table between us ezra jennings shook his head  useless mr blake quite useless as they stand now for three unanswerable reasons in the first place those notes have been taken under circumstances entirely out of the experience of the mass of mankind against them to begin with in the second place those notes represent a medical and metaphysical theory against them once more in the third place those notes are of my making there is nothing but my assertion to the contrary to guarantee that they are not fabrications remember what i told you on the moorand ask yourself what my assertion is worth no my notes have but one value looking to the verdict of the world outside your innocence is to be vindicated and they show how it can be done we must put our conviction to the proofand you are the man to prove it  how i asked  he leaned eagerly nearer to me across the table that divided us  are you willing to try a bold experiment  i will do anything to clear myself of the suspicion that rests on me now  will you submit to some personal inconvenience for a time  to any inconvenience no matter what it may be  will you be guided implicitly by my advice it may expose you to the ridicule of fools it may subject you to the remonstrances of friends whose opinions you are bound to respect  tell me what to do i broke out impatiently and come what may ill do it  you shall do this mr blake he answered you shall steal the diamond unconsciously for the second time in the presence of witnesses whose testimony is beyond dispute  i started to my feet i tried to speak i could only look at him  i believe it can be done he went on and it shall be doneif you will only help me try to compose yourselfsit down and hear what i have to say to you you have resumed the habit of smoking i have seen that for myself how long have you resumed it  for nearly a year  do you smoke more or less than you did  more  will you give up the habit again suddenly mindas you gave it up before  i began dimly to see his drift i will give it up from this moment i answered  if the same consequences follow which followed last june said ezra jenningsif you suffer once more as you suffered then from sleepless nights we shall have gained our first step we shall have put you back again into something assimilating to your nervous condition on the birthday night if we can next revive or nearly revive the domestic circumstances which surrounded you and if we can occupy your mind again with the various questions concerning the diamond which formerly agitated it we shall have replaced you as nearly as possible in the same position physically and morally in which the opium found you last year in that case we may fairly hope that a repetition of the dose will lead in a greater or lesser degree to a repetition of the result there is my proposal expressed in a few hasty words you shall now see what reasons i have to justify me in making it  he turned to one of the books at his side and opened it at a place marked by a small slip of paper  dont suppose that i am going to weary you with a lecture on physiology he said i think myself bound to prove in justice to both of us that i am not asking you to try this experiment in deference to any theory of my own devising admitted principles and recognised authorities justify me in the view that i take give me five minutes of your attention and i will undertake to show you that science sanctions my proposal fanciful as it may seem here in the first place is the physiological principle on which i am acting stated by no less a person than dr carpenter read it for yourself  he handed me the slip of paper which had marked the place in the book it contained a few lines of writing as follows  there seems much ground for the belief that every sensory impression which has once been recognised by the perceptive consciousness is registered so to speak in the brain and may be reproduced at some subsequent time although there may be no consciousness of its existence in the mind during the whole intermediate period is that plain so far asked ezra jennings  perfectly plain  he pushed the open book across the table to me and pointed to a passage marked by pencil lines  now he said read that account of a case which hasas i believea direct bearing on your own position and on the experiment which i am tempting you to try observe mr blake before you begin that i am now referring you to one of the greatest of english physiologists the book in your hand is doctor elliotsons human physiology and the case which the doctor cites rests on the wellknown authority of mr combe  the passage pointed out to me was expressed in these terms  dr abel informed me says mr combe of an irish porter to a warehouse who forgot when sober what he had done when drunk but being drunk again recollected the transactions of his former state of intoxication on one occasion being drunk he had lost a parcel of some value and in his sober moments could give no account of it next time he was intoxicated he recollected that he had left the parcel at a certain house and there being no address on it it had remained there safely and was got on his calling for it  plain again asked ezra jennings  as plain as need be  he put back the slip of paper in its place and closed the book  are you satisfied that i have not spoken without good authority to support me he asked if not i have only to go to those bookshelves and you have only to read the passages which i can point out to you  i am quite satisfied i said without reading a word more  in that case we may return to your own personal interest in this matter i am bound to tell you that there is something to be said against the experiment as well as for it if we could this year exactly reproduce in your case the conditions as they existed last year it is physiologically certain that we should arrive at exactly the same result but thisthere is no denying itis simply impossible we can only hope to approximate to the conditions and if we dont succeed in getting you nearly enough back to what you were this venture of ours will fail if we do succeedand i am myself hopeful of successyou may at least so far repeat your proceedings on the birthday night as to satisfy any reasonable person that you are guiltless morally speaking of the theft of the diamond i believe mr blake i have now stated the question on both sides of it as fairly as i can within the limits that i have imposed on myself if there is anything that i have not made clear to you tell me what it isand if i can enlighten you i will  all that you have explained to me i said i understand perfectly but i own i am puzzled on one point which you have not made clear to me yet  what is the point  i dont understand the effect of the laudanum on me i dont understand my walking downstairs and along corridors and my opening and shutting the drawers of a cabinet and my going back again to my own room all these are active proceedings i thought the influence of opium was first to stupefy you and then to send you to sleep  the common error about opium mr blake i am at this moment exerting my intelligence such as it is in your service under the influence of a dose of laudanum some ten times larger than the dose mr candy administered to you but dont trust to my authorityeven on a question which comes within my own personal experience i anticipated the objection you have just made and i have again provided myself with independent testimony which will carry its due weight with it in your own mind and in the minds of your friends  he handed me the second of the two books which he had by him on the table  there he said are the farfamed confessions of an english opium eater take the book away with you and read it at the passage which i have marked you will find that when de quincey had committed what he calls a debauch of opium he either went to the gallery at the opera to enjoy the music or he wandered about the london markets on saturday night and interested himself in observing all the little shifts and bargainings of the poor in providing their sundays dinner so much for the capacity of a man to occupy himself actively and to move about from place to place under the influence of opium  i am answered so far i said but i am not answered yet as to the effect produced by the opium on myself  i will try to answer you in a few words said ezra jennings the action of opium is comprised in the majority of cases in two influencesa stimulating influence first and a sedative influence afterwards under the stimulating influence the latest and most vivid impressions left on your mindnamely the impressions relating to the diamondwould be likely in your morbidly sensitive nervous condition to become intensified in your brain and would subordinate to themselves your judgment and your will exactly as an ordinary dream subordinates to itself your judgment and your will little by little under this action any apprehensions about the safety of the diamond which you might have felt during the day would be liable to develop themselves from the state of doubt to the state of certaintywould impel you into practical action to preserve the jewelwould direct your steps with that motive in view into the room which you enteredand would guide your hand to the drawers of the cabinet until you had found the drawer which held the stone in the spiritualised intoxication of opium you would do all that later as the sedative action began to gain on the stimulant action you would slowly become inert and stupefied later still you would fall into a deep sleep when the morning came and the effect of the opium had been all slept off you would wake as absolutely ignorant of what you had done in the night as if you had been living at the antipodes have i made it tolerably clear to you so far  you have made it so clear i said that i want you to go farther you have shown me how i entered the room and how i came to take the diamond but miss verinder saw me leave the room again with the jewel in my hand can you trace my proceedings from that moment can you guess what i did next  that is the very point i was coming to he rejoined it is a question with me whether the experiment which i propose as a means of vindicating your innocence may not also be made a means of recovering the lost diamond as well when you left miss verinders sittingroom with the jewel in your hand you went back in all probability to your own room  yes and what then  it is possible mr blakei dare not say morethat your idea of preserving the diamond led by a natural sequence to the idea of hiding the diamond and that the place in which you hid it was somewhere in your bedroom in that event the case of the irish porter may be your case you may remember under the influence of the second dose of opium the place in which you hid the diamond under the influence of the first  it was my turn now to enlighten ezra jennings i stopped him before he could say any more  you are speculating i said on a result which cannot possibly take place the diamond is at this moment in london  he started and looked at me in great surprise  in london he repeated how did it get to london from lady verinders house  nobody knows  you removed it with your own hand from miss verinders room how was it taken out of your keeping  i have no idea how it was taken out of my keeping  did you see it when you woke in the morning  no  has miss verinder recovered possession of it  no  mr blake there seems to be something here which wants clearing up may i ask how you know that the diamond is at this moment in london  i had put precisely the same question to mr bruff when i made my first inquiries about the moonstone on my return to england in answering ezra jennings i accordingly repeated what i had myself heard from the lawyers own lipsand what is already familiar to the readers of these pages  he showed plainly that he was not satisfied with my reply  with all deference to you he said and with all deference to your legal adviser i maintain the opinion which i expressed just now it rests i am well aware on a mere assumption pardon me for reminding you that your opinion also rests on a mere assumption as well  the view he took of the matter was entirely new to me i waited anxiously to hear how he would defend it  i assume pursued ezra jennings that the influence of the opiumafter impelling you to possess yourself of the diamond with the purpose of securing its safetymight also impel you acting under the same influence and the same motive to hide it somewhere in your own room you assume that the hindoo conspirators could by no possibility commit a mistake the indians went to mr lukers house after the diamondand therefore in mr lukers possession the diamond must be have you any evidence to prove that the moonstone was taken to london at all you cant even guess how or by whom it was removed from lady verinders house have you any evidence that the jewel was pledged to mr luker he declares that he never heard of the moonstone and his bankers receipt acknowledges nothing but the deposit of a valuable of great price the indians assume that mr luker is lyingand you assume again that the indians are right all i say in differing with you isthat my view is possible what more mr blake either logically or legally can be said for yours  it was put strongly but there was no denying that it was put truly as well  i confess you stagger me i replied do you object to my writing to mr bruff and telling him what you have said  on the contrary i shall be glad if you will write to mr bruff if we consult his experience we may see the matter under a new light for the present let us return to our experiment with the opium we have decided that you leave off the habit of smoking from this moment  from this moment  that is the first step the next step is to reproduce as nearly as we can the domestic circumstances which surrounded you last year  how was this to be done lady verinder was dead rachel and i so long as the suspicion of theft rested on me were parted irrevocably godfrey ablewhite was away travelling on the continent it was simply impossible to reassemble the people who had inhabited the house when i had slept in it last the statement of this objection did not appear to embarrass ezra jennings he attached very little importance he said to reassembling the same peopleseeing that it would be vain to expect them to reassume the various positions which they had occupied towards me in the past times on the other hand he considered it essential to the success of the experiment that i should see the same objects about me which had surrounded me when i was last in the house  above all things he said you must sleep in the room which you slept in on the birthday night and it must be furnished in the same way the stairs the corridors and miss verinders sittingroom must also be restored to what they were when you saw them last it is absolutely necessary mr blake to replace every article of furniture in that part of the house which may now be put away the sacrifice of your cigars will be useless unless we can get miss verinders permission to do that  who is to apply to her for permission i asked  is it not possible for you to apply  quite out of the question after what has passed between us on the subject of the lost diamond i can neither see her nor write to her as things are now  ezra jennings paused and considered for a moment  may i ask you a delicate question he said  i signed to him to go on  am i right mr blake in fancying from one or two things which have dropped from you that you felt no common interest in miss verinder in former times  quite right  was the feeling returned  it was  do you think miss verinder would be likely to feel a strong interest in the attempt to prove your innocence  i am certain of it  in that case i will write to miss verinderif you will give me leave  telling her of the proposal that you have made to me  telling her of everything that has passed between us today  it is needless to say that i eagerly accepted the service which he had offered to me  i shall have time to write by todays post he said looking at his watch dont forget to lock up your cigars when you get back to the hotel i will call tomorrow morning and hear how you have passed the night  i rose to take leave of him and attempted to express the grateful sense of his kindness which i really felt  he pressed my hand gently remember what i told you on the moor he answered if i can do you this little service mr blake i shall feel it like a last gleam of sunshine falling on the evening of a long and clouded day    we parted it was then the fifteenth of june the events of the next ten daysevery one of them more or less directly connected with the experiment of which i was the passive objectare all placed on record exactly as they happened in the journal habitually kept by mr candys assistant in the pages of ezra jennings nothing is concealed and nothing is forgotten let ezra jennings tell how the venture with the opium was tried and how it ended     fourth narrative   extracted from the journal of ezra jennings   1849june 15 with some interruption from patients and some interruption from pain i finished my letter to miss verinder in time for todays post i failed to make it as short a letter as i could have wished but i think i have made it plain it leaves her entirely mistress of her own decision if she consents to assist the experiment she consents of her own free will and not as a favour to mr franklin blake or to me   june 16throse late after a dreadful night the vengeance of yesterdays opium pursuing me through a series of frightful dreams at one time i was whirling through empty space with the phantoms of the dead friends and enemies together at another the one beloved face which i shall never see again rose at my bedside hideously phosphorescent in the black darkness and glared and grinned at me a slight return of the old pain at the usual time in the early morning was welcome as a change it dispelled the visionsand it was bearable because it did that  my bad night made it late in the morning before i could get to mr franklin blake i found him stretched on the sofa breakfasting on brandy and sodawater and a dry biscuit  i am beginning as well as you could possibly wish he said a miserable restless night and a total failure of appetite this morning exactly what happened last year when i gave up my cigars the sooner i am ready for my second dose of laudanum the better i shall be pleased  you shall have it on the earliest possible day i answered in the meantime we must be as careful of your health as we can if we allow you to become exhausted we shall fail in that way you must get an appetite for your dinner in other words you must get a ride or a walk this morning in the fresh air  i will ride if they can find me a horse here bytheby i wrote to mr bruff yesterday have you written to miss verinder  yesby last nights post  very good we shall have some news worth hearing to tell each other tomorrow dont go yet i have a word to say to you you appeared to think yesterday that our experiment with the opium was not likely to be viewed very favourably by some of my friends you were quite right i call old gabriel betteredge one of my friends and you will be amused to hear that he protested strongly when i saw him yesterday you have done a wonderful number of foolish things in the course of your life mr franklin but this tops them all there is betteredges opinion you will make allowance for his prejudices i am sure if you and he happen to meet  i left mr blake to go my rounds among my patients feeling the better and the happier even for the short interview that i had had with him  what is the secret of the attraction that there is for me in this man does it only mean that i feel the contrast between the frankly kind manner in which he has allowed me to become acquainted with him and the merciless dislike and distrust with which i am met by other people or is there really something in him which answers to the yearning that i have for a little human sympathythe yearning which has survived the solitude and persecution of many years which seems to grow keener and keener as the time comes nearer and nearer when i shall endure and feel no more how useless to ask these questions mr blake has given me a new interest in life let that be enough without seeking to know what the new interest is   june 17thbefore breakfast this morning mr candy informed me that he was going away for a fortnight on a visit to a friend in the south of england he gave me as many special directions poor fellow about the patients as if he still had the large practice which he possessed before he was taken ill the practice is worth little enough now other doctors have superseded him and nobody who can help it will employ me  it is perhaps fortunate that he is to be away just at this time he would have been mortified if i had not informed him of the experiment which i am going to try with mr blake and i hardly know what undesirable results might not have happened if i had taken him into my confidence better as it is unquestionably better as it is  the post brought me miss verinders answer after mr candy had left the house  a charming letter it gives me the highest opinion of her there is no attempt to conceal the interest that she feels in our proceedings she tells me in the prettiest manner that my letter has satisfied her of mr blakes innocence without the slightest need so far as she is concerned of putting my assertion to the proof she even upbraids herselfmost undeservedly poor thingfor not having divined at the time what the true solution of the mystery might really be the motive underlying all this proceeds evidently from something more than a generous eagerness to make atonement for a wrong which she has innocently inflicted on another person it is plain that she has loved him throughout the estrangement between them in more than one place the rapture of discovering that he has deserved to be loved breaks its way innocently through the stoutest formalities of pen and ink and even defies the stronger restraint still of writing to a stranger is it possible i ask myself in reading this delightful letter that i of all men in the world am chosen to be the means of bringing these two young people together again my own happiness has been trampled under foot my own love has been torn from me shall i live to see a happiness of others which is of my makinga love renewed which is of my bringing back oh merciful death let me see it before your arms enfold me before your voice whispers to me rest at last  there are two requests contained in the letter one of them prevents me from showing it to mr franklin blake i am authorised to tell him that miss verinder willingly consents to place her house at our disposal and that said i am desired to add no more  so far it is easy to comply with her wishes but the second request embarrasses me seriously  not content with having written to mr betteredge instructing him to carry out whatever directions i may have to give miss verinder asks leave to assist me by personally superintending the restoration of her own sittingroom she only waits a word of reply from me to make the journey to yorkshire and to be present as one of the witnesses on the night when the opium is tried for the second time  here again there is a motive under the surface and here again i fancy that i can find it out  what she has forbidden me to tell mr franklin blake she is as i interpret it eager to tell him with her own lips before he is put to the test which is to vindicate his character in the eyes of other people i understand and admire this generous anxiety to acquit him without waiting until his innocence may or may not be proved it is the atonement that she is longing to make poor girl after having innocently and inevitably wronged him but the thing cannot be done i have no sort of doubt that the agitation which a meeting between them would produce on both sidesreviving dormant feelings appealing to old memories awakening new hopeswould in their effect on the mind of mr blake be almost certainly fatal to the success of our experiment it is hard enough as things are to reproduce in him the conditions as they existed or nearly as they existed last year with new interests and new emotions to agitate him the attempt would be simply useless  and yet knowing this i cannot find it in my heart to disappoint her i must try if i can discover some new arrangement before posttime which will allow me to say yes to miss verinder without damage to the service which i have bound myself to render to mr franklin blake  two oclocki have just returned from my round of medical visits having begun of course by calling at the hotel  mr blakes report of the night is the same as before he has had some intervals of broken sleep and no more but he feels it less today having slept after yesterdays dinner this afterdinner sleep is the result no doubt of the ride which i advised him to take i fear i shall have to curtail his restorative exercise in the fresh air he must not be too well he must not be too ill it is a case as a sailor would say of very fine steering  he has not heard yet from mr bruff i found him eager to know if i had received any answer from miss verinder  i told him exactly what i was permitted to tell and no more it was quite needless to invent excuses for not showing him the letter he told me bitterly enough poor fellow that he understood the delicacy which disinclined me to produce it she consents of course as a matter of common courtesy and common justice he said but she keeps her own opinion of me and waits to see the result i was sorely tempted to hint that he was now wronging her as she had wronged him on reflection i shrank from forestalling her in the double luxury of surprising and forgiving him  my visit was a very short one after the experience of the other night i have been compelled once more to give up my dose of opium as a necessary result the agony of the disease that is in me has got the upper hand again i felt the attack coming on and left abruptly so as not to alarm or distress him it only lasted a quarter of an hour this time and it left me strength enough to go on with my work  five oclocki have written my reply to miss verinder  the arrangement i have proposed reconciles the interests on both sides if she will only consent to it after first stating the objections that there are to a meeting between mr blake and herself before the experiment is tried i have suggested that she should so time her journey as to arrive at the house privately on the evening when we make the attempt travelling by the afternoon train from london she would delay her arrival until nine oclock at that hour i have undertaken to see mr blake safely into his bedchamber and so to leave miss verinder free to occupy her own rooms until the time comes for administering the laudanum when that has been done there can be no objection to her watching the result with the rest of us on the next morning she shall show mr blake if she likes her correspondence with me and shall satisfy him in that way that he was acquitted in her estimation before the question of his innocence was put to the proof  in that sense i have written to her this is all that i can do today tomorrow i must see mr betteredge and give the necessary directions for reopening the house   june 18thlate again in calling on mr franklin blake more of that horrible pain in the early morning followed this time by complete prostration for some hours i foresee in spite of the penalties which it exacts from me that i shall have to return to the opium for the hundredth time if i had only myself to think of i should prefer the sharp pains to the frightful dreams but the physical suffering exhausts me if i let myself sink it may end in my becoming useless to mr blake at the time when he wants me most  it was nearly one oclock before i could get to the hotel today the visit even in my shattered condition proved to be a most amusing onethanks entirely to the presence on the scene of gabriel betteredge  i found him in the room when i went in he withdrew to the window and looked out while i put my first customary question to my patient mr blake had slept badly again and he felt the loss of rest this morning more than he had felt it yet  i asked next if he had heard from mr bruff  a letter had reached him that morning mr bruff expressed the strongest disapproval of the course which his friend and client was taking under my advice it was mischievousfor it excited hopes that might never be realised it was quite unintelligible to his mind except that it looked like a piece of trickery akin to the trickery of mesmerism clairvoyance and the like it unsettled miss verinders house and it would end in unsettling miss verinder herself he had put the case without mentioning names to an eminent physician and the eminent physician had smiled had shaken his head and had saidnothing on these grounds mr bruff entered his protest and left it there  my next inquiry related to the subject of the diamond had the lawyer produced any evidence to prove that the jewel was in london  no the lawyer had simply declined to discuss the question he was himself satisfied that the moonstone had been pledged to mr luker his eminent absent friend mr murthwaite whose consummate knowledge of the indian character no one could deny was satisfied also under these circumstances and with the many demands already made on him he must decline entering into any disputes on the subject of evidence time would show and mr bruff was willing to wait for time  it was quite plaineven if mr blake had not made it plainer still by reporting the substance of the letter instead of reading what was actually writtenthat distrust of me was at the bottom of all this having myself foreseen that result i was neither mortified nor surprised i asked mr blake if his friends protest had shaken him he answered emphatically that it had not produced the slightest effect on his mind i was free after that to dismiss mr bruff from considerationand i did dismiss him accordingly  a pause in the talk between us followedand gabriel betteredge came out from his retirement at the window  can you favour me with your attention sir he inquired addressing himself to me  i am quite at your service i answered  betteredge took a chair and seated himself at the table he produced a huge oldfashioned leather pocketbook with a pencil of dimensions to match having put on his spectacles he opened the pocketbook at a blank page and addressed himself to me once more  i have lived said betteredge looking at me sternly nigh on fifty years in the service of my late lady i was pageboy before that in the service of the old lord her father i am now somewhere between seventy and eighty years of agenever mind exactly where i am reckoned to have got as pretty a knowledge and experience of the world as most men and what does it all end in it ends mr ezra jennings in a conjuring trick being performed on mr franklin blake by a doctors assistant with a bottle of laudanumand by the living jingo im appointed in my old age to be conjurers boy  mr blake burst out laughing i attempted to speak betteredge held up his hand in token that he had not done yet  not a word mr jennings he said it dont want a word sir from you i have got my principles thank god if an order comes to me which is own brother to an order come from bedlam it dont matter so long as i get it from my master or mistress as the case may be i obey it i may have my own opinion which is also you will please to remember the opinion of mr bruffthe great mr bruff said betteredge raising his voice and shaking his head at me solemnly it dont matter i withdraw my opinion for all that my young lady says do it and i say miss it shall be done here i am with my book and my pencilthe latter not pointed so well as i could wish but when christians take leave of their senses who is to expect that pencils will keep their points give me your orders mr jennings ill have them in writing sir im determined not to be behind em or before em by so much as a hairs breadth im a blind agentthats what i am a blind agent repeated betteredge with infinite relish of his own description of himself  i am very sorry i began that you and i dont agree  dont bring me into it interposed betteredge this is not a matter of agreement its a matter of obedience issue your directions sirissue your directions  mr blake made me a sign to take him at his word i issued my directions as plainly and as gravely as i could  i wish certain parts of the house to be reopened i said and to be furnished exactly as they were furnished at this time last year  betteredge gave his imperfectlypointed pencil a preliminary lick with his tongue name the parts mr jennings he said loftily  first the inner hall leading to the chief staircase  first the inner hall betteredge wrote impossible to furnish that sir as it was furnished last yearto begin with  why  because there was a stuffed buzzard mr jennings in the hall last year when the family left the buzzard was put away with the other things when the buzzard was put awayhe burst  we will except the buzzard then  betteredge took a note of the exception the inner hall to be furnished again as furnished last year a burst buzzard alone excepted please to go on mr jennings  the carpet to be laid down on the stairs as before  the carpet to be laid down on the stairs as before sorry to disappoint you sir but that cant be done either  why not  because the man who laid that carpet down is dead mr jenningsand the like of him for reconciling together a carpet and a corner is not to be found in all england look where you may  very well we must try the next best man in england  betteredge took another note and i went on issuing my directions  miss verinders sittingroom to be restored exactly to what it was last year also the corridor leading from the sittingroom to the first landing also the second corridor leading from the second landing to the best bedrooms also the bedroom occupied last june by mr franklin blake  betteredges blunt pencil followed me conscientiously word by word go on sir he said with sardonic gravity theres a deal of writing left in the point of this pencil yet  i told him that i had no more directions to give sir said betteredge in that case i have a point or two to put on my own behalf he opened the pocketbook at a new page and gave the inexhaustible pencil another preliminary lick  i wish to know he began whether i may or may not wash my hands  you may decidedly said mr blake ill ring for the waiter  of certain responsibilities pursued betteredge impenetrably declining to see anybody in the room but himself and me as to miss verinders sittingroom to begin with when we took up the carpet last year mr jennings we found a surprising quantity of pins am i responsible for putting back the pins  certainly not  betteredge made a note of that concession on the spot  as to the first corridor next he resumed when we moved the ornaments in that part we moved a statue of a fat naked childprofanely described in the catalogue of the house as cupid god of love he had two wings last year in the fleshy part of his shoulders my eye being off him for the moment he lost one of them am i responsible for cupids wing  i made another concession and betteredge made another note  as to the second corridor he went on there having been nothing in it last year but the doors of the rooms to every one of which i can swear if necessary my mind is easy i admit respecting that part of the house only but as to mr franklins bedroom if that is to be put back to what it was before i want to know who is responsible for keeping it in a perpetual state of litter no matter how often it may be set righthis trousers here his towels there and his french novels everywhere i say who is responsible for untidying the tidiness of mr franklins room him or me  mr blake declared that he would assume the whole responsibility with the greatest pleasure betteredge obstinately declined to listen to any solution of the difficulty without first referring it to my sanction and approval i accepted mr blakes proposal and betteredge made a last entry in the pocketbook to that effect  look in when you like mr jennings beginning from tomorrow he said getting on his legs you will find me at work with the necessary persons to assist me i respectfully beg to thank you sir for overlooking the case of the stuffed buzzard and the other case of the cupids wingas also for permitting me to wash my hands of all responsibility in respect of the pins on the carpet and the litter in mr franklins room speaking as a servant i am deeply indebted to you speaking as a man i consider you to be a person whose head is full of maggots and i take up my testimony against your experiment as a delusion and a snare dont be afraid on that account of my feelings as a man getting in the way of my duty as a servant you shall be obeyed the maggots notwithstanding sir you shall be obeyed if it ends in your setting the house on fire damme if i send for the engines unless you ring the bell and order them first  with that farewell assurance he made me a bow and walked out of the room  do you think we can depend on him i asked  implicitly answered mr blake when we go to the house we shall find nothing neglected and nothing forgotten   june 19thanother protest against our contemplated proceedings from a lady this time  the mornings post brought me two letters one from miss verinder consenting in the kindest manner to the arrangement that i have proposed the other from the lady under whose care she is livingone mrs merridew  mrs merridew presents her compliments and does not pretend to understand the subject on which i have been corresponding with miss verinder in its scientific bearings viewed in its social bearings however she feels free to pronounce an opinion i am probably mrs merridew thinks not aware that miss verinder is barely nineteen years of age to allow a young lady at her time of life to be present without a chaperone in a house full of men among whom a medical experiment is being carried on is an outrage on propriety which mrs merridew cannot possibly permit if the matter is allowed to proceed she will feel it to be her dutyat a serious sacrifice of her own personal convenienceto accompany miss verinder to yorkshire under these circumstances she ventures to request that i will kindly reconsider the subject seeing that miss verinder declines to be guided by any opinion but mine her presence cannot possibly be necessary and a word from me to that effect would relieve both mrs merridew and myself of a very unpleasant responsibility  translated from polite commonplace into plain english the meaning of this is as i take it that mrs merridew stands in mortal fear of the opinion of the world she has unfortunately appealed to the very last man in existence who has any reason to regard that opinion with respect i wont disappoint miss verinder and i wont delay a reconciliation between two young people who love each other and who have been parted too long already translated from plain english into polite commonplace this means that mr jennings presents his compliments to mrs merridew and regrets that he cannot feel justified in interfering any farther in the matter  mr blakes report of himself this morning was the same as before we determined not to disturb betteredge by overlooking him at the house today tomorrow will be time enough for our first visit of inspection   june 20thmr blake is beginning to feel his continued restlessness at night the sooner the rooms are refurnished now the better  on our way to the house this morning he consulted me with some nervous impatience and irresolution about a letter forwarded to him from london which he had received from sergeant cuff  the sergeant writes from ireland he acknowledges the receipt through his housekeeper of a card and message which mr blake left at his residence near dorking and announces his return to england as likely to take place in a week or less in the meantime he requests to be favoured with mr blakes reasons for wishing to speak to him as stated in the message on the subject of the moonstone if mr blake can convict him of having made any serious mistake in the course of his last years inquiry concerning the diamond he will consider it a duty after the liberal manner in which he was treated by the late lady verinder to place himself at that gentlemans disposal if not he begs permission to remain in his retirement surrounded by the peaceful horticultural attractions of a country life  after reading the letter i had no hesitation in advising mr blake to inform sergeant cuff in reply of all that had happened since the inquiry was suspended last year and to leave him to draw his own conclusions from the plain facts  on second thoughts i also suggested inviting the sergeant to be present at the experiment in the event of his returning to england in time to join us he would be a valuable witness to have in any case and if i proved to be wrong in believing the diamond to be hidden in mr blakes room his advice might be of great importance at a future stage of the proceedings over which i could exercise no control this last consideration appeared to decide mr blake he promised to follow my advice  the sound of the hammer informed us that the work of refurnishing was in full progress as we entered the drive that led to the house  betteredge attired for the occasion in a fishermans red cap and an apron of green baize met us in the outer hall the moment he saw me he pulled out the pocketbook and pencil and obstinately insisted on taking notes of everything that i said to him look where we might we found as mr blake had foretold that the work was advancing as rapidly and as intelligently as it was possible to desire but there was still much to be done in the inner hall and in miss verinders room it seemed doubtful whether the house would be ready for us before the end of the week  having congratulated betteredge on the progress that he had made he persisted in taking notes every time i opened my lips declining at the same time to pay the slightest attention to anything said by mr blake and having promised to return for a second visit of inspection in a day or two we prepared to leave the house going out by the back way before we were clear of the passages downstairs i was stopped by betteredge just as i was passing the door which led into his own room  could i say two words to you in private he asked in a mysterious whisper  i consented of course mr blake walked on to wait for me in the garden while i accompanied betteredge into his room i fully anticipated a demand for certain new concessions following the precedent already established in the cases of the stuffed buzzard and the cupids wing to my great surprise betteredge laid his hand confidentially on my arm and put this extraordinary question to me  mr jennings do you happen to be acquainted with robinson crusoe  i answered that i had read robinson crusoe when i was a child  not since then inquired betteredge  not since then  he fell back a few steps and looked at me with an expression of compassionate curiosity tempered by superstitious awe  he has not read robinson crusoe since he was a child said betteredge speaking to himselfnot to me lets try how robinson crusoe strikes him now  he unlocked a cupboard in a corner and produced a dirty and dogseared book which exhaled a strong odour of stale tobacco as he turned over the leaves having found a passage of which he was apparently in search he requested me to join him in the corner still mysteriously confidential and still speaking under his breath  in respect to this hocuspocus of yours sir with the laudanum and mr franklin blake he began while the workpeople are in the house my duty as a servant gets the better of my feelings as a man when the workpeople are gone my feelings as a man get the better of my duty as a servant very good last night mr jennings it was borne in powerfully on my mind that this new medical enterprise of yours would end badly if i had yielded to that secret dictate i should have put all the furniture away again with my own hand and have warned the workmen off the premises when they came the next morning  i am glad to find from what i have seen upstairs i said that you resisted the secret dictate  resisted isnt the word answered betteredge wrostled is the word i wrostled sir between the silent orders in my bosom pulling me one way and the written orders in my pocketbook pushing me the other until saving your presence i was in a cold sweat in that dreadful perturbation of mind and laxity of body to what remedy did i apply to the remedy sir which has never failed me yet for the last thirty years and moreto this book  he hit the book a sounding blow with his open hand and struck out of it a stronger smell of stale tobacco than ever  what did i find here pursued betteredge at the first page i opened this awful bit sir page one hundred and seventyeight as followsupon these and many like reflections i afterwards made it a certain rule with me that whenever i found those secret hints or pressings of my mind to doing or not doing any thing that presented or to going this way or that way i never failed to obey the secret dictate as i live by bread mr jennings those were the first words that met my eye exactly at the time when i myself was setting the secret dictate at defiance you dont see anything at all out of the common in that do you sir  i see a coincidencenothing more  you dont feel at all shaken mr jennings in respect to this medical enterprise of yours  not the least in the world  betteredge stared hard at me in dead silence he closed the book with great deliberation he locked it up again in the cupboard with extraordinary care he wheeled round and stared hard at me once more then he spoke  sir he said gravely there are great allowances to be made for a man who has not read robinson crusoe since he was a child i wish you good morning  he opened his door with a low bow and left me at liberty to find my own way into the garden i met mr blake returning to the house  you neednt tell me what has happened he said betteredge has played his last card he has made another prophetic discovery in robinson crusoe have you humoured his favourite delusion no you have let him see that you dont believe in robinson crusoe mr jennings you have fallen to the lowest possible place in betteredges estimation say what you like and do what you like for the future you will find that he wont waste another word on you now   june 21sta short entry must suffice in my journal today  mr blake has had the worst night that he has passed yet i have been obliged greatly against my will to prescribe for him men of his sensitive organisation are fortunately quick in feeling the effect of remedial measures otherwise i should be inclined to fear that he will be totally unfit for the experiment when the time comes to try it  as for myself after some little remission of my pains for the last two days i had an attack this morning of which i shall say nothing but that it has decided me to return to the opium i shall close this book and take my full dosefive hundred drops   june 22ndour prospects look better today mr blakes nervous suffering is greatly allayed he slept a little last night my night thanks to the opium was the night of a man who is stunned i cant say that i woke this morning the fitter expression would be that i recovered my senses  we drove to the house to see if the refurnishing was done it will be completed tomorrowsaturday as mr blake foretold betteredge raised no further obstacles from first to last he was ominously polite and ominously silent  my medical enterprise as betteredge calls it must now inevitably be delayed until monday next tomorrow evening the workmen will be late in the house on the next day the established sunday tyranny which is one of the institutions of this free country so times the trains as to make it impossible to ask anybody to travel to us from london until monday comes there is nothing to be done but to watch mr blake carefully and to keep him if possible in the same state in which i find him today  in the meanwhile i have prevailed on him to write to mr bruff making a point of it that he shall be present as one of the witnesses i especially choose the lawyer because he is strongly prejudiced against us if we convince him we place our victory beyond the possibility of dispute  mr blake has also written to sergeant cuff and i have sent a line to miss verinder with these and with old betteredge who is really a person of importance in the family we shall have witnesses enough for the purposewithout including mrs merridew if mrs merridew persists in sacrificing herself to the opinion of the world   june 23rdthe vengeance of the opium overtook me again last night no matter i must go on with it now till monday is past and gone  mr blake is not so well again today at two this morning he confesses that he opened the drawer in which his cigars are put away he only succeeded in locking it up again by a violent effort his next proceeding in case of temptation was to throw the key out of window the waiter brought it in this morning discovered at the bottom of an empty cisternsuch is fate i have taken possession of the key until tuesday next   june 24thmr blake and i took a long drive in an open carriage we both felt beneficially the blessed influence of the soft summer air i dined with him at the hotel to my great relieffor i found him in an overwrought overexcited state this morninghe had two hours sound sleep on the sofa after dinner if he has another bad night nowi am not afraid of the consequence   june 25th mondaythe day of the experiment it is five oclock in the afternoon we have just arrived at the house  the first and foremost question is the question of mr blakes health  so far as it is possible for me to judge he promises physically speaking to be quite as susceptible to the action of the opium tonight as he was at this time last year he is this afternoon in a state of nervous sensitiveness which just stops short of nervous irritation he changes colour readily his hand is not quite steady and he starts at chance noises and at unexpected appearances of persons and things  these results have all been produced by deprivation of sleep which is in its turn the nervous consequence of a sudden cessation in the habit of smoking after that habit has been carried to an extreme here are the same causes at work again which operated last year and here are apparently the same effects will the parallel still hold good when the final test has been tried the events of the night must decide  while i write these lines mr blake is amusing himself at the billiard table in the inner hall practising different strokes in the game as he was accustomed to practise them when he was a guest in this house in june last i have brought my journal here partly with a view to occupying the idle hours which i am sure to have on my hands between this and tomorrow morning partly in the hope that something may happen which it may be worth my while to place on record at the time  have i omitted anything thus far a glance at yesterdays entry shows me that i have forgotten to note the arrival of the mornings post let me set this right before i close these leaves for the present and join mr blake  i received a few lines then yesterday from miss verinder she has arranged to travel by the afternoon train as i recommended mrs merridew has insisted on accompanying her the note hints that the old ladys generally excellent temper is a little ruffled and requests all due indulgence for her in consideration of her age and her habits i will endeavour in my relations with mrs merridew to emulate the moderation which betteredge displays in his relations with me he received us today portentously arrayed in his best black suit and his stiffest white cravat whenever he looks my way he remembers that i have not read robinson crusoe since i was a child and he respectfully pities me  yesterday also mr blake had the lawyers answer mr bruff accepts the invitationunder protest it is he thinks clearly necessary that a gentleman possessed of the average allowance of common sense should accompany miss verinder to the scene of what we will venture to call the proposed exhibition for want of a better escort mr bruff himself will be that gentlemanso here is poor miss verinder provided with two chaperones it is a relief to think that the opinion of the world must surely be satisfied with this  nothing has been heard of sergeant cuff he is no doubt still in ireland we must not expect to see him tonight  betteredge has just come in to say that mr blake has asked for me i must lay down my pen for the present        seven oclockwe have been all over the refurnished rooms and staircases again and we have had a pleasant stroll in the shrubbery which was mr blakes favourite walk when he was here last in this way i hope to revive the old impressions of places and things as vividly as possible in his mind  we are now going to dine exactly at the hour at which the birthday dinner was given last year my object of course is a purely medical one in this case the laudanum must find the process of digestion as nearly as may be where the laudanum found it last year  at a reasonable time after dinner i propose to lead the conversation back againas inartificially as i canto the subject of the diamond and of the indian conspiracy to steal it when i have filled his mind with these topics i shall have done all that it is in my power to do before the time comes for giving him the second dose        halfpast eighti have only this moment found an opportunity of attending to the most important duty of all the duty of looking in the family medicine chest for the laudanum which mr candy used last year  ten minutes since i caught betteredge at an unoccupied moment and told him what i wanted without a word of objection without so much as an attempt to produce his pocketbook he led the way making allowances for me at every step to the storeroom in which the medicine chest is kept  i discovered the bottle carefully guarded by a glass stopper tied over with leather the preparation which it contained was as i had anticipated the common tincture of opium finding the bottle still well filled i have resolved to use it in preference to employing either of the two preparations with which i had taken care to provide myself in case of emergency  the question of the quantity which i am to administer presents certain difficulties i have thought it over and have decided on increasing the dose  my notes inform me that mr candy only administered twentyfive minims this is a small dose to have produced the results which followedeven in the case of a person so sensitive as mr blake i think it highly probable that mr candy gave more than he supposed himself to have givenknowing as i do that he has a keen relish of the pleasures of the table and that he measured out the laudanum on the birthday after dinner in any case i shall run the risk of enlarging the dose to forty minims on this occasion mr blake knows beforehand that he is going to take the laudanumwhich is equivalent physiologically speaking to his having unconsciously to himself a certain capacity in him to resist the effects if my view is right a larger quantity is therefore imperatively required this time to repeat the results which the smaller quantity produced last year        ten oclockthe witnesses or the company which shall i call them reached the house an hour since  a little before nine oclock i prevailed on mr blake to accompany me to his bedroom stating as a reason that i wished him to look round it for the last time in order to make quite sure that nothing had been forgotten in the refurnishing of the room i had previously arranged with betteredge that the bedchamber prepared for mr bruff should be the next room to mr blakes and that i should be informed of the lawyers arrival by a knock at the door five minutes after the clock in the hall had struck nine i heard the knock and going out immediately met mr bruff in the corridor  my personal appearance as usual told against me mr bruffs distrust looked at me plainly enough out of mr bruffs eyes being well used to producing this effect on strangers i did not hesitate a moment in saying what i wanted to say before the lawyer found his way into mr blakes room  you have travelled here i believe in company with mrs merridew and miss verinder i said  yes answered mr bruff as drily as might be  miss verinder has probably told you that i wish her presence in the house and mrs merridews presence of course to be kept a secret from mr blake until my experiment on him has been tried first  i know that i am to hold my tongue sir said mr bruff impatiently being habitually silent on the subject of human folly i am all the readier to keep my lips closed on this occasion does that satisfy you  i bowed and left betteredge to show him to his room betteredge gave me one look at parting which said as if in so many words you have caught a tartar mr jenningsand the name of him is bruff  it was next necessary to get the meeting over with the two ladies i descended the stairsa little nervously i confesson my way to miss verinders sittingroom  the gardeners wife charged with looking after the accommodation of the ladies met me in the firstfloor corridor this excellent woman treats me with an excessive civility which is plainly the offspring of downright terror she stares trembles and curtseys whenever i speak to her on my asking for miss verinder she stared trembled and would no doubt have curtseyed next if miss verinder herself had not cut that ceremony short by suddenly opening her sittingroom door  is that mr jennings she asked  before i could answer she came out eagerly to speak to me in the corridor we met under the light of a lamp on a bracket at the first sight of me miss verinder stopped and hesitated she recovered herself instantly coloured for a momentand then with a charming frankness offered me her hand  i cant treat you like a stranger mr jennings she said oh if you only knew how happy your letters have made me  she looked at my ugly wrinkled face with a bright gratitude so new to me in my experience of my fellowcreatures that i was at a loss how to answer her nothing had prepared me for her kindness and her beauty the misery of many years has not hardened my heart thank god i was as awkward and as shy with her as if i had been a lad in my teens  where is he now she asked giving free expression to her one dominant interestthe interest in mr blake what is he doing has he spoken of me is he in good spirits how does he bear the sight of the house after what happened in it last year when are you going to give him the laudanum may i see you pour it out i am so interested i am so excitedi have ten thousand things to say to you and they all crowd together so that i dont know what to say first do you wonder at the interest i take in this  no i said i venture to think that i thoroughly understand it  she was far above the paltry affectation of being confused she answered me as she might have answered a brother or a father  you have relieved me of indescribable wretchedness you have given me a new life how can i be ungrateful enough to have any concealment from you i love him she said simply i have loved him from first to lasteven when i was wronging him in my own thoughts even when i was saying the hardest and the cruellest words to him is there any excuse for me in that i hope there isi am afraid it is the only excuse i have when tomorrow comes and he knows that i am in the house do you think  she stopped again and looked at me very earnestly  when tomorrow comes i said i think you have only to tell him what you have just told me  her face brightened she came a step nearer to me her fingers trifled nervously with a flower which i had picked in the garden and which i had put into the buttonhole of my coat  you have seen a great deal of him lately she said have you really and truly seen that  really and truly i answered i am quite certain of what will happen tomorrow i wish i could feel as certain of what will happen tonight  at that point in the conversation we were interrupted by the appearance of betteredge with the teatray he gave me another significant look as he passed on into the sittingroom aye aye make your hay while the sun shines the tartars upstairs mr jenningsthe tartars upstairs  we followed him into the room a little old lady in a corner very nicely dressed and very deeply absorbed over a smart piece of embroidery dropped her work in her lap and uttered a faint little scream at the first sight of my gipsy complexion and my piebald hair  mrs merridew said miss verinder this is mr jennings  i beg mr jenningss pardon said the old lady looking at miss verinder and speaking at me railway travelling always makes me nervous i am endeavouring to quiet my mind by occupying myself as usual i dont know whether my embroidery is out of place on this extraordinary occasion if it interferes with mr jenningss medical views i shall be happy to put it away of course  i hastened to sanction the presence of the embroidery exactly as i had sanctioned the absence of the burst buzzard and the cupids wing mrs merridew made an efforta grateful effortto look at my hair no it was not to be done mrs merridew looked back again at miss verinder  if mr jennings will permit me pursued the old lady i should like to ask a favour mr jennings is about to try a scientific experiment tonight i used to attend scientific experiments when i was a girl at school they invariably ended in an explosion if mr jennings will be so very kind i should like to be warned of the explosion this time with a view to getting it over if possible before i go to bed  i attempted to assure mrs merridew that an explosion was not included in the programme on this occasion  no said the old lady i am much obliged to mr jenningsi am aware that he is only deceiving me for my own good i prefer plain dealing i am quite resigned to the explosionbut i do want to get it over if possible before i go to bed  here the door opened and mrs merridew uttered another little scream the advent of the explosion no only the advent of betteredge  i beg your pardon mr jennings said betteredge in his most elaborately confidential manner mr franklin wishes to know where you are being under your orders to deceive him in respect to the presence of my young lady in the house i have said i dont know that you will please to observe was a lie having one foot already in the grave sir the fewer lies you expect me to tell the more i shall be indebted to you when my conscience pricks me and my time comes  there was not a moment to be wasted on the purely speculative question of betteredges conscience mr blake might make his appearance in search of me unless i went to him at once in his own room miss verinder followed me out into the corridor  they seem to be in a conspiracy to persecute you she said what does it mean  only the protest of the world miss verinderon a very small scaleagainst anything that is new  what are we to do with mrs merridew  tell her the explosion will take place at nine tomorrow morning  so as to send her to bed  yesso as to send her to bed  miss verinder went back to the sittingroom and i went upstairs to mr blake  to my surprise i found him alone restlessly pacing his room and a little irritated at being left by himself  where is mr bruff i asked  he pointed to the closed door of communication between the two rooms mr bruff had looked in on him for a moment had attempted to renew his protest against our proceedings and had once more failed to produce the smallest impression on mr blake upon this the lawyer had taken refuge in a black leather bag filled to bursting with professional papers the serious business of life he admitted was sadly out of place on such an occasion as the present but the serious business of life must be carried on for all that mr blake would perhaps kindly make allowance for the oldfashioned habits of a practical man time was moneyand as for mr jennings he might depend on it that mr bruff would be forthcoming when called upon with that apology the lawyer had gone back to his own room and had immersed himself obstinately in his black bag  i thought of mrs merridew and her embroidery and of betteredge and his conscience there is a wonderful sameness in the solid side of the english characterjust as there is a wonderful sameness in the solid expression of the english face  when are you going to give me the laudanum asked mr blake impatiently  you must wait a little longer i said i will stay and keep you company till the time comes  it was then not ten oclock inquiries which i had made at various times of betteredge and mr blake had led me to the conclusion that the dose of laudanum given by mr candy could not possibly have been administered before eleven i had accordingly determined not to try the second dose until that time  we talked a little but both our minds were preoccupied by the coming ordeal the conversation soon flaggedthen dropped altogether mr blake idly turned over the books on his bedroom table i had taken the precaution of looking at them when we first entered the room the guardian the tatler richardsons pamela mackenzies man of feeling roscoes lorenzo de medici and robertsons charles the fifthall classical works all of course immeasurably superior to anything produced in later times and all from my present point of view possessing the one great merit of enchaining nobodys interest and exciting nobodys brain i left mr blake to the composing influence of standard literature and occupied myself in making this entry in my journal  my watch informs me that it is close on eleven oclock i must shut up these leaves once more        two oclock amthe experiment has been tried with what result i am now to describe  at eleven oclock i rang the bell for betteredge and told mr blake that he might at last prepare himself for bed  i looked out of the window at the night it was mild and rainy resembling in this respect the night of the birthdaythe twentyfirst of june last year without professing to believe in omens it was at least encouraging to find no direct nervous influencesno stormy or electric perturbationsin the atmosphere betteredge joined me at the window and mysteriously put a little slip of paper into my hand it contained these lines  mrs merridew has gone to bed on the distinct understanding that the explosion is to take place at nine tomorrow morning and that i am not to stir out of this part of the house until she comes and sets me free she has no idea that the chief scene of the experiment is my sittingroomor she would have remained in it for the whole night i am alone and very anxious pray let me see you measure out the laudanum i want to have something to do with it even in the unimportant character of a mere lookeronrv  i followed betteredge out of the room and told him to remove the medicinechest into miss verinders sittingroom  the order appeared to take him completely by surprise he looked as if he suspected me of some occult medical design on miss verinder might i presume to ask he said what my young lady and the medicinechest have got to do with each other  stay in the sittingroom and you will see  betteredge appeared to doubt his own unaided capacity to superintend me effectually on an occasion when a medicinechest was included in the proceedings  is there any objection sir he asked to taking mr bruff into this part of the business  quite the contrary i am now going to ask mr bruff to accompany me downstairs  betteredge withdrew to fetch the medicinechest without another word i went back into mr blakes room and knocked at the door of communication mr bruff opened it with his papers in his handimmersed in law impenetrable to medicine  i am sorry to disturb you i said but i am going to prepare the laudanum for mr blake and i must request you to be present and to see what i do  yes said mr bruff with ninetenths of his attention riveted on his papers and with onetenth unwillingly accorded to me anything else  i must trouble you to return here with me and to see me administer the dose  anything else  one thing more i must put you to the inconvenience of remaining in mr blakes room and of waiting to see what happens  oh very good said mr bruff my room or mr blakes roomit doesnt matter which i can go on with my papers anywhere unless you object mr jennings to my importing that amount of common sense into the proceedings  before i could answer mr blake addressed himself to the lawyer speaking from his bed  do you really mean to say that you dont feel any interest in what we are going to do he asked mr bruff you have no more imagination than a cow  a cow is a very useful animal mr blake said the lawyer with that reply he followed me out of the room still keeping his papers in his hand  we found miss verinder pale and agitated restlessly pacing her sittingroom from end to end at a table in a corner stood betteredge on guard over the medicinechest mr bruff sat down on the first chair that he could find and emulating the usefulness of the cow plunged back again into his papers on the spot  miss verinder drew me aside and reverted instantly to her one allabsorbing interesther interest in mr blake  how is he now she asked is he nervous is he out of temper do you think it will succeed are you sure it will do no harm  quite sure come and see me measure it out  one moment it is past eleven now how long will it be before anything happens  it is not easy to say an hour perhaps  i suppose the room must be dark as it was last year  certainly  i shall wait in my bedroomjust as i did before i shall keep the door a little way open it was a little way open last year i will watch the sittingroom door and the moment it moves i will blow out my light it all happened in that way on my birthday night and it must all happen again in the same way musnt it  are you sure you can control yourself miss verinder  in his interests i can do anything she answered fervently  one look at her face told me that i could trust her i addressed myself again to mr bruff  i must trouble you to put your papers aside for a moment i said  oh certainly he got up with a startas if i had disturbed him at a particularly interesting placeand followed me to the medicinechest there deprived of the breathless excitement incidental to the practice of his profession he looked at betteredgeand yawned wearily  miss verinder joined me with a glass jug of cold water which she had taken from a sidetable let me pour out the water she whispered i must have a hand in it  i measured out the forty minims from the bottle and poured the laudanum into a medicine glass fill it till it is three parts full i said and handed the glass to miss verinder i then directed betteredge to lock up the medicine chest informing him that i had done with it now a look of unutterable relief overspread the old servants countenance he had evidently suspected me of a medical design on his young lady  after adding the water as i had directed miss verinder seized a momentwhile betteredge was locking the chest and while mr bruff was looking back to his papersand slyly kissed the rim of the medicine glass when you give it to him said the charming girl give it to him on that side  i took the piece of crystal which was to represent the diamond from my pocket and gave it to her  you must have a hand in this too i said you must put it where you put the moonstone last year  she led the way to the indian cabinet and put the mock diamond into the drawer which the real diamond had occupied on the birthday night mr bruff witnessed this proceeding under protest as he had witnessed everything else but the strong dramatic interest which the experiment was now assuming proved to my great amusement to be too much for betteredges capacity of self restraint his hand trembled as he held the candle and he whispered anxiously are you sure miss its the right drawer  i led the way out again with the laudanum and water in my hand at the door i stopped to address a last word to miss verinder  dont be long in putting out the lights i said  i will put them out at once she answered and i will wait in my bedroom with only one candle alight  she closed the sittingroom door behind us followed by mr bruff and betteredge i went back to mr blakes room  we found him moving restlessly from side to side of the bed and wondering irritably whether he was to have the laudanum that night in the presence of the two witnesses i gave him the dose and shook up his pillows and told him to lie down again quietly and wait  his bed provided with light chintz curtains was placed with the head against the wall of the room so as to leave a good open space on either side of it on one side i drew the curtains completelyand in the part of the room thus screened from his view i placed mr bruff and betteredge to wait for the result at the bottom of the bed i half drew the curtainsand placed my own chair at a little distance so that i might let him see me or not see me speak to me or not speak to me just as the circumstances might direct having already been informed that he always slept with a light in the room i placed one of the two lighted candles on a little table at the head of the bed where the glare of the light would not strike on his eyes the other candle i gave to mr bruff the light in this instance being subdued by the screen of the chintz curtains the window was open at the top so as to ventilate the room the rain fell softly the house was quiet it was twenty minutes past eleven by my watch when the preparations were completed and i took my place on the chair set apart at the bottom of the bed  mr bruff resumed his papers with every appearance of being as deeply interested in them as ever but looking towards him now i saw certain signs and tokens which told me that the law was beginning to lose its hold on him at last the suspended interest of the situation in which we were now placed was slowly asserting its influence even on his unimaginative mind as for betteredge consistency of principle and dignity of conduct had become in his case mere empty words he forgot that i was performing a conjuring trick on mr franklin blake he forgot that i had upset the house from top to bottom he forgot that i had not read robinson crusoe since i was a child for the lords sake sir he whispered to me tell us when it will begin to work  not before midnight i whispered back say nothing and sit still  betteredge dropped to the lowest depth of familiarity with me without a struggle to save himself he answered by a wink  looking next towards mr blake i found him as restless as ever in his bed fretfully wondering why the influence of the laudanum had not begun to assert itself yet to tell him in his present humour that the more he fidgeted and wondered the longer he would delay the result for which we were now waiting would have been simply useless the wiser course to take was to dismiss the idea of the opium from his mind by leading him insensibly to think of something else  with this view i encouraged him to talk to me contriving so to direct the conversation on my side as to lead it back again to the subject which had engaged us earlier in the eveningthe subject of the diamond i took care to revert to those portions of the story of the moonstone which related to the transport of it from london to yorkshire to the risk which mr blake had run in removing it from the bank at frizinghall and to the unexpected appearance of the indians at the house on the evening of the birthday and i purposely assumed in referring to these events to have misunderstood much of what mr blake himself had told me a few hours since in this way i set him talking on the subject with which it was now vitally important to fill his mindwithout allowing him to suspect that i was making him talk for a purpose little by little he became so interested in putting me right that he forgot to fidget in the bed his mind was far away from the question of the opium at the allimportant time when his eyes first told me that the opium was beginning to lay its hold on his brain  i looked at my watch it wanted five minutes to twelve when the premonitory symptoms of the working of the laudanum first showed themselves to me  at this time no unpractised eyes would have detected any change in him but as the minutes of the new morning wore away the swiftlysubtle progress of the influence began to show itself more plainly the sublime intoxication of opium gleamed in his eyes the dew of a stealthy perspiration began to glisten on his face in five minutes more the talk which he still kept up with me failed in coherence he held steadily to the subject of the diamond but he ceased to complete his sentences a little later the sentences dropped to single words then there was an interval of silence then he sat up in bed then still busy with the subject of the diamond he began to talk againnot to me but to himself that change told me that the first stage in the experiment was reached the stimulant influence of the opium had got him  the time now was twentythree minutes past twelve the next half hour at most would decide the question of whether he would or would not get up from his bed and leave the room  in the breathless interest of watching himin the unutterable triumph of seeing the first result of the experiment declare itself in the manner and nearly at the time which i had anticipatedi had utterly forgotten the two companions of my night vigil looking towards them now i saw the law as represented by mr bruffs papers lying unheeded on the floor mr bruff himself was looking eagerly through a crevice left in the imperfectlydrawn curtains of the bed and betteredge oblivious of all respect for social distinctions was peeping over mr bruffs shoulder  they both started back on finding that i was looking at them like two boys caught out by their schoolmaster in a fault i signed to them to take off their boots quietly as i was taking off mine if mr blake gave us the chance of following him it was vitally necessary to follow him without noise  ten minutes passedand nothing happened then he suddenly threw the bedclothes off him he put one leg out of bed he waited  i wish i had never taken it out of the bank he said to himself it was safe in the bank  my heart throbbed fast the pulses at my temples beat furiously the doubt about the safety of the diamond was once more the dominant impression in his brain on that one pivot the whole success of the experiment turned the prospect thus suddenly opened before me was too much for my shattered nerves i was obliged to look away from himor i should have lost my selfcontrol  there was another interval of silence  when i could trust myself to look back at him he was out of his bed standing erect at the side of it the pupils of his eyes were now contracted his eyeballs gleamed in the light of the candle as he moved his head slowly to and fro he was thinking he was doubtinghe spoke again  how do i know he said the indians may be hidden in the house  he stopped and walked slowly to the other end of the room he turnedwaitedcame back to the bed  its not even locked up he went on its in the drawer of her cabinet and the drawer doesnt lock  he sat down on the side of the bed anybody might take it he said  he rose again restlessly and reiterated his first words  how do i know the indians may be hidden in the house  he waited again i drew back behind the half curtain of the bed he looked about the room with a vacant glitter in his eyes it was a breathless moment there was a pause of some sort a pause in the action of the opium a pause in the action of the brain who could tell everything depended now on what he did next  he laid himself down again on the bed  a horrible doubt crossed my mind was it possible that the sedative action of the opium was making itself felt already it was not in my experience that it should do this but what is experience where opium is concerned there are probably no two men in existence on whom the drug acts in exactly the same manner was some constitutional peculiarity in him feeling the influence in some new way were we to fail on the very brink of success  no he got up again abruptly how the devil am i to sleep he said with this on my mind  he looked at the light burning on the table at the head of his bed after a moment he took the candle in his hand  i blew out the second candle burning behind the closed curtains i drew back with mr bruff and betteredge into the farthest corner by the bed i signed to them to be silent as if their lives had depended on it  we waitedseeing and hearing nothing we waited hidden from him by the curtains  the light which he was holding on the other side of us moved suddenly the next moment he passed us swift and noiseless with the candle in his hand  he opened the bedroom door and went out  we followed him along the corridor we followed him down the stairs we followed him along the second corridor he never looked back he never hesitated  he opened the sittingroom door and went in leaving it open behind him  the door was hung like all the other doors in the house on large oldfashioned hinges when it was opened a crevice was opened between the door and the post i signed to my two companions to look through this so as to keep them from showing themselves i placed myselfoutside the door alsoon the opposite side a recess in the wall was at my left hand in which i could instantly hide myself if he showed any signs of looking back into the corridor  he advanced to the middle of the room with the candle still in his hand he looked about himbut he never looked back  i saw the door of miss verinders bedroom standing ajar she had put out her light she controlled herself nobly the dim white outline of her summer dress was all that i could see nobody who had not known it beforehand would have suspected that there was a living creature in the room she kept back in the dark not a word not a movement escaped her  it was now ten minutes past one i heard through the dead silence the soft drip of the rain and the tremulous passage of the night air through the trees  after waiting irresolute for a minute or more in the middle of the room he moved to the corner near the window where the indian cabinet stood  he put his candle on the top of the cabinet he opened and shut one drawer after another until he came to the drawer in which the mock diamond was put he looked into the drawer for a moment then he took the mock diamond out with his right hand with the other hand he took the candle from the top of the cabinet  he walked back a few steps towards the middle of the room and stood still again  thus far he had exactly repeated what he had done on the birthday night would his next proceeding be the same as the proceeding of last year would he leave the room would he go back now as i believed he had gone back then to his bedchamber would he show us what he had done with the diamond when he had returned to his own room  his first action when he moved once more proved to be an action which he had not performed when he was under the influence of the opium for the first time he put the candle down on a table and wandered on a little towards the farther end of the room there was a sofa there he leaned heavily on the back of it with his left handthen roused himself and returned to the middle of the room i could now see his eyes they were getting dull and heavy the glitter in them was fast dying out  the suspense of the moment proved too much for miss verinders selfcontrol she advanced a few stepsthen stopped again mr bruff and betteredge looked across the open doorway at me for the first time the prevision of a coming disappointment was impressing itself on their minds as well as on mine  still so long as he stood where he was there was hope we waited in unutterable expectation to see what would happen next  the next event was decisive he let the mock diamond drop out of his hand  it fell on the floor before the doorwayplainly visible to him and to everyone he made no effort to pick it up he looked down at it vacantly and as he looked his head sank on his breast he staggeredroused himself for an instantwalked back unsteadily to the sofaand sat down on it he made a last effort he tried to rise and sank back his head fell on the sofa cushions it was then twentyfive minutes past one oclock before i had put my watch back in my pocket he was asleep  it was all over now the sedative influence had got him the experiment was at an end  i entered the room telling mr bruff and betteredge that they might follow me there was no fear of disturbing him we were free to move and speak  the first thing to settle i said is the question of what we are to do with him he will probably sleep for the next six or seven hours at least it is some distance to carry him back to his own room when i was younger i could have done it alone but my health and strength are not what they werei am afraid i must ask you to help me  before they could answer miss verinder called to me softly she met me at the door of her room with a light shawl and with the counterpane from her own bed  do you mean to watch him while he sleeps she asked  yes i am not sure enough of the action of the opium in his case to be willing to leave him alone  she handed me the shawl and the counterpane  why should you disturb him she whispered make his bed on the sofa i can shut my door and keep in my room  it was infinitely the simplest and the safest way of disposing of him for the night i mentioned the suggestion to mr bruff and betteredgewho both approved of my adopting it in five minutes i had laid him comfortably on the sofa and had covered him lightly with the counterpane and the shawl miss verinder wished us good night and closed the door at my request we three then drew round the table in the middle of the room on which the candle was still burning and on which writing materials were placed  before we separate i began i have a word to say about the experiment which has been tried tonight two distinct objects were to be gained by it the first of these objects was to prove that mr blake entered this room and took the diamond last year acting unconsciously and irresponsibly under the influence of opium after what you have both seen are you both satisfied so far  they answered me in the affirmative without a moments hesitation  the second object i went on was to discover what he did with the diamond after he was seen by miss verinder to leave her sittingroom with the jewel in his hand on the birthday night the gaining of this object depended of course on his still continuing exactly to repeat his proceedings of last year he has failed to do that and the purpose of the experiment is defeated accordingly i cant assert that i am not disappointed at the resultbut i can honestly say that i am not surprised by it i told mr blake from the first that our complete success in this matter depended on our completely reproducing in him the physical and moral conditions of last yearand i warned him that this was the next thing to a downright impossibility we have only partially reproduced the conditions and the experiment has been only partially successful in consequence it is also possible that i may have administered too large a dose of laudanum but i myself look upon the first reason that i have given as the true reason why we have to lament a failure as well as to rejoice over a success  after saying those words i put the writing materials before mr bruff and asked him if he had any objectionbefore we separated for the nightto draw out and sign a plain statement of what he had seen he at once took the pen and produced the statement with the fluent readiness of a practised hand  i owe you this he said signing the paper as some atonement for what passed between us earlier in the evening i beg your pardon mr jennings for having doubted you you have done franklin blake an inestimable service in our legal phrase you have proved your case  betteredges apology was characteristic of the man  mr jennings he said when you read robinson crusoe again which i strongly recommend you to do you will find that he never scruples to acknowledge it when he turns out to have been in the wrong please to consider me sir as doing what robinson crusoe did on the present occasion with those words he signed the paper in his turn  mr bruff took me aside as we rose from the table  one word about the diamond he said your theory is that franklin blake hid the moonstone in his room my theory is that the moonstone is in the possession of mr lukers bankers in london we wont dispute which of us is right we will only ask which of us is in a position to put his theory to the test  the test in my case i answered has been tried tonight and has failed  the test in my case rejoined mr bruff is still in process of trial for the last two days i have had a watch set for mr luker at the bank and i shall cause that watch to be continued until the last day of the month i know that he must take the diamond himself out of his bankers handsand i am acting on the chance that the person who has pledged the diamond may force him to do this by redeeming the pledge in that case i may be able to lay my hand on the person if i succeed i clear up the mystery exactly at the point where the mystery baffles us now do you admit that so far  i admitted it readily  i am going back to town by the morning train pursued the lawyer i may hear when i return that a discovery has been madeand it may be of the greatest importance that i should have franklin blake at hand to appeal to if necessary i intend to tell him as soon as he wakes that he must return with me to london after all that has happened may i trust to your influence to back me  certainly i said  mr bruff shook hands with me and left the room betteredge followed him out i went to the sofa to look at mr blake he had not moved since i had laid him down and made his bedhe lay locked in a deep and quiet sleep  while i was still looking at him i heard the bedroom door softly opened once more miss verinder appeared on the threshold in her pretty summer dress  do me a last favour she whispered let me watch him with you  i hesitatednot in the interests of propriety only in the interest of her nights rest she came close to me and took my hand  i cant sleep i cant even sit still in my own room she said oh mr jennings if you were me only think how you would long to sit and look at him say yes do  is it necessary to mention that i gave way surely not  she drew a chair to the foot of the sofa she looked at him in a silent ecstasy of happiness till the tears rose in her eyes she dried her eyes and said she would fetch her work she fetched her work and never did a single stitch of it it lay in her lapshe was not even able to look away from him long enough to thread her needle i thought of my own youth i thought of the gentle eyes which had once looked love at me in the heaviness of my heart i turned to my journal for relief and wrote in it what is written here  so we kept our watch together in silence one of us absorbed in his writing the other absorbed in her love  hour after hour he lay in his deep sleep the light of the new day grew and grew in the room and still he never moved  towards six oclock i felt the warning which told me that my pains were coming back i was obliged to leave her alone with him for a little while i said i would go upstairs and fetch another pillow for him out of his room it was not a long attack this time in a little while i was able to venture back and let her see me again  i found her at the head of the sofa when i returned she was just touching his forehead with her lips i shook my head as soberly as i could and pointed to her chair she looked back at me with a bright smile and a charming colour in her face you would have done it she whispered in my place        it is just eight oclock he is beginning to move for the first time  miss verinder is kneeling by the side of the sofa she has so placed herself that when his eyes first open they must open on her face  shall i leave them together  yes        eleven oclockthe house is empty again they have arranged it among themselves they have all gone to london by the ten oclock train my brief dream of happiness is over i have awakened again to the realities of my friendless and lonely life  i dare not trust myself to write down the kind words that have been said to me especially by miss verinder and mr blake besides it is needless those words will come back to me in my solitary hours and will help me through what is left of the end of my life mr blake is to write and tell me what happens in london miss verinder is to return to yorkshire in the autumn for her marriage no doubt and i am to take a holiday and be a guest in the house oh me how i felt as the grateful happiness looked at me out of her eyes and the warm pressure of her hand said this is your doing  my poor patients are waiting for me back again this morning to the old routine back again tonight to the dreadful alternative between the opium and the pain  god be praised for his mercy i have seen a little sunshinei have had a happy time     fifth narrative  the story resumed by franklin blake    chapter i   but few words are needed on my part to complete the narrative that has been presented in the journal of ezra jennings  of myself i have only to say that i awoke on the morning of the twentysixth perfectly ignorant of all that i had said and done under the influence of the opiumfrom the time when the drug first laid its hold on me to the time when i opened my eyes in rachels sittingroom  of what happened after my waking i do not feel called upon to render an account in detail confining myself merely to results i have to report that rachel and i thoroughly understood each other before a single word of explanation had passed on either side i decline to account and rachel declines to account for the extraordinary rapidity of our reconciliation sir and madam look back at the time when you were passionately attached to each otherand you will know what happened after ezra jennings had shut the door of the sittingroom as well as i know it myself  i have however no objection to add that we should have been certainly discovered by mrs merridew but for rachels presence of mind she heard the sound of the old ladys dress in the corridor and instantly ran out to meet her i heard mrs merridew say what is the matter and i heard rachel answer the explosion mrs merridew instantly permitted herself to be taken by the arm and led into the garden out of the way of the impending shock on her return to the house she met me in the hall and expressed herself as greatly struck by the vast improvement in science since the time when she was a girl at school explosions mr blake are infinitely milder than they were i assure you i barely heard mr jenningss explosion from the garden and no smell afterwards that i can detect now we have come back to the house i must really apologise to your medical friend it is only due to him to say that he has managed it beautifully  so after vanquishing betteredge and mr bruff ezra jennings vanquished mrs merridew herself there is a great deal of undeveloped liberal feeling in the world after all  at breakfast mr bruff made no secret of his reasons for wishing that i should accompany him to london by the morning train the watch kept at the bank and the result which might yet come of it appealed so irresistibly to rachels curiosity that she at once decided if mrs merridew had no objection on accompanying us back to townso as to be within reach of the earliest news of our proceedings  mrs merridew proved to be all pliability and indulgence after the truly considerate manner in which the explosion had conducted itself and betteredge was accordingly informed that we were all four to travel back together by the morning train i fully expected that he would have asked leave to accompany us but rachel had wisely provided her faithful old servant with an occupation that interested him he was charged with completing the refurnishing of the house and was too full of his domestic responsibilities to feel the detectivefever as he might have felt it under other circumstances  our one subject of regret in going to london was the necessity of parting more abruptly than we could have wished with ezra jennings it was impossible to persuade him to accompany us i could only promise to write to himand rachel could only insist on his coming to see her when she returned to yorkshire there was every prospect of our meeting again in a few monthsand yet there was something very sad in seeing our best and dearest friend left standing alone on the platform as the train moved out of the station  on our arrival in london mr bruff was accosted at the terminus by a small boy dressed in a jacket and trousers of threadbare black cloth and personally remarkable in virtue of the extraordinary prominence of his eyes they projected so far and they rolled about so loosely that you wondered uneasily why they remained in their sockets after listening to the boy mr bruff asked the ladies whether they would excuse our accompanying them back to portland place i had barely time to promise rachel that i would return and tell her everything that had happened before mr bruff seized me by the arm and hurried me into a cab the boy with the illsecured eyes took his place on the box by the driver and the driver was directed to go to lombard street  news from the bank i asked as we started  news of mr luker said mr bruff an hour ago he was seen to leave his house at lambeth in a cab accompanied by two men who were recognised by my men as police officers in plain clothes if mr lukers dread of the indians is at the bottom of this precaution the inference is plain enough he is going to take the diamond out of the bank  and we are going to the bank to see what comes of it  yesor to hear what has come of it if it is all over by this time did you notice my boyon the box there  i noticed his eyes  mr bruff laughed they call the poor little wretch gooseberry at the office he said i employ him to go on errandsand i only wish my clerks who have nicknamed him were as thoroughly to be depended on as he is gooseberry is one of the sharpest boys in london mr blake in spite of his eyes  it was twenty minutes to five when we drew up before the bank in lombard street gooseberry looked longingly at his master as he opened the cab door  do you want to come in too asked mr bruff kindly come in then and keep at my heels till further orders hes as quick as lightning pursued mr bruff addressing me in a whisper two words will do with gooseberry where twenty would be wanted with another boy  we entered the bank the outer officewith the long counter behind which the cashiers satwas crowded with people all waiting their turn to take money out or to pay money in before the bank closed at five oclock  two men among the crowd approached mr bruff as soon as he showed himself  well asked the lawyer have you seen him  he passed us here half an hour since sir and went on into the inner office  has he not come out again yet  no sir  mr bruff turned to me let us wait he said  i looked round among the people about me for the three indians not a sign of them was to be seen anywhere the only person present with a noticeably dark complexion was a tall man in a pilot coat and a round hat who looked like a sailor could this be one of them in disguise impossible the man was taller than any of the indians and his face where it was not hidden by a bushy black beard was twice the breadth of any of their faces at least  they must have their spy somewhere said mr bruff looking at the dark sailor in his turn and he may be the man  before he could say more his coattail was respectfully pulled by his attendant sprite with the gooseberry eyes mr bruff looked where the boy was looking hush he said here is mr luker  the moneylender came out from the inner regions of the bank followed by his two guardian policemen in plain clothes  keep your eye on him whispered mr bruff if he passes the diamond to anybody he will pass it here  without noticing either of us mr luker slowly made his way to the doornow in the thickest now in the thinnest part of the crowd i distinctly saw his hand move as he passed a short stout man respectably dressed in a suit of sober grey the man started a little and looked after him mr luker moved on slowly through the crowd at the door his guard placed themselves on either side of him they were all three followed by one of mr bruffs menand i saw them no more  i looked round at the lawyer and then looked significantly towards the man in the suit of sober grey yes whispered mr bruff i saw it too he turned about in search of his second man the second man was nowhere to be seen he looked behind him for his attendant sprite gooseberry had disappeared  what the devil does it mean said mr bruff angrily they have both left us at the very time when we want them most  it came to the turn of the man in the grey suit to transact his business at the counter he paid in a chequereceived a receipt for itand turned to go out  what is to be done asked mr bruff we cant degrade ourselves by following him  i can i said i wouldnt lose sight of that man for ten thousand pounds  in that case rejoined mr bruff i wouldnt lose sight of you for twice the money a nice occupation for a man in my position he muttered to himself as we followed the stranger out of the bank for heavens sake dont mention it i should be ruined if it was known  the man in the grey suit got into an omnibus going westward we got in after him there were latent reserves of youth still left in mr bruff i assert it positivelywhen he took his seat in the omnibus he blushed  the man in the grey suit stopped the omnibus and got out in oxford street we followed him again he went into a chemists shop  mr bruff started my chemist he exclaimed i am afraid we have made a mistake  we entered the shop mr bruff and the proprietor exchanged a few words in private the lawyer joined me again with a very crestfallen face  its greatly to our credit he said as he took my arm and led me outthats one comfort  what is to our credit i asked  mr blake you and i are the two worst amateur detectives that ever tried their hands at the trade the man in the grey suit has been thirty years in the chemists service he was sent to the bank to pay money to his masters accountand he knows no more of the moonstone than the babe unborn  i asked what was to be done next  come back to my office said mr bruff gooseberry and my second man have evidently followed somebody else let us hope that they had their eyes about them at any rate  when we reached grays inn square the second man had arrived there before us he had been waiting for more than a quarter of an hour  well asked mr bruff whats your news  i am sorry to say sir replied the man that i have made a mistake i could have taken my oath that i saw mr luker pass something to an elderly gentleman in a lightcoloured paletot the elderly gentleman turns out sir to be a most respectable master ironmonger in eastcheap  where is gooseberry asked mr bruff resignedly  the man stared i dont know sir i have seen nothing of him since i left the bank  mr bruff dismissed the man one of two things he said to me either gooseberry has run away or he is hunting on his own account what do you say to dining here on the chance that the boy may come back in an hour or two i have got some good wine in the cellar and we can get a chop from the coffeehouse  we dined at mr bruffs chambers before the cloth was removed a person was announced as wanting to speak to the lawyer was the person gooseberry no only the man who had been employed to follow mr luker when he left the bank  the report in this case presented no feature of the slightest interest mr luker had gone back to his own house and had there dismissed his guard he had not gone out again afterwards towards dusk the shutters had been put up and the doors had been bolted the street before the house and the alley behind the house had been carefully watched no signs of the indians had been visible no person whatever had been seen loitering about the premises having stated these facts the man waited to know whether there were any further orders mr bruff dismissed him for the night  do you think mr luker has taken the moonstone home with him i asked  not he said mr bruff he would never have dismissed his two policemen if he had run the risk of keeping the diamond in his own house again  we waited another halfhour for the boy and waited in vain it was then time for mr bruff to go to hampstead and for me to return to rachel in portland place i left my card in charge of the porter at the chambers with a line written on it to say that i should be at my lodgings at half past ten that night the card was to be given to the boy if the boy came back  some men have a knack of keeping appointments and other men have a knack of missing them i am one of the other men add to this that i passed the evening at portland place on the same seat with rachel in a room forty feet long with mrs merridew at the further end of it does anybody wonder that i got home at half past twelve instead of half past ten how thoroughly heartless that person must be and how earnestly i hope i may never make that persons acquaintance  my servant handed me a morsel of paper when he let me in  i read in a neat legal handwriting these wordsif you please sir i am getting sleepy i will come back tomorrow morning between nine and ten inquiry proved that a boy with very extraordinarylooking eyes had called and presented my card and message had waited an hour had done nothing but fall asleep and wake up again had written a line for me and had gone homeafter gravely informing the servant that he was fit for nothing unless he got his nights rest  at nine the next morning i was ready for my visitor at half past nine i heard steps outside my door come in gooseberry i called out thank you sir answered a grave and melancholy voice the door opened i started to my feet and confrontedsergeant cuff  i thought i would look in here mr blake on the chance of your being in town before i wrote to yorkshire said the sergeant  he was as dreary and as lean as ever his eyes had not lost their old trick so subtly noticed in betteredges narrative of looking as if they expected something more from you than you were aware of yourself but so far as dress can alter a man the great cuff was changed beyond all recognition he wore a broadbrimmed white hat a light shooting jacket white trousers and drab gaiters he carried a stout oak stick his whole aim and object seemed to be to look as if he had lived in the country all his life when i complimented him on his metamorphosis he declined to take it as a joke he complained quite gravely of the noises and the smells of london i declare i am far from sure that he did not speak with a slightly rustic accent i offered him breakfast the innocent countryman was quite shocked his breakfast hour was halfpast sixand he went to bed with the cocks and hens  i only got back from ireland last night said the sergeant coming round to the practical object of his visit in his own impenetrable manner before i went to bed i read your letter telling me what has happened since my inquiry after the diamond was suspended last year theres only one thing to be said about the matter on my side i completely mistook my case how any man living was to have seen things in their true light in such a situation as mine was at the time i dont profess to know but that doesnt alter the facts as they stand i own that i made a mess of it not the first mess mr blake which has distinguished my professional career its only in books that the officers of the detective force are superior to the weakness of making a mistake  you have come in the nick of time to recover your reputation i said  i beg your pardon mr blake rejoined the sergeant now i have retired from business i dont care a straw about my reputation i have done with my reputation thank god i am here sir in grateful remembrance of the late lady verinders liberality to me i will go back to my old workif you want me and if you will trust meon that consideration and on no other not a farthing of money is to pass if you please from you to me this is on honour now tell me mr blake how the case stands since you wrote to me last  i told him of the experiment with the opium and of what had occurred afterwards at the bank in lombard street he was greatly struck by the experimentit was something entirely new in his experience and he was particularly interested in the theory of ezra jennings relating to what i had done with the diamond after i had left rachels sittingroom on the birthday night  i dont hold with mr jennings that you hid the moonstone said sergeant cuff but i agree with him that you must certainly have taken it back to your own room  well i asked and what happened then  have you no suspicion yourself of what happened sir  none whatever  has mr bruff no suspicion  no more than i have  sergeant cuff rose and went to my writingtable he came back with a sealed envelope it was marked private it was addressed to me and it had the sergeants signature in the corner  i suspected the wrong person last year he said and i may be suspecting the wrong person now wait to open the envelope mr blake till you have got at the truth and then compare the name of the guilty person with the name that i have written in that sealed letter  i put the letter into my pocketand then asked for the sergeants opinion of the measures which we had taken at the bank  very well intended sir he answered and quite the right thing to do but there was another person who ought to have been looked after besides mr luker  the person named in the letter you have just given to me  yes mr blake the person named in the letter it cant be helped now i shall have something to propose to you and mr bruff sir when the time comes lets wait first and see if the boy has anything to tell us that is worth hearing  it was close on ten oclock and the boy had not made his appearance sergeant cuff talked of other matters he asked after his old friend betteredge and his old enemy the gardener in a minute more he would no doubt have got from this to the subject of his favourite roses if my servant had not interrupted us by announcing that the boy was below  on being brought into the room gooseberry stopped at the threshold of the door and looked distrustfully at the stranger who was in my company i told the boy to come to me  you may speak before this gentleman i said he is here to assist me and he knows all that has happened sergeant cuff i added this is the boy from mr bruffs office  in our modern system of civilisation celebrity no matter of what kind is the lever that will move anything the fame of the great cuff had even reached the ears of the small gooseberry the boys illfixed eyes rolled when i mentioned the illustrious name till i thought they really must have dropped on the carpet  come here my lad said the sergeant and lets hear what you have got to tell us  the notice of the great manthe hero of many a famous story in every lawyers office in londonappeared to fascinate the boy he placed himself in front of sergeant cuff and put his hands behind him after the approved fashion of a neophyte who is examined in his catechism  what is your name said the sergeant beginning with the first question in the catechism  octavius guy answered the boy they call me gooseberry at the office because of my eyes  octavius guy otherwise gooseberry pursued the sergeant with the utmost gravity you were missed at the bank yesterday what were you about  if you please sir i was following a man  who was he  a tall man sir with a big black beard dressed like a sailor  i remember the man i broke in mr bruff and i thought he was a spy employed by the indians  sergeant cuff did not appear to be much impressed by what mr bruff and i had thought he went on catechising gooseberry  well he saidand why did you follow the sailor  if you please sir mr bruff wanted to know whether mr luker passed anything to anybody on his way out of the bank i saw mr luker pass something to the sailor with the black beard  why didnt you tell mr bruff what you saw  i hadnt time to tell anybody sir the sailor went out in such a hurry  and you ran out after himeh  yes sir  gooseberry said the sergeant patting his head you have got something in that small skull of yoursand it isnt cottonwool i am greatly pleased with you so far  the boy blushed with pleasure sergeant cuff went on  well and what did the sailor do when he got into the street  he called a cab sir  and what did you do  held on behind and run after it  before the sergeant could put his next question another visitor was announcedthe head clerk from mr bruffs office  feeling the importance of not interrupting sergeant cuffs examination of the boy i received the clerk in another room he came with bad news of his employer the agitation and excitement of the last two days had proved too much for mr bruff he had awoke that morning with an attack of gout he was confined to his room at hampstead and in the present critical condition of our affairs he was very uneasy at being compelled to leave me without the advice and assistance of an experienced person the chief clerk had received orders to hold himself at my disposal and was willing to do his best to replace mr bruff  i wrote at once to quiet the old gentlemans mind by telling him of sergeant cuffs visit adding that gooseberry was at that moment under examination and promising to inform mr bruff either personally or by letter of whatever might occur later in the day having despatched the clerk to hampstead with my note i returned to the room which i had left and found sergeant cuff at the fireplace in the act of ringing the bell  i beg your pardon mr blake said the sergeant i was just going to send word by your servant that i wanted to speak to you there isnt a doubt on my mind that this boythis most meritorious boy added the sergeant patting gooseberry on the head has followed the right man precious time has been lost sir through your unfortunately not being at home at half past ten last night the only thing to do now is to send for a cab immediately  in five minutes more sergeant cuff and i with gooseberry on the box to guide the driver were on our way eastward towards the city  one of these days said the sergeant pointing through the front window of the cab that boy will do great things in my late profession he is the brightest and cleverest little chap i have met with for many a long year past you shall hear the substance mr blake of what he told me while you were out of the room you were present i think when he mentioned that he held on behind the cab and ran after it  yes  well sir the cab went from lombard street to the tower wharf the sailor with the black beard got out and spoke to the steward of the rotterdam steamboat which was to start next morning he asked if he could be allowed to go on board at once and sleep in his berth overnight the steward said no the cabins and berths and bedding were all to have a thorough cleaning that evening and no passenger could be allowed to come on board before the morning the sailor turned round and left the wharf when he got into the street again the boy noticed for the first time a man dressed like a respectable mechanic walking on the opposite side of the road and apparently keeping the sailor in view the sailor stopped at an eatinghouse in the neighbourhood and went in the boynot being able to make up his mind at the momenthung about among some other boys staring at the good things in the eatinghouse window he noticed the mechanic waiting as he himself was waitingbut still on the opposite side of the street after a minute a cab came by slowly and stopped where the mechanic was standing the boy could only see plainly one person in the cab who leaned forward at the window to speak to the mechanic he described that person mr blake without any prompting from me as having a dark face like the face of an indian  it was plain by this time that mr bruff and i had made another mistake the sailor with the black beard was clearly not a spy in the service of the indian conspiracy was he by any possibility the man who had got the diamond  after a little pursued the sergeant the cab moved on slowly down the street the mechanic crossed the road and went into the eatinghouse the boy waited outside till he was hungry and tiredand then went into the eatinghouse in his turn he had a shilling in his pocket and he dined sumptuously he tells me on a blackpudding an eelpie and a bottle of gingerbeer what can a boy not digest the substance in question has never been found yet  what did he see in the eatinghouse i asked  well mr blake he saw the sailor reading the newspaper at one table and the mechanic reading the newspaper at another it was dusk before the sailor got up and left the place he looked about him suspiciously when he got out into the street the boybeing a boypassed unnoticed the mechanic had not come out yet the sailor walked on looking about him and apparently not very certain of where he was going next the mechanic appeared once more on the opposite side of the road the sailor went on till he got to shore lane leading into lower thames street there he stopped before a publichouse under the sign of the wheel of fortune and after examining the place outside went in gooseberry went in too there were a great many people mostly of the decent sort at the bar the wheel of fortune is a very respectable house mr blake famous for its porter and porkpies  the sergeants digressions irritated me he saw it and confined himself more strictly to gooseberrys evidence when he went on  the sailor he resumed asked if he could have a bed the landlord said no they were full the barmaid corrected him and said number ten was empty a waiter was sent for to show the sailor to number ten just before that gooseberry had noticed the mechanic among the people at the bar before the waiter had answered the call the mechanic had vanished the sailor was taken off to his room not knowing what to do next gooseberry had the wisdom to wait and see if anything happened something did happen the landlord was called for angry voices were heard upstairs the mechanic suddenly made his appearance again collared by the landlord and exhibiting to gooseberrys great surprise all the signs and tokens of being drunk the landlord thrust him out at the door and threatened him with the police if he came back from the altercation between them while this was going on it appeared that the man had been discovered in number ten and had declared with drunken obstinacy that he had taken the room gooseberry was so struck by this sudden intoxication of a previously sober person that he couldnt resist running out after the mechanic into the street as long as he was in sight of the publichouse the man reeled about in the most disgraceful manner the moment he turned the corner of the street he recovered his balance instantly and became as sober a member of society as you could wish to see gooseberry went back to the wheel of fortune in a very bewildered state of mind he waited about again on the chance of something happening nothing happened and nothing more was to be heard or seen of the sailor gooseberry decided on going back to the office just as he came to this conclusion who should appear on the opposite side of the street as usual but the mechanic again he looked up at one particular window at the top of the publichouse which was the only one that had a light in it the light seemed to relieve his mind he left the place directly the boy made his way back to grays inngot your card and messagecalledand failed to find you there you have the state of the case mr blake as it stands at the present time  what is your own opinion of the case sergeant  i think its serious sir judging by what the boy saw the indians are in it to begin with  yes and the sailor is evidently the person to whom mr luker passed the diamond it seems odd that mr bruff and i and the man in mr bruffs employment should all have been mistaken about who the person was  not at all mr blake considering the risk that person ran its likely enough that mr luker purposely misled you by previous arrangement between them  do you understand the proceedings at the publichouse i asked the man dressed like a mechanic was acting of course in the employment of the indians but i am as much puzzled to account for his sudden assumption of drunkenness as gooseberry himself  i think i can give a guess at what it means sir said the sergeant if you will reflect you will see that the man must have had some pretty strict instructions from the indians they were far too noticeable themselves to risk being seen at the bank or in the publichousethey were obliged to trust everything to their deputy very good their deputy hears a certain number named in the publichouse as the number of the room which the sailor is to have for the nightthat being also the room unless our notion is all wrong which the diamond is to have for the night too under those circumstances the indians you may rely on it would insist on having a description of the roomof its position in the house of its capability of being approached from the outside and so on what was the man to do with such orders as these just what he did he ran upstairs to get a look at the room before the sailor was taken into it he was found there making his observationsand he shammed drunk as the easiest way of getting out of the difficulty thats how i read the riddle after he was turned out of the publichouse he probably went with his report to the place where his employers were waiting for him and his employers no doubt sent him back to make sure that the sailor was really settled at the publichouse till the next morning as for what happened at the wheel of fortune after the boy leftwe ought to have discovered that last night its eleven in the morning now we must hope for the best and find out what we can  in a quarter of an hour more the cab stopped in shore lane and gooseberry opened the door for us to get out  all right asked the sergeant  all right answered the boy  the moment we entered the wheel of fortune it was plain even to my inexperienced eyes that there was something wrong in the house  the only person behind the counter at which the liquors were served was a bewildered servant girl perfectly ignorant of the business one or two customers waiting for their morning drink were tapping impatiently on the counter with their money the barmaid appeared from the inner regions of the parlour excited and preoccupied she answered sergeant cuffs inquiry for the landlord by telling him sharply that her master was upstairs and was not to be bothered by anybody  come along with me sir said sergeant cuff coolly leading the way upstairs and beckoning to the boy to follow him  the barmaid called to her master and warned him that strangers were intruding themselves into the house on the first floor we were encountered by the landlord hurrying down in a highly irritated state to see what was the matter  who the devil are you and what do you want here he asked  keep your temper said the sergeant quietly ill tell you who i am to begin with i am sergeant cuff  the illustrious name instantly produced its effect the angry landlord threw open the door of a sittingroom and asked the sergeants pardon  i am annoyed and out of sorts sirthats the truth he said something unpleasant has happened in the house this morning a man in my way of business has a deal to upset his temper sergeant cuff  not a doubt of it said the sergeant ill come at once if you will allow me to what brings us here this gentleman and i want to trouble you with a few inquiries on a matter of some interest to both of us  relating to what sir asked the landlord  relating to a dark man dressed like a sailor who slept here last night  good god thats the man who is upsetting the whole house at this moment exclaimed the landlord do you or does this gentleman know anything about him  we cant be certain till we see him answered the sergeant  see him echoed the landlord thats the one thing that nobody has been able to do since seven oclock this morning that was the time when he left word last night that he was to be called he was calledand there was no getting an answer from him and no opening his door to see what was the matter they tried again at eight and they tried again at nine no use there was the door still lockedand not a sound to be heard in the room i have been out this morningand i only got back a quarter of an hour ago i have hammered at the door myselfand all to no purpose the potboy has gone to fetch a carpenter if you can wait a few minutes gentlemen we will have the door opened and see what it means  was the man drunk last night asked sergeant cuff  perfectly sober siror i would never have let him sleep in my house  did he pay for his bed beforehand  no  could he leave the room in any way without going out by the door  the room is a garret said the landlord but theres a trapdoor in the ceiling leading out on to the roofand a little lower down the street theres an empty house under repair do you think sergeant the blackguard has got off in that way without paying  a sailor said sergeant cuff might have done itearly in the morning before the street was astir he would be used to climbing and his head wouldnt fail him on the roofs of the houses  as he spoke the arrival of the carpenter was announced we all went upstairs at once to the top story i noticed that the sergeant was unusually grave even for him it also struck me as odd that he told the boy after having previously encouraged him to follow us to wait in the room below till we came down again  the carpenters hammer and chisel disposed of the resistance of the door in a few minutes but some article of furniture had been placed against it inside as a barricade by pushing at the door we thrust this obstacle aside and so got admission to the room the landlord entered first the sergeant second and i third the other persons present followed us  we all looked towards the bed and all started  the man had not left the room he lay dressed on the bedwith a white pillow over his face which completely hid it from view  what does that mean said the landlord pointing to the pillow  sergeant cuff led the way to the bed without answering and removed the pillow  the mans swarthy face was placid and still his black hair and beard were slightly very slightly discomposed his eyes stared wideopen glassy and vacant at the ceiling the filmy look and the fixed expression of them horrified me i turned away and went to the open window the rest of them remained where sergeant cuff remained at the bed  hes in a fit i heard the landlord say  hes dead the sergeant answered send for the nearest doctor and send for the police  the waiter was despatched on both errands some strange fascination seemed to hold sergeant cuff to the bed some strange curiosity seemed to keep the rest of them waiting to see what the sergeant would do next  i turned again to the window the moment afterwards i felt a soft pull at my coattails and a small voice whispered look here sir  gooseberry had followed us into the room his loose eyes rolled frightfullynot in terror but in exultation he had made a detectivediscovery on his own account look here sir he repeatedand led me to a table in the corner of the room  on the table stood a little wooden box open and empty on one side of the box lay some jewellers cotton on the other side was a torn sheet of white paper with a seal on it partly destroyed and with an inscription in writing which was still perfectly legible the inscription was in these words  deposited with messrs bushe lysaught and bushe by mr septimus luker of middlesex place lambeth a small wooden box sealed up in this envelope and containing a valuable of great price the box when claimed to be only given up by messrs bushe and co on the personal application of mr luker  those lines removed all further doubt on one point at least the sailor had been in possession of the moonstone when he had left the bank on the previous day  i felt another pull at my coattails gooseberry had not done with me yet  robbery whispered the boy pointing in high delight to the empty box  you were told to wait downstairs i said go away  and murder added gooseberry pointing with a keener relish still to the man on the bed  there was something so hideous in the boys enjoyment of the horror of the scene that i took him by the two shoulders and put him out of the room  at the moment when i crossed the threshold of the door i heard sergeant cuffs voice asking where i was he met me as i returned into the room and forced me to go back with him to the bedside  mr blake he said look at the mans face it is a face disguisedand heres a proof of it  he traced with his finger a thin line of livid white running backward from the dead mans forehead between the swarthy complexion and the slightlydisturbed black hair lets see what is under this said the sergeant suddenly seizing the black hair with a firm grip of his hand  my nerves were not strong enough to bear it i turned away again from the bed  the first sight that met my eyes at the other end of the room was the irrepressible gooseberry perched on a chair and looking with breathless interest over the heads of his elders at the sergeants proceedings  hes pulling off his wig whispered gooseberry compassionating my position as the only person in the room who could see nothing  there was a pauseand then a cry of astonishment among the people round the bed  hes pulled off his beard cried gooseberry  there was another pausesergeant cuff asked for something the landlord went to the washhandstand and returned to the bed with a basin of water and a towel  gooseberry danced with excitement on the chair come up here along with me sir hes washing off his complexion now  the sergeant suddenly burst his way through the people about him and came with horror in his face straight to the place where i was standing  come back to the bed sir he began he looked at me closer and checked himself no he resumed open the sealed letter firstthe letter i gave you this morning  i opened the letter  read the name mr blake that i have written inside  i read the name that he had written it was godfrey ablewhite  now said the sergeant come with me and look at the man on the bed  i went with him and looked at the man on the bed  godfrey ablewhite     sixth narrative  contributed by sergeant cuff     i  dorking surrey july 30th 1849 to franklin blake esq siri beg to apologise for the delay that has occurred in the production of the report with which i engaged to furnish you i have waited to make it a complete report and i have been met here and there by obstacles which it was only possible to remove by some little expenditure of patience and time  the object which i proposed to myself has now i hope been attained you will find in these pages answers to the greater partif not allof the questions concerning the late mr godfrey ablewhite which occurred to your mind when i last had the honour of seeing you  i propose to tell youin the first placewhat is known of the manner in which your cousin met his death appending to the statement such inferences and conclusions as we are justified according to my opinion in drawing from the facts  i shall then endeavourin the second placeto put you in possession of such discoveries as i have made respecting the proceedings of mr godfrey ablewhite before during and after the time when you and he met as guests at the late lady verinders countryhouse     ii  as to your cousins death then first  it appears to be established beyond any reasonable doubt that he was killed while he was asleep or immediately on his waking by being smothered with a pillow from his bedthat the persons guilty of murdering him are the three indiansand that the object contemplated and achieved by the crime was to obtain possession of the diamond called the moonstone  the facts from which this conclusion is drawn are derived partly from an examination of the room at the tavern and partly from the evidence obtained at the coroners inquest  on forcing the door of the room the deceased gentleman was discovered dead with the pillow of the bed over his face the medical man who examined him being informed of this circumstance considered the postmortem appearances as being perfectly compatible with murder by smotheringthat is to say with murder committed by some person or persons pressing the pillow over the nose and mouth of the deceased until death resulted from congestion of the lungs  next as to the motive for the crime  a small box with a sealed paper torn off from it the paper containing an inscription was found open and empty on a table in the room mr luker has himself personally identified the box the seal and the inscription he has declared that the box did actually contain the diamond called the moonstone and he has admitted having given the box thus sealed up to mr godfrey ablewhite then concealed under a disguise on the afternoon of the twentysixth of june last the fair inference from all this is that the stealing of the moonstone was the motive of the crime  next as to the manner in which the crime was committed  on examination of the room which is only seven feet high a trapdoor in the ceiling leading out on to the roof of the house was discovered open the short ladder used for obtaining access to the trapdoor and kept under the bed was found placed at the opening so as to enable any person or persons in the room to leave it again easily in the trapdoor itself was found a square aperture cut in the wood apparently with some exceedingly sharp instrument just behind the bolt which fastened the door on the inner side in this way any person from the outside could have drawn back the bolt and opened the door and have dropped or have been noiselessly lowered by an accomplice into the roomits height as already observed being only seven feet that some person or persons must have got admission in this way appears evident from the fact of the aperture being there as to the manner in which he or they obtained access to the roof of the tavern it is to be remarked that the third house lower down in the street was empty and under repairthat a long ladder was left by the workmen leading from the pavement to the top of the houseand that on returning to their work on the morning of the 27th the men found the plank which they had tied to the ladder to prevent anyone from using it in their absence removed and lying on the ground as to the possibility of ascending by this ladder passing over the roofs of the houses passing back and descending again unobservedit is discovered on the evidence of the night policeman that he only passes through shore lane twice in an hour when out on his beat the testimony of the inhabitants also declares that shore lane after midnight is one of the quietest and loneliest streets in london here again therefore it seems fair to infer thatwith ordinary caution and presence of mindany man or men might have ascended by the ladder and might have descended again unobserved once on the roof of the tavern it has been proved by experiment that a man might cut through the trapdoor while lying down on it and that in such a position the parapet in front of the house would conceal him from the view of anyone passing in the street  lastly as to the person or persons by whom the crime was committed  it is known 1 that the indians had an interest in possessing themselves of the diamond 2 it is at least probable that the man looking like an indian whom octavius guy saw at the window of the cab speaking to the man dressed like a mechanic was one of the three hindoo conspirators 3 it is certain that this same man dressed like a mechanic was seen keeping mr godfrey ablewhite in view all through the evening of the 26th and was found in the bedroom before mr ablewhite was shown into it under circumstances which lead to the suspicion that he was examining the room 4 a morsel of torn gold thread was picked up in the bedroom which persons expert in such matters declare to be of indian manufacture and to be a species of gold thread not known in england 5 on the morning of the 27th three men answering to the description of the three indians were observed in lower thames street were traced to the tower wharf and were seen to leave london by the steamer bound for rotterdam  there is here moral if not legal evidence that the murder was committed by the indians  whether the man personating a mechanic was or was not an accomplice in the crime it is impossible to say that he could have committed the murder alone seems beyond the limits of probability acting by himself he could hardly have smothered mr ablewhitewho was the taller and stronger man of the twowithout a struggle taking place or a cry being heard a servant girl sleeping in the next room heard nothing the landlord sleeping in the room below heard nothing the whole evidence points to the inference that more than one man was concerned in this crimeand the circumstances i repeat morally justify the conclusion that the indians committed it  i have only to add that the verdict at the coroners inquest was wilful murder against some person or persons unknown mr ablewhites family have offered a reward and no effort has been left untried to discover the guilty persons the man dressed like a mechanic has eluded all inquiries the indians have been traced as to the prospect of ultimately capturing these last i shall have a word to say to you on that head when i reach the end of the present report  in the meanwhile having now written all that is needful on the subject of mr godfrey ablewhites death i may pass next to the narrative of his proceedings before during and after the time when you and he met at the late lady verinders house     iii  with regard to the subject now in hand i may state at the outset that mr godfrey ablewhites life had two sides to it  the side turned up to the public view presented the spectacle of a gentleman possessed of considerable reputation as a speaker at charitable meetings and endowed with administrative abilities which he placed at the disposal of various benevolent societies mostly of the female sort the side kept hidden from the general notice exhibited this same gentleman in the totally different character of a man of pleasure with a villa in the suburbs which was not taken in his own name and with a lady in the villa who was not taken in his own name either  my investigations in the villa have shown me several fine pictures and statues furniture tastefully selected and admirably made and a conservatory of the rarest flowers the match of which it would not be easy to find in all london my investigation of the lady has resulted in the discovery of jewels which are worthy to take rank with the flowers and of carriages and horses which have deservedly produced a sensation in the park among persons well qualified to judge of the build of the one and the breed of the others  all this is so far common enough the villa and the lady are such familiar objects in london life that i ought to apologise for introducing them to notice but what is not common and not familiar in my experience is that all these fine things were not only ordered but paid for the pictures the statues the flowers the jewels the carriages and the horsesinquiry proved to my indescribable astonishment that not a sixpence of debt was owing on any of them as to the villa it had been bought out and out and settled on the lady  i might have tried to find the right reading of this riddle and tried in vainbut for mr godfrey ablewhites death which caused an inquiry to be made into the state of his affairs  the inquiry elicited these facts  that mr godfrey ablewhite was entrusted with the care of a sum of twenty thousand poundsas one of two trustees for a young gentleman who was still a minor in the year eighteen hundred and fortyeight that the trust was to lapse and that the young gentleman was to receive the twenty thousand pounds on the day when he came of age in the month of february eighteen hundred and fifty that pending the arrival of this period an income of six hundred pounds was to be paid to him by his two trustees halfyearlyat christmas and midsummer day that this income was regularly paid by the active trustee mr godfrey ablewhite that the twenty thousand pounds from which the income was supposed to be derived had every farthing of it been sold out of the funds at different periods ending with the end of the year eighteen hundred and fortyseven that the power of attorney authorising the bankers to sell out the stock and the various written orders telling them what amounts to sell out were formally signed by both the trustees that the signature of the second trustee a retired army officer living in the country was a signature forged in every case by the active trusteeotherwise mr godfrey ablewhite  in these facts lies the explanation of mr godfreys honourable conduct in paying the debts incurred for the lady and the villaand as you will presently see of more besides  we may now advance to the date of miss verinders birthday in the year eighteen hundred and fortyeightthe twentyfirst of june  on the day before mr godfrey ablewhite arrived at his fathers house and asked as i know from mr ablewhite senior himself for a loan of three hundred pounds mark the sum and remember at the same time that the halfyearly payment to the young gentleman was due on the twentyfourth of the month also that the whole of the young gentlemans fortune had been spent by his trustee by the end of the year fortyseven  mr ablewhite senior refused to lend his son a farthing  the next day mr godfrey ablewhite rode over with you to lady verinders house a few hours afterwards mr godfrey as you yourself have told me made a proposal of marriage to miss verinder here he saw his way no doubtif acceptedto the end of all his money anxieties present and future but as events actually turned out what happened miss verinder refused him  on the night of the birthday therefore mr godfrey ablewhites pecuniary position was this he had three hundred pounds to find on the twentyfourth of the month and twenty thousand pounds to find in february eighteen hundred and fifty failing to raise these sums at these times he was a ruined man  under those circumstances what takes place next  you exasperate mr candy the doctor on the sore subject of his profession and he plays you a practical joke in return with a dose of laudanum he trusts the administration of the dose prepared in a little phial to mr godfrey ablewhitewho has himself confessed the share he had in the matter under circumstances which shall presently be related to you mr godfrey is all the readier to enter into the conspiracy having himself suffered from your sharp tongue in the course of the evening he joins betteredge in persuading you to drink a little brandy and water before you go to bed he privately drops the dose of laudanum into your cold grog and you drink the mixture  let us now shift the scene if you please to mr lukers house at lambeth and allow me to remark by way of preface that mr bruff and i together have found a means of forcing the moneylender to make a clean breast of it we have carefully sifted the statement he has addressed to us and here it is at your service     iv  late on the evening of friday the twentythird of june fortyeight mr luker was surprised by a visit from mr godfrey ablewhite he was more than surprised when mr godfrey produced the moonstone no such diamond according to mr lukers experience was in the possession of any private person in europe  mr godfrey ablewhite had two modest proposals to make in relation to this magnificent gem first would mr luker be so good as to buy it secondly would mr luker in default of seeing his way to the purchase undertake to sell it on commission and to pay a sum down on the anticipated result  mr luker tested the diamond weighed the diamond and estimated the value of the diamond before he answered a word his estimate allowing for the flaw in the stone was thirty thousand pounds  having reached that result mr luker opened his lips and put a question how did you come by this only six words but what volumes of meaning in them  mr godfrey ablewhite began a story mr luker opened his lips again and only said three words this time that wont do  mr godfrey ablewhite began another story mr luker wasted no more words on him he got up and rang the bell for the servant to show the gentleman out  upon this compulsion mr godfrey made an effort and came out with a new and amended version of the affair to the following effect  after privately slipping the laudanum into your brandy and water he wished you good night and went into his own room it was the next room to yours and the two had a door of communication between them on entering his own room mr godfrey as he supposed closed his door his money troubles kept him awake he sat in his dressinggown and slippers for nearly an hour thinking over his position just as he was preparing to get into bed he heard you talking to yourself in your own room and going to the door of communication found that he had not shut it as he supposed  he looked into your room to see what was the matter he discovered you with the candle in your hand just leaving your bedchamber he heard you say to yourself in a voice quite unlike your own voice how do i know the indians may be hidden in the house  up to that time he had simply supposed himself in giving you the laudanum to be helping to make you the victim of a harmless practical joke it now occurred to him that the laudanum had taken some effect on you which had not been foreseen by the doctor any more than by himself in the fear of an accident happening he followed you softly to see what you would do  he followed you to miss verinders sittingroom and saw you go in you left the door open he looked through the crevice thus produced between the door and the post before he ventured into the room himself  in that position he not only detected you in taking the diamond out of the drawerhe also detected miss verinder silently watching you from her bedroom through her open door his own eyes satisfied him that she saw you take the diamond too  before you left the sittingroom again you hesitated a little mr godfrey took advantage of this hesitation to get back again to his bedroom before you came out and discovered him he had barely got back before you got back too you saw him as he supposes just as he was passing through the door of communication at any rate you called to him in a strange drowsy voice  he came back to you you looked at him in a dull sleepy way you put the diamond into his hand you said to him take it back godfrey to your fathers bank its safe thereits not safe here you turned away unsteadily and put on your dressinggown you sat down in the large armchair in your room you said i cant take it back to the bank my heads like leadand i cant feel my feet under me your head sank on the back of the chairyou heaved a heavy sighand you fell asleep  mr godfrey ablewhite went back with the diamond into his own room his statement is that he came to no conclusion at that timeexcept that he would wait and see what happened in the morning  when the morning came your language and conduct showed that you were absolutely ignorant of what you had said and done overnight at the same time miss verinders language and conduct showed that she was resolved to say nothing in mercy to you on her side if mr godfrey ablewhite chose to keep the diamond he might do so with perfect impunity the moonstone stood between him and ruin he put the moonstone into his pocket     v  this was the story told by your cousin under pressure of necessity to mr luker  mr luker believed the story to be as to all main essentials trueon this ground that mr godfrey ablewhite was too great a fool to have invented it mr bruff and i agree with mr luker in considering this test of the truth of the story to be a perfectly reliable one  the next question was the question of what mr luker would do in the matter of the moonstone he proposed the following terms as the only terms on which he would consent to mix himself up with what was even in his line of business a doubtful and dangerous transaction  mr luker would consent to lend mr godfrey ablewhite the sum of two thousand pounds on condition that the moonstone was to be deposited with him as a pledge if at the expiration of one year from that date mr godfrey ablewhite paid three thousand pounds to mr luker he was to receive back the diamond as a pledge redeemed if he failed to produce the money at the expiration of the year the pledge otherwise the moonstone was to be considered as forfeited to mr lukerwho would in this latter case generously make mr godfrey a present of certain promissory notes of his relating to former dealings which were then in the moneylenders possession  it is needless to say that mr godfrey indignantly refused to listen to these monstrous terms mr luker thereupon handed him back the diamond and wished him good night  your cousin went to the door and came back again how was he to be sure that the conversation of that evening would be kept strictly secret between his friend and himself  mr luker didnt profess to know how if mr godfrey had accepted his terms mr godfrey would have made him an accomplice and might have counted on his silence as on a certainty as things were mr luker must be guided by his own interests if awkward inquiries were made how could he be expected to compromise himself for the sake of a man who had declined to deal with him  receiving this reply mr godfrey ablewhite did what all animals human and otherwise do when they find themselves caught in a trap he looked about him in a state of helpless despair the day of the month recorded on a neat little card in a box on the moneylenders chimneypiece happened to attract his eye it was the twentythird of june on the twentyfourth he had three hundred pounds to pay to the young gentleman for whom he was trustee and no chance of raising the money except the chance that mr luker had offered to him but for this miserable obstacle he might have taken the diamond to amsterdam and have made a marketable commodity of it by having it cut up into separate stones as matters stood he had no choice but to accept mr lukers terms after all he had a year at his disposal in which to raise the three thousand poundsand a year is a long time  mr luker drew out the necessary documents on the spot when they were signed he gave mr godfrey ablewhite two cheques one dated june 23rd for three hundred pounds another dated a week on for the remaining balance seventeen hundred pounds  how the moonstone was trusted to the keeping of mr lukers bankers and how the indians treated mr luker and mr godfrey after that had been done you know already  the next event in your cousins life refers again to miss verinder he proposed marriage to her for the second timeand after having being accepted he consented at her request to consider the marriage as broken off one of his reasons for making this concession has been penetrated by mr bruff miss verinder had only a life interest in her mothers propertyand there was no raising the twenty thousand pounds on that  but you will say he might have saved the three thousand pounds to redeem the pledged diamond if he had married he might have done so certainlysupposing neither his wife nor her guardians and trustees objected to his anticipating more than half of the income at his disposal for some unknown purpose in the first year of his marriage but even if he got over this obstacle there was another waiting for him in the background the lady at the villa had heard of his contemplated marriage a superb woman mr blake of the sort that are not to be trifled withthe sort with the light complexion and the roman nose she felt the utmost contempt for mr godfrey ablewhite it would be silent contempt if he made a handsome provision for her otherwise it would be contempt with a tongue to it miss verinders life interest allowed him no more hope of raising the provision than of raising the twenty thousand pounds he couldnt marryhe really couldnt marry under all the circumstances  how he tried his luck again with another lady and how that marriage also broke down on the question of money you know already you also know of the legacy of five thousand pounds left to him shortly afterwards by one of those many admirers among the soft sex whose good graces this fascinating man had contrived to win that legacy as the event has proved led him to his death  i have ascertained that when he went abroad on getting his five thousand pounds he went to amsterdam there he made all the necessary arrangements for having the diamond cut into separate stones he came back in disguise and redeemed the moonstone on the appointed day a few days were allowed to elapse as a precaution agreed to by both parties before the jewel was actually taken out of the bank if he had got safe with it to amsterdam there would have been just time between july fortynine and february fifty when the young gentleman came of age to cut the diamond and to make a marketable commodity polished or unpolished of the separate stones judge from this what motives he had to run the risk which he actually ran it was neck or nothing with himif ever it was neck or nothing with a man yet  i have only to remind you before closing this report that there is a chance of laying hands on the indians and of recovering the moonstone yet they are now there is every reason to believe on their passage to bombay in an east indiaman the ship barring accidents will touch at no other port on her way out and the authorities at bombay already communicated with by letter overland will be prepared to board the vessel the moment she enters the harbour  i have the honour to remain dear sir your obedient servant richard cuff late sergeant in the detective force scotland yard london        notewherever the report touches on the events of the      birthday or of the three days that followed it compare      with betteredges narrative chapters viii to xiii      seventh narrative  in a letter from mr candy   frizinghall wednesday september 26th 1849dear mr franklin blake you will anticipate the sad news i have to tell you on finding your letter to ezra jennings returned to you unopened in this enclosure he died in my arms at sunrise on wednesday last  i am not to blame for having failed to warn you that his end was at hand he expressly forbade me to write to you i am indebted to mr franklin blake he said for having seen some happy days dont distress him mr candydont distress him  his sufferings up to the last six hours of his life were terrible to see in the intervals of remission when his mind was clear i entreated him to tell me of any relatives of his to whom i might write he asked to be forgiven for refusing anything to me and then he saidnot bitterlythat he would die as he had lived forgotten and unknown he maintained that resolution to the last there is no hope now of making any discoveries concerning him his story is a blank  the day before he died he told me where to find all his papers i brought them to him on his bed there was a little bundle of old letters which he put aside there was his unfinished book there was his diaryin many locked volumes he opened the volume for this year and tore out one by one the pages relating to the time when you and he were together give those he said to mr franklin blake in years to come he may feel an interest in looking back at what is written there then he clasped his hands and prayed god fervently to bless you and those dear to you he said he should like to see you again but the next moment he altered his mind no he answered when i offered to write i wont distress him i wont distress him  at his request i next collected the other papersthat is to say the bundle of letters the unfinished book and the volumes of the diaryand enclosed them all in one wrapper sealed with my own seal promise he said that you will put this into my coffin with your own hand and that you will see that no other hand touches it afterwards  i gave him my promise and the promise has been performed  he asked me to do one other thing for himwhich it cost me a hard struggle to comply with he said let my grave be forgotten give me your word of honour that you will allow no monument of any sortnot even the commonest tombstoneto mark the place of my burial let me sleep nameless let me rest unknown when i tried to plead with him to alter his resolution he became for the first and only time violently agitated i could not bear to see it and i gave way nothing but a little grass mound marks the place of his rest in time the tombstones will rise round it and the people who come after us will look and wonder at the nameless grave  as i have told you for six hours before his death his sufferings ceased he dozed a little i think he dreamed once or twice he smiled a womans name as i supposethe name of ellawas often on his lips at this time a few minutes before the end he asked me to lift him on his pillow to see the sun rise through the window he was very weak his head fell on my shoulder he whispered its coming then he said kiss me i kissed his forehead on a sudden he lifted his head the sunlight touched his face a beautiful expression an angelic expression came over it he cried out three times peace peace peace his head sank back again on my shoulder and the long trouble of his life was at an end  so he has gone from us this was as i think a great manthough the world never knew him he had the sweetest temper i have ever met with the loss of him makes me feel very lonely perhaps i have never been quite myself since my illness sometimes i think of giving up my practice and going away and trying what some of the foreign baths and waters will do for me  it is reported here that you and miss verinder are to be married next month please to accept my best congratulations  the pages of my poor friends journal are waiting for you at my housesealed up with your name on the wrapper i was afraid to trust them to the post  my best respects and good wishes attend miss verinder i remain dear mr franklin blake truly yours  thomas candy      eighth narrative  contributed by gabriel betteredge   i am the person as you remember no doubt who led the way in these pages and opened the story i am also the person who is left behind as it were to close the story up  let nobody suppose that i have any last words to say here concerning the indian diamond i hold that unlucky jewel in abhorrenceand i refer you to other authority than mine for such news of the moonstone as you may at the present time be expected to receive my purpose in this place is to state a fact in the history of the family which has been passed over by everybody and which i wont allow to be disrespectfully smothered up in that way the fact to which i allude isthe marriage of miss rachel and mr franklin blake this interesting event took place at our house in yorkshire on tuesday october ninth eighteen hundred and fortynine i had a new suit of clothes on the occasion and the married couple went to spend the honeymoon in scotland  family festivals having been rare enough at our house since my poor mistresss death i ownon this occasion of the weddingto having towards the latter part of the day taken a drop too much on the strength of it  if you have ever done the same sort of thing yourself you will understand and feel for me if you have not you will very likely say disgusting old man why does he tell us this the reason why is now to come  having then taken my drop bless you you have got your favourite vice too only your vice isnt mine and mine isnt yours i next applied the one infallible remedythat remedy being as you know robinson crusoe where i opened that unrivalled book i cant say where the lines of print at last left off running into each other i know however perfectly well it was at page three hundred and eighteena domestic bit concerning robinson crusoes marriage as follows  with those thoughts i considered my new engagement that i had a wife observe so had mr franklinone child bornobserve again that might yet be mr franklins case tooand my wife thenwhat robinson crusoes wife did or did not do then i felt no desire to discover i scored the bit about the child with my pencil and put a morsel of paper for a mark to keep the place lie you there i said till the marriage of mr franklin and miss rachel is some months olderand then well see  the months passed more than i had bargained for and no occasion presented itself for disturbing that mark in the book it was not till this present month of november eighteen hundred and fifty that mr franklin came into my room in high good spirits and said betteredge i have got some news for you something is going to happen in the house before we are many months older  does it concern the family sir i asked  it decidedly concerns the family says mr franklin  has your good lady anything to do with it if you please sir  she has a great deal to do with it says mr franklin beginning to look a little surprised  you neednt say a word more sir i answered god bless you both im heartily glad to hear it  mr franklin stared like a person thunderstruck may i venture to inquire where you got your information he asked i only got mine imparted in the strictest secrecy five minutes since  here was an opportunity of producing robinson crusoe here was a chance of reading that domestic bit about the child which i had marked on the day of mr franklins marriage i read those miraculous words with an emphasis which did them justice and then i looked him severely in the face now sir do you believe in robinson crusoe i asked with a solemnity suitable to the occasion  betteredge says mr franklin with equal solemnity im convinced at last he shook hands with meand i felt that i had converted him  with the relation of this extraordinary circumstance my reappearance in these pages comes to an end let nobody laugh at the unique anecdote here related you are welcome to be as merry as you please over everything else i have written but when i write of robinson crusoe by the lord its seriousand i request you to take it accordingly  when this is said all is said ladies and gentlemen i make my bow and shut up the story      epilogue  the finding of the diamond     i  the statement of sergeant cuffs man 1849   on the twentyseventh of june last i received instructions from sergeant cuff to follow three men suspected of murder and described as indians they had been seen on the tower wharf that morning embarking on board the steamer bound for rotterdam  i left london by a steamer belonging to another company which sailed on the morning of thursday the twentyeighth arriving at rotterdam i succeeded in finding the commander of the wednesdays steamer he informed me that the indians had certainly been passengers on board his vesselbut as far as gravesend only off that place one of the three had inquired at what time they would reach calais on being informed that the steamer was bound to rotterdam the spokesman of the party expressed the greatest surprise and distress at the mistake which he and his two friends had made they were all willing he said to sacrifice their passage money if the commander of the steamer would only put them ashore commiserating their position as foreigners in a strange land and knowing no reason for detaining them the commander signalled for a shore boat and the three men left the vessel  this proceeding of the indians having been plainly resolved on beforehand as a means of preventing their being traced i lost no time in returning to england i left the steamer at gravesend and discovered that the indians had gone from that place to london thence i again traced them as having left for plymouth inquiries made at plymouth proved that they had sailed fortyeight hours previously in the bewley castle east indiaman bound direct to bombay  on receiving this intelligence sergeant cuff caused the authorities at bombay to be communicated with overlandso that the vessel might be boarded by the police immediately on her entering the port this step having been taken my connection with the matter came to an end i have heard nothing more of it since that time     ii  the statement of the captain 1849   i am requested by sergeant cuff to set in writing certain facts concerning three men believed to be hindoos who were passengers last summer in the ship bewley castle bound for bombay direct under my command  the hindoos joined us at plymouth on the passage out i heard no complaint of their conduct they were berthed in the forward part of the vessel i had but few occasions myself of personally noticing them  in the latter part of the voyage we had the misfortune to be becalmed for three days and nights off the coast of india i have not got the ships journal to refer to and i cannot now call to mind the latitude and longitude as to our position therefore i am only able to state generally that the currents drifted us in towards the land and that when the wind found us again we reached our port in twentyfour hours afterwards  the discipline of a ship as all seafaring persons know becomes relaxed in a long calm the discipline of my ship became relaxed certain gentlemen among the passengers got some of the smaller boats lowered and amused themselves by rowing about and swimming when the sun at evening time was cool enough to let them divert themselves in that way the boats when done with ought to have been slung up again in their places instead of this they were left moored to the ships side what with the heat and what with the vexation of the weather neither officers nor men seemed to be in heart for their duty while the calm lasted  on the third night nothing unusual was heard or seen by the watch on deck when the morning came the smallest of the boats was missingand the three hindoos were next reported to be missing too  if these men had stolen the boat shortly after dark which i have no doubt they did we were near enough to the land to make it vain to send in pursuit of them when the discovery was made in the morning i have no doubt they got ashore in that calm weather making all due allowance for fatigue and clumsy rowing before daybreak  on reaching our port i there learnt for the first time the reason these passengers had for seizing their opportunity of escaping from the ship i could only make the same statement to the authorities which i have made here they considered me to blame for allowing the discipline of the vessel to be relaxed i have expressed my regret on this score to them and to my owners  since that time nothing has been heard to my knowledge of the three hindoos i have no more to add to what is here written     iii  the statement of mr murthwaite 1850  in a letter to mr bruff   have you any recollection my dear sir of a semisavage person whom you met out at dinner in london in the autumn of fortyeight permit me to remind you that the persons name was murthwaite and that you and he had a long conversation together after dinner the talk related to an indian diamond called the moonstone and to a conspiracy then in existence to get possession of the gem  since that time i have been wandering in central asia thence i have drifted back to the scene of some of my past adventures in the north and northwest of india about a fortnight since i found myself in a certain district or province but little known to europeans called kattiawar  here an adventure befell me in which incredible as it may appear you are personally interested  in the wild regions of kattiawar and how wild they are you will understand when i tell you that even the husbandmen plough the land armed to the teeth the population is fanatically devoted to the old hindoo religionto the ancient worship of bramah and vishnu the few mahometan families thinly scattered about the villages in the interior are afraid to taste meat of any kind a mahometan even suspected of killing that sacred animal the cow is as a matter of course put to death without mercy in these parts by the pious hindoo neighbours who surround him to strengthen the religious enthusiasm of the people two of the most famous shrines of hindoo pilgrimage are contained within the boundaries of kattiawar one of them is dwarka the birthplace of the god krishna the other is the sacred city of somnauthsacked and destroyed as long since as the eleventh century by the mahometan conqueror mahmoud of ghizni  finding myself for the second time in these romantic regions i resolved not to leave kattiawar without looking once more on the magnificent desolation of somnauth at the place where i planned to do this i was as nearly as i could calculate it some three days distant journeying on foot from the sacred city  i had not been long on the road before i noticed that other peopleby twos and threesappeared to be travelling in the same direction as myself  to such of these as spoke to me i gave myself out as a hindooboodhist from a distant province bound on a pilgrimage it is needless to say that my dress was of the sort to carry out this description add that i know the language as well as i know my own and that i am lean enough and brown enough to make it no easy matter to detect my european originand you will understand that i passed muster with the people readily not as one of themselves but as a stranger from a distant part of their own country  on the second day the number of hindoos travelling in my direction had increased to fifties and hundreds on the third day the throng had swollen to thousands all slowly converging to one pointthe city of somnauth  a trifling service which i was able to render to one of my fellowpilgrims during the third days journey proved the means of introducing me to certain hindoos of the higher caste from these men i learnt that the multitude was on its way to a great religious ceremony which was to take place on a hill at a little distance from somnauth the ceremony was in honour of the god of the moon and it was to be held at night  the crowd detained us as we drew near to the place of celebration by the time we reached the hill the moon was high in the heaven my hindoo friends possessed some special privileges which enabled them to gain access to the shrine they kindly allowed me to accompany them when we arrived at the place we found the shrine hidden from our view by a curtain hung between two magnificent trees beneath the trees a flat projection of rock jutted out and formed a species of natural platform below this i stood in company with my hindoo friends  looking back down the hill the view presented the grandest spectacle of nature and man in combination that i have ever seen the lower slopes of the eminence melted imperceptibly into a grassy plain the place of the meeting of three rivers on one side the graceful winding of the waters stretched away now visible now hidden by trees as far as the eye could see on the other the waveless ocean slept in the calm of the night people this lovely scene with tens of thousands of human creatures all dressed in white stretching down the sides of the hill overflowing into the plain and fringing the nearer banks of the winding rivers light this halt of the pilgrims by the wild red flames of cressets and torches streaming up at intervals from every part of the innumerable throng imagine the moonlight of the east pouring in unclouded glory over alland you will form some idea of the view that met me when i looked forth from the summit of the hill  a strain of plaintive music played on stringed instruments and flutes recalled my attention to the hidden shrine  i turned and saw on the rocky platform the figures of three men in the central figure of the three i recognised the man to whom i had spoken in england when the indians appeared on the terrace at lady verinders house the other two who had been his companions on that occasion were no doubt his companions also on this  one of the spectators near whom i was standing saw me start in a whisper he explained to me the apparition of the three figures on the platform of rock  they were brahmins he said who had forfeited their caste in the service of the god the god had commanded that their purification should be the purification by pilgrimage on that night the three men were to part in three separate directions they were to set forth as pilgrims to the shrines of india never more were they to look on each others faces never more were they to rest on their wanderings from the day which witnessed their separation to the day which witnessed their death  as those words were whispered to me the plaintive music ceased the three men prostrated themselves on the rock before the curtain which hid the shrine they rosethey looked on one anotherthey embraced then they descended separately among the people the people made way for them in dead silence in three different directions i saw the crowd part at one and the same moment slowly the grand white mass of the people closed together again the track of the doomed men through the ranks of their fellow mortals was obliterated we saw them no more  a new strain of music loud and jubilant rose from the hidden shrine the crowd around me shuddered and pressed together  the curtain between the trees was drawn aside and the shrine was disclosed to view  there raised high on a throneseated on his typical antelope with his four arms stretching towards the four corners of the earththere soared above us dark and awful in the mystic light of heaven the god of the moon and there in the forehead of the deity gleamed the yellow diamond whose splendour had last shone on me in england from the bosom of a womans dress  yes after the lapse of eight centuries the moonstone looks forth once more over the walls of the sacred city in which its story first began how it has found its way back to its wild native landby what accident or by what crime the indians regained possession of their sacred gem may be in your knowledge but is not in mine you have lost sight of it in england and if i know anything of this people you have lost sight of it for ever  so the years pass and repeat each other so the same events revolve in the cycles of time what will be the next adventures of the moonstone who can tell
