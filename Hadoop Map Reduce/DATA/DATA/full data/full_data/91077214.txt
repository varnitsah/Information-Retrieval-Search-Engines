91077214	on the relations of man to the lower animals  by thomas h huxley          multis videri poterit majorem esso differentiam simiae et      hominis quam diei et noctis verum tamen hi

the question of questions for mankindthe problem which underlies all others and is more deeply interesting than any otheris the ascertainment of the place which man occupies in nature and of his relations to the universe of things whence our race has come what are the limits of our power over nature and of natures power over us to what goal we are tending are the problems which present themselves anew and with undiminished interest to every man born into the world most of us shrinking from the difficulties and dangers which beset the seeker after original answers to these riddles are contented to ignore them altogether or to smother the investigating spirit under the featherbed of respected and respectable tradition but in every age one or two restless spirits blessed with that constructive genius which can only build on a secure foundation or cursed with the spirit of mere scepticism are unable to follow in the wellworn and comfortable track of their forefathers and contemporaries and unmindful of thorns and stumblingblocks strike out into paths of their own the sceptics end in the infidelity which asserts the problem to be insoluble or in the atheism which denies the existence of any orderly progress and governance of things the men of genius propound solutions which grow into systems of theology or of philosophy or veiled in musical language which suggests more than it asserts take the shape of the poetry of an epoch  each such answer to the great question invariably asserted by the followers of its propounder if not by himself to be complete and final remains in high authority and esteem it may be for one century or it may be for twenty but as invariably time proves each reply to have been a mere approximation to the truthtolerable chiefly on account of the ignorance of those by whom it was accepted and wholly intolerable when tested by the larger knowledge of their successors  in a wellworn metaphor a parallel is drawn between the life of man and the metamorphosis of the caterpillar into the butterfly but the comparison may be more just as well as more novel if for its former term we take the mental progress of the race history shows that the human mind fed by constant accessions of knowledge periodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings and bursts them asunder to appear in new habiliments as the feeding and growing grub at intervals casts its too narrow skin and assumes another itself but temporary truly the imago state of man seems to be terribly distant but every moult is a step gained and of such there have been many  since the revival of learning whereby the western races of europe were enabled to enter upon that progress towards true knowledge which was commenced by the philosophers of greece but was almost arrested in subsequent long ages of intellectual stagnation or at most gyration the human larva has been feeding vigorously and moulting in proportion a skin of some dimension was cast in the 16th century and another towards the end of the 18th while within the last fifty years the extraordinary growth of every department of physical science has spread among us mental food of so nutritious and stimulating a character that a new ecdysis seems imminent but this is a process not unusually accompanied by many throes and some sickness and debility or it may be by graver disturbances so that every good citizen must feel bound to facilitate the process and even if he have nothing but a scalpel to work withal to ease the cracking integument to the best of his ability  in this duty lies my excuse for the publication of these essays for it will be admitted that some knowledge of mans position in the animate world is an indispensable preliminary to the proper understanding of his relations to the universeand this again resolves itself in the long run into an inquiry into the nature and the closeness of the ties which connect him with those singular creatures whose history 1 has been sketched in the preceding pages  the importance of such an inquiry is indeed intuitively manifest brought face to face with these blurred copies of himself the least thoughtful of men is conscious of a certain shock due perhaps not so much to disgust at the aspect of what looks like an insulting caricature as to the awakening of a sudden and profound mistrust of timehonoured theories and stronglyrooted prejudices regarding his own position in nature and his relations to the underworld of life while that which remains a dim suspicion for the unthinking becomes a vast argument fraught with the deepest consequences for all who are acquainted with the recent progress of the anatomical and physiological sciences  i now propose briefly to unfold that argument and to set forth in a form intelligible to those who possess no special acquaintance with anatomical science the chief facts upon which all conclusions respecting the nature and the extent of the bonds which connect man with the brute world must be based i shall then indicate the one immediate conclusion which in my judgment is justified by those facts and i shall finally discuss the bearing of that conclusion upon the hypotheses which have been entertained respecting the origin of man  the facts to which i would first direct the readers attention though ignored by many of the professed instructors of the public mind are easy of demonstration and are universally agreed to by men of science while their significance is so great that whoso has duly pondered over them will i think find little to startle him in the other revelations of biology i refer to those facts which have been made known by the study of development  it is a truth of very wide if not of universal application that every living creature commences its existence under a form different from and simpler than that which it eventually attains  illustration fig 12a egg of the dog with the vitelline membrane burst so as to give exit to the yelk the germinal vesicle a and its included spot b b c d e f successive changes of the yelk indicated in the text after bischoff  the oak is a more complex thing than the little rudimentary plant contained in the acorn the caterpillar is more complex than the egg the butterfly than the caterpillar and each of these beings in passing from its rudimentary to its perfect condition runs through a series of changes the sum of which is called its development in the higher animals these changes are extremely complicated but within the last half century the labours of such men as von baer rathke reichert bischof and remak have almost completely unravelled them so that the successive stages of development which are exhibited by a dog for example are now as well known to the embryologist as are the steps of the metamorphosis of the silkworm moth to the schoolboy it will be useful to consider with attention the nature and the order of the stages of canine development as an example of the process in the higher animals generally  the dog like all animals save the very lowest and further inquiries may not improbably remove the apparent exception commences its existence as an egg as a body which is in every sense as much an egg as that of a hen but is devoid of that accumulation of nutritive matter which confers upon the birds egg its exceptional size and domestic utility and wants the shell which would not only be useless to an animal incubated within the body of its parent but would cut it off from access to the source of that nutriment which the young creature requires but which the minute egg of the mammal does not contain within itself  the dogs egg is in fact a little spheroidal bag fig 12 formed of a delicate transparent membrane called the vitelline membrane and about 1130 to 1120th of an inch in diameter it contains a mass of viscid nutritive matterthe yelkwithin which is inclosed a second much more delicate spheroidal bag called the germinal vesicle a in this lastly lies a more solid rounded body termed the germinal spot b  the egg or ovum is originally formed within a gland from which in due season it becomes detached and passes into the living chamber fitted for its protection and maintenance during the protracted process of gestation here when subjected to the required conditions this minute and apparently insignificant particle of living matter becomes animated by a new and mysterious activity the germinal vesicle and spot cease to be discernible their precise fate being one of the yet unsolved problems of embryology but the yelk becomes circumferentially indented as if an invisible knife had been drawn round it and thus appears divided into two hemispheres fig 12 c  by the repetition of this process in various planes these hemispheres become subdivided so that four segments are produced d and these in like manner divide and subdivide again until the whole yelk is converted into a mass of granules each of which consists of a minute spheroid of yelksubstance inclosing a central particle the socalled nucleus f nature by this process has attained much the same result as that at which a human artificer arrives by his operations in a brickfield she takes the rough plastic material of the yelk and breaks it up into wellshaped tolerably evensized masses handy for building up into any part of the living edifice  illustration fig 13earliest rudiment of the dog b rudiment further advanced showing the foundations of the head tail and vertebral column c the very young puppy with attached ends of the yelksac and allantois and invested in the amnion  next the mass of organic bricks or cells as they are technically called thus formed acquires an orderly arrangement becoming converted into a hollow spheroid with double walls then upon one side of this spheroid appears a thickening and by and bye in the centre of the area of thickening a straight shallow groove fig 13 a marks the central line of the edifice which is to be raised or in other words indicates the position of the middle line of the body of the future dog the substance bounding the groove on each side next rises up into a fold the rudiment of the side wall of that long cavity which will eventually lodge the spinal marrow and the brain and in the floor of this chamber appears a solid cellular cord the socalled notochord one end of the inclosed cavity dilates to form the head fig 13 b the other remains narrow and eventually becomes the tail the side walls of the body are fashioned out of the downward continuation of the walls of the groove and from them by and bye grow out little buds which by degrees assume the shape of limbs watching the fashioning process stage by stage one is forcibly reminded of the modeller in clay every part every organ is at first as it were pinched up rudely and sketched out in the rough then shaped more accurately and only at last receives the touches which stamp its final character  thus at length the young puppy assumes such a form as is shown in fig 13 c in this condition it has a disproportionately large head as dissimilar to that of a dog as the budlike limbs are unlike his legs  the remains of the yelk which have not yet been applied to the nutrition and growth of the young animal are contained in a sac attached to the rudimentary intestine and termed the yelk sac or umbilical vesicle two membranous bags intended to subserve respectively the protection and nutrition of the young creature have been developed from the skin and from the under and hinder surface of the body the former the socalled amnion is a sac filled with fluid which invests the whole body of the embryo and plays the part of a sort of waterbed for it the other termed the allantois grows out loaded with bloodvessels from the ventral region and eventually applying itself to the walls of the cavity in which the developing organism is contained enables these vessels to become the channel by which the stream of nutriment required to supply the wants of the offspring is furnished to it by the parent  the structure which is developed by the interlacement of the vessels of the offspring with those of the parent and by means of which the former is enabled to receive nourishment and to get rid of effete matters is termed the placenta  it would be tedious and it is unnecessary for my present purpose to trace the process of development further suffice it to say that by a long and gradual series of changes the rudiment here depicted and described becomes a puppy is born and then by still slower and less perceptible steps passes into the adult dog  there is not much apparent resemblance between a barndoor fowl and the dog who protects the farmyard nevertheless the student of development finds not only that the chick commences its existence as an egg primarily identical in all essential respects with that of the dog but that the yelk of this egg undergoes divisionthat the primitive groove arises and that the contiguous parts of the germ are fashioned by precisely similar methods into a young chick which at one stage of its existence is so like the nascent dog that ordinary inspection would hardly distinguish the two  the history of the development of any other vertebrate animal lizard snake frog or fish tells the same story there is always to begin with an egg having the same essential structure as that of the dogthe yelk of that egg always undergoes division or segmentation as it is often called the ultimate products of that segmentation constitute the building materials for the body of the young animal and this is built up round a primitive groove in the floor of which a notochord is developed furthermore there is a period in which the young of all these animals resemble one another not merely in outward form but in all essentials of structure so closely that the differences between them are inconsiderable while in their subsequent course they diverge more and more widely from one another and it is a general law that the more closely any animals resemble one another in adult structure the longer and the more intimately do their embryos resemble one another so that for example the embryos of a snake and of a lizard remain like one another longer than do those of a snake and of a bird and the embryo of a dog and of a cat remain like one another for a far longer period than do those of a dog and a bird or of a dog and an opossum or even than those of a dog and a monkey  thus the study of development affords a clear test of closeness of structural affinity and one turns with impatience to inquire what results are yielded by the study of the development of man is he something apart does he originate in a totally different way from dog bird frog and fish thus justifying those who assert him to have no place in nature and no real affinity with the lower world of animal life or does he originate in a similar germ pass through the same slow and gradually progressive modificationsdepend on the same contrivances for protection and nutrition and finally enter the world by the help of the same mechanism the reply is not doubtful for a moment and has not been doubtful any time these thirty years without question the mode of origin and the early stages of the development of man are identical with those of the animals immediately below him in the scalewithout a doubt in these respects he is far nearer the apes than the apes are to the dog  the human ovum is about 1125 of an inch in diameter and might be described in the same terms as that of the dog so that i need only refer to the figure illustrative 14 a of its structure it leaves the organ in which it is formed in a similar fashion and enters the organic chamber prepared for its reception in the same way the conditions of its development being in all respects the same it has not yet been possible and only by some rare chance can it ever be possible to study the human ovum in so early a developmental stage as that of yelk division but there is every reason to conclude that the changes it undergoes are identical with those exhibited by the ova of other vertebrated animals for the formative materials of which the rudimentary human body is composed in the earliest conditions in which it has been observed are the same as those of other animals some of these earliest stages are figured below and as will be seen they are strictly comparable to the very early states of the dog the marvellous correspondence between the two which is kept up even for some time as development advances becoming apparent by the simple comparison of the figures with those on page 249  illustration fig 14a human ovum after kolliker a germinal vesicle b germinal spot b a very early condition of man with yelksac allantois and amnion original c a more advanced stage after kolliker compare fig 13 c  indeed it is very long before the body of the young human being can be readily discriminated from that of the young puppy but at a tolerably early period the two become distinguishable by the different form of their adjuncts the yelksac and the allantois the former in the dog becomes long and spindleshaped while in man it remains spherical the latter in the dog attains an extremely large size and the vascular processes which are developed from it and eventually give rise to the formation of the placenta taking root as it were in the parental organism so as to draw nourishment therefrom as the root of a tree extracts it from the soil are arranged in an encircling zone while in man the allantois remains comparatively small and its vascular rootlets are eventually restricted to one disklike spot hence while the placenta of the dog is like a girdle that of man has the cakelike form indicated by the name of the organ  but exactly in those respects in which the developing man differs from the dog he resembles the ape which like man has a spheroidal yelksac and a discoidalsometimes partially lobedplacenta so that it is only quite in the later stages of development that the young human being presents marked differences from the young ape while the latter departs as much from the dog in its development as the man does  startling as the last assertion may appear to be it is demonstrably true and it alone appears to me sufficient to place beyond all doubt the structural unity of man with the rest of the animal world and more particularly and closely with the apes  thus identical in the physical processes by which he originatesidentical in the early stages of his formationidentical in the mode of his nutrition before and after birth with the animals which lie immediately below him in the scaleman if his adult and perfect structure be compared with theirs exhibits as might be expected a marvellous likeness of organization he resembles them as they resemble one anotherhe differs from them as they differ from one anotherand though these differences and resemblances cannot be weighed and measured their value may be readily estimated the scale or standard of judgment touching that value being afforded and expressed by the system of classification of animals now current among zoologists  a careful study of the resemblances and differences presented by animals has in fact led naturalists to arrange them into groups or assemblages all the members of each group presenting a certain amount of definable resemblance and the number of points of similarity being smaller as the group is larger and vice versa thus all creatures which agree only in presenting the few distinctive marks of animality form the kingdom animalia the numerous animals which agree only in possessing the special characters of vertebrates form one subkingdom of this kingdom then the subkingdom vertebrata is subdivided into the five classes fishes amphibians reptiles birds and mammals and these into smaller groups called orders these into families and genera while the last are finally broken up into the smallest assemblages which are distinguished by the possession of constant notsexual characters these ultimate groups are species  every year tends to bring about a greater uniformity of opinion throughout the zoological world as to the limits and characters of these groups great and small at present for example no one has the least doubt regarding the characters of the classes mammalia aves or reptilia nor does the question arise whether any thoroughly wellknown animal should be placed in one class or the other again there is a very general agreement respecting the characters and limits of the orders of mammals and as to the animals which are structurally necessitated to take a place in one or another order  no one doubts for example that the sloth and the anteater the kangaroo and the opossum the tiger and the badger the tapir and the rhinoceros are respectively members of the same orders these successive pairs of animals may and some do differ from one another immensely in such matters as the proportions and structure of their limbs the number of their dorsal and lumbar vertebrae the adaptation of their frames to climbing leaping or running the number and form of their teeth and the characters of their skulls and of the contained brain but with all these differences they are so closely connected in all the more important and fundamental characters of their organization and so distinctly separated by these same characters from other animals that zoologists find it necessary to group them together as members of one order and if any new animal were discovered and were found to present no greater difference from the kangaroo and the opossum for example than these animals do from one another the zoologist would not only be logically compelled to rank it in the same order with these but he would not think of doing otherwise  bearing this obvious course of zoological reasoning in mind let us endeavour for a moment to disconnect our thinking selves from the mask of humanity let us imagine ourselves scientific saturnians if you will fairly acquainted with such animals as now inhabit the earth and employed in discussing the relations they bear to a new and singular erect and featherless biped which some enterprising traveller overcoming the difficulties of space and gravitation has brought from that distant planet for our inspection well preserved may be in a cask of rum we should all at once agree upon placing him among the mammalian vertebrates and his lower jaw his molars and his brain would leave no room for doubting the systematic position of the new genus among those mammals whose young are nourished during gestation by means of a placenta or what are called the placental mammals  further the most superficial study would at once convince us that among the orders of placental mammals neither the whales nor the hoofed creatures nor the sloths and anteaters nor the carnivorous cats dogs and bears still less the rodent rats and rabbits or the insectivorous moles and hedgehogs or the bats could claim our homo as one of themselves  there would remain then but one order for comparison that of the apes using that word in its broadest sense and the question for discussion would narrow itself to thisis man so different from any of these apes that he must form an order by himself or does he differ less from them than they differ from one another and hence must take his place in the same order with them  being happily free from all real or imaginary personal interest in the results of the inquiry thus set afoot we should proceed to weigh the arguments on one side and on the other with as much judicial calmness as if the question related to a new opossum we should endeavour to ascertain without seeking either to magnify or diminish them all the characters by which our new mammal differed from the apes and if we found that these were of less structural value than those which distinguish certain members of the ape order from others universally admitted to be of the same order we should undoubtedly place the newly discovered tellurian genus with them  i now proceed to detail the facts which seem to me to leave us no choice but to adopt the last mentioned course  it is quite certain that the ape which most nearly approaches man in the totality of its organization is either the chimpanzee or the gorilla and as it makes no practical difference for the purposes of my present argument which is selected for comparison on the one hand with man and on the other hand with the rest of the primates 2 i shall select the latter so far as its organization is knownas a brute now so celebrated in prose and verse that all must have heard of him and have formed some conception of his appearance i shall take up as many of the most important points of difference between man and this remarkable creature as the space at my disposal will allow me to discuss and the necessities of the argument demand and i shall inquire into the value and magnitude of these differences when placed side by side with those which separate the gorilla from other animals of the same order  in the general proportions of the body and limbs there is a remarkable difference between the gorilla and man which at once strikes the eye the gorillas braincase is smaller its trunk larger its lower limbs shorter its upper limbs longer in proportion than those of man  i find that the vertebral column of a fullgrown gorilla in the museum of the royal college of surgeons measures 27 inches along its anterior curvature from the upper edge of the atlas or first vertebra of the neck to the lower extremity of the sacrum that the arm without the hand is 3112 inches long that the leg without the foot is 2612 inches long that the hand is 934 inches long the foot 1114 inches long  in other words taking the length of the spinal column as 100 the arm equals 115 the leg 96 the hand 36 and the foot 41  in the skeleton of a male bosjesman in the same collection the proportions by the same measurement to the spinal column taken as 100 arethe arm 78 the leg 110 the hand 26 and the foot 32 in a woman of the same race the arm is 83 and the leg 120 the hand and foot remaining the same in a european skeleton i find the arm to be 80 the leg 117 the hand 26 the foot 35  thus the leg is not so different as it looks at first sight in its proportion to the spine in the gorilla and in the manbeing very slightly shorter than the spine in the former and between 110 and 15 longer than the spine in the latter the foot is longer and the hand much longer in the gorilla but the great difference is caused by the arms which are very much longer than the spine in the gorilla very much shorter than the spine in the man  the question now arises how are the other apes related to the gorilla in these respectstaking the length of the spine measured in the same way at 100 in an adult chimpanzee the arm is only 96 the leg 90 the hand 43 the foot 39so that the hand and the leg depart more from the human proportion and the arm less while the foot is about the same as in the gorilla  in the orang the arms are very much longer than in the gorilla 122 while the legs are shorter 88 the foot is longer than the hand 52 and 48 and both are much longer in proportion to the spine  in the other manlike apes again the gibbons these proportions are still further altered the length of the arms being to that of the spinal column as 19 to 11 while the legs are also a third longer than the spinal column so as to be longer than in man instead of shorter the hand is half as long as the spinal column and the foot shorter than the hand is about 511ths of the length of the spinal column  thus hylobates is as much longer in the arms than the gorilla as the gorilla is longer in the arms than man while on the other hand it is as much longer in the legs than the man as the man is longer in the legs than the gorilla so that it contains within itself the extremest deviations from the average length of both pairs of limbs see the illustration on page 196  the mandrill presents a middle condition the arms and legs being nearly equal in length and both being shorter than the spinal column while hand and foot have nearly the same proportions to one another and to the spine as in man  in the spider monkey ateles the leg is longer than the spine and the arm than the leg and finally in that remarkable lemurine form the indri lichanotus the leg is about as long as the spinal column while the arm is not more than 1118 of its length the hand having rather less and the foot rather more than onethird the length of the spinal column  these examples might be greatly multiplied but they suffice to show that in whatever proportion of its limbs the gorilla differs from man the other apes depart still more widely from the gorilla and that consequently such differences of proportion can have no ordinal value  we may next consider the differences presented by the trunk consisting of the vertebral column or backbone and the ribs and pelvis or bony hipbasin which are connected with it in man and in the gorilla respectively  in man in consequence partly of the disposition of the articular surfaces of the vertebrae and largely of the elastic tension of some of the fibrous bands or ligaments which connect these vertebrae together the spinal column as a whole has an elegant slike curvature being convex forwards in the neck concave in the back convex in the loins or lumbar region and concave again in the sacral region an arrangement which gives much elasticity to the whole backbone and diminishes the jar communicated to the spine and through it to the head by locomotion in the erect position  furthermore under ordinary circumstances man has seven vertebrae in his neck which are called cervical twelve succeed these bearing ribs and forming the upper part of the back whence they are termed dorsal five lie in the loins bearing no distinct or free ribs and are called lumbar five united together into a great bone excavated in front solidly wedged in between the hip bones to form the back of the pelvis and known by the name of the sacrum succeed these and finally three or four little more or less movable bones so small as to be insignificant constitute the coccyx or rudimentary tail  in the gorilla the vertebral column is similarly divided into cervical dorsal lumbar sacral and coccygeal vertebrae and the total number of cervical and dorsal vertebrae taken together is the same as in man but the development of a pair of ribs to the first lumbar vertebra which is an exceptional occurrence in man is the rule in the gorilla and hence as lumbar are distinguished from dorsal vertebrae only by the presence or absence of free ribs the seventeen dorsolumbar vertebrae of the gorilla are divided into thirteen dorsal and four lumbar while in man they are twelve dorsal and five lumbar  illustration fig 15front and side views of the bony pelvis of man the gorilla and gibbon reduced from drawings made from nature of the same absolute length by mr waterhouse hawkins  not only however does man occasionally possess thirteen pair of ribs but the gorilla sometimes has fourteen pairs while an orangutan skeleton in the museum of the royal college of surgeons has twelve dorsal and five lumbar vertebrae as in man cuvier notes the same number in a hylobates on the other hand among the lower apes many possess twelve dorsal and six or seven lumbar vertebrae the douroucouli has fourteen dorsal and eight lumbar and a lemur stenops tardigradus has fifteen dorsal and nine lumbar vertebrae  the vertebral column of the gorilla as a whole differs from that of man in the less marked character of its curves especially in the slighter convexity of the lumbar region nevertheless the curves are present and are quite obvious in young skeletons of the gorilla and chimpanzee which have been prepared without removal of the ligaments in young orangs similarly preserved on the other hand the spinal column is either straight or even concave forwards throughout the lumbar region  whether we take these characters then or such minor ones as those which are derivable from the proportional length of the spines of the cervical vertebrae and the like there is no doubt whatsoever as to the marked difference between man and the gorilla but there is as little that equally marked differences of the very same order obtain between the gorilla and the lower apes  the pelvis or bony girdle of the hips of man is a strikingly human part of his organization the expanded haunch bones affording support for his viscera during his habitually erect posture and giving space for the attachment of the great muscles which enable him to assume and to preserve that attitude in these respects the pelvis of the gorilla differs very considerably from his fig 15 but go no lower than the gibbon and see how vastly more he differs from the gorilla than the latter does from man even in this structure look at the flat narrow haunch bonesthe long and narrow passagethe coarse outwardly curved ischiatic prominences on which the gibbon habitually rests and which are coated by the socalled callosities dense patches of skin wholly absent in the gorilla in the chimpanzee and in the orang as in man  in the lower monkeys and in the lemurs the difference becomes more striking still the pelvis acquiring an altogether quadrupedal character  but now let us turn to a nobler and more characteristic organthat by which the human frame seems to be and indeed is so strongly distinguished from all othersi mean the skull the differences between a gorillas skull and a mans are truly immense fig 16 in the former the face formed largely by the massive jawbones predominates over the brain case or cranium proper in the latter the proportions of the two are reversed in the man the occipital foramen through which passes the great nervous cord connecting the brain with the nerves of the body is placed just behind the centre of the base of the skull which thus becomes evenly balanced in the erect posture in the gorilla it lies in the posterior third of that base in the man the surface of the skull is comparatively smooth and the supraciliary ridges or brow prominences usually project but littlewhile in the gorilla vast crests are developed upon the skull and the brow ridges overhang the cavernous orbits like great penthouses  sections of the skulls however show that some of the apparent defects of the gorillas cranium arise in fact not so much from deficiency of brain case as from excessive development of the parts of the face the cranial cavity is not illshaped and the forehead is not truly flattened or very retreating its really wellformed curve being simply disguised by the mass of bone which is built up against it fig 16  but the roofs of the orbits rise more obliquely into the cranial cavity thus diminishing the space for the lower part of the anterior lobes of the brain and the absolute capacity of the cranium is far less than that of man so far as i am aware no human cranium belonging to an adult man has yet been observed with a less cubical capacity than 62 cubic inches the smallest cranium observed in any race of men by morton measuring 63 cubic inches while on the other hand the most capacious gorilla skull yet measured has a content of not more than 3412 cubic inches let us assume for simplicitys sake that the lowest mans skull has twice the capacity of that of the highest gorilla 4  no doubt this is a very striking difference but it loses much of its apparent systematic value when viewed by the light of certain other equally indubitable facts respecting cranial capacities  the first of these is that the difference in the volume of the cranial cavity of different races of mankind is far greater absolutely than that between the lowest man and the highest ape while relatively it is about the same for the largest human skull measured by morton contained 114 cubic inches that is to say had very nearly double the capacity of the smallest while its absolute preponderance of 52 cubic inchesis far greater than that by which the lowest adult male human cranium surpasses the largest of the gorillas 62  3412  2712 secondly the adult crania of gorillas which have as yet been measured differ among themselves by nearly onethird the maximum capacity being 345 cubic inches the minimum 24 cubic inches and thirdly after making all due allowance for difference of size the cranial capacities of some of the lower apes fall nearly as much relatively below those of the higher apes as the latter fall below man  thus even in the important matter of cranial capacity men differ more widely from one another than they do from the apes while the lowest apes differ as much in proportion from the highest as the latter does from man the last proposition is still better illustrated by the study of the modifications which other parts of the cranium undergo in the simian series  it is the large proportional size of the facial bones and the great projection of the jaws which confers upon the gorillas skull its small facial angle and brutal character  illustration fig 16sections of the skulls of man and various apes drawn so as to give the cerebral cavity the same length in each case thereby displaying the varying proportions of the facial bones the line b indicates the plane of the tentorium which separates the cerebrum from the cerebellum d the axis of the occipital outlet of the skull the extent of cerebral cavity behind c which is a perpendicular erected on b at the point where the tentorium is attached posteriorly indicates the degree to which the cerebrum overlaps the cerebellumthe space occupied by which is roughly indicated by the dark shading in comparing these diagrams it must be recollected that figures on so small a scale as these simply exemplify the statements in the text the proof of which is to be found in the objects themselves  but if we consider the proportional size of the facial bones to the skull proper only the little chrysothrix fig 16 differs very widely from the gorilla and in the same way as man does while the baboons cynocephalus fig 16 exaggerate the gross proportions of the muzzle of the great anthropoid so that its visage looks mild and human by comparison with theirs the difference between the gorilla and the baboon is even greater than it appears at first sight for the great facial mass of the former is largely due to a downward development of the jaws an essentially human character superadded upon that almost purely forward essentially brutal development of the same parts which characterizes the baboon and yet more remarkably distinguishes the lemur  similarly the occipital foramen of mycetes fig 16 and still more of the lemurs is situated completely in the posterior face of the skull or as much further back than that of the gorilla as that of the gorilla is further back than that of man while as if to render patent the futility of the attempt to base any broad classificatory distinction on such a character the same group of platyrhine or american monkeys to which the mycetes belongs contains the chrysothrix whose occipital foramen is situated far more forward than in any other ape and nearly approaches the position it holds in man  again the orangs skull is as devoid of excessively developed supraciliary prominences as a mans though some varieties exhibit great crests elsewhere see pp 231 232 and in some of the cebine apes and in the chrysothrix the cranium is as smooth and rounded as that of man himself  what is true of these leading characteristics of the skull holds good as may be imagined of all minor features so that for every constant difference between the gorillas skull and the mans a similar constant difference of the same order that is to say consisting in excess or defect of the same quality may be found between the gorillas skull and that of some other ape so that for the skull no less than for the skeleton in general the proposition holds good that the differences between man and the gorilla are of smaller value than those between the gorilla and some other apes  in connection with the skull i may speak of the teethorgans which have a peculiar classificatory value and whose resemblances and differences of number form and succession taken as a whole are usually regarded as more trustworthy indicators of affinity than any others  illustration fig 17lateral views of the same length of the upper jaws of various primates i incisors c canines pm premolars m molars a line is drawn through the first molar of man gorilla cynocephalus and cebus and the grinding surface of the second molar is shown in each its anterior and internal angle being just above the m of m2  man is provided with two sets of teethmilk teeth and permanent teeth the former consist of four incisors or cutting teeth two canines or eyeteeth and four molars or grinders in each jawmaking twenty in all the latter fig 17 comprise four incisors two canines four small grinders called premolars or false molars and six large grinders or true molars in each jawmaking thirtytwo in all the internal incisors are larger than the external pair in the upper jaw smaller than the external pair in the lower jaw the crowns of the upper molars exhibit four cusps or bluntpointed elevations and a ridge crosses the crown obliquely from the inner anterior cusp to the outer posterior cusp fig 17 m2 the anterior lower molars have five cusps three external and two internal the premolars have two cusps one internal and one external of which the outer is the higher  in all these respects the dentition of the gorilla may be described in the same terms as that of man but in other matters it exhibits many and important differences fig 17  thus the teeth of man constitute a regular and even serieswithout any break and without any marked projection of one tooth above the level of the rest a peculiarity which as cuvier long ago showed is shared by no other mammal save oneas different a creature from man as can well be imaginednamely the long extinct anoplotherium the teeth of the gorilla on the contrary exhibit a break or interval termed the diastema in both jaws in front of the eyetooth or between it and the outer incisor in the upper jaw behind the eyetooth or between it and the front false molar in the lower jaw into this break in the series in each jaw fits the canine of the opposite jaw the size of the eyetooth in the gorilla being so great that it projects like a tusk far beyond the general level of the other teeth the roots of the false molar teeth of the gorilla again are more complex than in man and the proportional size of the molars is different the gorilla has the crown of the hindmost grinder of the lower jaw more complex and the order of eruption of the permanent teeth is different the permanent canines making their appearance before the second and third molars in man and after them in the gorilla  thus while the teeth of the gorilla closely resemble those of man in number kind and in the general pattern of their crowns they exhibit marked differences from those of man in secondary respects such as relative size number of fangs and order of appearance  but if the teeth of the gorilla be compared with those of an ape no further removed from it than a cynocephalus or baboon it will be found that differences and resemblances of the same order are easily observable but that many of the points in which the gorilla resembles man are those in which it differs from the baboon while various respects in which it differs from man are exaggerated in the cynocephalus the number and the nature of the teeth remain the same in the baboon as in the gorilla and in man but the pattern of the baboons upper molars is quite different from that described above fig 17 the canines are proportionally longer and more knifelike the anterior premolar in the lower jaw is specially modified the posterior molar of the lower jaw is still larger and more complex than in the gorilla  passing from the oldworld apes to those of the new world we meet with a change of much greater importance than any of these in such a genus as cebus for example fig 17 it will be found that while in some secondary points such as the projection of the canines and the diastema the resemblance to the great ape is preserved in other and most important respects the dentition is extremely different instead of 20 teeth in the milk set there are 24 instead of 32 teeth in the permanent set there are 36 the false molars being increased from eight to twelve and in form the crowns of the molars are very unlike those of the gorilla and differ far more widely from the human pattern  the marmosets on the other hand exhibit the same number of teeth as man and the gorilla but notwithstanding this their dentition is very different for they have four more false molars like the other american monkeysbut as they have four fewer true molars the total remains the same and passing from the american apes to the lemurs the dentition becomes still more completely and essentially different from that of the gorilla the incisors begin to vary both in number and in form the molars acquire more and more a manypointed insectivorous character and in one genus the ayeaye cheiromys the canines disappear and the teeth completely simulate those of a rodent fig 17  hence it is obvious that greatly as the dentition of the highest ape differs from that of man it differs far more widely from that of the lower and lowest apes  whatever part of the animal fabricwhatever series of muscles whatever viscera might be selected for comparisonthe result would be the samethe lower apes and the gorilla would differ more than the gorilla and the man i cannot attempt in this place to follow out all these comparisons in detail and indeed it is unnecessary i should do so but certain real or supposed structural distinctions between man and the apes remain upon which so much stress has been laid that they require careful consideration in order that the true value may be assigned to those which are real and the emptiness of those which are fictitious may be exposed i refer to the characters of the hand the foot and the brain  man has been defined as the only animal possessed of two hands terminating his fore limbs and of two feet ending his hind limbs while it has been said that all the apes possess four hands and he has been affirmed to differ fundamentally from all the apes in the characters of his brain which alone it has been strangely asserted and reasserted exhibits the structures known to anatomists as the posterior lobe the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor  that the former proposition should have gained general acceptance is not surprisingindeed at first sight appearances are much in its favour but as for the second one can only admire the surpassing courage of its enunciator seeing that it is an innovation which is not only opposed to generally and justly accepted doctrines but which is directly negatived by the testimony of all original inquirers who have specially investigated the matter and that it neither has been nor can be supported by a single anatomical preparation it would in fact be unworthy of serious refutation except for the general and natural belief that deliberate and reiterated assertions must have some foundation  before we can discuss the first point with advantage we must consider with some attention and compare together the structure of the human hand and that of the human foot so that we may have distinct and clear ideas of what constitutes a hand and what a foot  the external form of the human hand is familiar enough to every one it consists of a stout wrist followed by a broad palm formed of flesh and tendons and skin binding together four bones and dividing into four long and flexible digits or fingers each of which bears on the back of its last joint a broad and flattened nail the longest cleft between any two digits is rather less than half as long as the hand from the outer side of the base of the palm a stout digit goes off having only two joints instead of three so short that it only reaches to a little beyond the middle of the first joint of the finger next it and further remarkable by its great mobility in consequence of which it can be directed outwards almost at a right angle to the rest this digit is called the pollex or thumb and like the others it bears a flat nail upon the back of its terminal joint in consequence of the proportions and mobility of the thumb it is what is termed opposable in other words its extremity can with the greatest ease be brought into contact with the extremities of any of the fingers a property upon which the possibility of our carrying into effect the conceptions of the mind so largely depends  the external form of the foot differs widely from that of the hand and yet when closely compared the two present some singular resemblances thus the ankle corresponds in a manner with the wrist the sole with the palm the toes with the fingers the great toe with the thumb but the toes or digits of the foot are far shorter in proportion than the digits of the hand and are less moveable the want of mobility being most striking in the great toewhich again is very much larger in proportion to the other toes than the thumb to the fingers in considering this point however it must not be forgotten that the civilized great toe confined and cramped from childhood upwards is seen to a great disadvantage and that in uncivilized and barefooted people it retains a great amount of mobility and even some sort of opposability the chinese boatmen are said to be able to pull an oar the artisans of bengal to weave and the carajas to steal fishhooks by its help though after all it must be recollected that the structure of its joints and the arrangement of its bones necessarily render its prehensile action far less perfect than that of the thumb  but to gain a precise conception of the resemblances and differences of the hand and foot and of the distinctive characters of each we must look below the skin and compare the bony framework and its motor apparatus in each fig 18  illustration fig 18the skeleton of the hand and foot of man reduced from dr carters drawings in grays anatomy the hand is drawn to a larger scale than the foot the line a a in the hand indicates the boundary between the carpus and the metacarpus b b that between the latter and the proximal phalanges c c marks the ends of the distal phalanges the line a a in the foot indicates the boundary between the tarsus and metatarsus b b marks that between the metatarsus and the proximal phalanges and c c bounds the ends of the distal phalanges ca the calcaneum as the astragalus sc the scaphoid bone in the tarsus  the skeleton of the hand exhibits in the region which we term the wrist and which is technically called the carpustwo rows of closely fitted polygonal bones four in each row which are tolerably equal in size the bones of the first row with the bones of the forearm form the wrist joint and are arranged side by side no one greatly exceeding or overlapping the rest  the four bones of the second row of the carpus bear the four long bones which support the palm of the hand the fifth bone of the same character is articulated in a much more free and moveable manner than the others with its carpal bone and forms the base of the thumb these are called metacarpal bones and they carry the phalanges or bones of the digits of which there are two in the thumb and three in each of the fingers  the skeleton of the foot is very like that of the hand in some respects thus there are three phalanges in each of the lesser toes and only two in the great toe which answers to the thumb there is a long bone termed metatarsal answering to the metacarpal for each digit and the tarsus which corresponds with the carpus presents four short polygonal bones in a row which correspond very closely with the four carpal bones of the second row of the hand in other respects the foot differs very widely from the hand thus the great toe is the longest digit but one and its metatarsal is far less moveably articulated with the tarsus than the metacarpal of the thumb with the carpus but a far more important distinction lies in the fact that instead of four more tarsal bones there are only three and that these three are not arranged side by side or in one row one of them the os calcis or heel bone ca lies externally and sends back the large projecting heel another the astragalus as rests on this by one face and by another forms with the bones of the leg the ankle joint while a third face directed forwards is separated from the three inner tarsal bones of the row next the metatarsus by a bone called the scaphoid sc  thus there is a fundamental difference in the structure of the foot and the hand observable when the carpus and the tarsus are contrasted and there are differences of degree noticeable when the proportions and the mobility of the metacarpals and metatarsals with their respective digits are compared together  the same two classes of differences become obvious when the muscles of the hand are compared with those of the foot  three principal sets of muscles called flexors bend the fingers and thumb as in clenching the fist and three setsthe extensorsextend them as in straightening the fingers these muscles are all long muscles that is to say the fleshy part of each lying in and being fixed to the bones of the arm is at the other end continued into tendons or rounded cords which pass into the hand and are ultimately fixed to the bones which are to be moved thus when the fingers are bent the fleshy parts of the flexors of the fingers placed in the arm contract in virtue of their peculiar endowment as muscles and pulling the tendinous cords connected with their ends cause them to pull down the bones of the fingers towards the palm  not only are the principal flexors of the fingers and of the thumb long muscles but they remain quite distinct from one another through their whole length  in the foot there are also three principal flexor muscles of the digits or toes and three principal extensors but one extensor and one flexor are short muscles that is to say their fleshy parts are not situated in the leg which corresponds with the arm but in the back and in the sole of the footregions which correspond with the back and the palm of the hand  again the tendons of the long flexor of the toes and of the long flexor of the great toe when they reach the sole of the foot do not remain distinct from one another as the flexors in the palm of the hand do but they become united and commingled in a very curious mannerwhile their united tendons receive an accessory muscle connected with the heelbone  but perhaps the most absolutely distinctive character about the muscles of the foot is the existence of what is termed the peronaeus longus a long muscle fixed to the outer bone of the leg and sending its tendon to the outer ankle behind and below which it passes and then crosses the foot obliquely to be attached to the base of the great toe no muscle in the hand exactly corresponds with this which is eminently a foot muscle  to resumethe foot of man is distinguished from his hand by the following absolute anatomical differences  1 by the arrangement of the tarsal bones  2 by having a short flexor and a short extensor muscle of the digits  3 by possessing the muscle termed peronaeus longus  and if we desire to ascertain whether the terminal division of a limb in other primates is to be called a foot or a hand it is by the presence or absence of these characters that we must be guided and not by the mere proportions and greater or lesser mobility of the great toe which may vary indefinitely without any fundamental alteration in the structure of the foot  keeping these considerations in mind let us now turn to the limbs of the gorilla the terminal division of the fore limb presents no difficultybone for bone and muscle for muscle are found to be arranged essentially as in man or with such minor differences as are found as varieties in man the gorillas hand is clumsier heavier and has a thumb somewhat shorter in proportion than that of man but no one has ever doubted its being a true hand  illustration fig 19foot of man gorilla and orangutan of the same absolute length to show the differences in proportion of each letters as in fig 18 reduced from original drawings by mr waterhouse hawkins  at first sight the termination of the hind limb of the gorilla looks very handlike and as it is still more so in many of the lower apes it is not wonderful that the appellation quadrumana or fourhanded creatures adopted from the older anatomists 5 by blumenbach and unfortunately rendered current by cuvier should have gained such wide acceptance as a name for the simian group but the most cursory anatomical investigation at once proves that the resemblance of the socalled hind hand to a true hand is only skin deep and that in all essential respects the hind limb of the gorilla is as truly terminated by a foot as that of man the tarsal bones in all important circumstances of number disposition and form resemble those of man fig 19 the metatarsals and digits on the other hand are proportionally longer and more slender while the great toe is not only proportionally shorter and weaker but its metatarsal bone is united by a more moveable joint with the tarsus at the same time the foot is set more obliquely upon the leg than in man  as this passage was published in 1699 m i g st hilaire is clearly in error in ascribing the invention of the term quadrumanous to buffon though himanous may belong to him tyson uses quadrumanus in several places as at p 91 our pygmie is no man nor yet the common ape but a sort of animal between both and though a biped yet of the quadrumanuskind though some men too have been observed to use their feet like hands as i have seen several  as to the muscles there is a short flexor a short extensor and a peronaeus longus while the tendons of the long flexors of the great toe and of the other toes are united together and with an accessory fleshy bundle  the hind limb of the gorilla therefore ends in a true foot with a very moveable great toe it is a prehensile foot indeed but is in no sense a hand it is a foot which differs from that of man not in any fundamental character but in mere proportions in the degree of mobility and in the secondary arrangement of its parts  it must not be supposed however because i speak of these differences as not fundamental that i wish to underrate their value they are important enough in their way the structure of the foot being in strict correlation with that of the rest of the organism in each case nor can it be doubted that the greater division of physiological labour in man so that the function of support is thrown wholly on the leg and foot is an advance in organization of very great moment to him but after all regarded anatomically the resemblances between the foot of man and the foot of the gorilla are far more striking and important than the differences  i have dwelt upon this point at length because it is one regarding which much delusion prevails but i might have passed it over without detriment to my argument which only requires me to show that be the differences between the hand and foot of man and those of the gorilla what they maythe differences between those of the gorilla and those of the lower apes are much greater  it is not necessary to descend lower in the scale than the orang for conclusive evidence on this head  the thumb of the orang differs more from that of the gorilla than the thumb of the gorilla differs from that of man not only by its shortness but by the absence of any special long flexor muscle the carpus of the orang like that of most lower apes contains nine bones while in the gorilla as in man and the chimpanzee there are only eight  the orangs foot fig 19 is still more aberrant its very long toes and short tarsus short great toe short and raised heel great obliquity of articulation in the leg and absence of a long flexor tendon to the great toe separating it far more widely from the foot of the gorilla than the latter is separated from that of man  but in some of the lower apes the hand and foot diverge still more from those of the gorilla than they do in the orang the thumb ceases to be opposable in the american monkeys is reduced to a mere rudiment covered by the skin in the spider monkey and is directed forwards and armed with a curved claw like the other digits in the marmosetsso that in all these cases there can be no doubt but that the hand is more different from that of the gorilla than the gorillas hand is from mans  and as to the foot the great toe of the marmoset is still more insignificant in proportion than that of the orangwhile in the lemurs it is very large and as completely thumblike and opposable as in the gorillabut in these animals the second toe is often irregularly modified and in some species the two principal bones of the tarsus the astragalus and the os calcis are so immensely elongated as to render the foot so far totally unlike that of any other mammal  so with regard to the muscles the short flexor of the toes of the gorilla differs from that of man by the circumstance that one slip of the muscle is attached not to the heel bone but to the tendons of the long flexors the lower apes depart from the gorilla by an exaggeration of the same character two three or more slips becoming fixed to the long flexor tendonsor by a multiplication of the slipsagain the gorilla differs slightly from man in the mode of interlacing of the long flexor tendons and the lower apes differ from the gorilla in exhibiting yet other sometimes very complex arrangements of the same parts and occasionally in the absence of the accessory fleshy bundle  throughout all these modifications it must be recollected that the foot loses no one of its essential characters every monkey and lemur exhibits the characteristic arrangement of tarsal bones possesses a short flexor and short extensor muscle and a peronaeus longus varied as the proportions and appearance of the organ may be the terminal division of the hind limb remains in plan and principle of construction a foot and never in those respects can be confounded with a hand  hardly any part of the bodily frame then could be found better calculated to illustrate the truth that the structural differences between man and the highest ape are of less value than those between the highest and the lower apes than the hand or the foot and yet perhaps there is one organ the study of which enforces the same conclusion in a still more striking mannerand that is the brain  but before entering upon the precise question of the amount of difference between the apes brain and that of man it is necessary that we should clearly understand what constitutes a great and what a small difference in cerebral structure and we shall be best enabled to do this by a brief study of the chief modifications which the brain exhibits in the series of vertebrate animals  the brain of a fish is very small compared with the spinal cord into which it is continued and with the nerves which come off from it of the segments of which it is composedthe olfactory lobes the cerebral hemisphere and the succeeding divisionsno one predominates so much over the rest as to obscure or cover them and the socalled optic lobes are frequently the largest masses of all in reptiles the mass of the brain relatively to the spinal cord increases and the cerebral hemispheres begin to predominate over the other parts while in birds this predominance is still more marked the brain of the lowest mammals such as the duckbilled platypus and the opossums and kangaroos exhibits a still more definite advance in the same direction the cerebral hemispheres have now so much increased in size as more or less to hide the representatives of the optic lobes which remain comparatively small so that the brain of a marsupial is extremely different from that of a bird reptile or fish a step higher in the scale among the placental mammals the structure of the brain acquires a vast modificationnot that it appears much altered externally in a rat or in a rabbit from what it is in a marsupialnor that the proportions of its parts are much changed but an apparently new structure is found between the cerebral hemispheres connecting them together as what is called the great commissure or corpus callosum the subject requires careful reinvestigation but if the currently received statements are correct the appearance of the corpus callosum in the placental mammals is the greatest and most sudden modification exhibited by the brain in the whole series of vertebrated animalsit is the greatest leap anywhere made by nature in her brain work for the two halves of the brain being once thus knit together the progress of cerebral complexity is traceable through a complete series of steps from the lowest rodent or insectivore to man and that complexity consists chiefly in the disproportionate development of the cerebral hemispheres and of the cerebellum but especially of the former in respect to the other parts of the brain  in the lower placental mammals the cerebral hemispheres leave the proper upper and posterior face of the cerebellum completely visible when the brain is viewed from above but in the higher forms the hinder part of each hemisphere separated only by the tentorium p 281 from the anterior face of the cerebellum inclines backwards and downwards and grows out as the socalled posterior lobe so as at length to overlap and hide the cerebellum in all mammals each cerebral hemisphere contains a cavity which is termed the ventricle and as this ventricle is prolonged on the one hand forwards and on the other downwards into the substance of the hemisphere it is said to have two horns or cornua an anterior cornu and a descending cornu when the posterior lobe is well developed a third prolongation of the ventricular cavity extends into it and is called the posterior cornu  in the lower and smaller forms of placental mammals the surface of the cerebral hemispheres is either smooth or evenly rounded or exhibits a very few grooves which are technically termed sulciseparating ridges or convolutions of the substance of the brain and the smaller species of all orders tend to a similar smoothness of brain but in the higher orders and especially the larger members of these orders the grooves or sulci become extremely numerous and the intermediate convolutions proportionately more complicated in their meanderings until in the elephant the porpoise the higher apes and man the cerebral surface appears a perfect labyrinth of tortuous foldings  where a posterior lobe exists and presents its customary cavitythe posterior cornuit commonly happens that a particular sulcus appears upon the inner and under surface of the lobe parallel with and beneath the floor of the cornuwhich is as it were arched over the roof of the sulcus it is as if the groove had been formed by indenting the floor of the posterior horn from without with a blunt instrument so that the floor should rise as a convex eminence now this eminence is what has been termed the hippocampus minor the hippocampus major being a larger eminence in the floor of the descending cornu what may be the functional importance of either of these structures we know not  as if to demonstrate by a striking example the impossibility of erecting any cerebral barrier between man and the apes nature has provided us in the latter animals with an almost complete series of gradations from brains little higher than that of a rodent to brains little lower than that of man and it is a remarkable circumstance that though so far as our present knowledge extends there is one true structural break in the series of forms of simian brains this hiatus does not lie between man and the manlike apes but between the lower and the lowest simians or in other words between the old and new world apes and monkeys and the lemurs every lemur which has yet been examined in fact has its cerebellum partially visible from above and its posterior lobe with the contained posterior cornu and hippocampus minor more or less rudimentary every marmoset american monkey oldworld monkey baboon or manlike ape on the contrary has its cerebellum entirely hidden posteriorly by the cerebral lobes and possesses a large posterior cornu with a welldeveloped hippocampus minor  illustration fig 20drawings of the internal casts of a mans and of a chimpanzees skull of the same absolute length and placed in corresponding positions a cerebrum b cerebellum the former drawing is taken from a cast in the museum of the royal college of surgeons the latter from the photograph of the cast of a chimpanzees skull which illustrates the paper by mr marshall on the brain of the chimpanzee in the natural history review for july 1861 the sharper definition of the lower edge of the cast of the cerebral chamber in the chimpanzee arises from the circumstance that the tentorium remained in that skull and not in the mans the cast more accurately represents the brain in chimpanzee than in the man and the great backward projection of the posterior lobes of the cerebrum of the former beyond the cerebellum is conspicuous  in many of these creatures such as the saimiri chrysothrix the cerebral lobes overlap and extend much further behind the cerebellum in proportion than they do in man fig 16and it is quite certain that in all the cerebellum is completely covered behind by welldeveloped posterior lobes the fact can be verified by every one who possesses the skull of any old or new world monkey for inasmuch as the brain in all mammals completely fills the cranial cavity it is obvious that a cast of the interior of the skull will reproduce the general form of the brain at any rate with such minute and for the present purpose utterly unimportant differences as may result from the absence of the enveloping membranes of the brain in the dry skull but if such a cast be made in plaster and compared with a similar cast of the interior of a human skull it will be obvious that the cast of the cerebral chamber representing the cerebrum of the ape as completely covers over and overlaps the cast of the cerebellar chamber representing the cerebellum as it does in the man fig 20 a careless observer forgetting that a soft structure like the brain loses its proper shape the moment it is taken out of the skull may indeed mistake the uncovered condition of the cerebellum of an extracted and distorted brain for the natural relations of the parts but his error must become patent even to himself if he try to replace the brain within the cranial chamber to suppose that the cerebellum of an ape is naturally uncovered behind is a miscomprehension comparable only to that of one who should imagine that a mans lungs always occupy but a small portion of the thoracic cavitybecause they do so when the chest is opened and their elasticity is no longer neutralized by the pressure of the air  and the error is the less excusable as it must become apparent to every one who examines a section of the skull of any ape above a lemur without taking the trouble to make a cast of it for there is a very marked groove in every such skull as in the human skullwhich indicates the line of attachment of what is termed the tentoriuma sort of parchmentlike shelf or partition which in the recent state is interposed between the cerebrum and cerebellum and prevents the former from pressing upon the latter see fig 16  this groove therefore indicates the line of separation between that part of the cranial cavity which contains the cerebrum and that which contains the cerebellum and as the brain exactly fills the cavity of the skull it is obvious that the relations of these two parts of the cranial cavity at once informs us of the relations of their contents now in man in all the oldworld and in all the newworld simiae with one exception when the face is directed forwards this line of attachment of the tentorium or impression for the lateral sinus as it is technically called is nearly horizontal and the cerebral chamber invariably overlaps or projects behind the cerebellar chamber in the howler monkey or mycetes see fig 16 the line passes obliquely upwards and backwards and the cerebral overlap is almost nil while in the lemurs as in the lower mammals the line is much more inclined in the same direction and the cerebellar chamber projects considerably beyond the cerebral  when the gravest errors respecting points so easily settled as this question respecting the posterior lobes can be authoritatively propounded it is no wonder that matters of observation of no very complex character but still requiring a certain amount of care should have fared worse any one who cannot see the posterior lobe in an apes brain is not likely to give a very valuable opinion respecting the posterior cornu or the hippocampus minor if a man cannot see a church it is preposterous to take his opinion about its altarpiece or painted windowso that i do not feel bound to enter upon any discussion of these points but content myself with assuring the reader that the posterior cornu and the hippocampus minor have now been seenusually at least as well developed as in man and often betternot only in the chimpanzee the orang and the gibbon but in all the genera of the old world baboons and monkeys and in most of the new world forms including the marmosets  illustration fig 21drawings of the cerebral hemispheres of a man and of a chimpanzee of the same length in order to show the relative proportions of the parts the former taken from a specimen which mr flower conservator of the museum of the royal college of surgeons was good enough to dissect for me the latter from the photograph of a similarly dissected chimpanzees brain given in mr marshalls paper above referred to a posterior lobe b lateral ventricle c posterior cornu x the hippocampus minor  in fact all the abundant and trustworthy evidence consisting of the results of careful investigations directed to the determination of these very questions by skilled anatomists which we now possess leads to the conviction that so far from the posterior lobe the posterior cornu and the hippocampus minor being structures peculiar to and characteristic of man as they have been over and over again asserted to be even after the publication of the clearest demonstration of the reverse it is precisely these structures which are the most marked cerebral characters common to man with the apes they are among the most distinctly simian peculiarities which the human organism exhibits  as to the convolutions the brains of the apes exhibit every stage of progress from the almost smooth brain of the marmoset to the orang and the chimpanzee which fall but little below man and it is most remarkable that as soon as all the principal sulci appear the pattern according to which they are arranged is identical with that of the corresponding sulci of man the surface of the brain of a monkey exhibits a sort of skeleton map of mans and in the manlike apes the details become more and more filled in until it is only in minor characters such as the greater excavation of the anterior lobes the constant presence of fissures usually absent in man and the different disposition and proportions of some convolutions that the chimpanzees or the orangs brain can be structurally distinguished from mans  so far as cerebral structure goes therefore it is clear that man differs less from the chimpanzee or the orang than these do even from the monkeys and that the difference between the brains of the chimpanzee and of man is almost insignificant when compared with that between the chimpanzee brain and that of a lemur  it must not be overlooked however that there is a very striking difference in absolute mass and weight between the lowest human brain and that of the highest apea difference which is all the more remarkable when we recollect that a full grown gorilla is probably pretty nearly twice as heavy as a bosjes man or as many an european woman it may be doubted whether a healthy human adult brain ever weighed less than thirtyone or two ounces or that the heaviest gorilla brain has exceeded twenty ounces  this is a very noteworthy circumstance and doubtless will one day help to furnish an explanation of the great gulf which intervenes between the lowest man and the highest ape in intellectual power 6 but it has little systematic value for the simple reason that as may be concluded from what has been already said respecting cranial capacity the difference in weight of brain between the highest and the lowest men is far greater both relatively and absolutely than that between the lowest man and the highest ape the latter as has been seen is represented by say twelve ounces of cerebral substance absolutely or by 3220 relatively but as the largest recorded human brain weighed between 65 and 66 ounces the former difference is represented by more than 33 ounces absolutely or by 6532 relatively regarded systematically the cerebral differences of man and apes are not of more than generic value his family distinction resting chiefly on his dentition his pelvis and his lower limbs  a man born dumb notwithstanding his great cerebral mass and his inheritance of strong intellectual instincts would be capable of few higher intellectual manifestations than an orang or a chimpanzee if he were confined to the society of dumb associates and yet there might not be the slightest discernible difference between his brain and that of a highly intelligent and cultivated person the dumbness might be the result of a defective structure of the mouth or of the tongue or a mere defective innervation of these parts or it might result from congenital deafness caused by some minute defect of the internal ear which only a careful anatomist could discover  the argument that because there is an immense difference between a mans intelligence and an apes therefore there must be an equally immense difference between their brains appears to me to be about as well based as the reasoning by which one should endeavour to prove that because there is a great gulf between a watch that keeps accurate time and another that will not go at all there is therefore a great structural hiatus between the two watches a hair in the balancewheel a little rust on a pinion a bend in a tooth of the escapement a something so slight that only the practised eye of the watchmaker can discover it may be the source of all the difference  and believing as i do with cuvier that the possession of articulate speech is the grand distinctive character of man whether it be absolutely peculiar to him or not i find it very easy to comprehend that some equally inconspicuous structural difference may have been the primary cause of the immeasurable and practically infinite divergence of the human from the simian stirps  thus whatever system of organs be studied the comparison of their modifications in the ape series leads to one and the same resultthat the structural differences which separate man from the gorilla and the chimpanzee are not so great as those which separate the gorilla from the lower apes  but in enunciating this important truth i must guard myself against a form of misunderstanding which is very prevalent i find in fact that those who endeavour to teach what nature so clearly shows us in this matter are liable to have their opinions misrepresented and their phraseology garbled until they seem to say that the structural differences between man and even the highest apes are small and insignificant let me take this opportunity then of distinctly asserting on the contrary that they are great and significant that every bone of a gorilla bears marks by which it might be distinguished from the corresponding bone of a man and that in the present creation at any rate no intermediate link bridges over the gap between homo and troglodytes  it would be no less wrong than absurd to deny the existence of this chasm but it is at least equally wrong and absurd to exaggerate its magnitude and resting on the admitted fact of its existence to refuse to inquire whether it is wide or narrow remember if you will that there is no existing link between man and the gorilla but do not forget that there is a no less sharp line of demarcation a no less complete absence of any transitional form between the gorilla and the orang or the orang and the gibbon i say not less sharp though it is somewhat narrower the structural differences between man and the manlike apes certainly justify our regarding him as constituting a family apart from them though inasmuch as he differs less from them than they do from other families of the same order there can be no justification for placing him in a distinct order  and thus the sagacious foresight of the great lawgiver of systematic zoology linnaeus becomes justified and a century of anatomical research brings us back to his conclusion that man is a member of the same order for which the linnaean term primates ought to be retained as the apes and lemurs this order is now divisible into seven families of about equal systematic value the first the anthropini contains man alone the second the catarhini embraces the oldworld apes the third the platyrhini all newworld apes except the marmosets the fourth the arctopithecini contains the marmosets the fifth the lemurini the lemursfrom which cheiromys should probably be excluded to form a sixth distinct family the cheiromyini while the seventh the galeopithecini contains only the flying lemur galeopithecusa strange form which almost touches on the bats as the cheiromys puts on a rodent clothing and the lemurs simulate insectivora  perhaps no order of mammals presents us with so extraordinary a series of gradations as thisleading us insensibly from the crown and summit of the animal creation down to creatures from which there is but a step as it seems to the lowest smallest and least intelligent of the placental mammalia it is as if nature herself had foreseen the arrogance of man and with roman severity had provided that his intellect by its very triumphs should call into prominence the slaves admonishing the conqueror that he is but dust  these are the chief facts this the immediate conclusion from them to which i adverted in the commencement of this essay the facts i believe cannot be disputed and if so the conclusion appears to me to be inevitable  but if man be separated by no greater structural barrier from the brutes than they are from one anotherthen it seems to follow that if any process of physical causation can be discovered by which the genera and families of ordinary animals have been produced that process of causation is amply sufficient to account for the origin of man in other words if it could be shown that the marmosets for example have arisen by gradual modification of the ordinary platyrhini or that both marmosets and platyrhini are modified ramifications of a primitive stockthen there would be no rational ground for doubting that man might have originated in the one case by the gradual modification of a manlike ape or in the other case as a ramification of the same primitive stock as those apes  at the present moment but one such process of physical causation has any evidence in its favour or in other words there is but one hypothesis regarding the origin of species of animals in general which has any scientific existencethat propounded by mr darwin for lamarck sagacious as many of his views were mingled them with so much that was crude and even absurd as to neutralize the benefit which his originality might have effected had he been a more sober and cautious thinker and though i have heard of the announcement of a formula touching the ordained continuous becoming of organic forms it is obvious that it is the first duty of a hypothesis to be intelligible and that a quaquaversal proposition of this kind which may be read backwards or forwards or sideways with exactly the same amount of signification does not really exist though it may seem to do so  at the present moment therefore the question of the relation of man to the lower animals resolves itself in the end into the larger question of the tenability or untenability of mr darwins views but here we enter upon difficult ground and it behoves us to define our exact position with the greatest care  it cannot be doubted i think that mr darwin has satisfactorily proved that what he terms selection or selective modification must occur and does occur in nature and he has also proved to superfluity that such selection is competent to produce forms as distinct structurally as some genera even are if the animated world presented us with none but structural differences i should have no hesitation in saying that mr darwin had demonstrated the existence of a true physical cause amply competent to account for the origin of living species and of man among the rest  but in addition to their structural distinctions the species of animals and plants or at least a great number of them exhibit physiological characterswhat are known as distinct species structurally being for the most part either altogether incompetent to breed one with another or if they breed the resulting mule or hybrid is unable to perpetuate its race with another hybrid of the same kind  a true physical cause is however admitted to be such only on one conditionthat it shall account for all the phenomena which come within the range of its operation if it is inconsistent with any one phenomenon it must be rejected if it fails to explain any one phenomenon it is so far weak so far to be suspected though it may have a perfect right to claim provisional acceptance  now mr darwins hypothesis is not so far as i am aware inconsistent with any known biological fact on the contrary if admitted the facts of development of comparative anatomy of geographical distribution and of palaeontology become connected together and exhibit a meaning such as they never possessed before and i for one am fully convinced that if not precisely true that hypothesis is as near an approximation to the truth as for example the copernican hypothesis was to the true theory of the planetary motions  but for all this our acceptance of the darwinian hypothesis must be provisional so long as one link in the chain of evidence is wanting and so long as all the animals and plants certainly produced by selective breeding from a common stock are fertile and their progeny are fertile with one another that link will be wanting for so long selective breeding will not be proved to be competent to do all that is required of it to produce natural species  i have put this conclusion as strongly as possible before the reader because the last position in which i wish to find myself is that of an advocate for mr darwins or any other viewsif by an advocate is meant one whose business it is to smooth over real difficulties and to persuade where he cannot convince  in justice to mr darwin however it must be admitted that the conditions of fertility and sterility are very ill understood and that every days advance in knowledge leads us to regard the hiatus in his evidence as of less and less importance when set against the multitude of facts which harmonize with or receive an explanation from his doctrines  i adopt mr darwins hypothesis therefore subject to the production of proof that physiological species may be produced by selective breeding just as a physical philosopher may accept the undulatory theory of light subject to the proof of the existence of the hypothetical ether or as the chemist adopts the atomic theory subject to the proof of the existence of atoms and for exactly the same reasons namely that it has an immense amount of prima facie probability that it is the only means at present within reach of reducing the chaos of observed facts to order and lastly that it is the most powerful instrument of investigation which has been presented to naturalists since the invention of the natural system of classification and the commencement of the systematic study of embryology  but even leaving mr darwins views aside the whole analogy of natural operations furnishes so complete and crushing an argument against the intervention of any but what are termed secondary causes in the production of all the phenomena of the universe that in view of the intimate relations between man and the rest of the living world and between the forces exerted by the latter and all other forces i can see no excuse for doubting that all are coordinated terms of natures great progression from the formless to the formedfrom the inorganic to the organicfrom blind force to conscious intellect and will  science has fulfilled her function when she has ascertained and enunciated truth and were these pages addressed to men of science only i should now close this essay knowing that my colleagues have learned to respect nothing but evidence and to believe that their highest duty lies in submitting to it however it may jar against their inclinations  but desiring as i do to reach the wider circle of the intelligent public it would be unworthy cowardice were i to ignore the repugnance with which the majority of my readers are likely to meet the conclusions to which the most careful and conscientious study i have been able to give to this matter has led me  on all sides i shall hear the crywe are men and women not a mere better sort of apes a little longer in the leg more compact in the foot and bigger in brain than your brutal chimpanzees and gorillas the power of knowledgethe conscience of good and evilthe pitiful tenderness of human affections raise us out of all real fellowship with the brutes however closely they may seem to approximate us  to this i can only reply that the exclamation would be most just and would have my own entire sympathy if it were only relevant but it is not i who seek to base mans dignity upon his great toe or insinuate that we are lost if an ape has a hippocampus minor on the contrary i have done my best to sweep away this vanity i have endeavoured to show that no absolute structural line of demarcation wider than that between the animals which immediately succeed us in the scale can be drawn between the animal world and ourselves and i may add the expression of my belief that the attempt to draw a psychical distinction is equally futile and that even the highest faculties of feeling and of intellect begin to germinate in lower forms of life 7 at the same time no one is more strongly convinced than i am of the vastness of the gulf between civilized man and the brutes or is more certain that whether from them or not he is assuredly not of them no one is less disposed to think lightly of the present dignity or desparingly of the future hopes of the only consciously intelligent denizen of this world  we are indeed told by those who assume authority in these matters that the two sets of opinions are incompatible and that the belief in the unity of origin of man and brutes involves the brutalization and degradation of the former but is this really so could not a sensible child confute by obvious arguments the shallow rhetoricians who would force this conclusion upon us is it indeed true that the poet or the philosopher or the artist whose genius is the glory of his age is degraded from his high estate by the undoubted historical probability not to say certainty that he is the direct descendant of some naked and bestial savage whose intelligence was just sufficient to make him a little more cunning than the fox and by so much more dangerous than the tiger or is he bound to howl and grovel on all fours because of the wholly unquestionable fact that he was once an egg which no ordinary power of discrimination could distinguish from that of a dog or is the philanthropist or the saint to give up his endeavours to lead a noble life because the simplest study of mans nature reveals at its foundations all the selfish passions and fierce appetites of the merest quadruped is motherlove vile because a hen shows it or fidelity base because dogs possess it  the common sense of the mass of mankind will answer these questions without a moments hesitation healthy humanity finding itself hard pressed to escape from real sin and degradation will leave the brooding over speculative pollution to the cynics and the righteous overmuch who disagreeing in everything else unite in blind insensibility to the nobleness of the visible world and in inability to appreciate the grandeur of the place man occupies therein  nay more thoughtful men once escaped from the blinding influences of traditional prejudice will find in the lowly stock whence man has sprung the best evidence of the splendour of his capacities and will discern in his long progress through the past a reasonable ground of faith in his attainment of a nobler future  they will remember that in comparing civilised man with the animal world one is as the alpine traveller who sees the mountains soaring into the sky and can hardly discern where the deep shadowed crags and roseate peaks end and where the clouds of heaven begin surely the awestruck voyager may be excused if at first he refuses to believe the geologist who tells him that these glorious masses are after all the hardened mud of primeval seas or the cooled slag of subterranean furnacesof one substance with the dullest clay but raised by inward forces to that place of proud and seemingly inaccessible glory  but the geologist is right and due reflection on his teachings instead of diminishing our reverence and our wonder adds all the force of intellectual sublimity to the mere aesthetic intuition of the uninstructed beholder  and after passion and prejudice have died away the same result will attend the teachings of the naturalist respecting that great alps and andes of the living worldman our reverence for the nobility of manhood will not be lessened by the knowledge that man is in substance and in structure one with the brutes for he alone possesses the marvellous endowment of intelligible and rational speech whereby in the secular period of his existence he has slowly accumulated and organized the experience which is almost wholly lost with the cessation of every individual life in other animals so that now he stands raised upon it as on a mountain top far above the level of his humble fellows and transfigured from his grosser nature by reflecting here and there a ray from the infinite source of truth  a succinct history of the controversy respecting the cerebral structure of man and the apes  up to the year 1857 all anatomists of authority who had occupied themselves with the cerebral structure of the apescuvier tiedemann sandifort vrolik isidore g st hilaire schroeder van der kolk gratioletwere agreed that the brain of the apes possesses a posterior lobe  tiedemann in 1825 figured and acknowledged in the text of his icones the existence of the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle in the apes not only under the title of scrobiculus parvus loco cornu posteriorisa fact which has been paradedbut as cornu posterius icones p 54 a circumstance which has been as sedulously kept in the background  cuvier lecons t iii p 103 says the anterior or lateral ventricles possess a digital cavity posterior cornu only in man and the apesits presence depends on that of the posterior lobes  schroeder van der kolk and vrolik and gratiolet had also figured and described the posterior cornu in various apes as to the hippocampus minor tiedemann had erroneously asserted its absence in the apes but schroeder van der kolk and vrolik had pointed out the existence of what they considered a rudimentary one in the chimpanzee and gratiolet had expressly affirmed its existence in these animals such was the state of our information on these subjects in the year 1856  in the year 1857 however professor owen either in ignorance of these wellknown facts or else unjustifiably suppressing them submitted to the linnaean society a paper on the characters principles of division and primary groups of the class mammalia which was printed in the societys journal and contains the following passagein man the brain presents an ascensive step in development higher and more strongly marked than that by which the preceding subclass was distinguished from the one below it not only do the cerebral hemispheres overlap and the olfactory lobes and cerebellum but they extend in advance of the one and further back than the other the posterior development is so marked that anatomists have assigned to that part the character of a third lobe it is peculiar to the genus homo and equally peculiar is the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor which characterise the hind lobe of each hemispherejournal of the proceedings of the linnaean society vol ii p 19  as the essay in which this passage stands had no less ambitious an aim than the remodelling of the classification of the mammalia its author might be supposed to have written under a sense of peculiar responsibility and to have tested with especial care the statements he ventured to promulgate and even if this be expecting too much hastiness or want of opportunity for due deliberation cannot now be pleaded in extenuation of any shortcomings for the propositions cited were repeated two years afterwards in the reade lecture delivered before so grave a body as the university of cambridge in 1859  when the assertions which i have italicised in the above extract first came under my notice i was not a little astonished at so flat a contradiction of the doctrines current among wellinformed anatomists but not unnaturally imagining that the deliberate statements of a responsible person must have some foundation in fact i deemed it my duty to investigate the subject anew before the time at which it would be my business to lecture thereupon came round the result of my inquiries was to prove that mr owens three assertions that the third lobe the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus minor are pecular to the genus homo are contrary to the plainest facts i communicated this conclusion to the students of my class and then having no desire to embark in a controversy which could not redound to the honour of british science whatever its issue i turned to more congenial occupations  the time speedily arrived however when a persistence in this reticence would have involved me in an unworthy paltering with truth  at the meeting of the british association at oxford in 1860 professor owen repeated these assertions in my presence and of course i immediately gave them a direct and unqualified contradiction pledging myself to justify that unusual procedure elsewhere i redeemed that pledge by publishing in the january number of the natural history review for 1861 an article wherein the truth of the three following propositions was fully demonstrated l c p 71  1 that the third lobe is neither peculiar to nor characteristic of man seeing that it exists in all the higher quadrumana  2 that the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle is neither peculiar to nor characteristic of man inasmuch as it also exists in the higher quadrumana  3 that the hippocampus minor is neither pecular to nor characteristic of man as it is found in certain of the higher quadrumana  furthermore this paper contains the following paragraph p 76 and lastly schroeder van der kolk and vrolik op cit p 271 though they particularly note that the lateral ventricle is distinguished from that of man by the very defective proportions of the posterior cornu wherein only a stripe is visible as an indication of the hippocampus minor yet the figure 4 in their second plate shows that this posterior cornu is a perfectly distinct and unmistakeable structure quite as large as it often is in man it is the more remarkable that professor owen should have overlooked the explicit statement and figure of these authors as it is quite obvious on comparison of the figures that his woodcut of the brain of a chimpanzee l c p 19 is a reduced copy of the second figure of messrs schroeder van der kolk and vroliks first plate  as m gratiolet l c p 18 however is careful to remark unfortunately the brain which they have taken as a model was greatly altered profondement affaisse whence the general form of the brain is given in these plates in a manner which is altogether incorrect indeed it is perfectly obvious from a comparison of a section of the skull of the chimpanzee with these figures that such is the case and it is greatly to be regretted that so inadequate a figure should have been taken as a typical representation of the chimpanzees brain  from this time forth the untenability of his position might have been as apparent to professor owen as it was to every one else but so far from retracting the grave errors into which he had fallen professor owen has persisted in and reiterated them first in a lecture delivered before the royal institution on the 19th of march 1861 which is admitted to have been accurately reproduced in the athenaeum for the 23rd of the same month in a letter addressed by professor owen to that journal on the 30th of march the athenaeum report was accompanied by a diagram purporting to represent a gorillas brain but in reality so extraordinary a misrepresentation that professor owen substantially though not explicitly withdraws it in the letter in question in amending this error however professor owen fell into another of much graver import as his communication concludes with the following paragraph for the true proportion in which the cerebrum covers the cerebellum in the highest apes reference should be made to the figure of the undissected brain of the chimpanzee in my reades lecture on the classification etc of the mammalia p 25 fig 7 8 vo 1859  it would not be credible if it were not unfortunately true that this figure to which the trusting public is referred without a word of qualification for the true proportion in which the cerebrum covers the cerebellum in the highest apes is exactly that unacknowledged copy of schroeder van der kolk and vroliks figure whose utter inaccuracy had been pointed out years before by gratiolet and had been brought to professor owens knowledge by myself in the passage of my article in the natural history review above quoted  i drew public attention to this circumstance again in my reply to professor owen published in the athenaeum for april 13th 1861 but the exploded figure was reproduced once more by professor owen without the slightest allusion to its inaccuracy in the annals of natural history for june 1861  this proved too much for the patience of the original authors of the figure messrs schroeder van der kolk and vrolik who in a note addressed to the academy of amsterdam of which they were members declared themselves to be though decided opponents of all forms of the doctrine of progressive development above all things lovers of truth and that therefore at whatever risk of seeming to lend support to views which they disliked they felt it their duty to take the first opportunity of publicly repudiating professor owens misuse of their authority  in this note they frankly admitted the justice of the criticisms of m gratiolet quoted above and they illustrated by new and careful figures the posterior lobe the posterior cornu and the hippocampus minor of the orang furthermore having demonstrated the parts at one of the sittings of the academy they add la presence des parties contestees y a ete universellement reconnue par les anatomistes presents a la seance le seul doute qui soit reste se rapporte au pes hippocampi minor a letat frais lindice du petit pied dhippocampe etait plus prononce que maintenant  professor owen repeated his erroneous assertions at the meeting of the british association in 1861 and again without any obvious necessity and without adducing a single new fact or new argument or being able in any way to meet the crushing evidence from original dissections of numerous apes brains which had in the meanwhile been brought forward by prof rolleston 8 frs mr marshall 9 frs mr flower 10 mr turner 11 and myself 12 revived the subject at the cambridge meeting of the same body in 1862 not content with the tolerably vigorous repudiation which these unprecedented proceedings met with in section d professor owen sanctioned the publication of a version of his own statements accompanied by a strange misrepresentation of mine as may be seen by comparison of the times report of the discussion in the medical times for october 11th 1862 i subjoin the conclusion of my reply in the same journal for october 25th  if this were a question of opinion or a question of interpretation of parts or of termswere it even a question of observation in which the testimony of my own senses alone was pitted against that of another person i should adopt a very different tone in discussing this matter i should in all humility admit the likelihood of having myself erred in judgment failed in knowledge or been blinded by prejudice  but no one pretends now that the controversy is one of the terms or of opinions novel and devoid of authority as some of professor owens proposed definitions may have been they might be accepted without changing the great features of the case hence though special investigations into these matters have been undertaken during the last two years by dr allen thomson by dr rolleston by mr marshall and by mr flower all as you are aware anatomists of repute in this country and by professors schroeder van der kolk and vrolik whom professor owen incautiously tried to press into his own service on the continent all these able and conscientious observers have with one accord testified to the accuracy of my statements and to the utter baselessness of the assertions of professor owen even the venerable rudolph wagner whom no man will accuse of progressionist proclivities has raised his voice on the same side while not a single anatomist great or small has supported professor owen  now i do not mean to suggest that scientific differences should be settled by universal suffrage but i do conceive that solid proofs must be met by something more than empty and unsupported assertions yet during the two years through which this preposterous controversy has dragged its weary length professor owen has not ventured to bring forward a single preparation in support of his oftenrepeated assertions  the case stands thus thereforenot only are the statements made by me in consonance with the doctrines of the best older authorities and with those of all recent investigators but i am quite ready to demonstrate them on the first monkey that comes to hand while professor owens assertions are not only in diametrical opposition to both old and new authorities but he has not produced and i will add cannot produce a single preparation which justifies them  i now leave this subject for the presentfor the credit of my calling i should be glad to be hereafter for ever silent upon it but unfortunately this is a matter upon which after all that has occurred no mistake or confusion of terms is possibleand in affirming that the posterior lobe the posterior cornu and the hippocampus minor exist in certain apes i am stating either that which is true or that which i must know to be false the question has thus become one of personal veracity for myself i will accept no other issue than this grave as it is to the present controversy     footnotes  footnote 1 it will be understood that in the preceding essay i have selected for notice from the vast mass of papers which have been written upon the manlike apes only those which seem to me to be of special moment  footnote 2 we are not at present thoroughly acquainted with the brain of the gorilla and therefore in discussing cerebral characters i shall take that of the chimpanzee as my highest term among the apes  footnote 3 more than once says peter camper have i met with more than six lumbar vertebrae in man once i found thirteen ribs and four lumbar vertebrae fallopius noted thirteen pair of ribs and only four lumbar vertebrae and eustachius once found eleven dorsal vertebrae and six lumbar vertebraeoeuvres de pierre camper t 1 p 42 as tyson states his pygmie had thirteen pair of ribs and five lumbar vertebrae the question of the curves of the spinal column in the apes requires further investigation  footnote 4 it has been affirmed that hindoo crania sometimes contain as little as 27 ounces of water which would give a capacity of about 46 cubic inches the minimum capacity which i have assumed above however is based upon the valuable tables published by professor r wagner in his vorstudien zu einer wissenschaftlichen morphologie und physiologie des menschlichen gehirns as the result of the careful weighing of more than 900 human brains professor wagner states that onehalf weighed between 1200 and 1400 grammes and that about twoninths consisting for the most part of male brains exceed 1400 grammes the lightest brain of an adult male with sound mental faculties recorded by wagner weighed 1020 grammes as a gramme equals 154 grains and a cubic inch of water contains 2524 grains this is equivalent to 62 cubic inches of water so that as brain is heavier than water we are perfectly safe against erring on the side of diminution in taking this as the smallest capacity of any adult male human brain the only adult male brain weighing as little as 970 grammes is that of an idiot but the brain of an adult woman against the soundness of whose faculties nothing appears weighed as little as 907 grammes 553 cubic inches of water and reid gives an adult female brain of still smaller capacity the heaviest brain 1872 grammes or about 115 cubic inches was however that of a woman next to it comes the brain of cuvier 1861 grammes then byron 1807 grammes and then an insane person 1783 grammes the lightest adult brain recorded 720 grammes was that of an idiotic female the brains of five children four years old weighed between 1275 and 992 grammes so that it may be safely said that an average european child of four years old has a brain twice as large as that of an adult gorilla  footnote 5 in speaking of the foot of his pygmie tyson remarks p 13 but this part in the formation and in its function too being liker a hand than a foot for the distinguishing this sort of animals from others i have thought whether it might not be reckoned and called rather quadrumanus than quadrupes ie a fourhanded rather than a fourfooted animal  footnote 6 i say help to furnish for i by no means believe that it was any original difference of cerebral quality or quantity which caused that divergence between the human and the pithecoid stirpes which has ended in the present enormous gulf between them it is no doubt perfectly true in a certain sense that all difference of function is a result of difference of structure or in other words of difference in the combination of the primary molecular forces of living substance and starting from this undeniable axiom objectors occasionally and with much seeming plausibility argue that the vast intellectual chasm between the ape and man implies a corresponding structural chasm in the organs of the intellectual functions so that it is said the nondiscovery of such vast differences proves not that they are absent but that science is incompetent to detect them a very little consideration however will i think show the fallacy of this reasoning its validity hangs upon the assumption that intellectual power depends altogether on the brainwhereas the brain is only one condition out of many on which intellectual manifestations depend the others being chiefly the organs of the senses and the motor apparatuses especially those which are concerned in prehension and in the production of articulate speech  footnote 7 it is so rare a pleasure for me to find professor owens opinions in entire accordance with my own that i cannot forbear from quoting a paragraph which appeared in his essay on the characters etc of the class mammalia in the journal of the proceedings of the linnean society of london for 1857 but is unaccountably omitted in the reade lecture delivered before the university of cambridge two years later which is otherwise nearly a reprint of the paper in question prof owen writes not being able to appreciate or conceive of the distinction between the psychical phenomena of a chimpanzee and of a boschisman or of an aztec with arrested brain growth as being of a nature so essential as to preclude a comparison between them or as being other than a difference of degree i cannot shut my eyes to the significance of that allpervading similitude of structureevery tooth every bone strictly homologouswhich makes the determination of the difference between homo and pithecus the anatomists difficulty surely it is a little singular that the anatomist who finds it difficult to determine the difference between homo and pithecus should yet range them on anatomical grounds in distinct subclasses  footnotes 8 on the affinities of the brain of the orang nat hist review april
