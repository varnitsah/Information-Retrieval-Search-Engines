95355777	doctor marigold   i am a cheap jack and my own fathers name was willum marigold  it was in his lifetime supposed by some that his name was william but my own father always consistently said no it was willum  on which point i content myself with looking at the argument this way if a man is not allowed to know his own name in a free country how much is he allowed to know in a land of slavery  as to looking at the argument through the medium of the register willum marigold come into the world before registers come up muchand went out of it too  they wouldnt have been greatly in his line neither if they had chanced to come up before him  i was born on the queens highway but it was the kings at that time  a doctor was fetched to my own mother by my own father when it took place on a common and in consequence of his being a very kind gentleman and accepting no fee but a teatray i was named doctor out of gratitude and compliment to him  there you have me  doctor marigold  i am at present a middleaged man of a broadish build in cords leggings and a sleeved waistcoat the strings of which is always gone behind  repair them how you will they go like fiddlestrings  you have been to the theatre and you have seen one of the wiolinplayers screw up his wiolin after listening to it as if it had been whispering the secret to him that it feared it was out of order and then you have heard it snap  thats as exactly similar to my waistcoat as a waistcoat and a wiolin can be like one another  i am partial to a white hat and i like a shawl round my neck wore loose and easy  sitting down is my favourite posture  if i have a taste in point of personal jewelry it is motherofpearl buttons  there you have me again as large as life  the doctor having accepted a teatray youll guess that my father was a cheap jack before me  you are right  he was  it was a pretty tray  it represented a large lady going along a serpentining uphill gravelwalk to attend a little church  two swans had likewise come astray with the same intentions  when i call her a large lady i dont mean in point of breadth for there she fell below my views but she more than made it up in heighth her heighth and slimness wasin short the heighth of both  i often saw that tray after i was the innocently smiling cause or more likely screeching one of the doctors standing it up on a table against the wall in his consultingroom  whenever my own father and mother were in that part of the country i used to put my head i have heard my own mother say it was flaxen curls at that time though you wouldnt know an old hearthbroom from it now till you come to the handle and found it wasnt me in at the doctors door and the doctor was always glad to see me and said aha my brother practitioner  come in little md  how are your inclinations as to sixpence  you cant go on for ever youll find nor yet could my father nor yet my mother  if you dont go off as a whole when you are about due youre liable to go off in part and two to one your heads the part  gradually my father went off his and my mother went off hers  it was in a harmless way but it put out the family where i boarded them  the old couple though retired got to be wholly and solely devoted to the cheap jack business and were always selling the family off  whenever the cloth was laid for dinner my father began rattling the plates and dishes as we do in our line when we put up crockery for a bid only he had lost the trick of it and mostly let em drop and broke em  as the old lady had been used to sit in the cart and hand the articles out one by one to the old gentleman on the footboard to sell just in the same way she handed him every item of the familys property and they disposed of it in their own imaginations from morning to night  at last the old gentleman lying bedridden in the same room with the old lady cries out in the old patter fluent after having been silent for two days and nights now here my jolly companions every onewhich the nightingale club in a village was held at the sign of the cabbage and shears where the singers no doubt would have greatly excelled but for want of taste voices and earsnow here my jolly companions every one is a working model of a usedup old cheap jack without a tooth in his head and with a pain in every bone so like life that it would be just as good if it wasnt better just as bad if it wasnt worse and just as new if it wasnt worn out  bid for the working model of the old cheap jack who has drunk more gunpowdertea with the ladies in his time than would blow the lid off a washerwomans copper and carry it as many thousands of miles higher than the moon as naught nix naught divided by the national debt carry nothing to the poorrates three under and two over  now my hearts of oak and men of straw what do you say for the lot  two shillings a shilling tenpence eightpence sixpence fourpence twopence  who said twopence  the gentleman in the scarecrows hat  i am ashamed of the gentleman in the scarecrows hat  i really am ashamed of him for his want of public spirit  now ill tell you what ill do with you  come  ill throw you in a working model of a old woman that was married to the old cheap jack so long ago that upon my word and honour it took place in noahs ark before the unicorn could get in to forbid the banns by blowing a tune upon his horn  there now  come  what do you say for both  ill tell you what ill do with you  i dont bear you malice for being so backward  here  if you make me a bid thatll only reflect a little credit on your town ill throw you in a warming pan for nothing and lend you a toastingfork for life  now come what do you say after that splendid offer  say two pound say thirty shillings say a pound say ten shillings say five say two and six  you dont say even two and six  you say two and three  no  you shant have the lot for two and three  id sooner give it to you if you was good looking enough  here  missis  chuck the old man and woman into the cart put the horse to and drive em away and bury em  such were the last words of willum marigold my own father and they were carried out by him and by his wife my own mother on one and the same day as i ought to know having followed as mourner  my father had been a lovely one in his time at the cheap jack work as his dying observations went to prove  but i top him  i dont say it because its myself but because it has been universally acknowledged by all that has had the means of comparison  i have worked at it  i have measured myself against other public speakersmembers of parliament platforms pulpits counsel learned in the lawand where i have found em good i have took a bit of imagination from em and where i have found em bad i have let em alone  now ill tell you what  i mean to go down into my grave declaring that of all the callings ill used in great britain the cheap jack calling is the worst used  why aint we a profession  why aint we endowed with privileges  why are we forced to take out a hawkers license when no such thing is expected of the political hawkers  wheres the difference betwixt us  except that we are cheap jacks and they are dear jacks i dont see any difference but whats in our favour  for look here  say its election time  i am on the footboard of my cart in the marketplace on a saturday night  i put up a general

hundred and fifty pound  there  take the lot on your own terms and ill count out two thousand seven hundred and fifty pound on the footboard of the cart to be dropped in the streets of your magnificent town for them to pick up that can  what do you say  come now  you wont do better and you may do worse  you take it  hooray  sold again and got the seat  these dear jacks soap the people shameful but we cheap jacks dont  we tell em the truth about themselves to their faces and scorn to court em  as to wenturesomeness in the way of puffing up the lots the dear jacks beat us hollow  it is considered in the cheap jack calling that better patter can be made out of a gun than any article we put up from the cart except a pair of spectacles  i often hold forth about a gun for a quarter of an hour and feel as if i need never leave off  but when i tell em what the gun can do and what the gun has brought down i never go half so far as the dear jacks do when they make speeches in praise of their gunstheir great guns that set em on to do it besides im in business for myself i aint sent down into the market place to order as they are  besides again my guns dont know what i say in their laudation and their guns do and the whole concern of em have reason to be sick and ashamed all round  these are some of my arguments for declaring that the cheap jack calling is treated ill in great britain and for turning warm when i think of the other jacks in question setting themselves up to pretend to look down upon it  i courted my wife from the footboard of the cart  i did indeed  she was a suffolk young woman and it was in ipswich marketplace right opposite the cornchandlers shop  i had noticed her up at a window last saturday that was appreciating highly  i had took to her and i had said to myself if not already disposed of ill have that lot  next saturday that come i pitched the cart on the same pitch and i was in very high feather indeed keeping em laughing the whole of the time and getting off the goods briskly  at last i took out of my waistcoatpocket a small lot wrapped in soft paper and i put it this way looking up at the window where she was  now here my blooming english maidens is an article the last article of the present evenings sale which i offer to only you the lovely suffolk dumplings biling over with beauty and i wont take a bid of a thousand pounds for from any man alive  now what is it  why ill tell you what it is  its made of fine gold and its not broke though theres a hole in the middle of it and its stronger than any fetter that ever was forged though its smaller than any finger in my set of ten  why ten  because when my parents made over my property to me i tell you true there was twelve sheets twelve towels twelve tablecloths twelve knives twelve forks twelve tablespoons and twelve teaspoons but my set of fingers was two short of a dozen and could never since be matched  now what else is it  come ill tell you its a hoop of solid gold wrapped in a silver curlpaper that i myself took off the shining locks of the ever beautiful old lady in threadneedle street london city i wouldnt tell you so if i hadnt the paper to show or you mightnt believe it even of me  now what else is it  its a mantrap and a handcuff the parish stocks and a leglock all in gold and all in one  now what else is it  its a weddingring  now ill tell you what im a going to do with it  im not a going to offer this lot for money but i mean to give it to the next of you beauties that laughs and ill pay her a visit tomorrow morning at exactly half after nine oclock as the chimes go and ill take her out for a walk to put up the banns  she laughed and got the ring handed up to her  when i called in the morning she says o dear  its never you and you never mean it  its ever me says i and i am ever yours and i ever mean it  so we got married after being put up three timeswhich by the bye is quite in the cheap jack way again and shows once more how the cheap jack customs pervade society  she wasnt a bad wife but she had a temper  if she could have parted with that one article at a sacrifice i wouldnt have swopped her away in exchange for any other woman in england  not that i ever did swop her away for we lived together till she died and that was thirteen year now my lords and ladies and gentlefolks all ill let you into a secret though you wont believe it  thirteen year of temper in a palace would try the worst of you but thirteen year of temper in a cart would try the best of you  you are kept so very close to it in a cart you see theres thousands of couples among you getting on like sweet ile upon a whetstone in houses five and six pairs of stairs high that would go to the divorce court in a cart  whether the jolting makes it worse i dont undertake to decide but in a cart it does come home to you and stick to you  wiolence in a cart is so wiolent and aggrawation in a cart is so aggrawating  we might have had such a pleasant life  a roomy cart with the large goods hung outside and the bed slung underneath it when on the road an iron pot and a kettle a fireplace for the cold weather a chimney for the smoke a hangingshelf and a cupboard a dog and a horse  what more do you want  you draw off upon a bit of turf in a green lane or by the roadside you hobble your old horse and turn him grazing you light your fire upon the ashes of the last visitors you cook your stew and you wouldnt call the emperor of france your father  but have a temper in the cart flinging language and the hardest goods in stock at you and where are you then  put a name to your feelings  my dog knew as well when she was on the turn as i did  before she broke out he would give a howl and bolt  how he knew it was a mystery to me but the sure and certain knowledge of it would wake him up out of his soundest sleep and he would give a howl and bolt  at such times i wished i was him  the worst of it was we had a daughter born to us and i love children with all my heart  when she was in her furies she beat the child  this got to be so shocking as the child got to be four or five year old that i have many a time gone on with my whip over my shoulder at the old horses head sobbing and crying worse than ever little sophy did  for how could i prevent it  such a thing is not to be tried with such a temperin a cartwithout coming to a fight  its in the natural size and formation of a cart to bring it to a fight  and then the poor child got worse terrified than before as well as worse hurt generally and her mother made complaints to the next people we lighted on and the word went round heres a wretch of a cheap jack been a beating his wife  little sophy was such a brave child  she grew to be quite devoted to her poor father though he could do so little to help her  she had a wonderful quantity of shining dark hair all curling natural about her it is quite astonishing to me now that i didnt go tearing mad when i used to see her run from her mother before the cart and her mother catch her by this hair and pull her down by it and beat her  such a brave child i said she was  ah with reason  dont you mind next time father dear she would whisper to me with her little face still flushed and her bright eyes still wet if i dont cry out you may know i am not much hurt  and even if i do cry out it will only be to get mother to let go and leave off  what i have seen the little spirit bearfor mewithout crying out  yet in other respects her mother took great care of her  her clothes were always clean and neat and her mother was never tired of working at em  such is the inconsistency in things  our being down in the marsh country in unhealthy weather i consider the cause of sophys taking bad low fever but however she took it once she got it she turned away from her mother for evermore and nothing would persuade her to be touched by her mothers hand  she would shiver and say no no no when it was offered at and would hide her face on my shoulder and hold me tighter round the neck  the cheap jack business had been worse than ever i had known it what with one thing and what with another and not least with railroads which will cut it all to pieces i expect at last and i was run dry of money  for which reason one night at that period of little sophys being so bad either we must have come to a deadlock for victuals and drink or i must have pitched the cart as i did  i couldnt get the dear child to lie down or leave go of me and indeed i hadnt the heart to try so i stepped out on the footboard with her holding round my neck  they all set up a laugh when they see us and one chuckleheaded joskin that i hated for it made the bidding tuppence for her  now you country boobies says i feeling as if my heart was a heavy weight at the end of a broken sashline i give you notice that i am a going to charm the money out of your pockets and to give you so much more than your moneys worth that youll only persuade yourselves to draw your saturday nights wages ever again arterwards by the hopes of meeting me to lay em out with which you never will and why not  because ive made my fortunes by selling my goods on a large scale for seventyfive per cent less than i give for em and i am consequently to be elevated to the house of peers next week by the title of the duke of cheap and markis jackaloorul  now lets know what you want tonight and you shall have it  but first of all shall i tell you why i have got this little girl round my neck  you dont want to know  then you shall  she belongs to the fairies  shes a fortuneteller  she can tell me all about you in a whisper and can put me up to whether youre going to buy a lot or leave it  now do you want a saw  no she says you dont because youre too clumsy to use one  else heres a saw which would be a lifelong blessing to a handy man at four shillings at three and six at three at two and six at two at eighteenpence  but none of you shall have it at any price on account of your wellknown awkwardness which would make it manslaughter  the same objection applies to this set of three planes which i wont let you have neither so dont bid for em now i am a going to ask her what you do want  then i whispered your head burns so that i am afraid it hurts you bad my pet and she answered without opening her heavy eyes just a little father  o this little fortuneteller says its a memorandumbook you want  then why didnt you mention it  here it is  look at it  two hundred superfine hotpressed wirewove pagesif you dont believe me count emready ruled for your expenses an everlastingly pointed pencil to put em down with a doublebladed penknife to scratch em out with a book of printed tables to calculate your income with and a campstool to sit down upon while you give your mind to it  stop  and an umbrella to keep the moon off when you give your mind to it on a pitchdark night now i wont ask you how much for the lot but how little  how little are you thinking of  dont be ashamed to mention it because my fortuneteller knows already  then making believe to whisper i kissed herand she kissed me  why she says you are thinking of as little as three and threepence  i couldnt have believed it even of you unless she told me  three and threepence  and a set of printed tables in the lot thatll calculate your income up to forty thousand a year with an income of forty thousand a year you grudge three and sixpence well then ill tell you my opinion  i so despise the threepence that id sooner take three shillings  there  for three shillings three shillings three shillings  gone  hand em over to the lucky man  as there had been no bid at all everybody looked about and grinned at everybody while i touched little sophys face and asked her if she felt faint or giddy  not very father  it will soon be over  then turning from the pretty patient eyes which were opened now and seeing nothing but grins across my lighted greasepot i went on again in my cheap jack style  wheres the butcher  my sorrowful eye had just caught sight of a fat young butcher on the outside of the crowd  she says the good luck is the butchers  where is he  everybody handed on the blushing butcher to the front and there was a roar and the butcher felt himself obliged to put his hand in his pocket and take the lot  the party so picked out in general does feel obliged to take the lotgood four times out of six  then we had another lot the counterpart of that one and sold it sixpence cheaper which is always wery much enjoyed then we had the spectacles  it aint a special profitable lot but i put em on and i see what the chancellor of the exchequer is going to take off the taxes and i see what the sweetheart of the young woman in the shawl is doing at home and i see what the bishops has got for dinner and a deal more that seldom fails to fetch em up in their spirits and the better their spirits the better their bids  then we had the ladies lotthe teapot teacaddy glass sugarbasin halfadozen spoons and caudlecupand all the time i was making similar excuses to give a look or two and say a word or two to my poor child  it was while the second ladies lot was holding em enchained that i felt her lift herself a little on my shoulder to look across the dark street  what troubles you darling  nothing troubles me father  i am not at all troubled but dont i see a pretty churchyard over there  yes my dear  kiss me twice dear father and lay me down to rest upon that churchyard grass so soft and green  i staggered back into the cart with her head dropped on my shoulder and i says to her mother quick  shut the door  dont let those laughing people see  whats the matter she cries  o woman woman i tells her youll never catch my little sophy by her hair again for she has flown away from you  maybe those were harder words than i meant em but from that time forth my wife took to brooding and would sit in the cart or walk beside it hours at a stretch with her arms crossed and her eyes looking on the ground  when her furies took her which was rather seldomer than before they took her in a new way and she banged herself about to that extent that i was forced to hold her  she got none the better for a little drink now and then and through some years i used to wonder as i plodded along at the old horses head whether there was many carts upon the road that held so much dreariness as mine for all my being looked up to as the king of the cheap jacks  so sad our lives went on till one summer evening when as we were coming into exeter out of the farther west of england we saw a woman beating a child in a cruel manner who screamed dont beat me  o mother mother mother  then my wife stopped her ears and ran away like a wild thing and next day she was found in the river  me and my dog were all the company left in the cart now and the dog learned to give a short bark when they wouldnt bid and to give another and a nod of his head when i asked him who said half a crown  are you the gentleman sir that offered half a crown  he attained to an immense height of popularity and i shall always believe taught himself entirely out of his own head to growl at any person in the crowd that bid as low as sixpence  but he got to be well on in years and one night when i was conwulsing york with the spectacles he took a conwulsion on his own account upon the very footboard by me and it finished him  being naturally of a tender turn i had dreadful lonely feelings on me arter this  i conquered em at selling times having a reputation to keep not to mention keeping myself but they got me down in private and rolled upon me  thats often the way with us public characters  see us on the footboard and youd give pretty well anything you possess to be us  see us off the footboard and youd add a trifle to be off your bargain  it was under those circumstances that i come acquainted with a giant  i might have been too high to fall into conversation with him had it not been for my lonely feelings  for the general rule is going round the country to draw the line at dressing up  when a man cant trust his getting a living to his undisguised abilities you consider him below your sort  and this giant when on view figured as a roman  he was a languid young man which i attribute to the distance betwixt his extremities  he had a little head and less in it he had weak eyes and weak knees and altogether you couldnt look at him without feeling that there was greatly too much of him both for his joints and his mind  but he was an amiable though timid young man his mother let him out and spent the money and we come acquainted when he was walking to ease the horse betwixt two fairs  he was called rinaldo di velasco his name being pickleson  this giant otherwise pickleson mentioned to me under the seal of confidence that beyond his being a burden to himself his life was made a burden to him by the cruelty of his master towards a stepdaughter who was deaf and dumb  her mother was dead and she had no living soul to take her part and was used most hard  she travelled with his masters caravan only because there was nowhere to leave her and this giant otherwise pickleson did go so far as to believe that his master often tried to lose her  he was such a very languid young man that i dont know how long it didnt take him to get this story out but it passed through his defective circulation to his top extremity in course of time  when i heard this account from the giant otherwise pickleson and likewise that the poor girl had beautiful long dark hair and was often pulled down by it and beaten i couldnt see the giant through what stood in my eyes  having wiped em i give him sixpence for he was kept as short as he was long and he laid it out in two threepennorths of gin andwater which so brisked him up that he sang the favourite comic of shivery shakey aint it colda popular effect which his master had tried every other means to get out of him as a roman wholly in vain  his masters name was mim a wery hoarse man and i knew him to speak to i went to that fair as a mere civilian leaving the cart outside the town and i looked about the back of the vans while the performing was going on and at last sitting dozing against a muddy cartwheel i come upon the poor girl who was deaf and dumb  at the first look i might almost have judged that she had escaped from the wild beast show but at the second i thought better of her and thought that if she was more cared for and more kindly used she would be like my child  she was just the same age that my own daughter would have been if her pretty head had not fell down upon my shoulder that unfortunate night  to cut it short i spoke confidential to mim while he was beating the gong outside betwixt two lots of picklesons publics and i put it to him she lies heavy on your own hands whatll you take for her  mim was a most ferocious swearer  suppressing that part of his reply which was much the longest part his reply was a pair of braces  now ill tell you says i what im a going to do with you  im a going to fetch you halfadozen pair of the primest braces in the cart and then to take her away with me  says mim again ferocious ill believe it when ive got the goods and no sooner  i made all the haste i could lest he should think twice of it and the bargain was completed which pickleson he was thereby so relieved in his mind that he come out at his little back door longways like a serpent and give us shivery shakey in a whisper among the wheels at parting  it was happy days for both of us when sophy and me began to travel in the cart  i at once give her the name of sophy to put her ever towards me in the attitude of my own daughter  we soon made out to begin to understand one another through the goodness of the heavens when she knowed that i meant true and kind by her  in a very little time she was wonderful fond of me  you have no idea what it is to have anybody wonderful fond of you unless you have been got down and rolled upon by the lonely feelings that i have mentioned as having once got the better of me  youd have laughedor the rewerseits according to your dispositionif you could have seen me trying to teach sophy  at first i was helpedyoud never guess by whatmilestones  i got some large alphabets in a box all the letters separate on bits of bone and saying we was going to windsor i give her those letters in that order and then at every milestone i showed her those same letters in that same order again and pointed towards the abode of royalty  another time i give her cart and then chalked the same upon the cart  another time i give her doctor marigold and hung a corresponding inscription outside my waistcoat  people that met us might stare a bit and laugh but what did i care if she caught the idea  she caught it after long patience and trouble and then we did begin to get on swimmingly i believe you  at first she was a little given to consider me the cart and the cart the abode of royalty but that soon wore off  we had our signs too and they was hundreds in number  sometimes she would sit looking at me and considering hard how to communicate with me about something freshhow to ask me what she wanted explainedand then she was or i thought she was what does it signify so like my child with those years added to her that i halfbelieved it was herself trying to tell me where she had been to up in the skies and what she had seen since that unhappy night when she flied away  she had a pretty face and now that there was no one to drag at her bright dark hair and it was all in order there was a something touching in her looks that made the cart most peaceful and most quiet though not at all melancholy nb  in the cheap jack patter we generally sound it lemonjolly and it gets a laugh  the way she learnt to understand any look of mine was truly surprising when i sold of a night she would sit in the cart unseen by them outside and would give a eager look into my eyes when i looked in and would hand me straight the precise article or articles i wanted  and then she would clap her hands and laugh for joy  and as for me seeing her so bright and remembering what she was when i first lighted on her starved and beaten and ragged leaning asleep against the muddy cartwheel it give me such heart that i gained a greater heighth of reputation than ever and i put pickleson down by the name of mims travelling giant otherwise pickleson for a fypunnote in my will  this happiness went on in the cart till she was sixteen year old  by which time i began to feel not satisfied that i had done my whole duty by her and to consider that she ought to have better teaching than i could give her  it drew a many tears on both sides when i commenced explaining my views to her but whats right is right and you cant neither by tears nor laughter do away with its character  so i took her hand in mine and i went with her one day to the deaf and dumb establishment in london and when the gentleman come to speak to us i says to him now ill tell you what ill do with you sir  i am nothing but a cheap jack but of late years i have laid by for a rainy day notwithstanding  this is my only daughter adopted and you cant produce a deafer nor a dumber  teach her the most that can be taught her in the shortest separation that can be namedstate the figure for itand i am game to put the money down  i wont bate you a single farthing sir but ill put down the money here and now and ill thankfully throw you in a pound to take it  there  the gentleman smiled and then well well says he i must first know what she has learned already  how do you communicate with her  then i showed him and she wrote in printed writing many names of things and so forth and we held some sprightly conversation sophy and me about a little story in a book which the gentleman showed her and which she was able to read this is most extraordinary says the gentleman is it possible that you have been her only teacher  i have been her only teacher sir i says besides herself  then says the gentleman and more acceptable words was never spoke to me youre a clever fellow and a good fellow this he makes known to sophy who kisses his hands claps her own and laughs and cries upon it  we saw the gentleman four times in all and when he took down my name and asked how in the world it ever chanced to be doctor it come out that he was own nephew by the sisters side if youll believe me to the very doctor that i was called after  this made our footing still easier and he says to me  now marigold tell me what more do you want your adopted daughter to know  i want her sir to be cut off from the world as little as can be considering her deprivations and therefore to be able to read whatever is wrote with perfect ease and pleasure  my good fellow urges the gentleman opening his eyes wide why i cant do that myself  i took his joke and gave him a laugh knowing by experience how flat you fall without it and i mended my words accordingly  what do you mean to do with her afterwards asks the gentleman with a sort of a doubtful eye  to take her about the country  in the cart sir but only in the cart  she will live a private life you understand in the cart  i should never think of bringing her infirmities before the public  i wouldnt make a show of her for any money  the gentleman nodded and seemed to approve  well says he can you part with her for two years  to do her that goodyes sir  theres another question says the gentleman looking towards hercan she part with you for two years  i dont know that it was a harder matter of itself for the other was hard enough to me but it was harder to get over  however she was pacified to it at last and the separation betwixt us was settled  how it cut up both of us when it took place and when i left her at the door in the dark of an evening i dont tell  but i know this remembering that night i shall never pass that same establishment without a heartache and a swelling in the throat and i couldnt put you up the best of lots in sight of it with my usual spiritno not even the gun nor the pair of spectaclesfor five hundred pound reward from the secretary of state for the home department and throw in the honour of putting my legs under his mahogany arterwards  still the loneliness that followed in the cart was not the old loneliness because there was a term put to it however long to look forward to and because i could think when i was anyways down that she belonged to me and i belonged to her  always planning for her coming back i bought in a few months time another cart and what do you think i planned to do with it  ill tell you  i planned to fit it up with shelves and books for her reading and to have a seat in it where i could sit and see her read and think that i had been her first teacher  not hurrying over the job i had the fittings knocked together in contriving ways under my own inspection and here was her bed in a berth with curtains and there was her readingtable and here was her writingdesk and elsewhere was her books in rows upon rows picters and no picters bindings and no bindings giltedged and plain just as i could pick em up for her in lots up and down the country north and south and west and east winds liked best and winds liked least here and there and gone astray over the hills and far away  and when i had got together pretty well as many books as the cart would neatly hold a new scheme come into my head which as it turned out kept my time and attention a good deal employed and helped me over the two years stile  without being of an awaricious temper i like to be the owner of things i shouldnt wish for instance to go partners with yourself in the cheap jack cart  its not that i mistrust you but that id rather know it was mine  similarly very likely youd rather know it was yours  well  a kind of a jealousy began to creep into my mind when i reflected that all those books would have been read by other people long before they was read by her  it seemed to take away from her being the owner of em like  in this way the question got into my head couldnt i have a book newmade express for her which she should be the first to read  it pleased me that thought did and as i never was a man to let a thought sleep you must wake up all the whole family of thoughts youve got and burn their nightcaps or you wont do in the cheap jack line i set to work at it  considering that i was in the habit of changing so much about the country and that i should have to find out a literary character here to make a deal with and another literary character there to make a deal with as opportunities presented i hit on the plan that this same book should be a general miscellaneous lotlike the razors flatiron chronometer watch dinner plates rollingpin and looking glassand shouldnt be offered as a single indiwidual article like the spectacles or the gun  when i had come to that conclusion i come to another which shall likewise be yours  often had i regretted that she never had heard me on the footboard and that she never could hear me  it aint that i am vain but that you dont like to put your own light under a bushel  whats the worth of your reputation if you cant convey the reason for it to the person you most wish to value it  now ill put it to you  is it worth sixpence fippence fourpence threepence twopence a penny a halfpenny a farthing  no it aint  not worth a farthing  very well then  my conclusion was that i would begin her book with some account of myself so that through reading a specimen or two of me on the footboard she might form an idea of my merits there  i was aware that i couldnt do myself justice  a man cant write his eye at least i dont know how to nor yet can a man write his voice nor the rate of his talk nor the quickness of his action nor his general spicy way  but he can write his turns of speech when he is a public speakerand indeed i have heard that he very often does before he speaks em  well  having formed that resolution then come the question of a name how did i hammer that hot iron into shape  this way  the most difficult explanation i had ever had with her was how i come to be called doctor and yet was no doctor  after all i felt that i had failed of getting it correctly into her mind with my utmost pains  but trusting to her improvement in the two years i thought that i might trust to her understanding it when she should come to read it as put down by my own hand  then i thought i would try a joke with her and watch how it took by which of itself i might fully judge of her understanding it  we had first discovered the mistake we had dropped into through her having asked me to prescribe for her when she had supposed me to be a doctor in a medical point of view so thinks i now if i give this book the name of my prescriptions and if she catches the idea that my only prescriptions are for her amusement and interestto make her laugh in a pleasant way or to make her cry in a pleasant wayit will be a delightful proof to both of us that we have got over our difficulty  it fell out to absolute perfection  for when she saw the book as i had it got upthe printed and pressed booklying on her desk in her cart and saw the title doctor marigolds prescriptions she looked at me for a moment with astonishment then fluttered the leaves then broke out a laughing in the charmingest way then felt her pulse and shook her head then turned the pages pretending to read them most attentive then kissed the book to me and put it to her bosom with both her hands  i never was better pleased in all my life  but let me not anticipate  i take that expression out of a lot of romances i bought for her  i never opened a single one of emand i have opened manybut i found the romancer saying let me not anticipate  which being so i wonder why he did anticipate or who asked him to it  let me not i say anticipate  this same book took up all my spare time  it was no play to get the other articles together in the general miscellaneous lot but when it come to my own article  there i couldnt have believed the blotting nor yet the buckling to at it nor the patience over it  which again is like the footboard  the public have no idea  at last it was done and the two years time was gone after all the other time before it and where its all gone to who knows  the new cart was finishedyellow outside relieved with wermilion and brass fittingsthe old horse was put in it a new un and a boy being laid on for the cheap jack cartand i cleaned myself up to go and fetch her bright cold weather it was cartchimneys smoking carts pitched private on a piece of waste ground over at wandsworth where you may see em from the souwestern railway when not upon the road  look out of the right hand window going down  marigold says the gentleman giving his hand hearty i am very glad to see you  yet i have my doubts sir says i if you can be half as glad to see me as i am to see you  the time has appeared so longhas it marigold  i wont say that sir considering its real length but  what a start my good fellow  ah  i should think it was  grown such a woman so pretty so intelligent so expressive  i knew then that she must be really like my child or i could never have known her standing quiet by the door  you are affected says the gentleman in a kindly manner  i feel sir says i that i am but a rough chap in a sleeved waistcoat  i feel says the gentleman that it was you who raised her from misery and degradation and brought her into communication with her kind  but why do we converse alone together when we can converse so well with her address her in your own way  i am such a rough chap in a sleeved waistcoat sir says i and she is such a graceful woman and she stands so quiet at the door  try if she moves at the old sign says the gentleman  they had got it up together o purpose to please me  for when i give her the old sign she rushed to my feet and dropped upon her knees holding up her hands to me with pouring tears of love and joy and when i took her hands and lifted her she clasped me round the neck and lay there and i dont know what a fool i didnt make of myself until we all three settled down into talking without sound as if there was a something soft and pleasant spread over the whole world for us        a portion is here omitted from the text having reference to the sketches contributed by other writers but the reader will be pleased to have what follows retained in a note  now ill tell you what i am agoing to do with you  i am agoing to offer you the general miscellaneous lot her own book never read by anybody else but me added to and completed by me after her first reading of it eightandforty printed pages sixandninety columns whitings own work beaufort house to wit thrown off by the steamingine best of paper beautiful green wrapper folded like clean linen come home from the clearstarchers and so exquisitely stitched that regarded as a piece of needlework alone its better than the sampler of a seamstress undergoing a competitive examination for starvation before the civil service commissionersand i offer the lot for what  for eight pound not so much  for six pound  less  for four pound  why i hardly expect you to believe me but thats the sum  four pound  the stitching alone cost half as much again  heres fortyeight original pages ninety six original columns for four pound  you want more for the money  take it  three whole pages of advertisements of thrilling interest thrown in for nothing  read em and believe em  more  my best of wishes for your merry christmases and your happy new years your long lives and your true prosperities  worth twenty pound good if they are delivered as i send them  remember  heres a final prescription added to be taken for life which will tell you how the cart broke down and where the journey ended  you think four pound too much  and still you think so come  ill tell you what then  say four pence and keep the secret        so every item of my plan was crowned with success  our reunited life was more than all that we had looked forward to  content and joy went with us as the wheels of the two carts went round and the same stopped with us when the two carts stopped  i was as pleased and as proud as a pug dog with his muzzle blackleaded for a evening party and his tail extra curled by machinery  but i had left something out of my calculations  now what had i left out  to help you to guess ill say a figure  come  make a guess and guess right  nought  no  nine  no  eight  no  seven  no  six no  five  no  four  no  three  no  two  no  one  no  now ill tell you what ill do with you  ill say its another sort of figure altogether  there  why then says you its a mortal figure  no nor yet a mortal figure  by such means you got yourself penned into a corner and you cant help guessing a immortal figure  thats about it  why didnt you say so sooner  yes  it was a immortal figure that i had altogether left out of my calculations  neither mans nor womans but a childs  girls or boys  boys  i says the sparrow with my bow and arrow  now you have got it  we were down at lancaster and i had done two nights more than fair average business though i cannot in honour recommend them as a quick audience in the open square there near the end of the street where mr slys kings arms and royal hotel stands  mims travelling giant otherwise pickleson happened at the selfsame time to be trying it on in the town  the genteel lay was adopted with him  no hint of a van  green baize alcove leading up to pickleson in a auction room  printed poster free list suspended with the exception of that proud boast of an enlightened country a free press  schools admitted by private arrangement  nothing to raise a blush in the cheek of youth or shock the most fastidious  mim swearing most horrible and terrific in a pink calico payplace at the slackness of the public  serious handbill in the shops importing that it was all but impossible to come to a right understanding of the history of david without seeing pickleson  i went to the auction room in question and i found it entirely empty of everything but echoes and mouldiness with the single exception of pickleson on a piece of red drugget  this suited my purpose as i wanted a private and confidential word with him which was pickleson  owing much happiness to you i put you in my will for a fypunnote but to save trouble heres fourpunten down which may equally suit your views and let us so conclude the transaction  pickleson who up to that remark had had the dejected appearance of a long roman rushlight that couldnt anyhow get lighted brightened up at his top extremity and made his acknowledgments in a way which for him was parliamentary eloquence  he likewise did add that having ceased to draw as a roman mim had made proposals for his going in as a conwerted indian giant worked upon by the dairymans daughter  this pickleson having no acquaintance with the tract named after that young woman and not being willing to couple gag with his serious views had declined to do thereby leading to words and the total stoppage of the unfortunate young mans beer  all of which during the whole of the interview was confirmed by the ferocious growling of mim down below in the payplace which shook the giant like a leaf  but what was to the present point in the remarks of the travelling giant otherwise pickleson was this doctor marigoldi give his words without a hope of conweying their feeblenesswho is the strange young man that hangs about your cartsthe strange young man  i gives him back thinking that he meant her and his languid circulation had dropped a syllable  doctor he returns with a pathos calculated to draw a tear from even a manly eye i am weak but not so weak yet as that i dont know my words  i repeat them doctor  the strange young man  it then appeared that pickleson being forced to stretch his legs not that they wanted it only at times when he couldnt be seen for nothing to wit in the dead of the night and towards daybreak had twice seen hanging about my carts in that same town of lancaster where i had been only two nights this same unknown young man  it put me rather out of sorts  what it meant as to particulars i no more foreboded then than you forebode now but it put me rather out of sorts howsoever i made light of it to pickleson and i took leave of pickleson advising him to spend his legacy in getting up his stamina and to continue to stand by his religion  towards morning i kept a look out for the strange young man andwhat was morei saw the strange young man  he was well dressed and well looking  he loitered very nigh my carts watching them like as if he was taking care of them and soon after daybreak turned and went away  i sent a hail after him but he never started or looked round or took the smallest notice  we left lancaster within an hour or two on our way towards carlisle next morning at daybreak i looked out again for the strange young man i did not see him  but next morning i looked out again and there he was once more  i sent another hail after him but as before he gave not the slightest sign of being anyways disturbed  this put a thought into my head  acting on it i watched him in different manners and at different times not necessary to enter into till i found that this strange young man was deaf and dumb  the discovery turned me over because i knew that a part of that establishment where she had been was allotted to young men some of them well off and i thought to myself if she favours him where am i and where is all that i have worked and planned for  hopingi must confess to the selfishnessthat she might not favour him i set myself to find out  at last i was by accident present at a meeting between them in the open air looking on leaning behind a firtree without their knowing of it  it was a moving meeting for all the three parties concerned  i knew every syllable that passed between them as well as they did  i listened with my eyes which had come to be as quick and true with deaf and dumb conversation as my ears with the talk of people that can speak  he was a going out to china as clerk in a merchants house which his father had been before him  he was in circumstances to keep a wife and he wanted her to marry him and go along with him  she persisted no  he asked if she didnt love him  yes she loved him dearly dearly but she could never disappoint her beloved good noble generous and idontknow whatall father meaning me the cheap jack in the sleeved waistcoat and she would stay with him heaven bless him though it was to break her heart  then she cried most bitterly and that made up my mind  while my mind had been in an unsettled state about her favouring this young man i had felt that unreasonable towards pickleson that it was well for him he had got his legacy down  for i often thought if it hadnt been for this same weakminded giant i might never have come to trouble my head and wex my soul about the young man  but once that i knew she loved himonce that i had seen her weep for himit was a different thing  i made it right in my mind with pickleson on the spot and i shook myself together to do what was right by all  she had left the young man by that time for it took a few minutes to get me thoroughly well shook together and the young man was leaning against another of the firtreesof which there was a clusterwith his face upon his arm  i touched him on the back  looking up and seeing me he says in our deafanddumb talk do not be angry  i am not angry good boy  i am your friend  come with me  i left him at the foot of the steps of the library cart and i went up alone  she was drying her eyes  you have been crying my dear  yes father  why  a headache  not a heartache  i said a headache father  doctor marigold must prescribe for that headache  she took up the book of my prescriptions and held it up with a forced smile but seeing me keep still and look earnest she softly laid it down again and her eyes were very attentive  the prescription is not there sophy  where is it  here my dear  i brought her young husband in and i put her hand in his and my only farther words to both of them were these doctor marigolds last prescription  to be taken for life  after which i bolted  when the wedding come off i mounted a coat blue and bright buttons for the first and last time in all my days and i give sophy away with my own hand  there were only us three and the gentleman who had had charge of her for those two years  i give the wedding dinner of four in the library cart  pigeonpie a leg of pickled pork a pair of fowls and suitable garden stuff  the best of drinks  i give them a speech and the gentleman give us a speech and all our jokes told and the whole went off like a skyrocket  in the course of the entertainment i explained to sophy that i should keep the library cart as my livingcart when not upon the road and that i should keep all her books for her just as they stood till she come back to claim them  so she went to china with her young husband and it was a parting sorrowful and heavy and i got the boy i had another service and so as of old when my child and wife were gone i went plodding along alone with my whip over my shoulder at the old horses head  sophy wrote me many letters and i wrote her many letters  about the end of the first year she sent me one in an unsteady hand dearest father not a week ago i had a darling little daughter but i am so well that they let me write these words to you  dearest and best father i hope my child may not be deaf and dumb but i do not yet know  when i wrote back i hinted the question but as sophy never answered that question i felt it to be a sad one and i never repeated it  for a long time our letters were regular but then they got irregular through sophys husband being moved to another station and through my being always on the move  but we were in one anothers thoughts i was equally sure letters or no letters  five years odd months had gone since sophy went away  i was still the king of the cheap jacks and at a greater height of popularity than ever i had had a firstrate autumn of it and on the twentythird of december one thousand eight hundred and sixtyfour i found myself at uxbridge middlesex clean sold out  so i jogged up to london with the old horse light and easy to have my christmaseve and christmasday alone by the fire in the library cart and then to buy a regular new stock of goods all round to sell em again and get the money  i am a neat hand at cookery and ill tell you what i knocked up for my christmaseve dinner in the library cart  i knocked up a beefsteakpudding for one with two kidneys a dozen oysters and a couple of mushrooms thrown in  its a pudding to put a man in good humour with everything except the two bottom buttons of his waistcoat having relished that pudding and cleared away i turned the lamp low and sat down by the light of the fire watching it as it shone upon the backs of sophys books  sophys books so brought sophys self that i saw her touching face quite plainly before i dropped off dozing by the fire  this may be a reason why sophy with her deafanddumb child in her arms seemed to stand silent by me all through my nap  i was on the road off the road in all sorts of places north and south and west and east winds liked best and winds liked least here and there and gone astray over the hills and far away and still she stood silent by me with her silent child in her arms  even when i woke with a start she seemed to vanish as if she had stood by me in that very place only a single instant before  i had started at a real sound and the sound was on the steps of the cart  it was the light hurried tread of a child coming clambering up that tread of a child had once been so familiar to me that for half a moment i believed i was agoing to see a little ghost  but the touch of a real child was laid upon the outer handle of the door and the handle turned and the door opened a little way and a real child peeped in  a bright little comely girl with large dark eyes  looking full at me the tiny creature took off her mite of a straw hat and a quantity of dark curls fell about her face  then she opened her lips and said in a pretty voice  grandfather  ah my god i cries out  she can speak  yes dear grandfather  and i am to ask you whether there was ever any one that i remind you of  in a moment sophy was round my neck as well as the child and her husband was awringing my hand with his face hid and we all had to shake ourselves together before we could get over it  and when we did begin to get over it and i saw the pretty child atalking pleased and quick and eager and busy to her mother in the signs that i had first taught her mother the happy and yet pitying tears fell rolling down my face
