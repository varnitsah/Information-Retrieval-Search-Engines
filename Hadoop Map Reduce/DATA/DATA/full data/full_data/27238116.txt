of calaisport of calaismagical words     preface   it may seem to be late in the day to give an account of the more ordinary characteristics of europe but the mass of all nations can form their opinions of others through the medium of testimony only and as no two travellers see precisely the same things or when seen view them with precisely the same eyes this is a species of writing after all that is not likely to pall or cease to be useful the changes that are constantly going on everywhere call for as constant repetitions of the descriptions and although the pictures may not always be drawn and coloured equally well so long as they are taken in good faith they will not be without their value  it is not a very difficult task to make what is commonly called an amusing book of travels any one who will tell with a reasonable degree of graphic effect what he has seen will not fail to carry the reader with him for the interest we all feel in personal adventure is of itself success but it is much more difficult to give an honest and a discriminating summary of what one has seen the mind so naturally turns to exceptions that an observer has great need of selfdistrust of the powers of analysis and most of all of a knowledge of the world to be what the lawyers call a safe witness  i have no excuse of haste or of a want of time to offer for the defect of these volumes all i ask is that they may be viewed as no more than they profess to be they are the gleanings of a harvest already gathered thrown together in a desultory manner and without the slightest or at least very small pretensions to any of those arithmetical and statistical accounts that properly belong to works of a graver character they contain the passing remarks of one who has certainly seen something of the world whether it has been to his advantage or not who had reasonably good opportunities to examine what he saw and who is not conscious of being in the slightest degree influenced by fear favour or the hope of reward his compte rendu must pass for what it is worth     france   letter i  our embarkationleavetakingour abigailbay of new york the hudsonominous predictionthe prophet

sailingpilotboatscoast of dorsetshirethe needles lymingtonsouthampton waterthe customhouse   to captain shubrick usn  my dear shubrick  passengers by the liverpool london and havre packets are informed that a steamboat will leave the white hall wharf precisely at eleven am tomorrow june 1st if to this notice be added the year 1826 you have the very hour and place of our embarkation we were nominally of the london party it being our intention however to land at cowes from which place we proposed crossing the channel to havre the reason for making this variation from the direct route was the superior comfort of the london ship that of the french line for the 1st june though a good vessel and well commanded being actually the least commodious packet that plied between the two hemispheres  we were punctual to the hour and found one of the smaller steamers crowded with those who like ourselves were bound to the old world and the friends who had come to take the last look at them we had our leavetakings too which are sufficiently painful when it is known that years must intervene before there is another meeting as is always done by good manhattanese the town house had been given up on the 1st of may since which time we had resided at an hotel the furniture had been principally sold at auction and the entire month had passed in what i believed to be very ample preparations it may be questioned if there is any such thing as being completely prepared for so material a change at all events we found a dozen essentials neglected at the last moment and as many oversights to be repaired in the same instant  on quitting the hotel some fifty or a hundred volumes and pamphlets lay on the floor of my bedroom luckily you were to sail on a cruise in a day or two and as you promised not only to give them a berth but to read them one and all they were transferred forthwith to the lexington they were a dear gift if you kept your word john was sent with a note with orders to be at the wharf in half an hour i have not seen him since then abigail was to be discharged we had long debated whether this excellent woman should or should not be taken she was an american and like most of her countrywomen who will consent to serve in a household a most valuable domestic she wished much to go but on the other side was the conviction that a woman who had never been at sea would be useless during the passage and then we were told so many fine things of the european servants that the odds were unfortunately against her the principal objection however was her forms of speech foreign servants would of themselves be a great aid in acquiring the different languages and poor abigail at the best spoke that least desirable of all corruptions of the english tongue the country dialect of new england her new england morals and new england sense in this instance were put in the balance against her bens angels doozes nawthings noans and even her virtooes in a family of children no immaterial considerations and the latter prevailed we had occasion to regret this decision a few years later i met in florence an italian family of high rank which had brought with them from philadelphia two female domestics whom they prized above all the other servants of a large establishment italy was not good enough for them however and after resisting a great deal of persuasion they were sent back what was florence or rome to philadelphia but then these people spoke good englishbetter perhaps than common english nurserymaids the greatest of their abuses in orthoepy being merely to teach a child to call its mother a mare  it was a flat calm and the packets were all dropping down the bay with the ebb the day was lovely and the view of the harbour which has so many while it wants so many of the elements of firstrate scenery was rarely finer all estuaries are most beautiful viewed in the calm but this is peculiarly true of the bay of new yorkneither the colour of the water nor its depth nor the height of the surrounding land being favourable to the grander efforts of nature there is little that is sublime in either the hudson or its mouth but there is the very extreme of landscape beauty  experience will teach every one that without returning to scenes that have made early impressions after long absences and many occasions to examine similar objects elsewhere our means of comparison are of no great value my acquaintance with the hudson has been long and very intimate for to say that i have gone up and down its waters a hundred times would be literally much within the truth during that journey whose observations and events are about to fill these volumes i retained a lively impression of its scenery and on returning to the country its current was ascended with a little apprehension that an eye which had got to be practised in the lights and shades of the alps and appenines might prove too fastidious for our own river what is usually termed the grandeur of the highlands was certainly much impaired but other parts of the scenery gained in proportion and on the whole i found the passage between new york and albany to be even finer than it had been painted by memory i should think there can be little doubt that if not positively the most beautiful river the hudson possesses some of the most beautiful riverscenery of the known world  our ship was named after this noble stream we got on board of her off bedlows and dropped quietly down as far as the quarantine ground before we were met by the flood here we came to to wait for a wind more passengers and that important personage whom manofwars men term the master and landsmen the captain in the course of the afternoon we had all assembled and began to reconnoitre each other and to attend to our comforts  to get accustomed to the smell of the ship with its confined air and especially to get all their little comforts about them in smooth water is a good beginning for your novices if to this be added moderation in food and especially in drink as much exercise as one can obtain refraining from reading and writing until accustomed to ones situation and paying great attention to the use of aperients i believe all is said that an old traveller and an old sailor too can communicate on a subject so important to those who are unaccustomed to the sea can your experience suggest anything more  we lay that night at the quarantine ground but early on the morning of the 2nd all hands were called to heaveup the wind came in puffs over the heights of staten and there was every prospect of our being able to get to sea in two or three hours we hove short and sheeted home and hoisted the three topsails but the anchor hung and the people were ordered to get their breakfasts leaving the ship to tug at her groundtackle with a view to loosen her hold of the bottom  everything was now in motion the little don quixote the havre ship just mentioned was laying through the narrows with a fresh breeze from the southwest the liverpool ship was out of sight and six or seven sails were turning down with the ebb under every stitch of canvass that would draw one fine vessel tacked directly on our quarter as she passed quite near our stern some one cried from her decka good run to you mr  after thanking this wellwisher i inquired his name he gave me that of an englishman who resided in cuba whither he was bound how long do you mean to be absent five years you will never come back with this ravenlike prediction we parted the wind sweeping his vessel beyond the reach of the voice  these words you will never come back were literally the last that i heard on quitting my country they were uttered in a prophetic tone and under circumstances that were of a nature to produce an impression i thought of them often when standing on the western verge of europe and following the course of the sun toward the land in which i was born i remembered them from the peaks of the alps when the subtle mind outstripping the senses would make its mysterious flight westward across seas and oceans to recur to the past and to conjecture the future and when the allotted five years were up and found us still wanderers i really began to think what probably every man thinks in some moment of weakness that this call from the passing ship was meant to prepare me for the future the result proved in my case however as it has probably proved in those of most men that providence did not consider me of sufficient importance to give me audible information of what was about to happen so strong was this impression to the last notwithstanding that on our return when the vessel passed the spot where the evilomened prediction was uttered i caught myself muttering involuntarily  is a false prophet i have come back  we got our anchor as soon as the people were ready and the wind drawing fresh through the narrows were not long turning into lower bay the ship was deep and had not a sufficient spread of canvass for a summer passage but she was well commanded and exceedingly comfortable  the wind became light in the lower bay the liverpool ship had got to sea the evening before and the don quixote was passing the hook just as we opened the mouth of the raritan a light english bark was making a fair wind of it by laying out across the swash and it now became questionable whether the ebb would last long enough to sweep us round the southwest spit a détour that our heavier draught rendered necessary  by paying great attention to the ship however the pilot who was of the dilatory school succeeded about 3 pm in getting us round that awkward but very necessary buoy which makes so many foul winds of fair ones when the ships bead was laid to the eastward with square yards in half an hour the vessel had slapped past the low sandy spit of land that you have so often regarded with philosophical eyes and we fairly entered the atlantic at a point where nothing but water lay between us and the rock of lisbon we discharged the pilot on the bar  by this time the wind had entirely left us the flood was making strong and there was a prospect of our being compelled to anchor the bark was nearly hulldown in the offing and the topgallantsails of the don quixote were just settling into the water all this was very provoking for there might be a good breeze to seaward while we had it calm inshore the suspense was short for a freshlooking line along the sea to the southward gave notice of the approach of wind the yards were braced forward and in half an hour we were standing east southerly with strong headway about sunset we passed the light vessel which then lay moored several leagues from land in the open oceanan experiment that has since failed the highlands of navesink disappeared with the day  the other passengers were driven below before evening the first mate a straightforward kennebunk man gave me a wink he had detected my seaeducation by a single expression that of send it an end while mounting the side of the ship and said a clear quarterdeck a good time to take a walk sir i had it all to myself sure enough for the first two or three days after which our landbirds came crawling up one by one but long before the end of the passage nothing short of a doublereefedtopsail breeze could send the greater part of them below there was one man however who the mate affirmed wore the heel of a spare topmast smooth by seating himself on it as the precise spot where the motion of the ship excited the least nausea i got into my berth at nine but hearing a movement overhead about midnight i turned out again with a sense of uneasiness i had rarely before experienced at sea the responsibility of a large family acted in some measure like the responsibility of command the captain was at his post shortening sail for it blew fresher there was some rain and thunder and lightning were at work in the heavens in the direction of the adjacent continent the air was full of wild unnatural lucidity as if the frequent flashes left a sort of twilight behind them and objects were discernible at a distance of two or three leagues we had been busy in the first watch as the omens denoted easterly weather the english bark was struggling along the troubled waters already quite a league on our lee quarter  i remained on deck half an hour watching the movements of the master he was a mild reasoning connecticut man whose manner of ministering to the wants of the female passengers had given me already a good opinion of his kindness and forethought while it left some doubts of his ability to manage the rude elements of drunkenness and insubordination which existed among the crew quite one half of whom were europeans he was now on deck in a southwester1 giving his orders in a way effectually to shake all that was left of the horrors out of the ships company i went below satisfied that we were in good hands and before the end of the passage i was at a loss to say whether nature had most fitted this truly worthy man to be a shipmaster or a childs nurse for he really appeared to me to be equally skilful in both capacities  footnote 1 doricsouthwester  such a temperament is admirably suited to the command of a packeta station in which so many different dispositions habits and prejudices are to be soothed at the same time that a proper regard is to be had to the safety of their persons if any proof is wanting that the characters of seamen in general have been formed under adverse circumstances and without sufficient attention or indeed any attention to their real interests it is afforded in the fact that the officers of the packetships men usually trained like other mariners so easily adapt their habits to their new situation and become more mild reflecting and humane it is very rare to hear a complaint against an officer of one of these vessels yet it is not easy to appreciate the embarrassments they have frequently to encounter from whimsical irritable ignorant and exacting passengers as a rule the eastern men of this country make the best packetofficers they are less accustomed to sail with foreigners than those who have been trained in the other ports but acquire habits of thought and justice by commanding their countrymen for of all the seamen of the known world i take it the most subordinate the least troublesome and the easiest to govern so long as he is not oppressed is the native american this indeed is true both ashore and afloat for very obvious reasons they who are accustomed to reason themselves being the most likely to submit to reasonable regulations and they who are habituated to plenty are the least likely to be injured by prosperity which causes quite as much trouble in this world as adversity it is this prosperity too suddenly acquired which spoils most of the labouring europeans who emigrate while they seldom acquire the real frank independence of feeling which characterizes the natives they adopt an insolent and rude manner as its substitute mistaking the shadow for the substance this opinion of the american seamen is precisely the converse of what is generally believed in europe however and more particularly in england for following out the onesided political theories in which they have been nurtured disorganization in the minds of the inhabitants of the old world is inseparable from popular institutions  the early part of the season of 1826 was remarkable for the quantities of ice that had drifted from the north into the track of european and american ships the crisis a london packet had been missing nearly three months when we sailed she was known to have been full of passengers and the worst fears were felt for her safety ten years have since elapsed and no vestige of this unhappy ship has ever been found  our master prudently decided that safety was of much more importance than speed and he kept the hudson well to the southward instead of crossing the banks we were as low as 40° when in their meridian and although we had some of the usual signs in distant piles of fog and exceedingly chilly and disagreeable weather for a day or two we saw no ice about the 15th the wind got round to the southward and eastward and we began to fall off more than we wished even to the northward  all the charts for the last fifty years have three rocks laid down to the westward of ireland which are known as the three chimneys most american mariners have little faith in their existence and yet i fancy no seaman draws near the spot where they are said to be without keeping a good lookout for the danger the master of the hudson once carried a lieutenant of the english navy as a passenger who assured him that he had actually seen these three chimneys he may have been mistaken and he may not our course lay far to the southward of them but the wind gradually hauled ahead in such a way as to bring us as near as might be to the very spot where they ought to appear if properly laid down the lookouts of a merchantship are of no great value except in serious cases and i passed nearly a whole night on deck quite as much incited by my precious charge as by curiosity in order to ascertain all that eyes could ascertain under the circumstances no signs of these rocks however were seen from the hudson  it is surprising in the present state of commerce and with the vast interests which are at stake that any facts affecting the ordinary navigation between the two hemispheres should be left in doubt there is a shoal and i believe a reef laid down near the tail of the great bank whose existence is still uncertain seamen respect this danger more than that of the three chimneys for it lies very much in the track of ships between liverpool and new york still while tacking or giving it a berth they do not know whether they are not losing a wind for a groundless apprehension our own government would do well to employ a light cruiser or two in ascertaining just these facts many more might he added to the list during the summer months our own brief naval history is pregnant with instances of the calamities that befall ships no man can say when or how the insurgente the pickering the wasp the epervier the lynx and the hornet disappeared we know that they are gone and of all the brave spirits they held not one has been left to relate the histories of the different disasters we have some plausible conjectures concerning the manner in which the two latter were wrecked but an impenetrable mystery conceals the fate of the four others they may have run on unknown reefs these reefs may be constantly heaving up from the depths of the ocean by subterranean efforts for a marine rock is merely the summit of a submarine mountain2  footnote 2 there is a touching incident connected with the fortunes of two young officers of the navy that is not generally known when the essex frigate was captured in the pacific by the phoebe and cherub two of the officers of the former were left in the ship in order to make certain affidavits that were necessary to the condemnation the remainder were paroled and returned to america after a considerable interval some uneasiness was felt at the protracted absence of those who had been left in the essex on inquiry it was found that after accompanying the ship to rio janeiro they had been exchanged according to agreement and suffered to go where they pleased after some delay they took passage in a swedish brig bound to norway as the only means which offered to get to europe whence they intended to return home about this time great interest was also felt for the sloop wasp she had sailed for the mouth of the british channel where she fell in with and took the reindeer carrying her prisoners into france shortly after she had an action with and took the avon but was compelled to abandon her prize by others of the enemys cruisers one of which the castilian actually came up with her and gave her a broadside about twenty days after the latter action she took a merchantbrig near the western islands and sent her into philadelphia this was the last that had been heard of her months and even years went by and no farther intelligence was obtained all this time too the gentlemen of the essex were missing government ordered inquiries to be made in sweden for the master of the brig in which they had embarked he was absent on a long voyage and a weary period elapsed before he could be found when this did happen he was required to give an account of his passengers by producing his logbook and proper receipts he proved that he had fallen in with the wasp near the line about a fortnight after she had taken the merchantbrig named when the young officers in question availed themselves of the occasion to return to their flag since that time a period of twentyone years the wasp has not been heard of  we were eighteen days out when early one morning we made an american ship on our weather quarter both vessels had everything set that would draw and were going about five knots close on the wind the stranger made a signal to speak us and on the hudsons maintopsail being laid to the mast he came down under our stern and ranged up alongside to leeward he proved to be a ship called the london packet from charlestown bound to havre and his chronometer having stopped he wanted to get the longitude  when we had given him our meridian a trial of sailing commenced which continued without intermission for three entire days during this time we had the wind from all quarters and of every degree of force from the lightest air to a doublereefedtopsail breeze we were never a mile separated and frequently we were for hours within a cables length of each other one night the two ships nearly got foul in a very light air the result showed that they sailed as nearly alike one being deep and the other light as might well happen to two vessels on the third day both ships being under reefed topsails with the wind at east and in thick weather after holding her own with us for two watches the london packet edged a little off the wind while the hudson still hugged it and we soon lost sight of our consort in the mist  we were ten days longer struggling with adverse winds during this time the ship made all possible traverses our vigilant master resorting to every expedient of an experienced seaman to get to the eastward we were driven up as high as fiftyfour where we fell into the track of the st lawrence traders the sea seemed covered with them and i believe we made more than a hundred most of which were brigs all these we passed without difficulty at length a stiff breeze came from the southwest and we laid our course for the mouth of the british channel under studdingsails  on the 28th we got bottom in about sixty fathoms water the 29th was thick weather with a very light but a fair wind we were now quite sensibly within the influence of the tides towards evening the horizon brightened a little and we made the bill of portland resembling a faint bluish cloud it was soon obscured and most of the landsmen were incredulous about its having been seen at all in the course of the night however we got a good view of the eddystone  going on deck early on the morning of the 30th a glorious view presented itself the day was fine clear and exhilarating and the wind was blowing fresh from the westward ninetyseven sail which had come into the channel like ourselves during the thick weather were in plain sight the majority were english but we recognized the build of half the maritime nations of christendom in the brilliant fleet everybody was busy and the blue waters were glittering with canvass a frigate was in the midst of us walking through the crowd like a giant stepping among pigmies our own good vessel left everything behind her also with the exception of two or three other brightsided ships which happened to be as fast as herself  i found the master busy with the glass and as soon as he caught my eye he made a sign for me to come forward look at that ship directly ahead of us the vessel alluded to led the fleet being nearly hulldown to the eastward it was the don quixote which had left the port of new york one month before about the same distance in our advance now look here inshore of us added the master it is an american but i cannot make her out look again she has a new cloth in her maintopgallant sail this was true enough and by that sign the vessel was our late competitor the london packet  as respects the don quixote we had made a journey of some five thousand miles and not varied our distance on arriving a league there was probably some accident in this for the don quixote had the reputation of a fast ship while the hudson was merely a pretty fair sailer we had probably got the best of the winds but a hard and close trial of three days had shown that neither the hudson nor the london packet in their present trims could go ahead of the other in any wind and yet here after a separation of ten days during which time our ship had tacked and wore fifty times had calms foul winds and fair and had run fully a thousand miles there was not a leagues difference between the two vessels  i have related these circumstances because i think they are connected with causes that have a great influence on the success of american navigation on passing several of the british ships today i observed that their officers were below or at least out of sight and in one instance a vessel of a very fair mould and with every appearance of a good sailer actually lay with some of her light sails aback long enough to permit us to come up with and pass her the hudson probably went with this wind some fifteen or twenty miles farther than this loiterer while i much question if she could have gone as far had the latter been well attended to the secret is to be found in the fact that so large a portion of american shipmasters are also shipowners as to have erected a standard of activity and vigilance below which few are permitted to fall these men work for themselves and like all their countrymen are looking out for something more than a mere support  about noon we got a cowes pilot he brought no news but told us the english vessel i have just named was sixty days from leghorn and that she had been once a privateer we were just thirty from new york  we had distant glimpses of the land all day and several of the passengers determined to make their way to the shore in the pilotboat these channel craft are sloops of about thirty or forty tons and are rather picturesque and pretty boats more especially when under low sail they are usually fitted to take passengers frequently earning more in this way than by their pilotage they have the long sliding bowsprit a short lower mast very long crosstrees with a taunt topmast and though not so wicked to the eye i think them prettier objects at sea than our own schooners the party from the hudson had scarcely got on board their new vessel when it fell calm and the master and myself paid them a visit they looked like a set of smugglers waiting for the darkness to run in on our return we rowed round the ship one cannot approach a vessel at sea in this manner without being struck with the boldness of the experiment which launched such massive and complicated fabrics on the ocean the pure water is a medium almost as transparent as the atmosphere and the very keel is seen usually so near the surface in consequence of refraction as to give us but a very indifferent opinion of the security of the whole machine i do not remember ever looking at my own vessel when at sea from a boat without wondering at my own folly in seeking such a home  in the afternoon the breeze sprang up again and we soon lost sight of our friends who were hauling in for the still distant land all that afternoon and night we had a fresh and a favourable wind the next day i went on deck while the people were washing the ship it was sunday and there was a flat calm the entire scene admirably suited a day of rest the channel was like a mirror unruffled by a breath of air and some twenty or thirty vessels lay scattered about the view with their sails festooned and drooping thrown into as many picturesque positions by the eddying waters our own ship had got close in with the land so near indeed as to render a horse or a man on the shore distinctly visible we were on the coast of dorsetshire a range of low cliffs lay directly abeam of us and as the land rose to a ridge behind them we had a distinct view of a fair expanse of nearly houseless fields we had left america verdant and smiling but we found england brown and parched there having been a long continuance of dry easterly winds  the cliffs terminated suddenly a little way ahead of the ship and the land retired inward with a wide sweep forming a large though not a very deep bay that was bounded by rather low shores it was under these very cliffs on which we were looking with so much pleasure and security and at so short a distance that the wellknown and terrible wreck of an indiaman occurred when the master with his two daughters and hundreds of other lives were lost the pilot pointed out the precise spot where that illfated vessel went to pieces but the sea in its anger and the sea at rest are very different powers the place had no terrors for us  ahead of us near twenty miles distant lay a high hazy bluff that was just visible this was the western extremity of the isle of wight and the end of our passage in the hudson a sloop of war was pointing her head in towards this bluff and all the vessels in sight now began to take new forms varying and increasing the picturesque character of the view we soon got a light air ourselves and succeeded in laying the ships head off shore towards which we had been gradually drifting nearer than was desirable the wind came fresh and fair about ten when we directed our course towards the distant bluff everything was again in motion the cliffs behind us gradually sunk as those before us rose and lost their indistinctness the blue of the latter soon became grey and ere long white as chalk this being the material of which they are in truth composed  we saw a small whale it might have been a large grampus floundering ahead of us and acting as an extra pilot for he appeared to be steering like ourselves for the needles these needles are fragments of the chalk cliffs that have been pointed and rendered picturesque by the action of the weather and our course lay directly past them they form a line from the extremity of the isle of wight and are awkwardly placed for vessels that come this way in thick weather or in the dark the sloop of war got round them first and we were not far behind her when fairly within the needles the ship was embayed our course now lying between hampshire and the isle of wight through a channel of no great width the country was not particularly beautiful and still looked parched though we got a distant view of one pretty town lymington in hampshire this place in the distance appeared not unlike a large new england village though there was less glare to the houses the cliffs however were very fine without being of any extraordinary elevation though much inferior to the shores of the mediterranean they as much surpass anything i remember to have seen on our own coast between cape anne and cape florida which for its extent a part of india perhaps excepted is i take it just the flattest and tamest and least interesting coast in the entire world  the master pointed out a mass of dark herbage on a distant height which resembled a copse of wood that had been studiously clipped into square forms at its different angles it was visible only for a few moments through a vista in the hills this was carisbrooke castle buried in ivy  there was another little castle on a low point of land which was erected by henry viii as a part of a system of marine defence it would scarcely serve to scale the guns of a modern twentyfourpounder frigate judging of its means of resistance and annoyance by the eye these things are bygones for england a country that has little need of marine batteries  about three we reached a broad basin the land retiring on each side of us the estuary to the northward is called southampton water the town of that name being seated on its margin the opening in the isle of wight is little more than a very wide mouth to a very diminutive river or creek and cowes divided into east and west lines its shores the anchorage in the arm of the sea off this little haven was well filled with vessels chiefly the yachts of amateur seamen and the port itself contained little more than pilotboats and crafts of a smaller size the hudson brought up among the former hauling up the forecourse of a merchantship is like lifting the curtain again on the drama of the land these vessels rarely furl this sail and they who have not experienced it cannot imagine what a change it produces on those who have lived a month or six weeks beneath its shadow the sound of the chain running out was very grateful and i believe though well satisfied with the ship as such that everybody was glad to get a nearer view of our great mother earth  it was sunday but we were soon visited by boats from the town some came to carry us ashore others to see that we carried nothing off with us at first the officer of the customs manifested a desire to make us all go without the smallest article of dress or anything belonging to our most ordinary comforts but he listened to remonstrances and we were eventually allowed to depart with our nightbags as the hudson was to sail immediately for london all our effects were sent within the hour to the customhouse at 3 pm july 2nd 1826 we put foot in europe after a passage of thirtyone days from the quarantine ground     letter ii  controversy at cowescustomhouse civilityenglish costumefashion in americaquadrilles in new

cowes or the principal quarter of the place and got rooms at the fountain mr and mrs  had preceded us and were already in possession of a parlour adjoining our own on casting an eye out at the street i found them one at each window of their own room already engaged in a lively discussion of the comparative merits of cowes and philadelphia this propensity to exaggerate the value of whatever is our own and to depreciate that which is our neighbours a principle that is connected with the very groundwork of poor human nature forms a material portion of travelling equipage of nearly every one who quits the scenes of his own youth to visit those of other people a comparison between cowes and philadelphia is even more absurd than a comparison between new york and london and yet in this instance it answered the purpose of raising a lively controversy between an american wife and a european husband  the consul at cowes had been an old acquaintance at school some fiveandtwenty years before and an inquiry was set on foot for his residence he was absent in france but his deputy soon presented himself with an offer of services we wished for our trunks and it was soon arranged that there should be an immediate examination within an hour we were summoned to the storehouse where an officer attended on behalf of the customs everything was done in a very expeditious and civil manner not only for us but for a few steerage passengers and this too without the least necessity for a douceur the usual passepartout of england america sends no manufactures to europe and a little smuggling in tobacco excepted there is probably less of the contraband in our commercial connexion with england than ever before occurred between two nations that have so large a trade this however is only in reference to what goes eastward for immense amounts of the smaller manufactured articles of all europe find their way duty free into the united states there is also a regular system of smuggling through the canadas i have been told  while the ladies were enjoying the negative luxury of being liberated from a ship at the fountain inn i strolled about the place you know that i had twice visited england professionally before i was eighteen and on one occasion the ship i was in anchored off this very island though not at this precise spot i now thought the people altered there had certainly been so many important changes in myself during the same period that it becomes me to speak with hesitation on this point but even the common class seemed less peculiar less english less provincial if one might use such an expression as applied to so great a nation in short more like the rest of the world than formerly twenty years before england was engaged in a war by which she was in a degree isolated from most of christendom this insulated condition sustained by a consciousness of wealth knowledge and power had served to produce a decided peculiarity of manners and even of appearance in the article of dress i could not be mistaken in 1806 i had seen all the lower classes of the english clad in something like costumes the channel waterman wore the short dowlas petticoat the thames waterman a jacket and breeches of velveteen and a badge the gentleman and gentlewoman attire such as was certainly to be seen in no other part of the christian world the english colonies excepted something of this still remained but it existed rather as the exception than as the rule i then felt at every turn that i was in a foreign country whereas now the idea did not obtrude itself unless i was brought in immediate contact with the people  america in my time at least has always had an active and swift communication with the rest of the world as a people we are beyond a question decidedly provincial but our provincialism is not exactly one of external appearance the men are negligent of dress for they are much occupied have few servants and clothes are expensive but the women dress remarkably near the parisian modes we have not sufficient confidence in ourselves to set fashions all our departures from the usages of the rest of mankind are results of circumstances and not of calculationunless indeed it be one that is pecuniary those whose interest it is to produce changes cause fashions to travel fast and there is not so much difficulty or more cost in transporting anything from havre to new york than there is in transporting the same thing from calais to london and far less difficulty in causing a new mode to be introduced since as a young people we are essentially imitative an example or two will better illustrate what i mean  when i visited london with a part of my family in 1823 after passing near two years on the continent of europe mrs  was compelled to change her dressat all times simple but then as a matter of course parisianin order not to be the subject of unpleasant observation she might have gone in a carriage attired as a frenchwoman for they who ride in england are not much like those who walk but to walk in the streets and look at objects it was far pleasanter to seem english than to seem french five years later we took london on our way to america and even then something of the same necessity was felt on reaching home with dresses fresh from paris the same party was only in the mode with toilettes a little and but very little better arranged it is true but in surprising conformity with those of all around them on visiting our own little retired mountain village these parisianmade dresses were scarcely the subject of remark to any but to your connoisseurs my family struck me as being much less peculiar in the streets of c than they had been a few months before in the streets of london all this must be explained by the activity of the intercourse between france and america and by the greater facility of the americans in submitting to the despotism of foreign fashions  another fact will show you another side of the subject while at paris a book of travels in america written by an englishman mr vigne fell into my hands the writer apparently a welldisposed and sensible man states that he was dancing dosàdos in a quadrille at new york when he found by the embarrassment of the rest of the set he had done something wrong some one kindly told him that they no longer danced dosàdos in commenting on this trifling circumstance the writer ascribes the whole affair to the false delicacy of our women unable to see the connexion between the cause and the effect i pointed out the paragraph to one of my family who was then in the daily practice of dancing and that too in paris itself the very court of terpsichore she laughed and told me that the practice of dancing dosàdos had gone out at paris a year or two before and that doubtless the newer mode had reached new york before it reached mr vigne these are trifles but they are the trifles that make up the sum of national peculiarities ignorance of which leads us into a thousand fruitless and absurd conjectures in this little anecdote we learn the great rapidity with which new fashions penetrate american usages and the greater ductility of american society in visible and tangible things at least and the heedless manner with which even those who write in a good spirit of america jump to their conclusions had captain hall or mrs trollope encountered this unlucky quadrille they would probably have found some clever means of imputing the nezànez tendencies of our dances to the spirit of democracy the latter for instance is greatly outraged by the practice of wearing hats in congress and of placing the legs on tables and yet both have been practised in parliament from time immemorial she had never seen her own legislature and having a set of theories cut and dried for congress everything that struck her as novel was referred to one of her preconceived notions in this manner are books manufactured and by such means are nations made acquainted with each other  cowes resembles a toytown the houses are tiny the streets in the main are narrow and not particularly straight while everything is neat as wax some new avenues however are well planned and long ere this are probably occupied and there were several small marine villas in or near the place one was shown me that belonged to the duke of norfolk it had the outward appearance of a mediumsized american countryhouse the bluff king hall caused another castle to be built here also which i understood was inhabited at the time by the family of the marquis of anglesey who was said to be its governor a part of the system of the english government patronage is connected with these useless castles and nominally fortified places salaries are attached to the governments and the situations are usually bestowed on military men this is a good or a bad regulation as the patronage is used in a nation of extensive military operations it might prove a commendable and a delicate way of rewarding services but as the tendency of mankind is to defer to intrigue and to augment power rather than to reward merit the probability is that these places are rarely bestowed except in the way of political quids pro quos  i was with one striking exception greatly disappointed in the general appearance of the females that i met in the streets while strolling in the skirts of the town i came across a group of girls and boys in which a laughable scene of nautical gallantry was going on the boys lads of fourteen or fifteen were young sailors and among the girls who were of the same age and class was one of bewitching beauty there had been some very palpable passages of coquetry between the two parties when one of the young sailors a tight lad of thirteen or fourteen rushed into the bevy of petticoats and borne away by an ecstasy of admiration but certainly guided by an excellent taste he seized the young venus round the neck and dealt out some as hearty smacks as i remember to have heard the working of emotion in the face of the girl was a perfect study confusion and shame came first indignation followed and darting out from among her companions she dealt her robust young admirer such a slap in the face that it sounded like the report of a pocketpistol the blow was well meant and admirably administered it left the mark of every finger on the cheek of the sturdy little fellow the lad clenched his fist seemed much disposed to retort in kind and ended by telling his beautiful antagonist that it was very fortunate for her she was not a boy but it was the face of the girl herself that drew my attention it was like a mirror which reflected every passing thought when she gave the blow it was red with indignation this feeling instantly gave way to a kinder sentiment and her colour softened to a flush of surprise at the boldness of her own act then came a laugh and a look about her as if to inquire if she had been very wrong the whole terminating in an expression of regret in the prettiest blue eyes in the world which might have satisfied any one that an offence occasioned by her own sweet face was not unpardonable the sweetness the ingenuousness the spirit mingled with softness exhibited in the countenance of this girl are i think all characteristic of the english female countenance when it has not been marbleized by the overwrought polish of high breeding similar countenances occur in america though i think less frequently than here and i believe them to be quite peculiar to the anglosaxon race the workings of such a countenance are like the play of lights and shades in a southern sky  from the windows of the inn we had a very good view of a small castellated dwelling that one of the kings architects had caused to be erected for himself the effect of gray towers seen over the treetops with glimpses of the lawn visible through vistas in the copses was exceedingly pretty though the indescribable influence of association prevented us from paying that homage to turrets and walls of the nineteenth that we were ready so devotedly to pay to anything of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries  we broke bread for the first time in europe that evening having made an early and a hurried dinner on board the ship the isle of wight is celebrated for its butter and yet we found it difficult to eat it the english and many other european nations put no salt in their table butter and we who had been accustomed to the american usage exclaimed with one voice against its insipidity a near relation of as who once served in the british army used to relate an anecdote on the subject of tastes that is quite in point a brother officer who had gone safely through the celebrated siege of gibraltar landed at portsmouth on his return home among the other privations of his recent service he had been compelled to eat butter whose fragrance scented the whole rock before retiring for the night he gave particular orders to have hot rolls and isle of wight butter served for breakfast the first mouthful disappointed him and of course the unlucky waiter suffered the latter protested that he had executed the order to the letter then take away your isle of wight butter growled the officer and bring me some that has a taste  like him of gibraltar we were ready to exclaim take away your isle of wight butter and bring us some from the good ship hudson which though not quite as fragrant as that which had obtained its odour in a siege was not entirely without a taste this little event homely as it may appear is connected with the principle that influences the decisions of more than half of those who visit foreign nations usages are condemned because they are not our own practices are denounced if their connexion with fitness is not selfapparent to our inexperience and men and things are judged by rules that are of local origin and local application the moral will be complete when i add that we who were so fastidious about the butter at cowes after an absence of nearly eight years from america had the salt regularly worked out of all we ate for months after our return home protesting there was no such thing as good butter in america had mrs  introduced the philadelphia butter however i think her husband must have succumbed for i believe it to be the best in the world not even excepting that of leyden  towards evening the hudson having landed all her passengers and the most of those who were in the steerage went round the eastern point of the little port on her way to london  after taking an early breakfast we all got into a carriage called a sociable which is very like a larger sort of american coaches and went to newport the principal town in the island the road ran between hedges and the scenery was strictly english small enclosures copses a sward clipped close as velvet and trees of no great size or beauty however scattered in the fields with an effect nearly equal to landscape gardening were the predominant features the drought had less influence on the verdure here than in dorsetshire the road was narrow and winding the very beau idéal of a highway for in this particular the general rule obtains that what is agreeable is the least useful thanks to the practical good sense and perseverance of mr mcadam not only the road in question but nearly all the roads of great britain have been made within the last fiveandtwenty years to resemble in appearance but really to exceed in solidity and strength the roads one formerly saw in the grounds of private gentlemen these roads are almost flat and when they have been properly constructed the wheel rolls over them as if passing along a bed of iron apart from the levels which of course are not so rigidly observed there is not any very sensible difference between the draught on a really good mcadamized road and on a railroad we have a few roads in america that are nearly as good as most one meets with but we have nothing that deserves to be termed a real imitation of the system of mr mcadam  the distance to newport was only four or five miles the town itself a borough but otherwise of little note lies in a very sweet vale and is neat but plain resembling in all but its greater appearance of antiquity and the greater size of its churches one of our own provincial towns of the same size a and myself took a fly and went by a very rural road to carisbrooke a distance of about a mile in quest of lodgings carisbrooke is a mere village but the whole valley in this part of the island is so highly cultivated and so many pretty cottages meet the eyenot cottages of the poor but cottages of the richthat it has an air of finish and high cultivation that we are accustomed to see only in the immediate vicinity of large towns and not always even there  on reaching the hamlet of carisbrooke we found ourselves immediately beneath the castle there was a fine old village church one of those picturesque rustic edifices which abound in england a building that time had warped and twisted in such a way as to leave few parallel lines or straight edges or even regular angles in any part of it they told us also that the remains of a ruined priory were at hand we had often laughed since at the eagerness and delight with which we hurried off to look at these venerable objects it was soon decided however that it was a pleasure too exquisite to be niggardly enjoyed alone and the carriage was sent back with orders to bring up the whole party  while the flya liliputian coach drawn by a single horse a sort of diminutive buggywas absent we went in quest of the priory the people were very civil and quite readily pointed out the way we found the ruin in a farmyard there was literally nothing but a very small fragment of a blind wall but with these materials we went to work with the imagination and soon completed the whole edifice we might even have peopled it had not carisbrooke with its keep its gateway and its ivyclad ramparts lain in full view inviting us to something less ideal the church toothe rude old humpbacked church was already opened waiting to be inspected  the interior of this building was as ancient in appearance at least and quite as little in harmony with right lines and regular angles as its exterior all the woodwork was of unpainted oak a colour however that was scarcely dark enough to be rich a circumstance which to american eyes at leasteyes on whose lenses paint is ever presentgave it an unfinished look had we seen this old building five years later we might have thought differently as for the english oak of which one has heard so much it is no great matter our own common oaks are much prettier and did we understand their beauty there would not be a village church in america that in this particular would not excel the finest english cathedral i saw nothing in all europe of this nature that equalled the common oaken doors of the hall at c which you know so well  a movement in the churchyard called us out and we became pained witnesses of the interment of two of the unhonoured dead the air manner and conduct of these funerals made a deep impression on us both the dead were a woman and a child but of different families there were three or four mourners belonging to each party both the bodies were brought in the same horsecart and they were buried by the same service the coffins were of coarse wood stained with black in a way to betray poverty it was literally le convoi du pauvre deference to their superiors and the struggle to maintain appearancesfor there was a semblance of the pomp of woe even in these extraordinary groups of which all were in deep mourningcontrasted strangely with the extreme poverty of the parties the niggardly administration of the sacred offices and the businesslike manner of the whole transaction the mourners evidently struggled between natural grief and the bewilderment of their situation the clergyman was a goodlooking young man in a dirty surplice most probably he was a curate he read the service in a strong voice but without reverence and as if he were doing it by the job in every way short measure was dealt out to the poor mourners when the solemn words of dust to dust ashes to ashes were uttered he bowed hastily towards each gravehe stood between themand the assistants met his wholesale administration of the rites with a wholesale sympathy  the ceremony was no sooner over than the clergyman and his clerk retired into the church one or two of the men cast wistful eyes towards the graves neither of which was half filled and reluctantly followed i could scarcely believe my senses and ventured to approach the door here i met such a view as i had never before seen and hope never to witness again on one side of me two men were filling the graves on the opposite two others were actually paying the funeral fees in one ear was the hollow sound of the clod on the coffin in the other the chinking of silver on the altar yea literally on the altar we are certainly far behind this great people in many essential particulars our manners are less formed our civilization is less perfect but thanks to the spirit which led our ancestors into the wilderness such mockery of the almighty and his worship such a mingling of god and mammon never yet disgraced the temple within the wide reach of the american borders  we were joined by the whole party before the sods were laid on the graves of the poor but some time after the silver had been given for the consolations of religion with melancholy reflections we mounted to the castle a had been educated in opinions peculiarly favourable to england but i saw as we walked mournfully away from the spot that one fact like this did more to remove the film from her eyes than volumes of reading  carisbrooke has been too often described to need many words externally it is a pile of high battlemented wall completely buried in ivy forming within a large area that was once subdivided into courts of which however there are at present scarcely any remains we found an old woman as warder who occupied a room or two in a sort of cottage that had been made out of the ruins the part of the edifice which had been the prison of charles i was a total ruin resembling any ordinary house without roof floors or chimneys the aperture of the window through which he attempted to escape is still visible it is in the outer wall against which the principal apartments had been erected the whole work stands on a high irregular ridge of a rocky hill the keep being much the most elevated we ascended to the sort of bastion which its summit forms whence the view was charming the whole vale which contains carisbrooke and newport with a multitude of cottages villas farmhouses and orchards with meads lawns and shrubberies lay in full view and we had distant glimpses of the water the setting of this sweet picture or the adjacent hills was as naked and brown as the vale itself was crowded with objects and verdant the isle of wight as a whole did not strike me as being either particularly fertile or particularly beautiful while it contains certain spots that are eminently both i have sailed entirely round it more than once and judging from the appearance of its coasts and from what was visible in this little excursion i should think that it had more than a usual amount of waste treeless land the seaviews are fine as a matter of course and the air is pure and bracing it is consequently much frequented in summer it were better to call it the wateringplace than to call it the garden of england  we had come in quest of a house where the family might be left for a few days while i went up to london but the whole party was anxious to put their feet in bona fide old england before they crossed the channel and the plan was changed to meet their wishes we slept that night at newport therefore and returned in the morning to cowes early enough to get on board a steamboat for southampton this town lies several miles up an estuary that receives one or two small streams there are a few dwellings on the banks of the latter that are about the size and of the appearance of the better sort of countryhouses on the hudson although more attention appears to have been generally paid to the grounds there were two more of henry the eighths forts and we caught a glimpse of a fine ruined gothic window in passing netley abbey  we landed on the pier at southampton about one and found ourselves truly in england boat sir boat coach sir coach london sir londonno we have need of neitherthankee sirthankee sir these few words in one sense are an epitome of england they rang in our ears for the first five minutes after landing pressing forward for a livelihood a multitude of conveniences a choice of amusements and a trained but a heartless and unmeaning civility no i do not want a boat thankee sir you are just as much thankee if you do not employ the man as if you did you are thanked for condescending to give an order for declining for listening it is plain to see that such thanks dwell only on the lips and yet we so easily get to be sophisticated words can be so readily made to supplant things deference however unmeaning is usually so grateful that one soon becomes accustomed to all this and even begins to complain that he is not imposed on  we turned into the first cleanlooking inn that offered it was called the vine and though a secondrate house for southampton even we were sufficiently well served everything was neat and the waiter an old man with a powdered bead was as methodical as a clock and a most busy servitor to human wants he told me he had been twentyeight years doing exactly the same things daily and in precisely the same place think of a man crying coming sir and setting table for a whole life within an area of forty feet square truly this was not america  the principal street in southampton though making a sweep is a broad clean avenue that is lined with houses having with very few exceptions bowwindows as far as an ancient gate a part of the old defences of the town here the highstreet is divided into abovebar and belowbar the former is much the most modern and promises to be an exceedingly pretty place when a little more advanced belowbar is neat and agreeable too the people appeared singularly well dressed after new york the women though less fashionably attired than our own taking the paris modes for the criterion were in beautiful english chintzes spotlessly neat and the men all looked as if they had been born with hatbrushes and clothesbrushes in their hands and yet every one was in a sort of seashore costume i saw many men whom my nautical instinct detected at once to be naval officerssome of whom must have been captainsin roundabouts but it was quite impossible to criticise toilettes that were so faultlessly neat and so perfectly well arranged  we ordered dinner and sallied forth in quest of lodgings southampton is said to be peculiar for long passages bowwindows and old maids i can vouch that it merits the two first distinctions the season had scarcely commenced and we had little difficulty in obtaining rooms the bowwindow and long passage included these lodgings comprise one or more drawingrooms the requisite number of bedrooms and the use of the kitchen the people of the house ordinarily tradespeople do the cooking and furnish the necessary attendance we engaged an extra servant and prepared to take possession that evening  when we returned to the vine we found a visitor in this land of strangers mrs r of new york a relative and an old friend had heard that americans of our name were there and she came doubting and hoping to the vine we found that the windows of our own drawingroom looked directly into those of hers a few doors below us dwelt mrs l a still nearer relative and a few days later we had visàvis mrs ma a sister of as on whom we all laid eyes for the first time in our lives such little incidents recall to mind the close consanguinity of the two nations although for myself i have always felt as a stranger in england this has not been so much from the want of kindness and a community of opinion many subjects as from a consciousness that in the whole of that great nation there is not a single individual with whom i could claim affinity and yet with a slight exception we are purely of english extraction our father was the greatgreatgrandson of an englishman i once met with a man an englishman who bore so strong a resemblance to him in stature form walk features and expression that i actually took the trouble to ascertain his name he even had our own i had no means of tracing the matter any farther but here was physical evidence to show the affinity between the two people on the other hand a comes of the huguenots she is purely american by every intermarriage from the time of louis the fourteenth down and yet she found cousins in england at every turn and even a child of the same parents who was as much of an englishwoman as she herself was an american  we drank to the happiness of america at dinner that day fifty years she declared herself a nation that very day and nearly at that hour two of the colabourers in the great work we celebrated departed in company for the world of spirits  a day or two was necessary to become familiarized to the novel objects around us and my departure for london was postponed we profited by the delay to visit netley abbey a ruin of some note at no great distance from southampton the road was circuitous and we passed several pretty countryhouses few of which exceeded in size or embellishments shrubbery excepted similar dwellings at home there was one however of an architecture much more ancient than we had been accustomed to see it being by all appearance of the time of elizabeth or james it had turrets and battlements but was otherwise plain  the abbey was a fine without being a very imposing ruin standing in the midst of a field of english neatness prettily relieved by woods the window already mentioned formed the finest part the effect of these ruins on us proved the wonderful power of association the greater force of the past than of the future on the mind can only be the result of questionable causes our real concern with the future is incalculably the greatest and yet we are dreaming over our own graves on the events and scenes which throw a charm around the graves of those who have gone before us had we seen netley abbey just as far advanced towards completion as it was in fact advanced towards decay our speculations would have been limited by a few conjectures on its probable appearance but gazing at it as we did we peopled its passages imagined benedictines stalking along its galleries and fancied that we heard the voices of the choir pealing among its arches  our fresh american feelings were strangely interrupted by the sounds of junketing a party of southampton cockneys there are cockneys even in new york having established themselves on the grass in one of the courts were lighting a fire and were deliberately proceeding to make tea to tea and ruins the invitations most probably run we retreated into a little battery of the bluff king hal that was near by a work that sufficiently proved the state of nautical warfare in the sixteenth century     letter iii  road to londonroyal pastimecockney

early hour one of the london coaches stopped at the door i had secured a seat by the side of the coachman and we went through the bar at a round trot the distance was about sixty miles and i had paid a guinea for my place there were four or five other passengers all on the outside  the road between southampton and london is one of little interest even the highway itself is not as good as usual for the first twenty or thirty miles being made chiefly of gravel instead of broken stones the soil for a long distance was thirsty and the verdure was nearly gone england feels a drought sooner than most countries probably from the circumstances of its vegetation being so little accustomed to the absence of moisture and to the comparative lightness of the dews the winds until just before the arrival of the hudson had been blowing from the eastward for several weeks and in england this is usually a dry wind the roads were dusty the hedges were brown and the fields had nothing to boast of over our own verdure indeed it is unusual to see the grasses of new york so much discoloured so early in the season  i soon established amicable relations with my companion on the box he had been ordered at the vine to stop for an american and he soon began to converse about the new world is america anywhere near van diemens land was one of his first questions i satisfied him on this head and he apologised for the mistake by explaining that he had a sister settled in van diemens land and he had a natural desire to know something about her welfare we passed a house which had more the air of a considerable place than any i had yet seen though of far less architectural pretensions than the miniature castle near cowes this my companion informed me had once been occupied by george iv when prince of wales here his royal highness enjoyed what i call the perfection of life sir women wine and foxhunting added the professor of the whip with the leer of a true amateur  these coachmen are a class by themselves they have no concern with grooming the horses and keep the reins for a certain number of relays they dress in a particular way without being at all in livery or uniform like the continental postilions talk in a particular way and act in a particular way we changed this personage for another about half the distance between southampton and london his successor proved to be even a still better specimen of his class he was a thorough cockney and altogether the superior of his country colleague he was clearly the oracle of the boys delivering his sentiments in the manner of one accustomed to dictate to all in and about the stables in addition to this there was an indescribable but ludicrous salvo to his dignity in the way of surliness some one had engaged him to carry a blackbird to town and caused him to wait on this subject he sang a jeremiad in the true cockney key he didnt want to take the blaaackbud but if the man wanted to send the blaaackbud why didnt he bring the blaaackbud this is one of the hundred dialects of the lower classes of the english one of the horses of the last team was restiff and it became necessary to restrain him by an additional curb before we ventured into the streets of london i intimated that i had known such horses completely subdued in america by filling their ears with cotton this suggestion evidently gave offence and he took occasion soon after to show it he wrung the nose of the horse with a cord attaching its end below in the manner of a severe martingale while going through this harsh process which by the way effectually subdued the animal he had leisure to tell him that he was an english horse and not an outlandish horse and he knew best what was good for him with a great deal more similar sound nationality  winchester was the only town of any importance on the road it is pleasantly seated in a valley is of no great size is but meanly built though extremely neat has a cathedral and a bishop and is the shiretown of hampshire the assizes were sitting and southampton was full of troops that had been sent from winchester in order to comply with a custom which forbids the military to remain near the courts of justice england is full of these political mystifications and it is one of the reasons that she is so much in arrears in many of the great essentials in carrying out the practice in this identical case a serious private wrong was inflicted in order that in form an abstract and perfectly useless principle might be maintained the inns at southampton were filled with troops who were billeted on the publicans will ye nill ye and not only the masters of the different houses but travellers were subjected to a great inconvenience in order that this abstraction might not be violated there may be some small remuneration but no one can suppose for a moment that the keeper of a genteel establishment of this nature wishes to see his carriagehouses gateways and halls thronged with soldiers society oppresses him to maintain appearances at the present day the presence of soldiers might be the means of sustaining justice while there is not the smallest probability that they would be used for contrary purposes except in cases in which this usage or lawfor i believe there is a statue for itwould not be in the least respected this is not an age nor is england the country in which a judge is to be overawed by the roll of a drum all sacrifices of common sense and all recourse to plausible political combinations whether of individuals or of men are uniformly made at the expense of the majority the day is certainly arrived when absurdities like these should be done away with  the weather was oppressively hot nor do i remember to have suffered more from the sun than during this little journey were i to indulge in the travellers propensity to refer everything to his own state of feeling you might be told what a sultry place england is in july but i was too old a sailor not to understand the cause the sea is always more temperate than the land being cooler in summer and warmer in winter after being thirty days at sea we all feel this truth either in one way or the other i was quitting the coast too which is uniformly cooler than the interior  when some twelve or thirteen miles from town the coachman pointed to a wood enclosed by a wall on our left a rill trickled from the thicket and ran beneath the road i was told that virginia water lay there and that the evening before a single footpad had robbed a coach in that precise spot or within a few hundred yards of the very place where the king of england at the moment was amusing himself with the fishingrod highway robberies however are now of exceedingly rare occurrence that in question being spoken of as the only one within the knowledge of my informant for many years  our rate of travelling was much the same as that of one of our own better sort of stages the distance was not materially less than that between albany and cn the roads were not so hilly and much better than our own road and yet at the same season we usually perform it in about the same time that we went the distance between southampton and london the scenery was tame nor with the exception of winchester was there a single object of any interest visible until we got near london we crossed the thames a stream of trifling expanse and at kew we had a glimpse of an old germanlooking edifice in yellow bricks with towers turrets and battlements this was one of the royal palaces it stood on the opposite side of the river in the midst of tolerably extensive grounds here a nearly incessant stream of vehicles commenced i attempted to count the stagecoaches and got as high as thirtythree when we met a line of mailcoaches that caused me to stop in despair i think we met not less than fifty within the last hour of our journey there were seven belonging to the mail in one group they all leave london at the same hour for different parts of the kingdom  at hyde park corner i began to recall objects known in my early visits to london apsley house had changed owners and had become the property of one whose great name was still in the germ when i had last seen his present dwelling the parks a gateway or two excepted were unchanged in the row of noble houses that line piccadillyin that hospitallooking edifice devonshire housein the dingy mean irregular and yet interesting front of st jamessin brookess whites the thatched house and various other historical monuments i saw no change buckingham house had disappeared and an unintelligible pile was rising on its ruins a noble palazzononfinito stood at the angle between the green and st jamess parks and here and there i discovered houses of better architecture than london was wont of old to boast one of the very best of these i was told was raised in honour of mercury and probably out of his legitimate profits it is called crockfords  our blaaackbud pulled up in the strand at the head of adamstreet adelphi and i descended from my seat at his side an extra shilling brought the glimmering of a surly smile athwart his blubbercheeks and we parted in goodhumour my fellowtravellers were all men of no very high class but they had been civil and were sufficiently attentive to my wants when they found i was a stranger by pointing out objects on the road and explaining the usages of the inns one of them had been in america and he boasted a little of his intimacy with general this and commodore that at one time too he appeared somewhat disposed to institute comparisons between the two countries a good deal at our expense as you may suppose but as i made no answers i soon heard him settling it with his companions that after all it was quite natural a man should not like to hear his own country abused and so he gave the matter up with this exception i had no cause of complaint but on the contrary good reason to be pleased  i was set down at the adamstreet hotel a house much frequented by americans the respectable woman who has so long kept it received me with quiet civility saw that i had a room and promised me a dinner in a few minutes while the latter was preparing having got rid of the dust i went out into the streets the lamps were just lighted and i went swiftly along the strand recalling objects at every step in this manner i passed at a rapid pace somerset house st clementsledane st marylestrand templebar bridgestreet ludgatehill pausing only before st pauls along the whole of this line i saw but little change a grand bridge waterloo with a noble approach to it had been thrown across the river just above somerset house but nearly everything else remained unaltered i believe my manner and the eagerness with which i gazed at longremembered objects attracted attention for i soon observed i was dogged around the church by a suspiciouslooking fellow he either suspected me of evil or attracted by my want of a london air he meditated evil himself knowing my own innocence i determined to bring the matter to an issue we were alone in a retired part of the place and first making sure that my watch wallet and handkerchief had not already disappeared i walked directly up to him and looked him intently in the face as if to recognize his features he took the hint and turning on his heels moved nimbly of it is surprising how soon an accustomed eye will distinguish a stranger in the streets of a large town on mentioning this circumstance next day to  he said that the londoners pretend to recognize a rustic air in a countess if she has been six months from town rusticity in such cases however must merely mean a little behind the fashions  i had suffered curiosity to draw me two miles from my dinner and was as glad to get back as just before i had been to run away from it still the past with the recollections which crowded on the mind bringing with them a flood of all sorts of associations prevented me from getting into a coach which would in a measure have excluded objects from my sight i went to bed that night with the strange sensation of being again in london after an interval of twenty years  the next day i set about the business which had brought me to the english capital most of our passengers were in town and we met as a matter of course i had calls from three or four americans established here some in one capacity and some in others for our country has long been giving back its increase to england in the shape of admirals generals judges artists writers and notionmongers but what is all this compared to the constant accessions of europeans among ourselves eight years later on returning home i found new york in feeling opinions desires apart from profit and i might almost say in population a foreign rather than american town  i had passed months in london when a boy and yet had no knowledge of westminster abbey i cannot account for this oversight for i was a great devotee of gothic architecture of which by the way i knew nothing except through the prints and i could not reproach myself with a want of proper curiosity on such subjects for i had devoted as much time to their examination as my duty to the ship would at all allow still all i could recall of the abbey was an indistinct image of two towers with a glimpse in at a great door now that i was master of my own movements one of my first acts was to hurry to the venerable church  westminster abbey is built in the form of a cross as is i believe invariably the case with every catholic church of any pretension at its northern end are two towers and at its southern is the celebrated chapel of henry vii this chapel is an addition which allowing for a vast difference in the scale resembles in its general appearance a school or vestryroom attached to the end of one of our own churches a gothic church is indeed seldom complete without such a chapel it is not an easy matter to impress an american with a proper idea of european architecture even while the edifice is before his eyes he is very apt to form an erroneous opinion of its comparative magnitude the proportions aid deception in the first place and absence uniformly exaggerates the beauty and extent of familiar objects none but those who have disciplined the eye and who have accustomed themselves to measure proportions by rules more definite than those of the fancy should trust to their judgments in descriptions of this sort  westminster itself is not large however in comparison with st pauls and an ordinary parish church called st margarets which must be i think quite as large as trinity new york and stands within a hundred yards of the abbey is but a pigmy compared with westminster i took a position in st margarets churchyard at a point where the whole of the eastern side of the edifice might be seen and for the first time in my life gazed upon a truly gothic structure of any magnitude it was near sunset and the light was peculiarly suited to the sombre architecture the material was a grey stone that time had rendered dull and which had broad shades of black about its angles and faces that of the chapel was fresher and of a warmer tint a change well suited to the greater delicacy of the ornaments  the principal building is in the severer style of the gothic without however being one of its best specimens it is comparatively plain nor are the proportions faultless the towers are twins are far from being high and to me they have since seemed to have a crowded appearance or to be too near each other a defect that sensibly lessens the grandeur of the north front a few feet more or less in such a case may carry the architect too much without or too much within the just proportions i lay claim to very little science on the subject but i have frequently observed since that to my own eye and the uninitiated can have no other criterion these towers as seen from the parks above the tops of the trees have a contracted and pinched air  but while the abbey church itself is as plain as almost any similar edifice i remember its great extent and the noble windows and doors rendered it to me deeply impressive on the other hand the chapel is an exquisite specimen of the most elaborated ornaments of the style all sorts of monstrosities have at one period or another been pressed into the service of the gothic such as lizards toads frogs serpents dragons spitfires and salamanders there is i believe some typical connexion between these offensive objects and the different sins when well carved properly placed and not viewed too near their effect is far from bad they help to give the edifice its fretted appearance or a look resembling that of lace various other features which have been taken from familiar objects such as parts of castellated buildings portcullises and armorial bearings help to make up the sum of the detail on henry the sevenths chapel toads lizards and the whole group of metaphorical sins are sufficiently numerous without being offensively apparent while miniature portcullises escutcheons and other ornaments give the whole the rich and imaginativealmost fairylike aspectwhich forms the distinctive feature of the most ornamented portions of the order you have seen ivory workboxes from the east that were cut and carved in a way to render them so very complicated delicate and beautiful that they please us without conveying any fixed forms to the mind it would be no great departure from literal truth were i to bid you fancy one of these boxes swelled to the dimensions of a church the material changed to stone and after a due allowance for a difference in form for the painted windows and for the emblems were i to add that such a box would probably give you the best idea of a highlywrought gothic edifice that any comparison of the sort can furnish  i stood gazing at the pile until i felt the sensation we term a creeping of the blood i know that westminster though remarkable for its chapel was by no means a firstrate specimen of its own style of architecture and at that moment a journey through europe promised to be a gradation of enjoyments each more exquisite than the other all the architecture of america united would not assemble a tithe of the grandeur the fanciful or of the beautiful a few imitations of grecian temples excepted that were to be seen in this single edifice if i were to enumerate the strong and excited feelings which are awakened by viewing novel objects i should place this short visit to the abbey as giving birth in me to sensation no 1 the emotion of a first landing in europe had long passed our recent landfall had been like any other landfall merely pleasant and i even looked upon st pauls as an old and a rather familiar friend this was absolutely my introduction to the gothic and it has proved to be an acquaintance pregnant of more satisfaction than any other it has been my good fortune to make since youth  it was too late to enter the church and i turned away towards the adjoining public buildings the english kings had a palace at westminster in the times of the plantagenets it was the ancient usage to assemble the parliament which was little more than a lit de justice previously to the struggle which terminated in the commonwealth in the royal residence and in this manner westminster palace became permanently the place for holding the meetings of these bodies the buildings ancient and modern form a cluster on the banks of the river and are separated from the abbey by a street i believe their site was once an island  westminster hall was built as the banqueting room of the palace there is no uniformity in the architecture of the pile which is exceedingly complicated and confused my examination at this time was too hurried for details and i shall refer you to a later visit to england for a description a vacant space at the abbey end of the palace is called old palaceyard which sufficiently indicates the locality of the ancient royal residence and a similar but larger space or square at the entrance to the hall is known as new palaceyard two sides of the latter are filled with the buildings of the pile namely the courts of law the principal part of the hall and certain houses that are occupied by some of the minor functionaries of the establishment with buildings to contain records etc the latter are mean and altogether unworthy of the neighbourhood they were plastered on the exterior and observing a hole in the mortar i approached and found to my surprise that here in the heart of the english capital as a part of the legislative and judicial structures in plain view and on the most frequented square of the vicinity were houses actually built of wood and covered with lath and mortar  the next morning i sent for a hairdresser as he entered the room i made him a sign without speaking to cut my hair i was reading the morning paper and my operator had got half through with his job without a syllable being exchanged between us when the man of the comb suddenly demanded what is the reason sir that the americans think everything in their own country so much better than it is everywhere else you will suppose that the brusquerie as well as the purport of this interrogatory occasioned some surprise how he knew i was an american at all i am unable to say but the fellow had been fidgeting the whole time to break out upon me with this question  i mention the anecdote in order to show you how lively and general the feeling of jealousy has got to be among our transatlantic kinsmen there will be a better occasion to speak of this hereafter  london was empty the fashionable streets were actually without a soul for minutes at a time and without seeing it i could not have believed that a town which at certain times is so crowded as actually to render crossing its streets hazardous was ever so like a mere wilderness of houses during these recesses in dissipation and fashion i believe that the meanest residents disappear for a few months  our fellowtraveller mr l however was in london and we passed a day or two in company as he is a votary of music he took me to hear madame pasta i was nearly as much struck with the extent and magnificence of the operahouse as i had been with the architecture of the abbey the brilliant manner in which it was lighted in particular excited my admiration for want of light is a decided and a prominent fault of all scenic exhibitions at home whether they are made in public or in private madame pasta played semiramide how do you like her demanded l at the close of the first act extremely i scarce know which to praise the most the command and the range of her voice or her powers as a mere actress but dont you think her exceedingly like the signorina the present madame malibran was then singing in new york under the name of signorina garcia l laughed and told me the remark was well enough but i had not put the question in exactly the proper form do you not think the signorina exceedingly like madame pasta would have been better i had got the matter wrong end foremost  l reminded me of our having amused ourselves on the passage with the nasal tones of the chorus at new york he now directed my attention to the same peculiarity here in this particular i saw no difference nor should there be any for i believe nearly all who are on the american stage in any character are foreigners and chiefly english  the next day we went to old drury where we found a countryman and townsman mr stephen price in the chair of sheridan the season was over but we were shown the whole of the interior it is also a magnificent structure in extent and internal embellishment though a very plain brick pile externally it must have eight or ten times the cubic contents of the largest american theatre the rival building covent garden is within a few hundred feet of it and has much more of architectural pretension though neither can lay claim to much the taste of the latter is very well but it is built of that pennysaving material stuccoed bricks  we dined with mr price and on the table was some of our own justlycelebrated madeira l who is an oracle on these subjects pronounced it injured he was told it was so lately arrived from new york that there had not been time to affect it this fact coupled with others that have since come to my knowledge induce me to believe that the change of tastes which is so often remarked in liquors fruits and other eatables is as much wrought on ourselves as in the muchabused viands those delicate organs which are necessary to this particular sense may readily undergo modifications by the varieties of temperature we know that taste and its sister sense smelling are both temporarily destroyed by colds the voice is signally affected by temperature in cold climates it is clear and soft in warm harsh and deep all these facts would serve to sustain the probability of the theory that a large portion of the strictures that are lavished on the products of different countries should be lavished on our own capricious organs au reste the consequence is much the same let the cause be what it will  mr m an englishman who has many business concerns with america came in while we were still at table and i quitted the house in his company it was still broad daylight as we were walking together arm and arm my companion suddenly placed a hand behind him and said my fine fellow you are there are you a lad of about seventeen had a hand in one of his pockets feeling for his handkerchief the case was perfectly clear for mr m had him still in his gripe when i saw them instead of showing apprehension or shame the fellow began to bluster and threaten my companion after a word or two of advice hurried me from the spot on expressing the surprise i felt at his permitting such a hardened rogue to go at large he said that our wisest course was to get away the lad was evidently supported by a gang and we might be beaten as well as robbed for our pains besides the handkerchief was not actually taken attendance in the courts was both expensive and vexatious and he would be bound over to prosecute in england the complainant is compelled to prosecute which is in effect a premium on crime we retain many of the absurdities of the common law and among others some which depend on a distinction between the intention and the commission of the act but i do not know that any of our states are so unjust as to punish a citizen in this way because he has already been the victim of a rogue  after all i am not so certain our law is much better but i believe more of the onus of obtaining justice falls on the injured party here than it does with us still we are both too much under the dominion of the common law  the next day i was looking at a bronze statue of achilles at hyde park corner which had been erected in honour of the duke of wellington the place like every other fashionable haunt at that season was comparatively deserted still there might have been fifty persons in sight stop him stop him cried a man who was chasing another directly towards me the chase to use nautical terms began to lighten ship by throwing overboard first one article and then another as these objects were cast in different directions he probably hoped that his pursuer like atalantis might stop to pick them up the last that appeared in the air was a hat when finding himself hemmed in between three of us the thief suffered himself to be taken a young man had been sleeping on the grass and this landpirate had absolutely succeeded in getting his shoes his handkerchief and his hat but an attempt to take off his cravat had awoke the sleeper in this case the prisoner was marched off under sundry severe threats of vengeance for the robbee was heated with the run and really looked so ridiculous that his anger was quite natural  my business was now done and i left london in a nightcoach for southampton the place of rendezvous was the white horse cellar in piccadillya spot almost as celebrated for those who are in transitu as was the isthmus of suez of old i took an inside seat this time for the convenience of a nap at first i had but a single fellowtraveller venturing to ask him the names of one or two objects that we passed and fearing he might think my curiosity impertinent i apologized for it by mentioning that i was a foreigner a foreigner he exclaimed why you speak english as well as i do myself i confess i had thought until that moment that the advantage in this particular was altogether on my side but it seems i was mistaken by way of relieving his mind however i told him i was an american an american and he seemed more puzzled than ever after a few minutes of meditation on what he had just heard he civilly pointed to a bit of meadow through which the thames meanders and goodnaturedly told me it was runnymeade i presume my manner denoted a proper interest for he now took up the subject of the english barons and entered into a long account of their modern magnificence and wealth this is a topic that a large class in england who only know their aristocracy by report usually discuss with great unction they appear to have the same pride in the superiority of their great families that the american slave is known to feel in the importance of his master i say this seriously and not with a view to sneer but to point out to you a state of feeling that at first struck me as very extraordinary i suppose that the feelings of both castes depend on a very natural principle the englishman however as he is better educated has one respectable feature in his deference he exults with reason in the superiority of his betters over the betters of most other people in this particular he is fully borne out by the fact subsequent observation has given me occasion to observe that the english gentleman in appearance attainments manliness and perhaps i might add principles although this and deportment are points on which i should speak with less confidence stands at the head of his class in christendom this should not be nor would it be were the gentlemen of america equal to their fortunes which unhappily they are not facts have so far preceded opinions at home as to leave but few minds capable of keeping in their company but this is a subject to which we may also have occasion to return  the coach stopped and we took up a third inside this man proved to be a radical he soon began to make sidehits at the nobility and gentry and mingled with some biting truths he uttered a vast deal of nonsense while he was in the midst of his denunciations the coach again stopped and one of the outsides was driven into it by the night air he was evidently a gentleman and the guard afterwards told me he was a captain somebody and a nephew of a lord something to whose country place he was going the appearance of the captain checked the radical for a little while but finding that the other was quiet he soon returned to the attack the aristocrat was silent and the admirer of aristocracy evidently thought himself too good to enter into a dispute with one of the mere people for to admire aristocracy was in his eyes something like an illustration but wincing under one of the others homepushes he said these opinions may do very well for this gentleman meaning me who as yet had not uttered a syllablewho is an american but i must say i think them out of place in the mouth of an englishman the radical regarded me a moment and inquired if what the other had just said was true i answered that it was he then began an eulogium on america which like his jeremiad on england had a good many truths blended with a great deal of nonsense at length he unfortunately referred to me to corroborate one of his most capital errors as this could not be done conscientiously for his theory depended on the material misconstruction of giving the whole legislative power to congress i was obliged to explain the mistake into which he had fallen the captain and the toady were both evidently pleased nor can i say i was sorry the appeal had been made for it had the effect of silencing a commentator who knew very little of his subject the captain manifested his satisfaction by commencing a conversation which lasted until we all went to sleep both the captain and the radical quitted us in the night  men like the one just described do the truth a great deal of harm their knowledge does not extend to first principles and they are always for maintaining their positions by a citation of facts one half of the latter are imagined and even that which is true is so enveloped with collateral absurdities that when pushed they are invariably exposed these are the travellers who come among us liberals and go back tories finding that things fall short of the political elysiums of their imaginations they fly into the opposite extreme as a sort of amende honorable to their own folly and ignorance  at the distance of a few miles from winchester we passed an encampment of gipsies by the wayside they were betterlooking than i had expected to see them though their faces were hardly perceptible in the grey of the morning they appeared well fed and very comfortably bivouacked why do not these people appear in america or do they come and get absorbed like all the rest by the humane and popular tendencies of the country what a homage will it be to the institutions if it be found that even a gipsy cease to be a gipsy in such a country just as the sun rose i got out to our lodgings and went to bed  after a sound sleep of two or three hours i rose and went to the drawingroom a lady was in it seated in a way to allow me to see no more than a small part of her sideface in that little i saw the countenance of your aunts family it was the sister whom we had never seen and who had hastened out of hertfordshire to meet us there are obvious reasons why such a subject cannot be treated in this letter but the study of two sisters who had been educated the one in england and the other in america who possessed so much in common and yet who were separated by so much that was not in common was to me a matter of singular interest it showed me at a glance the manner in which the distinctive moral and physical features of nations are formed the points of resemblance being just sufficient to render the points of difference more obvious  a new and nearer route to netley had been discovered during my absence and our unpractised americans had done little else than admire ruins for the past week the european who comes to america plunges into the virgin forest with wonder and delight while the american who goes to europe finds his greatest pleasure at first in hunting up the memorials of the past each is in quest of novelty and is burning with the desire to gaze at objects of which he has often read  the steamboat made but one or two voyages a week between southampton and havre and we were obliged to wait a day or two for the next trip the intervening time was passed in the manner just named every place of any importance in england has some work or other written on the subject of its history its beauties and its monuments it is lucky to escape a folio our works on southampton which are of moderate dimensions however spoke of some roman remains in the neighbourhood the spot was found and although the imagination was of greater use than common in following the authors description we stood on the spot with a species of antiquarian awe  southampton had formerly been a port of some importance many of the expeditions sent against france embarked here and the town had once been well fortified for the warfare of the period a good deal of the old wall remains all of this was industriously traced out while the bowwindows long passages and old maids found no favour in our eyes  one simple and touching memorial i well remember there is a ferry between the town and the grounds near netley abbey a lady had caught a cold which terminated in death in consequence of waiting on the shore during a storm for the arrival of a boat to protect others from a similar calamity she had ordered a very suitable defence against the weather to be built on the fatal spot and to be kept in repair for ever the structure is entirely of stone small and exceedingly simple and ingenious the ground plan is that of a greek cross on this foundation are reared four walls which of course cross each other in the centre at right angles a little above the height of a man the whole is amply roofed let the wind blow which way it will you perceive there is always shelter there is no external wall and the diameter of the whole does not exceed ten feet if it be as much this little work is exceedingly english and it is just as unlike anything american as possible it has its origin in benevolence is original in the idea and it is picturesque we might accomplish the benevolence but it would be of a more public character the picturesque is a thing of which we hardly know the meaning and as for the originality the dread of doing anything different from his neighbour would effectually prevent an american from erecting such a shelter even charity with us being subject to the control of the general voice on the other hand what a clever expedient would have been devised in the first instance in america to get across the ferry without taking cold all these little peculiarities have an intimate connexion with national character and national habits the desire to be independent and original causes a multitude of silly things to be invented here while the apprehension of doing anything different from those around them causes a multitude of silly things to be perpetuated in america and yet we are children of the same parents when profit is in view we have but one soul and that is certainly inventive enough but when money has been made and is to be spent we really do not seem to know how to set about it except by routine     letter iv  quit englandapproach to francehavreour reception therefemale commissionnaireclamour of drumsport of havreprojected enterprizeamerican

vernonrosnymantesbourbon magnificence approach to parisenter paris   to r cooper esq cooperstown  on quitting england we embarked from the very strand where henry v embarked for the fruitless field of agincourt a fearful rumour had gone abroad that the camilla the steamboat had been shorn of a wing and there were many rueful faces in the boat that took us off to the vessel in plainer speech one of the boilers was out of order and the passage was to be made with just half the usual propelling power at that season or indeed at any season the only probable consequence was loss of time with a strong headwind it is true the camilla might have been compelled to return but this might also have happened with the use of both the boilers  our adventurers did not see things in this light the division of employments which produces prices so cheap and good makes bad travellers our boats cargo embarked with fear and trembling and she has but one boiler passed from mouth to mouth amid ominous faces a bachelorlooking personage of about fifty with his person well swaddled in july declared in a loud voice that we were all going on board to be drowned this startled a who having full faith in my nautical experience asked what we were to think of it it was a mere question between ten hours and fifteen and so i told her the females who had just before been trembling with alarm brightened at this and two or three of them civilly thanked me for the information they had thus obtained incidentallyboat sir boat thank ee sir thank ee sir  we found two or three parties on board of a higher condition than common apprehension cast a shade over the cold marblelike polish of even the english aristocrat for if as mrs opie has well observed there is nothing so like a lord in a passion as a commoner in a passion your fear is also a sad leveller the boat was soon under way and gradually our cargo of mental apprehensions settled into the usual dolorous physical suffering of landsmen in rough water so much for excessive civilization the want of a boiler under similar circumstances would have excited no feeling whatever among a similar number of americans nineteen in twenty of whom thanks to their roughandtumble habits would know exactly what to think of it  i was seated during a part of the day near a group of young men who were conversing with a lady of some three or four and twenty they expressed their surprise at meeting her on board she told them it was a sudden whim that no one knew of her movements she meant only to be gone a fortnight to take a run into normandy in the course of the conversation i learned that she was single and had a maid and a footman with her in this guise she might go where she pleased whereas had she taken an escort in the american fashion her character would have suffered this usage however is english rather than european single women on the continent except in extraordinary cases are obliged to maintain far greater reserve even than with us and there single or married they cannot travel under the protection of any man who is not very nearly connected with them domestics and dependants excepted  the debates about proceeding at all had detained us so long and the one boiler proved to be so powerless that night set in and we had not yet made the coast of france the breeze had been fresh but it lulled towards sunset though not before we began to feel the influence of the tides about midnight however i heard some one exclaim land and we all hastened on deck to take a first look at france  the boat was running along beneath some cliffs the moon was shining bright and her rays lighted up the chalky sides of the high coast giving them a ghostly hue the towers of two lighthouses also glittered on a headland near by presently a long seawall became visible and rounding its end we shot into smooth water we entered the little port of havre between artificial works on one of which stands a low massive circular tower that tradition attributes to no less a personage than julius caesar  what a change in so short a time on the other side of the channel beyond the usual demands for employment which were made in a modest way and the eternal thankee sir there was a quiet in the people that was not entirely free from a suspicion of surliness here every man seemed to have two voices both of which he used as if with no other desire than to hear himself speak notwithstanding the hour which was past midnight the quay was well lined and a dozen officials poured on board the boat to prevent our landing customhouse officers gendarmes with enormous hats and female commissionaires were counteracting each other at every turn at length we were permitted to land being ordered up to a building near by here the females were taken into a separate room where their persons were examined by functionaries of their own sex for contraband goods this process has been described to me as being to the last degree offensive and humiliating my own person was respected i know not why for we were herded like sheep as we were without spot at least so far as smuggling was concerned we were soon liberated all our effects were left in the office and we were turned into the streets without even a rag but what we had on this was an inauspicious commencement for a country so polished and yet when one comes to look at the causes it is not easy to point out an alternative it was our own fault that we came so late  the streets were empty and the tall grey houses narrow avenues and the unaccustomed objects presented a strange spectacle by the placid light of the moon it appeared as if we had alighted in a different planet though fatigued and sleepy the whole party would involuntarily stop to admire some novelty and our march was straggling and irregular one house refused us after another and it soon became seriously a question whether the night was not to be passed in the open air p was less than three years old and as we had a regular gradation from that age upward our début in france promised to be anything but agreeable the guide said his resources were exhausted and hinted at the impossibility of getting in nothing but the inns was open and at all these we were refused at length i remembered that in poring over an english guidebook purchased in new york a certain hôtel dangleterre had been recommended as the best house in havre savezvous mon ami où est lhôtel dangleterrema fois oui cest tout près this ma fois oui was ominous and the cest tout près was more so still thither we went however and we were received then commenced the process of climbing we ascended several stories by a narrow crooked staircase and were shown into rooms on the fifth floor  the floors were of waxed tiles without carpets or mats and the furniture was tawdry we got into our beds which fatigue could scarcely render it possible to endure on account of the bugs a more infernal night i never passed and i have often thought since how hazardous it is to trust to first impressions this night and one or two more passed at havre and one other passed between rouen and paris were among the most uncomfortable i can remember and yet if i were to name a country in which one would be the most certain to get a good and a clean bed i think i should name france  the next morning i arose and went down the ladder for it was little better to the lower world the servant wished to know if we intended to use the table dhôte which he pronounced excellent curiosity induced me to look at the appliances it was a dark dirty and crowded room and yet not without certain savoury smells french cookery can even get the better of french dirt it was the only place about the house the kitchen excepted where a tolerable smell was to be found and i mounted to the upper regions in selfdefence  an hour or two afterwards the consul did me the favour to call i apologized for the necessity of causing him to clamber up so high it is not a misfortune here was the answer for the higher one is the purer is the atmosphere and he was right enough it was not necessary to explain that we were in an inferior house and certainly everything was extremely novel at breakfast however there was a sensible improvement the linen was white as snow we were served with silver forksit was a breakfast à la fourchettespotlessly clean napkins excellent rolls and delicious butter to say nothing of côtelettes that appeared to have been cooked by magic your aunt and myself looked at each other with ludicrous satisfaction when we came to taste coffee which happened to be precisely at the same instant it was the first time either of us had ever tasted french coffeeit would scarcely be exaggeration to say that either of us had ever tasted coffee at all i have had many french cooks since have lived years in the capital of france itself but i could never yet obtain a servant who understood the secret of making café au lait as it is made in most of the inns and cafés of that country the discrepancy between the excellence of the table and the abominations of the place struck them all so forcibly that the rest of the party did little else but talk about it as for myself i wished to do nothing but eat  i had now another specimen of national manners it was necessary to get our luggage through the customhouse the consul recommended a commissionnaire to help me you are not to be surprised he said laughing as he went away if i send you one in petticoats in a few minutes sure enough one of the beau sexe presented herself her name was désirée and an abler negotiator was never employed she scolded coaxed advised wrangled and uniformly triumphed the officers were more civil by daylight than we had found them under the influence of the moon and our business was soon effected  w had brought with him a spyglass it was old and of little value but it was an heirloom of the family it came from the hall at cn and had become historical for its service in detecting deer in the lake during the early years of the settlement this glass had disappeared no inquiry could recover it send for désirée said the consul désirée came received her orders and in half an hour the glass was restored there was an oversight in not getting a passport when we were about to quit havre the office hours were over and the steamboat could not wait were is désirée désirée was made acquainted with the difficulty and the passport was obtained désirée où est désirée cried some one in the crowd that had assembled to see the camilla start for england the day after our arrival here is an englishman who is too late to get his passport viséd said this person to désirée so near me that i heard it all the boat goes in ten minuteswhat is to be donema foiit is too late try ma bonneits a pity he should lose his passagevoici the englishman gave his fee désirée looked about her and then taking the idler by the arm she hurried him through the crowd this way and that way ending by putting him aboard without any passport at all it is too late to get one she said and they can but send you back he passed undetected france has a plenty of these managing females though désirée is one of the cleverest of them all i understood this woman had passed a year or two in england expressly to fit herself for her present occupation by learning the language  while engaged in taking our passages on board the steamboat for rouen some one called me by name in english the sound of the most familiar words in ones own language soon get to be startling in a foreign country i remember on returning to england after an absence of five years that it was more than a week before i could persuade myself i was not addressed whenever a passerby spoke suddenly on the present occasion i was called to by an old schoolboy acquaintance mr hr who was a consul in england but who had taken a house on what is called the côte a hillside just above ingouville a village at no great distance from the town we went out to his pretty little cottage which enjoyed a charming view indeed i should particularize this spot as the one which gave me the first idea of one species of distinctive european scenery the houses cling to the declivity rising above each other in a way that might literally enable one to toss a stone into his neighbours chimneytop they are of stone but being whitewashed and very numerous they give the whole mountainside the appearance of a pretty hamlet scattered without order in the midst of gardens italy abounds with such little scenes nor are they unfrequent in france especially in the vicinity of towns though whitened edifices are far from being the prevailing taste of that country  that evening we had an infernal clamour of drums in the principal street which happened to be our own there might have been fifty unaccompanied by any wind instrument the french do not use the fife and when one is treated to the drum it is generally in large potions and nothing but drum this is a relic of barbarism and is quite unworthy of a musical age there is more or less of it in all the garrisoned towns of europe you may imagine the satisfaction with which one listens to a hundred or two of these plaintive instruments beat between houses six or eight stories high in a narrow street and with desperate perseverance the object is to recall the troops to their quarters  havre is a tideharbour in america where there is on an average not more than five feet of rise and fall to the water of the sea such a haven would of course be impracticable for large vessels but the majority of the ports on the british channel are of this character and indeed a large portion of the harbours of great britain calais boulogne havre and dieppe are all inaccessible at low water the cliffs are broken by a large ravine a creek makes up the gorge or a small stream flows outward into the sea a basin is excavated the entrance is rendered safe by moles which project into deep water and the town is crowded around this semiartificial port as well as circumstances will allow such is more or less the history of them all havre however is in some measure an exception it stands on a plain that i should think had once been a marsh the cliffs are near it seaward and towards the interior there are fine receding hills leaving a sufficient site notwithstanding for a town of large dimensions  the port of havre has been much improved of late years large basins have been excavated and formed into regular wet docks they are nearly in the centre of the town the mole stretches out several hundred yards on that side of the entrance of the port which is next the sea here signals are regularly made to acquaint vessels in the offing with the precise number of feet that can be brought into the port these signals are changed at the rise or fall of every foot according to a graduated scale which is near the signal pole at dead low water the entrance to the harbour and the outer harbour itself are merely beds of soft mud machines are kept constantly at work to deepen them  the ship from sea makes the lights and judges of the state of the tide by the signals she rounds the molehead at the distance of fifty or sixty yards and sails along a passage too narrow to admit another vessel at the same moment into the harbour here she finds from eighteen to twenty or even twentyfour feet of water according to circumstances she is hauled up to the gates of a dock which are opened at high water only as the water falls one gate is shut and the entrance to the dock becomes a lock vessels can enter therefore as long as there remains sufficient water in the outer harbour for a ship to float if caught outside however she must lie in the mud until the ensuing tide  havre is the seaport of paris and is rapidly increasing in importance there is a project for connecting the latter with the sea by a ship channel such a project is hardly suited to the french impulses which imagine a thousand grand projects but hardly ever convert any of them to much practical good the opinions of the people are formed on habits of great saving and it requires older calculations greater familiarity with risks and more liberal notions of industry and possibly more capital than is commonly found in their enterprises to induce the people to encounter the extra charges of these improvements when they can have recourse to what in their eyes are simpler and safer means of making money the government employs men of science who conceive well but their conceptions are but indifferently sustained by the average practical intellect of the country in this particular france is the very converse of america  the project of making a seaport of paris is founded on a principle that is radically wrong it is easier to build a house on the seaside than to carry the sea into the interior but the political economy of france like that of nearly all the continental nations is based on a false principle that of forcing improvements the intellects of the mass should first be acted on and when the public mind is sufficiently improved to benefit by innovations the public sentiment might be trusted to decide the questions of locality and usefulness the french system looks to a concentration of everything in paris the political organization of the country favours such a scheme and in a project of this sort the interests of all the northern and western departments would be sacrificed to the interests of paris as for the departments east and south of paris they would in no degree be benefited by making a port of paris as goods would still have to be transshipped to reach them a system of canals and railroads is much wanted in france and most of all a system of general instruction to prepare the minds of the operatives to profit by such advantages when i say that we are behind our facts in america i do not mean in a physical but in a moral sense all that is visible and tangible is led by opinion in all that is purely moral the facts precede the notions of the people  i found at a later day many droll theories broached in france more especially in the chamber of deputies on the subject of our own great success in the useful enterprises as is usual in such cases any reason but the true one was given at the period of our arrival in europe the plan of connecting the great lakes with the atlantic had just been completed and the vast results were beginning to attract attention in europe at first it was thought as a matter of course that engineers from the old world had been employed this was disproved and it was shown that they who laid out the work however skilful they may have since become by practice were at first little more than common american surveyors then the trifling cost was a stumblingblock for labour was known to be far better paid in america than in europe and lastly the results created astonishment several deputies affirmed that the cause of the great success was owing to the fact that in america we trusted such things to private competition whereas in france the government meddled with everything but it was the state governments which indeed alone possess the necessary means and authority that had caused most of the american canals to be constructed these political economists knew too little of other systems to apply a clever saying of their ownil y a de la rochefoucald et de la rouchefoucald all governments do not wither what they touch  some americans have introduced steamboats on the rivers of france and on the lakes of switzerland and italy we embarked in one after passing two delectable nights at the hôtel dangleterre the boat was a fraillooking thing and so loaded with passengers that it appeared actually to stagger under its freight the seine has a wide mouth and a long groundswell was setting in from the channel our parisian cockneys of whom there were several on board stood aghast nous voici en pleine mer one muttered to the other and the annals of that eventful voyage are still related i make no question to admiring auditors in the interior of france the french make excellent seamen when properly trained but i think on the whole they are more thoroughly landsmen than any people of my acquaintance who possess a coast there has been too much sympathy with the army to permit the mariners to receive a proper share of the public favour  the boat shaped her course diagonally across the broad current directly for honfleur here we first began to get an idea of the true points of difference between our own scenery and that of the continent of europe and chiefly of that of france the general characteristics of england are not essentially different from those of america after allowing for a much higher finish in the former substituting hedges for fences and stripping the earth of its forests these you may think are in themselves grand points of difference but they fall far short of those which render the continent of europe altogether of a different nature of forest there is vastly more in france than in england but with few exceptions the fields are not separated by enclosures the houses are of stone or of wood roughcast honfleur as we approached had a grey distinctness that is difficult to describe the atmosphere seemed visible around the angles of the buildings as in certain flemish pictures bringing out the fine old sombre piles from the depth of the view in a way to leave little concealed while nothing was meretricious or gaudy at first though we found these hues imposing and even beautiful we thought the view would have been gayer and more agreeable had the tints been livelier but a little use taught us that our tastes had been corrupted on our return home every structure appeared flaring and tawdry even those of stone had a recent and mushroom air besides being in colours equally ill suited to architecture or a landscape the only thing of the sort in america which appeared venerable and of a suitable hue after an absence of eight years was our own family abode and this the despoiler paint had not defiled for near forty years  we discharged part of our cargo at honfleur but the boat was still greatly crowded fatigue and ill health rendered standing painful to a and all the benches were crowded she approached a young girl of about eighteen who occupied three chairs on one she was seated on another she had her feet and the third held her reticule apologizing for the liberty a asked leave to put the reticule on the second chair and to take the third for her own use this request was refused the selfishness created by sophistication and a factitious state of things renders such acts quite frequent for it is more my wish to offer you distinctive traits of character than exceptions this case of selfishness might have been a little stronger than usual it is true but similar acts are of daily occurrence out of society in france in society the utmost respect to the wants and feelings of others is paid vastly more than with us while with us it is scarcely too strong to say that such an instance of unfeeling selfishness could scarcely have occurred at all we may have occasion to inquire into the causes of this difference in national manners hereafter  the seine narrows at quilleboeuf about thirty miles from havre to the width of an ordinary european tide river on a high bluff we passed a ruin called tancarville which was formerly a castle of the de montmorencies this place was the cradle of one of williams barons and an english descendant i believe has been ennobled by the title of earl of tankerville  above quilleboeuf the river becomes exceedingly pretty it is crooked a charm in itself has many willowy islands and here and there a grey venerable town is seated in the opening of the high hills which contract the view with crumbling towers and walls that did good service in the times of the old english and french wars there were fewer seats than might have been expected though we passed three or four one near the waterside of some size was in the ancient french style with avenues cut in formal lines mutilated statues precise and treeless terraces and other elaborated monstrosities these places are not entirely without a pretension to magnificence but considered in reference to what is desirable in landscape gardening they are the very laid idéal of deformity after winding our way for eight or ten hours amid such scenes the towers of rouen came in view they had a dark ebonycoloured look which did great violence to our manhattanese notions but which harmonized gloriously with a bluish sky the grey walls beneath and a background of hanging fields  rouen is a seaport vessels of two hundred or two hundred and fifty tons burden lying at its quays here is also a customhouse and our baggage was again opened for examination this was done amid a great deal of noise and confusion and yet so cursorily as to be of no real service at havre landing as we did in the night and committing all to désirée the next day i escaped collision with subordinates but not having a servant i was now compelled to look after our effects in person w protested that we had fallen among barbarians what between brawls contests for the trunks cries oaths and snatching the scene was equally provoking and comic  without schooling without training of any sort little checked by morals pressed upon by society with nearly every necessary of life highly taxed and yet entirely loosened from the deference of feudal manners the frenchmen of this class have in general become what they who wish to ride upon their fellow mortals love to represent them as being truculent violent greedy of gain and but too much disposed to exaction there is great bonhomie and many touches of chivalry in the national character but it is asking too much to suppose that men who are placed in the situation i have named should not exhibit some of the most unpleasant traits of human infirmity our trunks were put into a handbarrow and wheeled by two men a few hundred yards the whole occupying half an hour of time for this service ten francs were demanded i offered five or double what would have been required by a drayman in new york a place where labour is proverbially dear this was disdainfully refused and i was threatened with the law of the latter i knew nothing but determined not to be bullied into what i felt persuaded was an imposition i threw down the five francs and walked away these fellows kept prowling about the hotel the whole day alternately wheedling and menacing without success towards night one of them appeared and returned the five francs saying that he gave me his services for nothing i thanked him and put the money in my pocket this fit of dignity lasted about five minutes when as finale i received a proposal to pay the money again and bring the matter to a close which was done accordingly  an englishman of the same class would have done his work in silence with a respect approaching to servility and with a system that any little contretems would derange he would ask enough take his money with a thank ee sir and go off looking as surly as if he were dissatisfied an american would do his work silently but independently as to mannerbut a fact will best illustrate the conduct of the american the day after we landed at newyork i returned to the ship for the light articles they made a troublesome load and filled a horsecart what do you think i ought to get for carrying this load sqire asked the cartman as he looked at the baskets umbrellas bandboxes valises secretaries trunks etc etc it is quite two miles to carroll place it is indeed what is your fare only thirtyseven and a half cents about two francs and it is justly worth seventyfive there is so much trumpery i will give you a dollar no more need be said sir you shall have everything safe i was so much struck with this straightforward manner of proceeding after all i had undergone in europe that i made a note of it the same day  the hôtel de leurope at rouen was not a firstrate inn for france but it effectually removed the disagreeable impression left by the hôtel dangleterre at havre we were well lodged well fed and otherwise well treated after ordering dinner all of a suitable age hurried off to the cathedral  rouen is an old and by no means a wellbuilt town some improvements along the river are on a large scale and promise well but the heart of the city is composed principally of houses of wooden frames with the interstices filled in with cement work of this kind is very common in all the northern provincial towns of france it gives a place a singular and not altogether an unpicturesque air the short dark studs that time has imbrowned forming a sort of visible ribs to the houses  when we reached the little square in front of the cathedral verily henry the sevenths chapel sunk into insignificance i can only compare the effect of the chiselling on the quaint gothic of this edifice to that of an enormous skreen of dark lace thrown into the form of a church this was the first building of the kind that my companions had ever seen and they had insomuch the advantage over me as i had in a degree taken off the edge of wonder by the visit already mentioned to westminster the first look at this pile was one of inextricable details it was not difficult to distinguish the vast and magnificent doors and the beautiful oriel windows buried as they were in ornament but an examination was absolutely necessary to trace the little towers pinnacles and the crowds of pointed arches amid such a scene of architectural confusion it is worth crossing the atlantic were it only to see this was the common feeling among us  it was some time before we discovered that divers dwellings had actually been built between the buttresses of the church for their comparative diminutiveness quaint style and close incorporation with the pile caused us to think them at first a part of the edifice itself this desecration of the gothic is of very frequent occurrence on the continent of europe taking its rise in the straitened limits of fortified towns the cupidity of churchmen and the general indifference to knowledge and consequently to taste which depressed the ages that immediately followed the construction of most of these cathedrals  we were less struck by the interior than by the exterior of this building it is vast has some fine windows and is purely gothic but after the richness of the external details the aisles and the choir appeared rather plain it possessed however in some of its monuments subjects of great interest to those who had never stood over a grave of more than two centuries and rarely even over one of half that age among other objects of this nature is the heart of coeur de lion for the church was commenced in the reign of one of his predecessors normandy at that time belonging to the english kings and claiming to be the depository of the lion heart  rouen has many more memorials of the past we visited the square in which joan of arc was burned a small irregular area in front of her prison the prison itself and the hall in which she had been condemned all these edifices are gothic quaint and some of them sufficiently dilapidated  i had forgotten to relate in its place a fact as an offset to the truculent garrulity of the porters we were shown round the cathedral by a respectablelooking old man in a red scarf a cocked hat and a livery one of the officers of the place he was respectful modest and well instructed in his tale the tone of this good old cicerone was so much superior to anything i had seen in englandin america such a functionary is nearly unknownthat under the influence of our national manners i had awkward doubts as to the propriety of offering him money at length the five francs rescued from the cupidity of the halfcivilized peasants of la basse normandie were put into his hand a look of indecision caused me to repent the indiscretion i thought his feelings had been wounded estce que monsieur compte me présenter tout ceci i told him i hoped he would do me the favour to accept it i had only given more than was usual and the honesty of the worthy cicerone hesitated about taking it to know when to pay and what to pay is a useful attainment of the experienced traveller  paris lay before us and although rouen is a venerable and historical town we were impatient to reach the french capital a carriage was procured and on the afternoon of the second day we proceeded  after quitting rouen the road runs for several miles at the foot of high hills and immediately on the banks of the seine at length we were compelled to climb the mountain which terminates near the city and offers one of the noblest views in france from a point called st catherines hill we did not obtain so fine a prospect from the road but the view far surpassed anything we had yet seen in europe putting my head out of the window when about half way up the ascent i saw an object booming down upon us at the rate of six or eight miles the hour that resembled in magnitude at least a moving house it was a diligence and being the first we had met it caused a general sensation in our party our heads were in each others way and finding it impossible to get a good view in any other manner we fairly alighted in the highway old and young to look at the monster unincumbered our admiration and eagerness caused as much amusement to the travellers it held as their extraordinary equipage gave rise to among us and two merrier parties did not encounter each other on the public road that day  a proper diligence is formed of a chariotbody and two coachbodies placed one before the other the first in front these are all on a large scale and the wheels and train are in proportion on the roof the three bodies are closely united is a cabriolet or covered seat and baggage is frequently piled there many feet in height a large leathern apron covers the latter an ordinary load of hay though wider is scarcely of more bulk than one of these vehicles which sometimes carries twentyfive or thirty passengers and two or three tons of luggage the usual team is composed of five horses two of which go on the pole and three on the lead the latter turning their heads outwards as w remarked so as to resemble a spread eagle notwithstanding the weight these carriages usually go down a hill faster than when travelling on the plain a bar of wood is brought by means of a winch that is controlled by a person called the conducteur one who has charge of both ship and cargo to bear on the hind wheels with a greater or less force according to circumstances so that all the pressure is taken off the wheel horses a similar invention has latterly been applied to railroad cars i have since gone over this very road with ten horses two on the wheel and eight in two lines on the lead on that occasion we came down this very hill at the rate of nine miles the hour  after amusing ourselves with the spectacle of the diligence we found the scenery too beautiful to reenter the carriage immediately and we walked to the top of the mountain the view from the summit was truly admirable the seine comes winding its way through a broad rich valley from the southward having just before run east and a league or two beyond due west our own susquehanna being less crooked the stream was not broad but its numerous isles willowy banks and verdant meadows formed a line for the eye to follow rouen in the distance with its ebony towers fantastic roofs and straggling suburbs lines its shores at a curvature where the stream swept away west again bearing craft of the sea on its bosom these dark old towers have a sombre mysterious air which harmonizes admirably with the recollections that crowd the mind at such a moment scarce an isolated dwelling was to be seen but the dense population is compressed into villages and bourgs that dot the view looking brown and teeming like the nests of wasps some of these places have still remains of walls and most of them are so compact and well defined that they appear more like vast castles than like the villages of england or america all are grey sombre and without glare rising from the background of pale verdure so many appropriate bas reliefs  the road was strewed with peasants of both sexes wending their way homeward from the market of rouen one a tawny woman with no other protection for her head than a high but perfectly clean cap was going past us driving an ass with the panniers loaded with manure we were about six miles from the town and the poor beast after staggering some eight or ten miles to the market in the morning was staggering back with this heavy freight at even i asked the woman who under the circumstances could not be a resident of one of the neighbouring villages the name of a considerable bourg that lay about a gunshot distant in plain view on the other side of the river monsieur je ne saurais pas vous dire parce que voyezvous je ne suis pas de ce payslà was the answer  knowledge is the parent of knowledge he who possesses most of the information of his age will not quietly submit to neglect its current acquisitions but will go on improving as long as means and opportunities offer while he who finds himself ignorant of most things is only too apt to shrink from a labour which becomes herculean in this manner ambition is stifled the mind gets to be inactive and finally sinks into unresisting apathy such is the case with a large portion of the european peasantry the multitude of objects that surround them becomes a reason of indifference and they pass from day to day for a whole life in full view of a town without sufficient curiosity in its history to inquire its name or if told by accident sufficient interest to remember it we see this principle exemplified daily in cities one seldom thinks of asking the name of a passerby though he may be seen constantly whereas in the country such objects being comparatively rare the stranger is not often permitted to appear without some question touching his character3  footnote 3 when in london two years later i saw a gentleman of rather striking appearance pass my door for two months five or six times of a morning remembering the apathy of the norman peasant i at length asked who it wassir francis burdett was the answer  i once inquired of a servant girl at a french inn who might be the owner of a chateau near by the gate of which was within a hundred feet of the house we were in she was unable to say urging as an apology that she had only been six weeks in her present place this too was in a small country hamlet i think every one must have remarked coeteris paribus how much more activity and curiosity of mind is displayed by a countryman who first visits a town than by the dweller in a city who first visits the country the first wishes to learn everything since be has been accustomed to understand everything he has hitherto seen while the last accustomed to a crowd of objects usually regards most of the novel things he now sees for the first time with indifference  the road for the rest of the afternoon led us over hills and plains from one reach of the river to another for we crossed the latter repeatedly before reaching paris the appearance of the country was extraordinary in our eyes isolated houses were rare but villages dotted the whole expanse no obtrusive colours but the eye had frequently to search against the hillside or in the valley and first detecting a mass it gradually took in the picturesque angles roofs towers and walls of the little bourg not a fence or visible boundary of any sort to mark the limits of possessions not a hoof in the fields grazing and occasionally a sweep of mountainland resembled a patterncard with its stripes of green and yellow and other hues the narrow fields of the small proprietors the play of light and shade on these gay upland patches though not strictly in conformity with the laws of taste certainly was attractive when they fell entirely into shadow the harvest being over and their gaudy colours lessened they resembled the melancholy and wasted vestiges of a festival  at louviers we dined and there we found a new object of wonder in the church it was of the gothic of the bourgs less elaborated and more rudely wrought than that of the larger towns but quaint and the population considered vast ugly dragons thrust out their grinning heads at us from the buttresses the most agreeable monstrosities imaginable were crawling along the grey old stones after passing this place the scenery lost a good deal of the pastoral appearance which renders normandy rather remarkable in france and took still more of the starched patterncard look just mentioned still it was sombre the villages were to be extracted by the eye from their setting of fields and here and there one of those silent fingers pointing to the skies raised itself into the air like a needle to prick the consciences of the thoughtless the dusky hues of all the villages contrasted oddly and not unpleasantly with the carnival colours of the grains  we slept at vernon and before retiring for the night passed half an hour in a fruitless attempt to carry by storm a large old circular tower that is imputed to the inexhaustible industry of caesar this was the third of his reputed works that we had seen since landing in france in this part of europe caesar has the credit of everything for which no one else is willing to apply as is the case with virgil at naples  it was a sensation to rise in the morning with the rational prospect of seeing paris for the first time in ones life before night in my catalogue it stands numbered as sensation the 5th westminster the night arrival in france and the cathedral of rouen giving birth to numbers 1 2 and 4 though accustomed to the tattoo and the evening bugle of a manofwar the drums of havre had the honour of number 3 alas how soon we cease to feel those agreeable excitements at all even a drum coming in time to pall on the ear  near vernon we passed a village which gave us the first idea of one feature in the old régime the place was grey sombre and picturesque as usual in the distance but crowded dirty inconvenient and mean when the eye got too near just without the limits of its nuisances stood the chateau a regular pile of hewn stone with formal allées abundance of windows extensive stables and broken vases the ancient seigneur probably retained no more of this ancient possession than its name while some monsieur le blanc or monsieur le noir filled his place in the house and personne dans la seigneurie  a few leagues farther brought us to an eminence whence we got a beautiful glimpse of the sweeping river and of a wide expanse of fertile country less formally striped and more picturesque than the preceding another grey castellated town lay on the verge of the river with towers that seemed even darker than ever how different was all this from the glare of our own objects as we wound round the brow of the height extensive parkgrounds a village more modern less picturesque and less dirty than common with a large chateau in red bricks was brought in sight in the valley this was rosny the place that gave his hereditary title to the celebrated sully as baron and marquis de rosny sully a man who like bacon almost deserves the character so justly given of the latter by pope that of the wisest greatest meanest of mankind the house and grounds were now the property of madame as it is the etiquette to term the duchesse de berri the town in the distance with the dark towers was mantes a place well known in the history of normandy we breakfasted at le cheval blanc the church drew us all out but it was less monstrous than that of louviers and as a cathedral unworthy to be named with those of the larger places  the next stage brought us to st germainenlaye or to the verge of the circle of low mountains that surround the plains of paris here we got within the influence of royal magnificence and the capital the bourbons down to the period of the revolution were indeed kings and they have left physical and moral impressions of their dynasty of seven hundred years that will require as long a period to eradicate nearly every foot of the entire semicircle of hills to the west of paris is historical and garnished by palaces pavilions forests parks aqueducts gardens or chases a carriage terrace of a mile in length and on a most magnificent scale in other respects overlooks the river at an elevation of several hundred feet above its bed the palace itself a quaint old edifice of the time of francis i who seems to have had an architecture not unlike that of elizabeth of england has long been abandoned as a royal abode i believe its last royal occupant was the dethroned james ii it is said to have been deserted by its owners because it commands a distant view of that silent monitor the sombre beautiful spire of st denis whose walls shadow the vaults of the bourbons they who sat on a throne not choosing to be thus constantly reminded of the time when they must descend to the common fate and crumbling equality of the grave  an aqueduct worthy of the romans gave an imposing idea of the scale on which these royal works were conducted it appeared at the distance of a league or two a vast succession of arches displaying a broader range of masonry than i had ever before seen so many years had passed since i was last in europe that i gazed in wonder at its vastness  from st germain we plunged into the valley and took our way towards paris by a broad paved avenue that was bordered with trees the road now began to show an approach to a capital being crowded with all sorts of uncouthlooking vehicles used as public conveyances still it was on a lilliputian scale as compared to london and semibarbarous even as compared to one of our towns marlylamachine was passed an hydraulic invention to force water up the mountains to supply the different princely dwellings of the neighbourhood then came a house of no great pretension buried in trees at the foot of the bill this was the celebrated consular abode malmaison after this we mounted to a hamlet and the road stretched away before us with the river between to the unfinished arc de lÉtoile or the barrier of the capital the evening was soft and there had been a passing shower as the mist drove away a mass rose like a glittering beacon beyond the nearest hill proclaiming paris it was the dome of the hotel of the invalids  though paris possesses better points of view from its immediate vicinity than most capitals it is little seen from any of its ordinary approaches until fairly entered we descended to the river by a gentle declivity the chateau and grounds of neuilly a private possession of the duke of orleans lay on our left the bois de boulogne the carriage promenade of the capital on our right we passed one of those abortions a magnificent village neuilly and ascended gently towards the unfinished arch of the star bending around this imposing memorial ofheaven knows what for it has had as many destinations as france has had governorswe entered the iron gate of the barrier and found ourselves within the walls of paris  we were in the avenue de neuilly the champs elysées without verdure a grove divided by the broad approach and moderately peopled by a welldressed crowd lay on each side in front at the distance of a mile was a mass of foliage that looked more like a rich copse in park than an embellishment of a town garden and above this again peered the pointed roofs of two or three large and high members of some vast structure sombre in colour and quaint in form they were the pavilions of the tuileries4 a line of hotels became visible through trees and shrubbery on the left and on the right we soon got evidence that we were again near the river we had just left it behind us and after a détour of several leagues here it was again flowing in our front cutting in twain the capital  footnote 4 tuileries is derived from tuile or tile the site of the present gardens having been a tileyard  objects now grew confused for they came fast we entered and crossed a paved area that lay between the seine the champs elysées the garden of the tuileries and two little palaces of extraordinary beauty of architecture this was the place where louis xvi and his unfortunate wife were beheaded passing between the two edifices last named we came upon the boulevards and plunged at once into the streetgaiety and movement of this remarkable town     letter v

napoleoncentralization   to r cooper esq cooperstown  we were not a fortnight in paris before we were quietly established en bourgeois in the faubourg st germain then followed the long and wearying toil of sightseeing happily our time was not limited and we took months for that which is usually performed in a few days this labour is connected with objects that description has already rendered familiar and i shall say nothing of them except as they may incidentally belong to such parts of my subject as i believe worthy to be noticed  paris was empty in the month of august 1826 the court was at st cloud the duchesse de berri at her favourite dieppe and the fashionable world was scattered abroad over the face of europe our own minister was at the baths of aix in savoy  one of the first things was to obtain precise and accurate ideas of the position and entourage of the place in addition to those enjoyed from its towers there are noble views of paris from montmartre and père lachaise the former has the best lookout and thither we proceeded this little mountain is entirely isolated forming no part of the exterior circle of heights which environ the town it lies north of the walls which cross its base the ascent is so steep as to require a winding road and the summit a table of a hundred acres is crowned by a crowded village a church and divers windmills there was formerly a convent or two and small countryhouses still cling to its sides buried in the shrubbery that clothe their terraces  we were fortunate in our sky which was well veiled in clouds and occasionally darkened by mists a bright sun may suit particular scenes and peculiar moods of the mind but every connoisseur in the beauties of nature will allow that as a rule clouds and very frequently a partial obscurity greatly aid a landscape this is yet more true of a birdseye view of a grey old mass of walls which give up their confused and dusky objects all the better for the absence of glare i love to study a place teeming with historical recollections under this light leaving the sites of memorable scenes to issue one by one out of the grey mass of gloom as time gives up its facts from the obscurity of ages  unlike english and american towns paris has scarcely any suburbs those parts which are called its faubourgs are in truth integral parts of the city and with the exception of a few clusters of winehouses and guinguettes which have collected near its gates to escape the city duties the continuity of houses ceases suddenly with the barrières and at the distance of half a mile from the latter one is as effectually in the country so far as the eye is concerned as if a hundred leagues in the provinces the unfenced meadows vineyards lucerne oats wheat and vegetables in many places literally reach the walls these walls are not intended for defence but are merely a financial enceinte created for offensive operations against the pockets of the inhabitants every town in france that has two thousand inhabitants is entitled to set up an octroi on its articles of consumption and something like four millions of dollars are taken annually at the gates of paris in duties on this internal trade it is merely the old expedient to tax the poor by laying impositions on food and necessaries  from the windmills of montmartre the day we ascended the eye took in the whole vast capital at a glance the domes sprung up through the mist like starling balloons and here and there the meandering stream threw back a gleam of silvery light enormous roofs denoted the sites of the palaces churches or theatres the summits of columns the crosses of the minor churches and the pyramids of pavilion tops seemed struggling to rear their heads from out the plain of edifices a better idea of the vastness of the principal structures was obtained here in one hour than could be got from the streets in a twelvemonth taking the roofs of the palace for instance the eye followed its field of slate and lead through a parallelogram for quite a mile the sheet of the french opera resembled a blue pond and the aisles of notre dame and st eustache with their slender ribs and massive buttresses towered so much above the lofty houses around them as to seem to stand on their ridges the church of st geneviève the pantheon of the revolution faced us on the swelling land of the opposite side of the town but surrounded still with crowded lines of dwellings the observatory limiting equally the view and the vast field of houses in that direction  owing to the state of the atmosphere and the varying light the picture before us was not that simply of a town but from the multiplicity and variety of its objects it was a vast and magnificent view i have frequently looked at paris since from the same spot or from its church towers when the strong sunlight reduced it to the appearance of confused glittering piles on which the eye almost refused to dwell but in a clouded day all the peculiarities stand out sombre and distinct resembling the grey accessories of the ordinary french landscape  from the town we turned to the heights which surround it east and southeast after crossing the seine the country lay in the wastelike unfenced fields which characterize the scenery of this part of europe roads stretched away in the direction of orleans marked by the usual lines of clipped and branchless trees more to the west commence the abrupt heights which washed by the river enclose nearly half the wide plain like an amphitheatre this has been the favourite region of the kings of france from the time of louis xiii down to the present day the palaces of versailles st germain st cloud and meudon all lie in this direction within short distances of the capital and the royal forests avenues and chases intersect it in every direction as mentioned before  farther north the hills rise to be low mountains though a wide and perfectly level plain spreads itself between the town and their bases varying in breadth from two to four leagues on the whole of this expanse of cultivated fields there was hardly such a thing as an isolated house though not literally true this fact was so nearly so as to render the effect oddly peculiar when one stood on the eastern extremity of montmartre where by turning southward he looked down upon the affluence and heard the din of a vast capital and by turning northward he beheld a country with all the appliances of rural life and dotted by grey villages two places however were in sight in this direction that might aspire to be termed towns one was st denis from time immemorial the buryingplace of the french kings and the other was montmorency the bourg which gives its name to or receives it from the illustrious family that is so styled for i am unable to say which is the fact the church spire of the former is one of the most beautiful objects in view from montmartre the church itself which was desecrated in the revolution having been restored by napoleon st denis is celebrated in the catholic annals by the fact of the martyr from whom the name is derived having walked after decapitation with his head under his arm all the way from paris to this very spot  montmorency is a town of no great size or importance but lying on the side of a respectable mountain in a way to give the spectator more than a profile it appears to be larger than it actually is this place is scarcely distinguishable from paris under the ordinary light but on a day like that which we had chosen it stood out in fine relief from the surrounding fields even the grey mass of its church being plainly visible if paris is so beautiful and striking when seen from the surrounding heights there are many singularly fine pictures in the bosom of the place itself we rarely crossed the pont royal during the first month or two of our residence without stopping the carriage to gaze at the two remarkable views it offers one is up the reach of the seine which stretches through the heart of the town separated by the island and the other in an opposite direction looks down the reach by which the stream flows into the meadows on its way to the sea the first is a look into the avenues of a large town the eye resting on the quaint outlines and endless mazes of walls towers and roofs while the last is a prospect in which the front of the picture is a collection of some of the finest objects of a high state of civilization and the background a beautiful termination of wooded and decorated heights  at first one who is accustomed to the forms and movements of a seaport feels a little disappointment at seeing a river that bears nothing but dingy barges loaded with charcoal and winecasks the magnificence of the quays seems disproportioned to the trifling character of the commerce they are destined to receive but familiarity with the town soon changes all these notions and while we admit that paris is altogether secondary so far as trade is concerned we come to feel the magnificence of her public works and to find something that is pleasing and picturesque even in her huge and unwieldy wood and coal barges trade is a good thing in its way but its agents rarely contribute to the taste learning manners or morals of a nation  the sight of the different interesting objects that encircle paris stimulated our curiosity to nearer views and we proceeded immediately to visit the environs these little excursions occupied more than a month and they not only made us familiar with the adjacent country but by compelling us to pass out at nearly every one of the twenty or thirty different gates or barriers as they are called with a large portion of the town also this capital has been too often described to render any further account of the principal objects necessary and in speaking of it i shall endeavour to confine my remarks to things that i think may still interest you by their novelty  the royal residences in paris at this time are strictly speaking but twothe tuileries and the palais royal the louvre is connected with the first and it has no finished apartments that are occupied by any of princely rank most of its better rooms being unfinished and are occupied as cabinets or museums a small palace called the elysée bourbon is fitted up as a residence for the heir presumptive the duc de bordeaux but though it contains his princely toys such as miniature batteries of artillery etc he is much too young to maintain a separate establishment this little scion of royalty only completed his seventh year not long after our arrival in france on which occasion one of those silly ceremonies which some of the present age appear to think inseparable from sound principles was observed the child was solemnly and formally transferred from the care of the women to that of the men up to this period madame la vicomtesse de gontautbiron had been his governess and she now resigned her charge into the hands of the baron de damas who had lately been minister of foreign affairs madame de gontaut was raised to the rank of duchess on the occasion the boy himself is said to have passed from the hands of the one party to those of the other in presence of the whole court absolutely naked some such absurdity was observed at the reception of marie antoinette it being a part of regal etiquette that a royal bride on entering france should leave her old wardrobe even to the last garment behind her you will be amused to hear that there are people in europe who still attach great importance to a rigid adherence to all the old etiquette at similar ceremonies these are the men who believe it to be essential that judges and advocates should wear wigs in an age when their use being rejected by the rest of the world their presence cannot fail if it excite any feeling to excite that of inconvenience and absurdity there is such a thing as leaving society too naked i admit but a chemise at least could not have injured the little duke of bordeaux at this ceremony whenever a usage that is poetical in itself and which awakens a sentiment without doing violence to decency or comfort or common sense can be preserved i would rigidly adhere to it if it were only for antiquitys sake but surely it would be far more rational for judges to wear false beards because formerly bacon and coke did not shave their chins than it is for a magistrate to appear on the bench with a cumbrous hot and inconvenient cloud of powdered flax or whatever may be the material on his poll because our ancestors a century or two since were so silly as to violate nature in the same extraordinary manner  speaking of the duke of bordeaux reminds me of an odd and indeed in some degree a painful scene of which i was accidentally a witness a short time before the ceremony just mentioned the émigrés have brought back with them into france a taste for horseracing and supported by a few of the english who are here there are regular races spring and autumn in the champs de mars the course is one of the finest imaginable being more than a mile in circumference and surrounded by mounds of earth raised expressly with that object which permit the spectators to overlook the entire field the result is a species of amphitheatric arena in which any of the dramatic exhibitions that are so pleasing to this spectacleloving nation may be enacted pavilions are permanently erected at the startingpost and one or two of these are usually fitted up for the use of the court whenever it is the pleasure of the royal family to attend as was the case at the time the little occurrence i am about to relate took place  on this occasion charles x came in royal state from st cloud accompanied by detachments of his guards many carriages several of which were drawn by eight horses and a cloud of mounted footmen most of the dignitaries of the kingdom were present in the different pavilions or stands and nearly or quite all the ministers together with the whole diplomatic corps there could not have been less than a hundred thousand spectators on the mounds  the racing itself was no great matter being neither within time nor well contested the horses were all french the trial being intended for the encouragement of the french breeders and the sports were yet too recent to have produced much influence on the stock of the country during the heats accompanied by a young american friend i had strolled among the royal equipages in order to examine their magnificence and returning towards the course we came out unexpectedly at a little open space immediately at one end of the pavilion in which the royal family was seated there were not a dozen people near us and one of these was a sturdy englishman evidently a tradesman who betrayed a keen and a truly national desire to get a look at the king the head of a little girl was just visible above the side of the pavilion and my companion who by a singular accident not long before had been thrown into company with les enfans de france as the royal children are called informed me that it was mademoiselle dartois the sister of the heir presumptive he had given me a favourable account of the children whom he represented as both lively and intelligent and i changed my position a little to get a better look of the face of this little personage who was not twenty feet from the spot where we stood my movement attracted her attention and after looking down a moment into the small area in which we were enclosed she disappeared presently a lady looked over the balustrade and our englishman seemed to be on tenterhooks some thirty or forty french gathered round us immediately and i presume it was thought none but loyal subjects could manifest so much desire to gaze at the family especially as one or two of the french clapped the little princess whose head now appeared and disappeared again as if she were earnestly pressing something on the attention of those within the pavilion in a moment the form of a pale and sicklylooking boy was seen the little girl who was a year or two older keeping her place at his side the boy was raised on the knee of a melancholylooking and rather hardfeatured female of fifty who removed his straw hat in order to salute us these are the dauphine and the duc de bordeaux whispered my companion who knew the person of the former by sight the dauphine looked anxiously and i thought mournfully at the little cluster we formed directly before her as if waiting to observe in what manner her nephew would be received of course my friend and myself who were in the foreground stood uncovered as gentlemen we could not do less nor as foreign gentlemen could we very well do more not a frenchman however even touched his hat on the other hand the englishman straddled his legs gave a wide sweep with his beaver and uttered as hearty a hurrah as if he had been cheering a member of parliament who gave gin in his beer the effect of this single unaccompanied unanswered cheer was both ludicrous and painful the poor fellow himself seemed startled at hearing his own voice amid so profound a stillness and checking his zeal as unexpectedly as he had commenced its exhibition he looked furiously around him and walked surlily away the dauphine followed him with her eyes there was no mistaking his gaitered limbs dogged mien and florid countenance be clearly was not french and those that were as clearly turned his enthusiasm into ridicule i felt sorry for her as with a saddened face she set down the boy and withdrew her own head within the covering of the pavilion the little mademoiselle dartois kept her bright looks in a sort of wonder on us until the circumspection of those around her gave her a hint to disappear  this was the first direct and near view i got of the true state of popular feeling in paris towards the reigning family according to the journals in the interest of the court enthusiasm was invariably exhibited whenever any of their princes appeared in public but the journals in every country our own dear and shrewd republic not excepted are very unsafe guides for those who desire truth  i am told that the style of this court has been materially altered and perhaps improved by the impetuous character of napoleon the king rarely appears in public with less than eight horses which are usually in a foam his liveries are not showy neither are the carriages as neat and elegant as one would expect the former are blue and white with a few slight ornaments of white and red lace and the vehicles are showy large and even magnificent but i think without good taste you will be surprised to hear that he drives with what in america we call dutch collars six of the horses are held in hand and the leaders are managed by a postilion there is always one or more empty carriages according to the number of the royal personages present equipped in every respect like those which are filled and which are held in reserve against accidents a provision by the way that is not at all unreasonable in those who scamper over the broken pavements in and about paris as fast as leg can be put to the ground  notwithstanding the present magnificence of the court royalty is shorn of much of its splendour in france since the days of louis xvi then a city of a hundred thousand souls versailles was a mere dependant of the crown lodgings for many hundred abbés it is said were provided in the palace alone and a simple representation at the palace opera cost a fortune  it is not an easy matter to come at the real cost of the kingly office in this country all the expenditures of the european governments being mystified in such a way as to require a very intimate knowledge of the details to give a perfectly clear account of them but so far as i have been able to ascertain the charges that arise from this feature of the system do not fall much short if indeed they do any of eight millions of dollars annually out of this sum however the king pays the extra allowances of his guards the war office taking the same view of all classes of soldiers after distinguishing between foot and cavalry you will get an idea of the luxury of royalty by a short account of the gardes du corps these troops are all officers the privates having the rank and receiving the pay of lieutenants their duty as the name implies is to have the royal person in their especial care and there is always a guard of them in an antechamber of the royal apartments they are heavy cavalry and when they mount guard in the palaces their arm is a carabine a party of them always appear near the carriage of the king or indeed near that of any of the reigning branch of the family there are said to be four regiments or companies of them of four hundred men each but it strikes me the number must be exaggerated i should think however that there are fully a thousand of them in addition to these selected troops there are three hundred swiss of the swiss and royal guards of the latter including all arms there must be many thousands these are the troops that usually mount guard in and about all the palaces the annual budget of france appears in the estimates at about a milliard or a thousand millions of francs but the usual mystifications are resorted to and the truth will give the annual central expenses of the country at not less i think than two hundred millions of dollars this sum however covers many items of expenditure that we are accustomed to consider purely local the clergy for instance are paid out of it as is a portion of the cost of maintaining the roads on the other hand much money is collected as a general regulation that does not appear in the budget few or no churches are built and there are charges for masses interments christenings and fees for a hundred things of which no account is taken in making out the sum total of the cost of government  it was the policy of napoleon to create a system of centralization that should cause everything to emanate from himself the whole organization of government had this end in view and all the details of the departments have been framed expressly to further this object the prefects are no more than so many political aides whose duty it is to carry into effect the orders that emanate from the great head and lines of telegraphs are established all over france in such a way that a communication may be sent from the tuileries to the remotest corner of the kingdom in the course of a few hours it has been said that one of the first steps towards effecting a revolution ought to be to seize the telegraphs at paris by means of which such information and orders could be sent into the provinces as the emergency might seem to require  this system of centralization has almost neutralized the advancement of the nation in a knowledge of the usages and objects of the political liberty that the french have obtained by bitter experience from other sources it is the constant aim of that portion of the community which understands the action of free institutions to increase the powers of the municipalities and to lessen the functions of the central government but their efforts are resisted with a jealous distrust of everything like popular dictation their municipal privileges are rightly enough thought to be the entering wedges of real liberty the people ought to manage their own affairs just as far as they can do so without sacrificing their interests for want of a proper care and here is the starting point of representation so far from france enjoying such a system however half the time a bell cannot be hung in a parish church or a bridge repaired without communications with

york  i quitted america with some twenty letters of introduction that had been pressed upon me by different friends but which were carefully locked up in a secretary where they still remain and are likely to remain for ever or until they are destroyed as this may appear a singular resolution for one who left his own country to be absent for years i shall endeavour to explain it in the first place i have a strong repugnance to pushing myself on the acquaintance of any man this feeling may in fact proceed from pride but i have a disposition to believe that it proceeds in part also from a better motive these letters of introduction like verbal introductions are so much abused in america that the latter feeling perhaps i might say both feelings are increased by the fact of all the people in the world we are the most prodigal of these favours when selfrespect and propriety would teach us we ought to be among the most reserved simply because the character of the nation is so low that the european more than half the time fancies he is condescending when he bestows attentions on our people at all other travellers may give you a different account of the matter but let every one be responsible for his own opinions and facts then a friend who just as we left home returned from europe after an absence of five years assured me that he found his letters of but little use that nearly every agreeable acquaintance he made was the result of accident and that the europeans in general were much more cautious in giving and receiving letters of this nature than ourselves  the usages of all europe those of the english excepted differ from our own on the subject of visits there the stranger or the latest arrival is expected to make the first visit and an inquiry for your address is always taken for an intimation that your acquaintance would be acceptable many perhaps most americans lose a great deal through their provincial breeding in this respect in waiting for attentions that it is their duty to invite by putting themselves in the way of receiving them the european usage is not only the most rational but it is the most delicate it is the most rational as there is a manifest absurdity in supposing for instance that the inhabitant of a town is to know whenever a visitor from the country arrives and it is the most delicate as it leaves the newcomer who is supposed to know his own wishes best to decide for himself whether he wishes to make acquaintances or not in short our own practices are provincial and rustic and cannot exist when the society of the country shall have taken the usual phases of an advanced civilization even in england in the higher classes the cases of distinguished men excepted it is usual for the stranger to seek the introduction  under such circumstances coupled with the utter insignificance of an ordinary individual in a town like paris you will easily understand that we had the first months of our residence entirely to ourselves as a matter of course we called on our own minister and his wife and as a matter of course we have been included in the dinners and parties that they are accustomed to give at this season of the year this however has merely brought us in contact with a chancemedley of our own countrymen these diplomatic entertainments being quite obviously a matter of accident so far as the set is concerned the dinners of your banker however are still worse since with them the visitinglist is usually a mere extract from the ledger  our privacy has not been without its advantages it has enabled us to visit all the visible objects without the incumbrance of engagements and given me leisure to note and to comment on things that might otherwise have been overlooked for several months we have had nothing to do but to see sights get familiarized with a situation that at first we found singularly novel and to brush up our french  i never had sufficient faith in the popular accounts of the usages of other countries to believe onehalf of what i have heard i distrusted from the first the fact of ladiesi mean real bona fide ladies women of sentiment delicacy taste and conditionfrequenting public eatinghouses and habitually living without the retirement and reserve that is so necessary to all women not to say men of the caste i found it difficult therefore to imagine i should meet with many females of condition in restaurans and cafés such a thing might happen on an emergency but it was assailing too much all those feelings and tastes which become inherent in refinement to suppose that the tables of even the best house of the sort in paris could be honoured by the presence of such persons except under particular circumstances my own observation corroborated this opinion and in order to make sure of the fact i have put the question to nearly every frenchwoman of rank it has since been my good fortune to become sufficiently acquainted with to take the liberty the answer has been uniform such things are sometimes done but rarely and even then it is usual to have the service in a private room one old lady a woman perfectly competent to decide on such a point told me franklywe never do it except by way of a frolic or when in a humour which induces people to do many other silly and unbecoming things why should we go to the restaurateurs to eat we have our own houses and servants as well as the english or even you americansit may be supposed i laughedand certainly the french are not so devoid of good taste as not to understand that the mixed society of a publichouse is not the best possible company for a woman  it is moreover a great mistake to imagine that the french are not hospitable and that they do not entertain as freely and as often as any other people the only difference between them and the english in this respect or between them and ourselves is in the better taste and ease which regulate their intercourse of this nature while there is a great deal of true elegance there is no fuss at a french entertainment and all that you have heard of the superiority of the kitchen in this country is certainly true society is divided into castes in paris as it is everywhere else and the degrees of elegance and refinement increase as one ascends as a matter of course but there is less of effort in every class than is usual with us one of the bestbred englishmen of my acquaintance and one too who had long been in the world has frankly admitted to me that the highest tone of english society is merely an imitation of that which existed in paris previously to the revolution and of which though modified as to usages and forms a good deal still remains by the highest tone however you are not to suppose i mean that laboured frigid heartless manner that so many in england especially mistake for high breeding merely because they do not know how to unite with the finish which constant intercourse with the world creates the graceful semblance of living less for ones self than for others and to express as it were their feelings and wishes rather than to permit ones own to escape hima habit that like the reflection of a mirror produces the truest and most pleasing images when thrown back from surfaces the most highly polished but i am anticipating rather than giving you a history of what i have seen  in consequence of our not having brought any letters as has just been mentioned and of not having sought society no one gave themselves any trouble on our account for the first three or four months of our residence in paris at the end of that period however i made my début at probably as brilliant an entertainment as one usually sees here in the course of a whole winter mr canning then secretary of state for foreign affairs came to paris on a visit and as is usual on such occasions diplomacy was a good deal mixed up with eating and drinking report says that the etiquette of the court was a good deal deranged by this visit the bourbons not having adopted the halefellow hospitality of the english kings m de villèle or m de damas would be invited to dine at windsor almost as a matter of course but the descendant of hugh capet hesitated about breaking bread with an english commoner the matter is understood to have been gotten over by giving the entertainment at st cloud where it would seem the royal person has fewer immunities than at the tuileries but among other attentions that were bestowed on the english statesman mr brown determined to give him a great diplomatic dinner and our own legations having a great poverty of subordinates except in the way of travelling attachés i was invited to occupy one end of the table while the regular secretary took his seat at the other before i attempt a short description of this entertainment it may help to enliven the solitude of your mountain residence and serve to give you more distinct ideas of the matter than can be obtained from novels if i commence with a summary of the appliances and modes of polite intercourse in this part of the world as they are to be distinguished from our own  in the first place you are to discard from your mind all images of two rooms and foldingdoors with a passage six feet wide a narrow carpeted flight of steps and a bedroom prepared for the ladies to uncloak in and another in which the men can brush their hair and hide their hats some such snuggeries very possibly exist in england among the middling classes but i believe all over the continent of europe style is never attempted without more suitable means to carry out the intention  in paris every one who mingles with the world lives in an hotel or a house that has a court and an outer gate usually the building surrounds three sides of this court and sometimes the whole four though small hotels are to be found in which the court is encircled on two or even on three of its sides merely by high walls the gate is always in the keeping of a regular porter who is an important personage about the establishment taking in letters tickets etc ejecting blackguards and all other suspicious persons carrying messages besides levying contributions on all the inmates of the house in the way of wood and coal in short he is in some measure held to be responsible for the exits and entrances being a sort of domestic gendarme in the larger hotels there are two courts the great and la basse cour the latter being connected with the offices and stables  of course these hotels vary in size and magnificence some are not larger than our own largest town dwellings while others again are palaces as these buildings were originally constructed to lodge a single establishment they have their principal and their inferior apartments some have their summer and their winter apartments as is and always must be the case where everything like state and magnificence are affected the receptionrooms are en suite the mode of building which prevails in america being derived from the secondary class of english houses it is true that in london many men of rank perhaps of the nobility do not live in houses any larger or much better than the best of our own though i think that one oftener sees rooms of a good size and proper elevation even in these dwellings than it is usual to see in america but the great houses of london such as burlingtonhouse northumberlandhouse devonshirehouse lansdownhouse sutherlandhouse the most magnificent of all etc are more or less on the continental plan though not generally built around courts this plan eschews passages of all descriptions except among the private parts of the dwelling in this respect an american house is the very opposite of a european house we are nothing without passages it being indispensable that every room should open on one whereas here the great point is to have as little to do with them as possible thus you quit the great staircase by a principal door and find yourself in an antechamber this communicates with one or two more rooms of the same character gradually improving in ornaments and fixtures until you enter a salon then comes a succession of apartments of greater or less magnificence according to circumstances until you are led entirely round the edifice quitting it by a door on the great staircase again opposite to the one by which you entered in those cases in which there are courts the principal rooms are ranged in this manner en suite on the exterior range usually looking out on the gardens while those within them which look into the court contain the bedrooms boudoir eatingrooms and perhaps the library so tenacious are those who lay any claim to gentility here of the use of the antechambers that i scarcely recollect a lodging of any sort beyond the solitary chamber of some student without at least one they seem indispensable and i think rightly to all ideas of style or even of comfort i remember to have seen an amusing instance of the strength of this feeling in the case of the wife of a former french minister at washington the building she inhabited was one of the ordinary american double houses as they are called with a passage through the centre the stairs in the passage and a short corridor to communicate with the bedrooms above off the end of this upper corridor if indeed so short a transverse passage deserves the name was partitioned a room of some eight feet by ten as a bedroom a room adjoining this was converted into a boudoir and bedroom for madame de  by means of a silk screen the usual door of the latter opened of course on the passage in a morning call one day i was received in the boudoir surprised to be carried up stairs on such an occasion i was still more so to find myself taken through a small room before i was admitted to the larger the amount of it all was that madame de  accustomed to have many rooms and to think it vulgar to receive in her great drawingroom of a morning believing au premier or up one pair of stairs more genteel than the rez de chaussée or the ground floor and feeling the necessity of an antechamber as there was an abruptness in being at once admitted into the presence of a lady from a staircase a sort of local brusquerie that would suit her cook better than the wife of an envoy extraordinary had contrived to introduce her guests through the little bedroom at the end of the upstairs entry  from all this you will be prepared to understand some of the essential differences between a reception in paris and one at new york or even at washington the footman or footmen if there are two ascend to the inner antechamber with their masters and mistresses where they receive the cloaks shawls overcoats or whatever else has been used for the sake of mere warmth and withdraw if they are sent home as is usually the case at dinners and evening parties they return with the things at the hour ordered but if the call be merely a passing one or the guest means to go early to some other house they either wait in the antechamber or in a room provided for that purpose the french are kind to their servants much kinder than either the english or their humble imitators ourselves and it is quite common to see not only a good warm room but refreshments provided for the servants at a french party in england they either crowd the narrow passages and the doorway or throng the street as with us in both countries the poor coachmen sit for hours on their carriageboxes like so many ducks in the drizzle and rain  the footman gives the names of his party to the maître dhôtel or the groom of the chambers who as he throws open the door of the first drawingroom announces them in a loud voice announcing by means of a line of servants is rarely if ever practised in france though it is still done in england at large parties and in the great houses every one has heard the story of the attempt at philadelphia some forty years ago to introduce the latter custom when by the awkwardness of a servant a party was announced as master and mistress and the young ladies but you will smile when i tell you that the latter part of this style is precisely that which is most in vogue at paris a young lady here may be admired she may be danced with and she may even look and be looked at but in society she talks little is never loud or belleish is always neat and simple in her attire using very little jewelry and has scarcely any other name than mademoiselle the usual mode of announcing is monsieur le comte et madame la comtesse dune telle avec leurs demoiselles or in plain english the count and countess suchaone with their daughters this you will perceive is not so far after all from master and mistress and the young ladies the english more simple in some respects and less so in others usually give every name though in the use of titles the utmost good taste is observed thus every nobleman below a duke is almost uniformly addressed and styled lord a lord b etc and their wives ladies a and b thus the marquess of lansdowne would i think always be addressed and spoken of and even announced merely as lord lansdowne this you will observe is using the simplest possible style and it appears to me that there is rather an affectation of simplicity in their ordinary intercourse the term my lord being hardly ever used except by the tradesmen and domestics the safest rule for an american and certainly the one that good taste would dictate is to be very sparing in his use of everything of this sort since he cannot be always certain of the proper usages of the different countries he visits and so long as he avoids unnecessary affectations of republicanisms and if a gentleman this he will do without any effort simplicity is his cue when i say avoids the affectations of republicanisms i do not mean the points connected with principles but those vulgar and underbred pretensions of ultra equality and liberalism which while they mark neither manliness nor a real appreciation of equal rights almost uniformly betray a want of proper training and great ignorance of the world whenever however any attempt is made to identify equality of rights and democratical institutions with vulgarity and truculency as is sometimes attempted here in the presence of americans and even in good company it is the part of every gentleman of our country to improve the opportunity that is thus afforded him to show it is a source of pride with him to belong to a nation in which a hundred men are not depressed politically in order that one may be great and also to show how much advantage after all he who is right in substance has over him who is substantially wrong even in the forms of society and in that true politeness which depends on natural justice such a principle acted on systematically would soon place the gentlemen of america where they ought to be and the gentlemen of other countries where sooner or later they must be content to descend or to change their systems that these things are not so must be ascribed to our provincial habits our remote situation comparative insignificance and chiefly to the circumstance that mens minds trained under a different state of things cannot keep even pace with the wonderful progress of the facts of the country  but all this time i have only got you into the outer salon of a french hotel in order that we may proceed more regularly we will return to the dinner given by our minister to mr canning mr brown has an apartment in the hotel monaco one of the best houses in paris the prince of monaco is the sovereign of a little territory of the same name on the gulf of nice at the foot of the maritime alps his states may be some six or eight miles square and the population some six or eight thousand the ancient name of the family is grimaldi but by some intermarriage or other the duke of valentinois a frenchman has become the prince this little state is still independent though under the especial protection of the king of sardinia and without foreign relations it was formerly a common thing for the petty princes of europe to own hotels at paris thus the present hotel of the legion of honour was built by a prince of salms and the princes of monaco had two one of which is occupied by the austrian ambassador and in the other our own minister just at this moment has an apartment as i had been pressed especially to be early i went a little before six and finding no one in the drawingroom i strolled into the bureau where i found mr shelden the secretary of legation who lived in the family dressed for dinner we chatted a little and on my admiring the magnificence of the rooms he gave me the history of the hotel as you have just heard it with an additional anecdote that may be worth relating  this hotel said the secretary was once owned by m de talleyrand and this bureau was probably the receptacle of state secrets of far greater importance than any that are connected with our own simple and unsupported claims for justice he then went on to say that the citizens of hamburg understanding it was the intention of napoleon to incorporate their town with the empire had recourse to a ceur5 in order to prevent an act that by destroying their neutrality would annihilate their commerce four millions of francs were administered on this occasion and of these a large proportion it is said went to pay for the hotel monaco which was a recent purchase of m de talleyrand to the horror of the hambourgeois the money was scarcely paid when the deprecated decree appeared and every man of them was converted into a frenchman by the stroke of a pen the worthy burghers were accustomed to receive a quid pro quo for every florin they bestowed failing of which on the present occasion they sent a deputation forthwith to napoleon to reveal the facts and to make their complaints that great man little liked that any one but himself should peculate in his dominions and in the end m de talleyrand was obliged to quit the hotel monaco by some means with which i am unacquainted most probably by purchase however the house is now the property of madame adelaide of orleans  footnote 5 the first three letters of the word cannot be correctly read on the original book  the rolling of a coach into the court was a signal for us to be at our posts and we abandoned the bureau so lately occupied by the great father of diplomacy for the drawingroom i have already told you that this dinner was in honour of mr canning and although diplomatic in one sense it was not so strictly confined to the corps as to prevent a selection this selection in honour of the principal guest had been made from the representatives of the great powers spain being the least important nation represented on the occasion the republic of switzerland excepted i do not know whether the presence of the swiss chargédaffaires was so intended or not but it struck me as pointed and in good taste for all the other foreign agents were ambassadors with the exception of the prussian who was an envoy extraordinary diplomacy has its honorary gradations as well as a military corps and as you can know but little of such matters i will explain them en passant first in rank comes the ambassador this functionary is supposed to represent the personal dignity of the state that sends him if a king there is a room in his house that has a throne and it is usual to see the chair reversed in respect for its sanctity and it appears to be etiquette to suspend the portrait of the sovereign beneath the canopy the envoy extraordinary comes next and then the minister plenipotentiary ordinarily these two functions are united in the same individual such is the rank of mr brown the minister resident is a lower grade and the chargédaffaires the lowest of all inter se these personages take rank according to this scale previously to the peace of 1814 the representative of one monarch laid claim to precede the representative of another always admitting however of the validity of the foregoing rule this pretension gave rise to a good deal of heartburning and contention nothing can in itself be of greater indifference whether a or b walk into the receptionroom or to the dinnertable first but when the idea of general superiority is associated with the act the aspect of the thing is entirely changed under the old system the ambassador of the emperor claimed precedence over all other ambassadors and i believe the representatives of the kings of france had high pretensions also now there are great mutations in states spain once the most important kingdom of europe has much less influence today than prussia a power of yesterday then the minister of the most insignificant prince claimed precedency over the representative of the most potent republic this might have passed while republics were insignificant and dependent but no one can believe that a minister of america for instance representing a state of fifty millions as will be the case before long would submit to such an extravagant pretension on the part of a minister of wurtemburg or sardinia or portugal he would not submit to such a pretension on the part of the minister of any power on earth  i do not believe that the congress of vienna had sufficient foresight or sufficient knowledge of the actual condition of the united states to foresee this difficulty but there were embarrassing points to be settled among the european states themselves and the whole affair was disposed of on a very discreet and equitable principle it was decided that priority of standing at a particular court should regulate the rank between the different classes of agents at that particular court thus the ambassador longest at paris precedes all the other ambassadors at paris and the same rule prevails with the ministers and chargés according to their respective gradations of rank a provision however was made in favour of the representative of the pope who if of the rank of a nuncio precedes all ambassadors the concession has been made in honour of the church which as you must know or ought to be told is an interest much protected in all monarchies statesmen being notoriously of tender consciences  the constant habit of meeting drills the diplomatic corps so well that they go through the evolutions of etiquette as dexterously as a corps of regular troops perform their wheelings and countermarches the first great point with them is punctuality for to people who sacrifice so much of it to forms time gets to be precious the roll of wheels was incessant in the court of the hotel monaco from the time the first carriage entered until the last had set down its company i know as every man who reflects must know that it is inherently illbred to be late anywhere but i never before felt how completely it was high breeding to be as punctual as possible the maître dhôtel had as much as he could do to announce the company who entered as closely after each other as decorum and dignity would permit i presume one party waited a little for the others in the outer drawingroom the reception being altogether in the inner room  the americans very properly came first we were mr gallatin who was absent from london on leave his wife and daughter and a clergyman and his wife and myself mrs  having declined the invitation on account of ill health the announcing and the entrance of most of the company especially as everybody was in high dinnerdress the women in jewels and the men wearing all their orders had something of the air of a scenic display the effect was heightened by the magnificence of the hotel the drawingroom in which we were collected being almost regal  the first person who appeared was a handsome compact wellbuilt gentlemanlike little man who was announced as the duke of villa hermosa the spanish ambassador he was dressed with great simplicity and beauty having however the breast of his coat covered with stars among which i recognized with historical reverence that of the golden fleece he came alone his wife pleading indisposition for her absence the prussian minister and his wife came next then followed lord and lady granville the representatives of england he was a large welllooking man but wanted the perfect command of movement and manner that so much distinguish his brethren in diplomacy as for mere physical stuff he and our own minister who stands six feet four in his stockings would make material enough for all the rest of the corps he wore the star of the bath the austrian ambassador and ambassadress followed a couple of singularly high air and a good tone of manner he is a hungarian and very handsome she a veronese i believe and certainly a woman admirably adapted for her station they had hardly made their salutations before m le comte et mad la comtesse de villèle were announced here then we had the french prime minister as the women precede the men into a drawingroom here knowing how to walk and to curtsey alone i did not at first perceive the great man who followed so close to his wifes skirts as to be nearly hid but he was soon flying about the room at large and betrayed himself immediately to be a fidget instead of remaining stationary or nearly so as became his high quality he took the initiative in compliments and had nearly every diplomatic man walking apart in the adjoining room in a political aside in less than twenty minutes he had a countenance of shrewdness and i make little doubt is a better man in a bureau than in a drawingroom his colleague the foreign minister m de damas and his wife came next he was a large heavylooking personage that i suspect throws no small part of the diplomacy on the shoulders of the premier though he had more the manner of good society than his colleague he has already exchanged his office for that of governor of the heir presumptive as i have already stated there was a pause when a quiet evenpaced classicallooking man in the attire of an ecclesiastic appeared in the door and was announced as my lord the nuncio he was then an archbishop and wore the usual dress of his rank but i have since met him at an evening party with a red hat under his arm the pope having recalled him and raised him to that dignity he is now cardinal macchi he was a priestly and an intellectuallooking personage and externals considered well suited to his station he wore a decoration or two as well as most of the others  my lord clanricarde and mr canning came next and the great man followed by his soninlaw made his appearance he walked into the room with the quiet aplomb of a man accustomed to being lionised and certainly without being of striking he was of very pleasing appearance his size was ordinary but his frame was compact and well built neither too heavy nor too light for his years but of just the proportions to give one the idea of a perfect management of the machine his face was agreeable and his eye steady and searching he and m de villèle were the very opposites in demeanour though after all it was easy to see that the englishman had the most latent force about him one was fidgety and the other humorous for with all his command of limb and gesture nothing could be more natural than the expression of mr canning i may have imagined that i detected some of his wit from a knowledge of the character of his mind he left the impression however of a man whose natural powers were checked by a trained and factitious deference to the rank of those with whom he associated lord granville i thought treated him with a sort of affectionate deference and right or wrong i jumped to the conclusion that the english ambassador was a straightforward good fellow at the bottom and one very likely to badger the fidgetty premier by his steady determination to do what was right i thought m de damas too looked like an honest man god forgive me if i do injustice to any of these gentlemen  all this time i have forgotten count pozzo di borgo the russian ambassador being a bachelor he came alone it might have been fancy but i thought he appeared more at his ease under the american roof than any of his colleagues the perfect good understanding between our own government and that of russia extends to their representatives and policy or not we are better treated by them than by any other foreign ministers this fact should be known and appreciated for as one citizen of the republic however insignificant i have no notion of being blackguarded and vituperated half a century and then cajoled into forgetfulness at the suggestions of fear and expediency as circumstances render our goodwill of importance let us at least show that we are not mannikins to be pulled about for the convenience and humours of others but that we know what honest words are understand the difference between civility and abuse and have pride enough to resent contumely when at least we feel it to be unmerited m pozzo is a handsome man of good size and a fine dark eye and has a greater reputation for talents than any other member of the diplomatic corps now at paris he is by birth a corsican and i have heard it said distantly related to bonaparte this may be true corsica being so small a country just as some of us are related to everybody in west jersey our party now consisted of the prime minister the secretary of foreign affairs the austrian and english ambassadors and the prussian minister with their wivesthe nuncio the russian and spanish ambassadors the swiss chargédaffaires mr canning lord clanricarde mr mrs and miss gallatin and the other americans already mentioned or twentyfive in all  if i had been struck with the rapid and businesslike manner in which the company entered i was amused with the readiness with which they paired off when dinner was announced it was like a coup de théâtre every man and woman knowing his or her exact rank and precedency and the time when to move this business of getting out of a drawingroom to a dinnertable is often one of difficulty though less frequently in france than in most other european countries on account of the admirable tact of the women who seldom suffer a knotty point to get the ascendancy but by choosing the gentlemen for themselves settle the affair off hand from their decision of course there is no appeal in order that in your simplicity you may not mistake the importance of this moment i will relate an anecdote of what lately occurred at a dinner given by an english functionary in holland  when william invaded england in 1688 he took with him many dutch nobles some of whom remained and became english peers among others he created one of his followers an irish earl but choosing to return to holland this person was afterwards known as the count de  although his irish rank was always acknowledged it happened that the wife of the descendant of this person was present at the entertainment in question when dinner was announced the company remarked that the master of the house was in a dilemma there was much consultation and a delay of near half an hour before the matter was decided the debated point was whether madame de  was to be considered as a dutch or an irish countess if the latter there were english ladies present who were entitled to precede her if the former as a stranger she might get that advantage herself luckily for the rights of hospitality the dutch lady got the best of it  these things sound absurd and sometimes they are so but this social drilling unless carried to extremes is not without its use in america i have always understood that on such occasions silent laws of etiquette exist in all good company which are founded on propriety and tact the young give way to the old the undistinguished to the distinguished and he who is at home to the stranger these rules are certainly the most rational and in the best taste when they can be observed and on the whole they lead perhaps to the fewest embarrassments always so if there happen to be none but the wellbred present since seats become of little consideration where no importance is attached to them i confess to some manoeuvring in my time to get near or away from a fire out of a draught or next some agreeable woman but the idea whether i was at the head or the foot of the table never crossed my mind and yet here where they do mean the salt to come into the account i begin to take care that they do not bite their thumbs at me two or three little things have occurred in my presence which show that all our people do not even understand the ways of their own good society a very young man lately under the impression that gallantry required it led one of the most distinguished women in the room to the table merely because he happened to be next her at the moment dinner was announced this was certainly a failure even in american etiquette every woman being more disposed to appreciate the delicacy and respect which should have induced such a person to give place to one of higher claims than to prize the headoverheels assiduity that caused the boy to forget himself sentiment should be the guide on such occasions and no man is a gentleman until his habits are brought completely in subjection to its dictates in all matters of this sort  there was very little sentiment however in marshalling the company at the dinner given to mr canning i will not undertake to say that all the guests were invited to meet this gentleman and that he had been asked to name a day as is usual when it is intended to pay an especial compliment but i was asked to meet him and i understood that the dinner was in his honour diplomatic etiquette made short work of the matter notwithstanding for the doors were hardly thrown open before all the privileged vanished with a quickness that was surprising the minister took madame de villèle m de villèle mrs brown m de damas the wife of the oldest ambassador and the nuncio madame de damas after which the ambassadors and ministers took each others wives in due order and with a promptitude that denoted great practice even the charge disappeared leaving the rest of us to settle matters among ourselves as well as we could mr canning mr gallatin lord clanricarde the divine the secretary and myself were left with only the wife of the clergyman and miss gallatin as a matter of course the americans feeling themselves at home made signs for the two englishmen to precede them and mr canning offered his arm to mrs  and lord clanricarde his to miss gallatin here occurred a touch of character that is worthy to be mentioned as showing of how very little account an american male or female is in the estimation of a european and how very arbitrary are the laws of etiquette among our english cousins mr canning actually gave way to his soninlaw leaving the oldest of the two ladies to come after the youngest because as a marquis his soninlaw took precedence of a commoner this was out of place in america at least where the parties were by a fiction in law if not in politeness and it greatly scandalized all our yankee notions of propriety mrs  afterwards told me that he apologized for the circumstance giving lord clanricardes rank as the reason sempereadem or worse and worse as my old friend on used to translate it what became of the precedency of the married lady all this time you will be ready to ask alas she was an american and had no precedency the twelve millions may not settle this matter as it should be but take my word for it the fifty millions will insignificant as all this is or rather ought to be your grandchildren and mine will live to see the mistake rectified how much better would it be for those who cannot stop the progress of events by vain wishes and idle regrets to concede the point gracefully and on just principles than to have their cherished prejudices broken down by dint of sheer numbers and power  the dinner itself was like every dinner that is given at paris beautiful in decoration admirable in its order and excellent in viands or rather in its dishes for it is the cookery and not the staple articles that form the boast of the french kitchen as you are notable in your own region for understanding these matters i must say a word touching the gastric science as it is understood here a general error exists in america on the subject of french cookery which is not highly seasoned but whose merit consists in blending flavours and in arranging compounds in such a manner as to produce at the same time the lightest and most agreeable food a lady who from her public situation receives once a week for the entire year and whose table has a reputation assured me lately that all the spices consumed annually in her kitchen did not cost her a franc the effect of a french dinner is its principal charm one of reasonably moderate habits rises from the table with a sense of enjoyment that to a stranger at least is sometimes startling i have on several occasions been afraid i was relaxing into the vices of a gourmet if indeed vices they can be called the gourmand is a beast and there is nothing to be said in his favour but after all i incline to the opinion that no one is the worse for a knowledge of what is agreeable to the palate perhaps no one of either sex is thoroughly trained or properly bred without being tant soit peu de gourmet the difference between sheer eating and eating with tact and intelligence is so apparent as to need no explanation a dinner here does not oppress one the wine neither intoxicates nor heats and the frame of mind and body in which one is left is precisely that best suited to intellectual and social pleasures i make no doubt that one of the chief causes of the french being so agreeable as companions is in a considerable degree owing to the admirable qualities of their table a national character may emanate from a kitchen roast beef bacon pudding and beer and port will make a different man in time from chateau margau côtelettes consommés and soufflés the very name of vol au vent is enough to make one walk on air  seriously these things have more influence than may be at a glance imagined the first great change i could wish to make in america would be to see a juster appreciation of the substance and less importance attached to outward forms in moral things the second would be to create a standard of greatness and distinction that should be independent or nearly independent of money the next a more reasoning and original tone of thought as respects our own distinctive principles and distinctive situation with a total indifference to the theories that have been broached to sustain an alien and an antagonist system in england and the last the climax a total reform in the kitchen if i were to reverse the order of these improvements i am not certain the three last might not follow as a consequence of the first after our people have been taught to cook a dinner they ought also to be taught how to eat it  our entertainment lasted the usual hour and a half and as one is all this time eating and there are limits to the capacity of a stomach a part of the lightness and gaiety with which one rises from a french dinner ought to be attributed to the time that is consumed at the table the different ingredients have opportunity to dispose of themselves in their new abode and are not crowded together pellmell or like papers and books in  library as i think they must be after a transatlantic meal as for the point of a mere consumption of food i take it the palm must be given to your frenchman i had some amusement today in watching the different countries the americans were nearly all through their dinner by the time the first course was removed all that was eaten afterwards was literally with them pure makeweight though they kept a hungry look to the last the english seemed fed even before the dinner was begun and although the continental powers in general had the art of picking till they got to the fingerbowls none really kept up the ball but the frenchmen it happened to be friday and i was a little curious to discover whether the nuncio came to these places with a dispensation in his pocket he sat next to madame de damas as good a catholic as himself and i observed them helping themselves to several suspiciouslooking dishes during the first course i ought to have told you before that one rarely almost never helps his neighbour at a french entertainment the dishes are usually put on the table removed by the servants to be carved in succession and handed to the guests to help themselves when the service is perfect every dish is handed to each guest in the great houses servants out of livery help to the different plats servants in livery holding the dishes sauces etc and changing the plates i believe it is strictly haut ton for the servants in livery to do nothing but assist those out of livery in america it is thought stylish to give liveries in europe those who keep most servants out of livery are in the highest mode since these are always a superior class of menials the habits of this quarter of the world give servants a very different estimation from that which they hold with us nobles of high rank are employed about the persons of princes and although in this age they perform no strictly menial offices or only on great occasions they are in theory the servitors of the body nobles have been even employed by nobles and it is still considered an honour for the child of a physician or a clergyman or a shopkeeper in some parts of europe to fill a high place in the household of a great noble the body servant or the gentleman as he is sometimes called even in england of a man of rank looks down upon a mechanic as his inferior contrary to all our notions as all this is it is strictly reasonable when the relative conditions information habits and characters of the people are considered but servants here are divided into many classes for some are scullions and some are entrusted with the keys it follows that those who maintain most of the higher class who are never in livery maintain the highest style to say he keeps a servant out of livery means that he keeps a better sort of domestic mere footmen always wear it the maître dhôtel or groom of the chambers and the valet never  but to return to the dispensation i made it a point to taste every dish that had been partaken of by the nuncio and his neighbour and i found that they were all fish but fish so treated that they could hardly know what to think of themselves you may remember however that an archbishop of paris was sufficiently complaisant to declare a particular duck of which one of louis the sixteenths aunts was fond to be fish and of course fit to be eaten on fastdays  the fasting of these people would strike you as singular for i verily believe they eat more of a fastday than on any other we engaged a governess for the girls not long after our arrival and she proved to be a bigoted catholic a furious royalist and as ignorant as a calf she had been but a few weeks in the house when i detected her teaching her élèves to think washington an unpardonable rebel la fayette a monster louis xvi a martyr and all heretics in the high road to damnation there remained no alternative but to give her a quarters salary and to get rid of her by the way this woman was of a noble family and as such received a small pension from the court but i kept her fully a month longer than i think i otherwise should to see her eat on fastdays your aunt had the consideration invariably to order fish for her and she made as much havoc among them as a pike she always commenced the friday with an extra allowance of fruit which she was eating all the morning and at dinner she contrived to eat half the vegetables and all the fish one day by mistake the soup happened to be gras instead of maigre and after she had swallowed a large plateful i was malicious enough to express my regrets at the mistake i really thought the poor woman was about to disgorge on the spot but by dint of consolation she managed to spare us this scene so good an occasion offering i ventured to ask her why she fasted at all as i did not see it made any great difference in the sum total of her bodily nutriment she assured me that i did not understand the matter the fruit was merely a rafraîchissant and so counted for nothing and as for the fish and vegetables i might possibly think them very good eating and for that matter so did she on thursdays and saturdays but no sooner did friday come than she longed for meat the merit of the thing consisted therefore more in denying her appetite than in going without food i tried hard to persuade her to take a côtelette with me but the proposition made her shudder though she admitted that she envied me every mouthful i swallowed the knowledge of this craving did not take away my appetite  lest you should suppose that i am indulging in the vulgar english slang against french governesses i will add that our own was the very worst in every respect i ever saw in or out of france and that i have met with ladies in this situation every way qualified by principles attainments manners and antecedents to be received with pleasure in the best company of europe  our connives in the hotel monaco soon disappeared after the chassecafé leaving none but the americans behind them men and women retired as they came the latter however taking leave as is always required by the punctilios of your sex except at very large and crowded parties and even then properly and the former if alone getting away as quietly as possible the whole affair was over before nine oclock at which hour the diplomatic corps was scattered all through paris  previously to this dispersion however mr gallatin did me the favour to present me to mr canning the conversation was short and was chiefly on america there was a sore part in his feelings in consequence of a recent negotiation and he betrayed it he clearly does not love us but what englishman does you will be amused to hear that unimportant in other respects as this little conversation was it has been the means of affecting the happiness of two individuals of high station in great britain it would be improper for me to say more but of the fact i can entertain no manner of doubt and i mention it here merely as a curious instance of the manner in which tall oaks from little acorns grow  i ought to have said that two instead of one event followed this dinner the second was our own introduction into european society the how and wherefore it is unnecessary to explain but some of the cleverest and bestbred people of this wellbred and clever capital took us by the hand all unlettered as we were and from that moment taking into consideration our tastes and my health the question has been not how to get into but how to keep out of the great world you know enough of these matters to understand that the ice once broken any one can float in the current of society  this little footing has not been obtained without some contretems and i have learned early to understand that wherever there is an englishman in the question it behoves an american to be reserved punctilious and sometimes stubborn there is a strange mixture of kind feeling prejudice and illnature as respects us wrought into the national character of that people that will not admit of much mystification that they should not like us may be natural enough but if they seek the intercourse they ought on all occasions to be made to conduct it equally without annoyance and condescension and on terms of perfect equality conditions by the way that are scarcely agreeable to their present notions of superiority6  footnote 6 the change in this respect during the last ten years is patent no european nation has probably just at this moment as much real respect for america as the english though it is still mixed with great ignorance and a very sincere dislike still the enterprise activity and growing power of the country are forcing themselves on the attention of our kinsmen and if the government understood its foreign relations as well as it does its domestic and made a proper exhibition of maritime preparation and of maritime force this people would hold the balance in many of the grave questions that are now only in abeyance in european politics hitherto we have been influenced by every vacillation in english interests and it is quite time to think of turning the tables and of placing as far as practicable american interests above the vicissitudes of those of other people the thing is more easily done than is commonly imagined but a party politician is rarely a statesman the subordinate management necessary to the one being death to the comprehensive views that belong to the other the peculiar nature of the american institutions and the peculiar geographical situation of the country moreover render higher qualities necessary perhaps to make a statesman here than elsewhere  in order to understand why i mention any other than the french in the capital of france you will remember that there are many thousands of foreigners established here for longer or shorter periods who by means of their money a necessary that relatively is less abundant with the french materially affect society contriving to penetrate it in all directions in some way or other     letter vii  english jurisprudenceenglish justicejustice in francecontinental jurisprudencejurieslegal injusticethe bar in franceprecedence of the law   to jacob sutherland esq new york  your legal pursuits will naturally give you an interest in the subject of the state of justice in this part of the world a correspondence like mine would not admit of any very profound analysis of the subject did i possess the necessary learning which i do not but i may present a few general facts and notions that will give you some idea of the state of this important feature of society the forms and modes of english jurisprudence are so much like our own as to create the impression that the administration of justice is equally free from venality and favour as a whole and when the points at issue reach the higher functionaries of the law i should think this opinion true but taking those facts that appear in the daily prints through the police reports and in the form of personal narratives as guides i should think that there is much more oppression many more abuses and far more outrages on the intention of the law in the purlieus of the courts in england through the agency of subordinates than with us the delays and charges of a suit in chancery almost amount to a denial of justice quite lately i saw a statement which went to show that a legacy to a charity of about 1000l with the interest of some fourteen years had been consumed in this court with the exception of rather more than 100l this is an intolerable state of things and goes to prove i think that in some of its features at least english jurisprudence is behind that of every other free country  but i have been much impressed lately by a case that would be likely to escape the attention of more regular commentators a peer of the realm having struck a constable on a racecourse is proceeded against in the civil action the jury found for the plaintiff damages fifty pounds in summing up the judge reasoned exactly contrary to what i am inclined to think would have been the case had the matter been tried before you he gave it as his opinion that the action was frivolous and ought never to have been brought that the affair should have been settled out of court and in short left the impression that it was not as such so great a hardship for a constable to be struck by a peer that his honour might not be satisfied with the offering of a guinea or two the jury thought differently from which i infer that the facts did not sustain the judge in his notions now the reasoning at home would i think have been just the other way the english judge said in substance a man of lord s dignity ought not to have been exposed to this action you would have said a senator is a lawmaker and owes even a higher example of order than common to the community he insinuated that a small reparation ought to suffice while you would have made some strong hints at smartmoney  i mention this case for i think it rather illustrative of english justice indeed it is not easy to see how it well can be otherwise when society is divided into castes the weak must go to the wall i know that the theory here is quite different and that one of the boasts of england is the equality of its justice but i am dealing in facts and not in theories in america it is thought and with proper limitations i dare say justly that the bias of juries in the very lowest courts is in favour of the poor against the rich but the right of appeal restores the balance and in a great degree secures justice in each case it is the controlling power that does the wrong in england the few in america the many  in france as you probably know juries are confined to criminal cases the consequence is a continuance of the old practice of soliciting justice the judge virtually decides in chambers and he hears the parties in chambers or in other words wherever he may choose to receive them the client depends as much on external influence and his own solicitations as on the law and the justice of his case he visits the judge officially and works upon his mind by all the means in his power you and i have been acquainted intimately from boyhood and it has been my bad luck to have had more to do with the courts than i could wish and yet in all the freedom of an otherwise unfettered intercourse i have never dared to introduce the subject of any suit in which i have been a party i have been afraid of wounding your sense of right to say nothing of my own and of forfeiting your esteem or at least of losing your society now had we been frenchmen you would have expected me to solicit you you would probably have heard me with the bias of an old friend and my adversary must have been a singularly lucky fellow or you a very honest one if he did not get the worst of it supposing the case to admit of doubt formerly it was known that influence prevailed bribes were offered and received and a suit was a contest of money and favouritism rather than one of facts and principles  i asked general la fayette not long since what he thought of the actual condition of france as respects the administration of justice in most political cases he accused the government of the grossest injustice illegality and oppression in the ordinary criminal cases he believed the intentions of the courts and juries perfectly fair as indeed it is difficult to believe they should not be in the civil suits he thought a great improvement had taken place nor did he believe that there now exists much of the ancient corruption the civil code of napoleon had worked well and all he complained of was a want of fitness between the subordinate provisions of a system invented by a military despot for his own support and the system of quasi liberty that had been adopted at the restoration for the bourbons had gladly availed themselves of all the machinery of power that napoleon bequeathed to france  a gentleman who heard the conversation afterwards told me the following anecdote a friend of his had long been an unsuccessful suitor in one of the higher courts of the kingdom they met one day in the street when the other told him that an unsealed letter which he held in his hand contained an offer of a pair of carriagehorses to the wife of the judge who had the control of his affair on being told he dare not take so strong a step m de  my informant was requested to read the letter to seal it and to put it in the boîte aux lettres with his own hands in order to satisfy himself of the actual state of justice in france all this was done and i can only add continued m de  that i afterwards saw the horses in the carriage of madame  and that my friend gained his cause to this anecdote i can only say i tell it exactly as i heard it and that m de  is a deputy and one of the honestest and simplestminded men of my acquaintance it is but proper to add that the judge in question has a bad name and is little esteemed by the bar but the abovementioned fact would go to show that too much of the old system remains  in germany justice bears a better name though the absence of juries generally must subject the suitor to the assaults of personal influence farther south report speaks still less favourably of the manner in which the laws are interpreted and indeed it would seem to be an inevitable consequence of despotism that justice should be abused one hears occasionally of some signal act of moderation and equity on the part of monarchies but the merits of systems are to be proved not by these brilliant coups de justice but by the steady quiet and regular working of the machine on which men know how to calculate in which they have faith and which as seldom deceives them as comports with human fallibility rather than by scenes in which the blind goddess is made to play a part in a melodrama  on the whole it is fair to presume that while public opinion and that intelligence which acts virtually as a bill of rights even in the most despotic governments of europe not even excepting turkey perhaps have produced a beneficial influence on the courts the secrecy of their proceedings the irresponsible nature of their trusts responsible to power and irresponsible to the nation and the absence of publicity produce precisely the effects that a commonsense view of the facts would lead one who understands human nature to expect  i am no great admirer of the compromising verdicts of juries in civil suits that admit of a question as to amounts they are an admirable invention to settle questions of guilty or not guilty but an enlightened court would nine times in ten do more justice in the cases just named would it not be an improvement to alter the present powers of juries by letting them simply find for or against the suitor leaving the damages to be assessed by regular officers that might resemble masters in chancery at all events juries or some active substitute cannot be safely dispensed with until a people have made great progress in the science of publicity and in a knowledge of the general principles connected with jurisprudence  this latter feature is quite peculiar to america nothing has struck me more in europe than the ignorance which everywhere exists on such subjects even among educated people no one appears to have any distinct notions of legal principles or even of general law beyond a few prominent facts but the professional men chance threw me not long since into the company of three or four exceedingly clever young englishmen they were all elder sons and two were the heirs of peers7 something was said on the subject of a claim of a gentleman with whom i am connected to a large irish estate the grandfather of this gentleman was the next brother to the incumbent who died intestate the grandson however was defeated in his claim in consequence of its being proved that the ancestor through whom he derived his claim was of the halfblood my english companions did not understand the principle and when i explained by adding that the grandfather of the claimant was born of a different mother from the last holder in fee and that he could never inherit at law unless by devise the estate going to a hundredth cousin of the whole blood in preference or even escheating to the king they one and all protested england had no such law they were evidently struck with the injustice of transferring property that had been acquired by the common ancestor of two brothers to a remote cousin merely because the affinity between the sons was only on the fathers side although that very father may have accumulated the estate and they could not believe that what struck them as so grievous a wrong could be the law of descents under which they lived luckily for me one learned in the profession happened to be present and corroborated the fact now all these gentlemen were members of parliament but they were accustomed to leave legal questions of this nature to the management of professional men  footnote 7 this absurd and unaccountable provision of the common law has since been superseded by a statute regulating descents on a more intelligible and just provision england has made greater advances in common sense and in the right in all such matters within the last five years than during the previous hundred  i mentioned this conversation to another englishman who thought the difficulty well disposed of by saying that if property ever escheated in this manner i ought to remember that the crown invariably bestowed it on the natural heir this struck me as singular reasoning to be used by a people who profess to cherish liberty inasmuch as to a certain degree it places all the land in the kingdom at the mercy of the sovereign i need not tell you moreover that this answer was insufficient as it did not meet the contingency of a remote cousins inheriting to the prejudice of the children of him who earned the estate but habit is all in all with the english in such matters and that which they are accustomed to see and hear they are accustomed to think right  the bar is rising greatly in public consideration in france before the revolution there were certain legal families of great distinction but these could scarcely be considered as forming a portion of the regular practitioners now many of the most distinguished statesmen peers and politicians of france commenced their careers as advocates the practice of public speaking gives them an immense advantage in the chambers and fully half of the most popular debaters are members who belong to the profession new candidates for public favour appear every day and the time is at hand when the fortunes of france so lately controlled by soldiers will be more influenced by men of this profession than by those of all the others this is a great step in moral civilization for the country that most feels the ascendancy of the law and that least feels that of arms is nearest to the summit of human perfection when asked which profession takes rank in america i tell them the law in influence and the church in deference some of my moustachoed auditors stare at this reply for here the sword has precedence of all others and the law with few exceptions is deemed a calling for none but those who are in the secondary ranks of society but as i have told you opinion is undergoing a great change in this particular i believe that every efficient man in the present ministry is or has been a lawyer     letter viii  army of francemilitary displayfête of the trocaderoroyal review royal

soultdisaffection of the army   to col bankhead us artillery  the army of france obtained so high a reputation during the wars of the revolution and the empire that you may feel some curiosity to know its actual condition as the bourbons understand that they have been restored to the throne by the great powers of europe if not in opposition to the wishes of a majority of frenchmen certainly in opposition to the wishes of the active portion of the population and consequently to that part of the nation which would be most likely to oppose their interests they have been accused of endeavouring to keep the establishments of france so low as to put her at the mercy of any new combination of the allies i should think this accusation in a great degree certainly unmerited for france at this moment has a large and so far as i can judge a wellappointed army and one that is charged by the liberal party with being a heavy expense to the nation and that too chiefly with the intention of keeping the people in subjection to tyranny but these contradictions are common in party politics it is not easy here to get at statistical facts accurately especially those which are connected with expenditure nominally the army is about 200000 men but it is whispered that numerous congés are given in order to divert the funds that are thus saved to other objects admitting all this to be true and it probably is so in part i should think france must have fully 150000 men embodied without including the national guards paris is pretty well garrisoned and the casernes in the vicinity of the capital are always occupied it appears to me there cannot be less than 20000 men within a days march of the tuileries and there may be half as many more8  footnote 8 the sudden disbandment of the guards and other troops in 1830 greatly diminished the actual force of the country  since our arrival there have been several great military displays and i have made it a point to be present at them all the first was a petite guerre9 on the plains of issy or within a mile of the walls of the town there may have been 15000 men assembled for the occasion including troops of all arms  footnote 9 shamfight  one of the first things that struck me at paris was the careless militialike manner in which the french troops marched about the streets the disorder irregularity careless and indifferent style of moving were all exactly such as i have heard laughed at a thousand times in our own great body of national defenders but this is only one of many similar instances in which i have discovered that what has been deemed a peculiarity in ourselves arising from the institutions perhaps is a very general quality belonging rather to man than to any particular set of men our notions you will excuse the freedom of the remark are apt to be a little provincial and every one knows that fashion opinions and tastes only become the more exaggerated the farther we remove from the centre of light in this way we come to think of things in an exaggerated sense until like the boy who is disappointed at finding a king a man we form notions of life that are anything but natural and true  i was still so new to all this however that i confess i went to the plain of issy expecting to see a new style of manoeuvring or at least one very different from that which i had so often witnessed at home nor can i say that in this instance there was so much disappointment the plan of the day did not embrace two parties but was merely an attack on an imaginary position against which the assailants were regularly and scientifically brought up the victory being a matter of convention the movements were very beautiful and were made with astonishing spirit and accuracy all idea of disorder or the want of regularity was lost here for entire battalions advanced to the charges without the slightest apparent deviation from perfectly mathematical lines  when we reached the acclivity that overlooked the field a new line was forming directly beneath us it being supposed that the advance of the enemy had already been driven in upon his main body and the great attack was just on the point of commencing  a long line of infantry of the french guards formed the centre of the assailants several batteries of artillery were at hand and divers strong columns of horse and foot were held in reserve a regiment of lancers was on the nearest flank and another of cuirassiers was stationed at the opposite all the men of the royal family were in the field surrounded by a brilliant staff a gun was fired near them by way of signal i suppose when two brigades of artillery galloped through the intervals of the line unlimbered and went to work as if they were in downright earnest the cannonade continued a short time when the infantry advanced in line and delivered its fire by companies or battalions i could not discern which in the smoke this lasted some ten minutes when i observed a strong column of troops dressed in scarlet moving up with great steadiness and regularity from the rear these were the swiss guards and there might have been fifteen hundred or two thousand of them the column divided into two as it approached the rear of the line which broke into column in turn and for a minute there was a confused crowd of red and blue coats in the smoke that quite set my nautical instinct at defiance the cuirassiers chose this moment to make a rapid and menacing movement in advance but without opening their column and some of the artillery reappeared and commenced firing at the unoccupied intervals this lasted a very little while for the swiss deployed into line like clockwork and then made a quick charge with beautiful precision halting they threw in a heavy fire by battalions the french guard rallied and formed upon their flanks the whole reserve came up the cuirassiers and lancers charged by turning the position assailed and for ten or fifteen minutes there was a succession of quick evolutions which like the finale of a grand piece of music appeared confused even while it was the most scientific and then there was a sudden pause the position whose centre was a copse had been carried and we soon saw the guards formed on the ground that was supposed to have been held by the enemy the artillery still fired occasionally as on a retreating foe and the lancers and cuirassiers were charging and manoeuvring half a mile farther in advance as if following up their advantage  altogether this was much the prettiest field exercise i ever witnessed there was a unity of plan a perfection of evolution and a division of matériel about it that rendered it to my eyes as nearly perfect as might be the troops were the best of france and the management of the whole had been confided to some one accustomed to the field it contained all the poetry without any of the horrors of a battle it could not possess the heartstirring interest of a real conflict and yet it was not without great excitement  some time after the petite guerre of issy the capital celebrated the fête of the trocadero the trocadero you may remember was the fortress of cadix carried by assault under the order of the dauphin in the war of the late spanish revolution this government which has destroyed all the statues of the emperor proscribed his family and obliterated every visible mark of his reign in their power has had the unaccountable folly of endeavouring to supplant the military glory acquired under napoleon by that of louis antoine dauphin of france a necessary consequence of the attempt is a concentration of all the military souvenirs of the day in this affair of the trocadero bold as all this will appear to one who has not the advantage of taking a near view of what is going on here it has even been exceeded through the abject spirit of subserviency in those who have the care of public instruction by an attempt to exclude even the name of the bonaparte from french history my girls have shown me an abridgment of the history of france that has been officially prepared for the ordinary schools in which there is no sort of allusion to him the wags here say that a work has been especially prepared for the heir presumptive however in which the emperor is a little better treated being spoken of as a certain marquis de bonaparte who commanded the armies of the king  the mimic attack on the trocadero like its great original was at night the troops assembled in the champs de mars and the assault was made across the beautiful bridge of jena on a sharp acclivity near passy which was the imaginary fortress the result was a pretty good effect of nightfiring some smoke not a little noise with a very pretty movement of masses i could make nothing of it of much interest for the obscurity prevented the eyes from helping the imagination  not long since the king held a great review of regular troops and of the entire body of the national guards of paris and its environs this review also took place in the champs de mars and it was said that nearly a hundred thousand men were under arms for the occasion i think there might have been quite seventy thousand these mere reviews have little interest the evolutions being limited to marching by regiments on and off the ground in doing the latter the troops defile before the king previously to this the royal cortege passed along the several lines receiving the usual honours  on this occasion the dauphine and the duchesse de berri followed the king in open carriages accompanied by the little duc de bordeaux and his sister i happened to be at an angle of the field as the royal party surrounded by a showy group of marshals and generals passed and when there seemed to be a little confusion as a matter of course the cry of vive le roi had passed along with the procession for popular or not it is always easy for a sovereign to procure this sign of affection or for others to procure it for him you will readily understand that employés of the government are especially directed to betray the proper enthusiasm on such occasions there was however a cry at this corner of the area that did not seem so unequivocally loyal and on inquiry i was told that some of the national guards had cried a bas les ministres the affair passed off without much notice however and i believe it was generally forgotten by the population within an hour the desire to get rid of m de villèle and his set was so general in paris that most people considered the interruption quite as a matter of course  the next day the capital was electrified by a royal ordinance disbanding all the national guards of paris a more infatuated or if it were intended to punish the disaffected a more unjust decree could not easily have been issued it was telling the great majority of the very class which forms the true force of every government that their rulers could not confide in them as confidence by awakening pride begets a spirit in favour of those who depend on it so does obvious distrust engender disaffection but the certainty that louis xvi lost his throne and his life for the want of decision has created one of those sweeping opinions here of the virtue of energy that constantly leads the rulers into false measures an act that might have restrained the france of 1792 would be certain to throw the france of 1827 into open revolt the present generation of frenchmen in a political sense have little in common with even the french of 1814 and measures must be suited to the times in which we live as well might one think of using the birch on the man that had been found profitable with the boy as to suppose these people can be treated like their ancestors  as might have been expected a deep and what is likely to prove a lasting discontent has been the consequence of the blunder it is pretended that the shopkeepers of paris are glad to be rid of the trouble of occasionally mounting guard and that the affair will be forgotten in a short time all this may be true enough in part and it would also be true in the whole were there not a press to keep disaffection alive and to inflame the feelings of those who have been treated so cavalierly for he knows little of human nature who does not understand that while bodies of men commit flagrant wrongs without the responsibility being kept in view by their individual members an affront to the whole is pretty certain to be received as an affront to each of those who make an integral part  the immediate demonstrations of dissatisfaction have not amounted to much though the law and medical students paraded the streets and shouted beneath the windows of the ministers the very cry that gave rise to the disbandment of the guards but if no other consequence has followed this exercise of arbitrary power i at least have learned how to disperse a crowd as you may have occasion some days in your military capacity to perform this unpleasant duty it may be worth while to give you a hint concerning the modus operandi  happening to pass through the place vendôme i found the foot of the celebrated column which stands directly in the centre of the square surrounded by several hundred students they were clustered together like bees close to the iron railing which encloses the base of the pillar or around an area of some fifty or sixty feet square from time to time they raised a shout evidently directed against the ministers of whom one resided at no great distance from the column as the hotel of the Étatmajor of paris is in this square and there is always a post at it it soon became apparent there was no intention quietly to submit to this insult i was attracted by a demonstration on the part of the corps de garde and taking a station at no greet distance from the students i awaited the issue  the guard some thirty foot soldiers came swiftly out of the court of the hotel and drew up in a line before its gate this happened as i reached their own side of the square which i had just crossed presently a party of fifteen or twenty gendarmes à cheval came up and wheeled into line the students raised another shout as it might be in defiance the infantry shouldered arms and filing off singly headed by an officer they marched in what we call indian file towards the crowd all this was done in the most quiet manner possible but promptly and with an air of great decision and determination on reaching the crowd they penetrated it in the same order quite up to the railing nothing was said nor was anything done for it would have been going farther than the students were prepared to proceed had they attempted to seize and disarm the soldiers this appeared to be understood and instead of wasting the moments and exasperating his enemies by a parley the officer as has just been said went directly through them until he reached the railing once there he began to encircle it followed in the same order by his men the first turn loosened the crowd necessarily and then i observed that the muskets which hitherto had been kept at a carry were inclined a little outwards two turns enabled the men to throw their pieces to a charge and by this time they had opened their order so far as to occupy the four sides of the area facing outwards they advanced very slowly but giving time for the crowd to recede this manoeuvre rendered the throng less and less dense when watching their time the mounted gendarmes rode into it in a body and making a circuit on a trot without the line of infantry they got the mass so loosened and scattered that unarmed as the students were had they been disposed to resist they would now have been completely at the mercy of the troops every step that was gained of course weakened the crowd and in ten minutes the square was empty some being driven out of it in one direction and some in another without a blow being struck or even an angry word used the force of the old saying that the kings name is a tower of strength or the law being on the side of the troops probably was of some avail but a mob of fiery young frenchmen is not too apt to look at the law with reverence  i stood near the hotels but still in the square when a gendarme sweeping his sabre as one would use a stick in driving sheep came near me he told me to go away i smiled and said i was a stranger who was looking at the scene purely from curiosity i see you are sir he answered but you had better fall back into the rue de la paix we exchanged friendly nods and i did as he told me without further hesitation in truth there remained no more to be seen  certainly nothing could have been done in better temper more effectually nor more steadily than this dispersion of the students there is no want of spirit in these young men you must know but the reverse is rather the case the troops were under fifty in number and the mob was between six hundred and a thousand resolute active sturdy young fellows who had plenty of fight in them but who wanted the unity of purpose that a single leader can give to soldiers i thought this little campaign of the column of the place vendôme quite as good in its way as the petite guerre of the plains of issy  i do not know whether you have fallen into the same error as myself in relation to the comparative merits of the cavalry of this part of the world though i think it is one common to most americans from the excellence of their horses as well as from that general deference for the character and prowess of the nation which exists at home i had been led to believe that the superior qualities of the british cavalry were admitted in europe this is anything but true military men so far as i can learn giving the palm to the austrian artillery the british infantry and the french cavalry the russians are said to be generally good for the purposes of defence and in the same degree deficient for those of attack some shrewd observers however think the prussian army once more the best in europe  the french cavalry is usually mounted on small clumsy but sturdy beasts that do not show a particle of blood their movement is awkward and their powers for a short effort certainly are very much inferior to those of either england or america their superiority must consist in their powers of endurance for the blooded animal soon falls off on scanty fare and bad grooming i have heard the moral qualities of the men given as a reason why the french cavalry should be superior to that of england the system of conscription secures to an army the best materials while that of enlistment necessarily includes the worst in this fact is to be found the real moral superiority of the french and prussian armies here service even in the ranks is deemed honourable whereas with us or in england it would be certain degradation to a man of the smallest pretension to enlist as a soldier except in moments that made stronger appeals than usual to patriotism in short it is primâ facie evidence of a degraded condition for a man to carry a musket in a regular battalion not so here i have frequently seen common soldiers copying in the gallery of the louvre or otherwise engaged in examining works of science or of taste not ignorantly and with vulgar wonder but like men who had been regularly instructed i have been told that a work on artillery practice lately appeared in france which excited so much surprise by its cleverness that an inquiry was set on foot for its author he was found seated in a cabriolet in the streets his vocation being that of a driver what renders his knowledge more surprising is the fact that the man was never a soldier at all but having a great deal of leisure while waiting for his fares he had turned his attention to this subject and had obtained all he knew by means of books nothing is more common than to see the drivers of cabriolets and fiacres reading in their seats and i have even seen marketwomen under their umbrellas à la robinson with books in their hands you are not however to be misled by these facts which merely show the influence of the peculiar literature of the country so attractive and amusing for a very great majority of the french can neither read nor write it is only in the north that such things are seen at all except among the soldiers and a large proportion of even the french army are entirely without schooling  to return to the cavalry i have heard the superiority of the french ascribed also to their dexterity in the use of the sabre or as it is termed here larme blanche after all this is rather a poetical conclusion for charges of cavalry rarely result in regular handtohand conflicts like the bayonet the sabre is seldom used except on an unresisting enemy still the consciousness of such a manual superiority might induce a squadron less expert to wheel away or to break without waiting for orders  i have made the acquaintance here of an old english general who has passed all his life in the dragoons and who commanded brigades of cavalry in spain and at waterloo as he is a sensible old man of great frankness and simplicity of character perfect good breeding and good nature and moreover so far as i can discover absolutely without prejudice against america he has quite won my heart and i have availed myself of his kindness to see a good deal of him we walk together frequently and chat of all things in heaven and earth just as they come uppermost the other day i asked him to explain the details of a charge of his own particular arm to me of which i confessed a proper ignorance this is soon done said the old gentleman taking my arm with a sort of sly humour as if he were about to relate something facetious against foot a charge is a menace if they break we profit by it if they stand we get out of the scrape as well as we can when foot are in disorder cavalry does the most and it is always active in securing a victory usually taking most of the prisoners but as against cavalry there is much misconception when two regiments assault each other it is in compact line how i interrupted him do not you open so as to leave room to swing a sabre not at all the theory is knee to knee but this is easier said than done in actual service i will suppose an unsuccessful charge we start knee to knee on a trot this loosens the ranks and as we increase the speed they become still looser we are under the fire of artillery or perhaps of infantry all the time and the enemy wont run at this moment a clever officer will command a retreat to be sounded if he should not some officer is opportunely killed or some leading man loses command of his horse which is wounded and wheels the squadron follows and we get away as well as we can the enemy follows and if he catches us we are cut up other charges do occur but this is the common history of cavalry against cavalry and in unsuccessful attacks of cavalry against infantry too a knowledge of the use of the sword is necessary for did your enemy believe you ignorant of it he would not fly but the weapon itself is rarely used on such occasions very few men are slain in their ranks by the bayonet or the sabre  i was once told though not directly by an officer that the english dragoon neglected his horse in the field selling the provender for liquor and that as a consequence the corps became inefficient whereas the french dragoon being usually a sober man was less exposed to this temptation this may or may not be true but drunkenness is now quite common in the french army though i think much less so in the cavalry than in the foot the former are generally selected with some care and the common regiments of the line as a matter of course receive the refuse of the conscription  this conscription is after all extremely oppressive and unjust though it has the appearance of an equal tax napoleon had made it so unpopular by the inordinate nature of his demands for men that louis xviii caused an article to be inserted in the charter by which it was to be altogether abolished but a law being necessary to carry out this constitutional provision the clause remains a perfect dead letter it being no uncommon thing for the law to be stronger than the constitution even in america and quite a common thing here i will give you an instance of the injustice of the system an old servant of mine has been drafted for the cavalry i paid this man seven hundred francs a year gave him coffee butter and wine with his food and he fell heir to a good portion of my old clothes the other day he came to see me and i inquired into his present situation his arms and clothes were found him he got neither coffee wine nor butter and his other food as a matter of course was much inferior to that he had been accustomed to receive with me his pay after deducting the necessary demands on it in the shape of regular contributions amounts to about two sous a day instead of the two francs he got in my service  now necessity in such matters is clearly the primary law if a country cannot exist without a large standing army and the men are not to be had by voluntary enlistments a draft is probably the wisest and best regulation for its security but taking this principle as the basis of the national defence a just and a paternal government would occupy itself in equalizing the effects of the burden as far as circumstances would in any manner admit the most obvious and efficient means would be by raising the rate of pay to the level at least of a scale that should admit of substitutes being obtained at reasonable rates this is done with us where a soldier receives a full ration all his clothes and sixty dollars a year10 it is true that this would make an army very costly and to bear the charge it might be necessary to curtail some of the useless magnificence and prodigality of the other branches of the government and herein is just the point of difference between the expenditures of america and those of france it must be remembered too that a really free government by enlisting the popular feeling in its behalf through its justice escapes all the charges that are incident to the necessity of maintaining power by force wanting soldiers for its enemies without and not for its enemies within we have no need of a large standing army on account of our geographical position it is true but had we the government of france we should not find that our geographical position exempted us from the charge  footnote 10 he now receives seventytwo  you have heard a great deal of the celebrated soldiers who surrounded napoleon and whose names have become almost as familiar to us as his own i do not find that the french consider the marshals men of singular talents most of them reached their high stations on account of their cleverness in some particular branch of their duties and by their strong devotion in the earlier parts of their career to their master maréchal soult has a reputation for skill in managing the civil detail of service as a soldier he is also distinguished for manoeuvring in the face of his enemy and under fire some such excitement appears necessary to arouse his dormant talents suchet is said to have had capacity but i think to massena and to the present king of sweden the french usually yield the palm in this respect davoust was a man of terrible military energy and suited to certain circumstances but scarcely a man of talents it was to him napoleon said remember you have but a single friend in francemyself take care you do not lose him lannes seems to have stood better than most of them as a soldier and macdonald as a man but on the whole i think it quite apparent there was scarcely one among them all calculated to have carried out a very high fortune for himself without the aid of the directing genius of his master many of them had ambition enough for anything but it was an ambition stimulated by example rather than by a consciousness of superiority  in nothing have i been more disappointed than in the appearance of these men there is more or less of character about the exterior and physiognomy of them all it is true but scarcely one has what we are accustomed to think the carriage of a soldier it may be known to you that moreau had very little of this and really one is apt to fancy he can see the civic origin in nearly all of them while the common french soldiers have a good deal of military coquetry the higher officers appear to be nearly destitute of it maréchal molitor is a fine man maréchal marmont neat compact and soldierlylooking maréchal mortier a grenadier without grace maréchal oudinot much the same and so on to the end of the chapter lamarque is a little swarthy man with good features and a keen eye but he is military in neither carriage nor mien  crossing the pont royal shortly after my arrival in company with a friend the latter pointed out to me a stranger on the opposite sidewalk and desired me to guess who and what he might be the subject of my examination was a compact solidlybuilt man with a plodding rustic air and who walked a little lame after looking at him a minute i guessed he was some substantial grazier who had come to paris on business connected with the supplies of the town my friend laughed and told me it was marshal soult to my inexperienced eye he had not a bit of the exterior of a soldier and was as unlike the engravings we see of the french heroes as possible but here art is art and like the man who was accused of betraying another into a profitless speculation by drawing streams on his map when the land was without any and who defended himself by declaring no one ever saw a map without streams the french artists appear to think every one should be represented in his ideal character let him be as bourgeois as he may in truth i have seen marshal soult in company and his face has much character the head is good and the eye searching the whole physiognomy possessing those latent fires that one would be apt to think would require the noise and excitement of a battle to awaken la fayette looks more like an old soldier than any of them gérard however is both a handsome man and of a military mien  now and then we see a vieux moustache in the guards but on the whole i have been much surprised at finding how completely the army of this country is composed of young soldiers the campaigns of russia of 1813 1814 and of 1815 left few besides conscripts beneath the eagles of napoleon my old servant charles tells me that the guardhouse is obliged to listen to tales of the campaign of spain and of the trocadero  the army of france is understood to be very generally disaffected the restoration has introduced into it in the capacity of general officers many who followed the fortunes of the bourbons into exile and some i believe who actually fought against this country in the ranks of her enemies this may be in some measure necessary but it is singularly unfortunate  i have been told on good authority that since the restoration of 1815 several occasions have occurred when the court thought itself menaced with a revolution on all these occasions the army as a matter of course has been looked to with hope or with distrust investigation is said to have always discovered so bad a spirit that little reliance is placed on its support  the traditions of the service are all against the bourbons it is true that very few of the men who fought at marengo and austerlitz still remain but then the recollection of their deeds forms the great delight of most frenchmen there is but one power that can counteract this feeling and it is the power of money by throwing itself into the arms of the industrious classes the court might possibly obtain an ally sufficiently strong to quell the martial spirit of the nation but so far from pursuing such a policy it has all the commercial and manufacturing interests marshalled against it because it wishes to return to the bon vieux tems of the old system  after all i much question if any government in france will have the army cordially with it that does not find it better employment than mockfights on the plain of issy and night attacks on the mimic trocadero     letter ix  royal dinnermagnificence and

officethe duchesse de berrithe catastrophean aristocratic quarrel   to mrs singleton w beall green bay  we have lately witnessed a ceremony that may have some interest for one who like yourself dwells in the retirement of a remote frontier post it is etiquette for the kings of france to dine in public twice in the year viz the 1st of january and the day that is set apart for the fête of the king having some idle curiosity to be present on one of these occasions i wrote the usual note to the lord in waiting or as he is called here le premier gentilhomme de la chambre du roi de service and we got the customary answer enclosing us tickets of admission there are two sorts of permissions granted on these occasions by one you are allowed to remain in the room during the dinner and by the other you are obliged to walk slowly through the salle in at one side and out at the other without however being suffered to pause even for a moment ours were of the former description  the king of france having the laudable custom of being punctual and as every one dines in paris at six that best of all hours for a town life we were obliged to order our own dinner an hour earlier than common for looking at others eating on an empty stomach is of all amusements the least satisfactory having taken this wise precaution we drove to the chateau at half after five it not being seemly to enter the room after the king and as we discovered for females impossible  magnificence and comfort seldom have much in common we were struck with this truth on entering the palace of the king of france the room into which we were first admitted was filled with tall lounging foot soldiers richly attired but who lolled about the place with their caps on and with a barracklike air that seemed to us singularly in contrast with the prompt and respectful civility with which one is received in the antechamber of a private hotel it is true that we had nothing to do with the soldiers and lackeys who thronged the place but if their presence was intended to impress visitors with the importance of their master i think a more private entrance would have been most likely to produce that effect for i confess that it appeared to me has a mark of poverty that troops being necessary to the state and security of the monarch he was obliged to keep them in the vestibule by which his guests entered but this is royal state formerly the executioner was present and in the semibarbarous courts of the east such is the fact even now the soldiers were a party of the hundred swiss men chosen for their great stature and remarkable for the perfection of their musket two of them were posted as sentinels at the foot of the great staircase by which we ascended and we passed several more on the landings  we were soon in the salle des gardes or the room which the gardes du corps on service occupied two of these quasi soldiers were also acting as sentinels here while others lounged about the room their apartment communicated with the salle de diane the hall or gallery prepared for the entertainment i had no other means but the eye of judging of the dimensions of this room but its length considerably exceeds a hundred feet and its breadth is probably forty or more it is of the proper height and the ceiling is painted in imitation of those of the celebrated farnese palace at rome  we found this noble room divided by a low railing into three compartments the centre an area of some thirty feet by forty contained the table and was otherwise prepared for the reception of the court on one side of it were raised benches for the ladies who were allowed to be seated and on the other a vacant space for the gentlemen who stood all these you will understand were considered merely as spectators not being supposed to be in the presence of the king the mere spectators were dressed as usual or in common evening dress and not all the women even in that while those within the railings being deemed to be in the royal presence were in high court dresses thus i stood for an hour within fiveandtwenty feet of the king and part of the time much nearer while by a fiction of etiquette i was not understood to be there at all i was a good while within ten feet of the duchesse de berri while by convention i was nowhere there was abundance of room in our area and every facility of moving about many coming and going as they saw fit behind us but at a little distance were other rows of raised seats filled with the best instrumental musicians of paris along the wall facing the table was a narrow raised platform wide enough to allow of two or three to walk abreast separated from the rest of the room by a railing and extending from a door at one end of the gallery to a door at the other this was the place designed for the passage of the public during the dinner no one however being admitted even here without a ticket  a gentleman of the court led your aunt to the seats reserved for the female spectators which were also without the railing and i took my post among the men although the court of the tuileries was when we entered the palace filled with a throng of those who were waiting to pass through the gallery of diana to my surprise the number of persons who were to remain in the room was very small i account for the circumstance by supposing that it is not etiquette for any who have been presented to attend unless they are among the court and as some reserve was necessary in issuing these tickets the number was necessarily limited i do not think there were fifty men on our side which might have held several hundred and the seats of the ladies were not half filled boxes were fitted up in the enormous windows which closed and curtained a family of fine children occupying that nearest to me some one said they were the princes of the house of orleans for none of the members of the royal family have seats at the grands couverts as these dinners are called unless they belong to the reigning branch there is but one bourbon prince more remote from the crown11 than the duc dorléans and this is the prince de condé or as he is more familiarly termed here the duc de bourbon the father of the unfortunate duc denghien so broad are the distinctions made between the sovereign and the other members of his family in these governments that it was the duty of the prince de condé to appear today behind the kings chair as the highest dignitary of his household though it was understood that he was excused on account of his age and infirmities these broad distinctions you will readily imagine however are only maintained on solemn and great state occasions for in their ordinary intercourse kings nowadays dispense with most of the ancient formalities of their rank it would have been curious however to see one descendant of st louis standing behind the chair of another as a servitor and more especially to see the prince de condé standing behind the chair of charles x for when comte dartois and duc de bourbon some fifty years since they actually fought a duel on account of some slight neglect of the wife of the latter by the former  footnote 11 1827  the crown of france as you know passes only in the male line the duke of orleans is descended from louis xiii and the prince de condé from louis ix in the male line the duke of orleans is only the fourth cousin once removed of the king and the prince de condé the eighth or ninth the latter would be even much more remotely related to the crown but for the accession of his own branch of the family in the person of henry iv who was a near cousin of his ancestor thus you perceive while royalty is always held in reverencefor any member of the family may possibly become the kingstill there are broad distinctions made between the near and the more distant branches of the line the duke of orleans fills that equivocal position in the family which is rather common in the history of this species of government he is a liberal and is regarded with distrust by the reigning branch and with hope by that portion of the people who think seriously of the actual state of the country a saying of m de talleyrand however is circulated at his expense which if true would go to show that this wary prince is not disposed to risk his immense fortune in a crusade for liberty ce nest pas assez dêtre quelquunil faut être quelque chose are the words attributed to the witty and wily politician but usually men have neither half the wit nor half the cunning that popular accounts ascribe to them when it becomes the fashion to record their acts and sayings i believe the duke of orleans holds no situation about the court although the king has given him the title of royal highness his birth entitling him to be styled no more than serene highness this act of grace is much spoken of by the bourbonists who consider it a favour that for ever secures the loyalty and gratitude of the duke the duchess being the daughter of a king had this rank from her birth  the orchestra was playing when we entered the gallery of diana and throughout the whole evening it gave us from time to time such music as can only be found in a few of the great capitals of europe  the covers were laid and every preparation was made within the railing for the reception of the convives the table was in the shape of a young moon with the horns towards the spectators or from the wall it was of some length and as there were but four covers the guests were obliged to be seated several feet from each other in the centre was an armchair covered with crimson velvet and ornamented with a crown this was for the king a chair without arms on his right was intended for the dauphin another on his left for the dauphine and the fourth which was still further on the right of the dauphin was intended for madame as she is called or the duchess of berri these are the old and favourite appellations of the monarchy and absurd as some of them are they excite reverence and respect from their antiquity your wolverines and suckers and buckeyes and hooziers would look amazed to hear an executive styled the white fish of michigan or the sturgeon of wisconsin and yet there is nothing more absurd in it in the abstract than the titles that were formerly given in europe some of which have descended to our times the name of the country as well as the title of the sovereign in the case of dauphiné was derived from the same source thus in homely english the dolphin of dolphinstown renders le dauphin de dauphiné perfectly well the last independent dauphin in bequeathing his states to the king of france of the day the unfortunate john the prisoner of the black prince made a condition that the heir apparent of the kingdom should always be known by his own title and consequently ever since the appellation has been continued you will understand that none but an heirapparent is called the dauphin and not an heirpresumptive thus should the present dauphin and the duc de bordeaux die the duke of orleans according to a treaty of the time of louis xiv though not according to the ancient laws of the monarchy would become heirpresumptive but he could never be the dauphin since should the king marry again and have another son his rights would be superseded none but the heirapparent or the inevitable heir bears this title there were formerly bears in belgium who were of the rank of counts these appellations were derived from the arms the dauphin now bearing dolphins with the lilies of france the boar of ardennes got his sobriquet from bearing the head of a wild boar in his arms there were formerly many titles in france that are now extinct such as captal vidame and castellan all of which were general i believe and referred to official duties there was however formerly a singular proof of how even simplicity can exalt a man when the fashion runs into the opposite extremes in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there existed in france powerful noblemen the owners and lords of the castle and lands of coucy or couci who were content to bear the appellation of sire a word from which our own sir is derived and which means like sir the simplest term of courtesy that could be used these sires de coucy were so powerful as to make royal alliances they waged war with their sovereign and maintained a state nearly royal their pride lay in their antiquity independence and power and they showed their contempt for titles by their device which is said to have been derived from the answer of one of the family to the sovereign who struck with the splendour of his appearance and the number of his attendants had demanded what king has come to my court this motto which is still to be seen on the ancient monuments of the family reads        je ne suis roi ne prince ne duc ne comte aussi                 je suis le sire de coucy12  footnote 12 i am neither king nor prince nor duke nor even a count i am m de coucy  this greatly beats coke of holkham of whom it is said that george iv who had been a liberal in his youth and the friend of the great norfolk commoner vexed by his bringing up so many liberal addresses threatenedif coke comes to me with any more of his whig petitions ill knight him  i have often thought that this simplicity of the sires de coucy furnishes an excellent example for our own ministers and citizens when abroad instead of attempting to imitate the gorgeous attire of their colleagues whose magnificence for the want of stars and similar conventional decorations they can never equal they should go to court as they go to the presidents house in the simple attire of american gentlemen if any prince should inquirewho is this that approaches me clad so simply that i may mistake him for a butler or a groom of the chambers let him answer je ne suis roi ne prince ne duc ne comte aussii am the minister of the united states of amerikey and leave the rest to the millions at home my life for it the question would not be asked twice indeed no man who is truly fit to represent the republic would ever have any concern about the matter but all this time the dinner of the king of france is getting cold  we might have been in the gallery fifteen minutes when there was a stir at a door on the side where the females were seated and a huissier cried outmadame la dauphine and sure enough the dauphine appeared followed by two dames dhonneur she walked quite through the gallery across the area reserved for the court and passed out at the little gate in the railing which communicated with our side of the room leaving the place by the same door at which we had entered she was in high court dress with diamonds and lappets and was proceeding from her own apartments in the other wing of the palace to those of the king as she went within six feet of me i observed her hard and yet saddened countenance with interest for she has the reputation of dwelling on her early fortunes and of constantly anticipating evil of course she was saluted by all in passing but she hardly raised her eyes from the floor though favoured by my position i got a slight melancholy smile in return for my own bow  the dauphine had scarcely disappeared when her royal highness madame was announced and the duchess of berri went through in a similar manner her air was altogether less constrained and she had smiles and inclinations for all she passed she is a slight delicate little woman with large blue eyes a fair complexion and light hair she struck me as being less a bourbon than an austrian and though wanting in embonpoint she would be quite pretty but for a cast in one of her eyes  a minute or two later we had monseigneur le dauphin who passed through the gallery in the same manner as his wife and sisterinlaw he had been reviewing some troops and was in the uniform of a colonel of the guards booted to the knees and carrying a military hat in his hand he is not of commanding presence though i think he has the countenance of an amiable man and his face is decidedly bourbon we were indebted to the same lantern like construction of the palace for this preliminary glimpse at so many of the actors in the coming scene  after the passage of the dauphin a few courtiers and superior officers of the household began to appear within the railed space among them were five or six duchesses women of this rank have the privilege of being seated in the presence of the king on state occasions and tabourets were provided for them accordingly a tabouret is a stuffed stool nearly of the form of the ancient cerulean chair without its back for a back would make it a chair at once and by the etiquette of courts these are reserved for the bloodroyal ambassadors etc as none but duchesses could be seated at the grand couvert you may be certain none below that rank appeared there might have been a dozen present they were all in high court dresses one of great personal charms and quite young was seated near me and my neighbour an old abbé carried away by enthusiasm suddenly exclaimed to mequelle belle fortune monsieur dêtre jeune jolie et duchesse i dare say the lady had the same opinion of the matter  baron louis not the financier but the kings physician arrived it was his duty to stand behind the kings chair like sanchos tormentor and see that he did not overeat himself the ancient usages were very tender of the royal person if he travelled he had a spare litter or a spare coach to receive him in the event of accidenta practice that is continued to this day if he ate there was one to taste his food lest he might be poisoned and when he lay down to sleep armed sentinels watched at the door of his chamber most of these usages are still continued in some form or other and the ceremonies which are observed at these public dinners are mere memorials of the olden time  i was told the following anecdote by mad de  who was intimate with louis xviii one day in taking an airing the king was thirsty and sent a footman to a cottage for water the peasants appeared with some grapes which they offered as the homage of their condition the king took them and ate them notwithstanding the remonstrances of his attendants this little incident was spoken of at court where all the monarch does and says becomes matter of interest and the next time mad de  was admitted she joined her remonstrances to those of the other courtiers we no longer live in an age when kings need dread assassins said louis smiling a month passed and mad de  was again admitted she was received with a melancholy shake of the head and with tears the duc de berri had been killed in the interval  a few gentlemen who did not strictly belong to the court appeared among the duchesses but at the most there were but six or eight one of them however was the gayest looking personage i ever saw in the station of a gentleman being nothing but lace and embroidery even to the seams of his coat a sort of genteel harlequin the abbé who seemed to understand himself said he was a spanish grandee  i was near the little gate when an old man in a strictly court dress but plain and matteroffact in air made an application for admittance in giving way for him to pass my attention was drawn to his appearance the long white hair that hung down his face the cordon bleu the lame foot the imperturbable countenance and the unearthly aspect made me suspect the truth on inquiring i was right it was m de talleyrand he came as grand chamberlain to officiate at the dinner of his master  everything in a court goes by clockwork your little great may be out of time and affect a want of punctuality but a rigid attention to appointments is indispensable to those who are really in high situations a failure in this respect would produce the same impression on the affairs of men that a delay in the rising of the sun would produce on the day the appearance of the different personages named all so near each other was the certain sign that one greater than all could not be far behind they were the dawn of the royal presence accordingly the door which communicated with the apartments of the king and the only one within the railed space opened with the announcement of le service du roi when a procession of footmen of the palace appeared bearing the dishes of the first course all the vessels whether already on the table or those in their hands were of gold richly wrought or at least silver gilt i had no means of knowing which most probably they were of the former metal the dishes were taken from the footmen by pages of honour in scarlet dresses and by them placed in order on the table the first course was no sooner ready than we heard the welcome announcement of le roi the family immediately made their appearance at the same door by which the service had entered they were followed by a proper number of lords and ladies in waiting every one arose as a matter of course even to the jeunes jolies et duchesses and the music as became it gave us a royal crash the huissier in announcing the king spoke in a modest voice and less loud i observed than in announcing the dauphin and the ladies it was however a different person and it is probable one was a common huissier and the other a gentleman acting in that character  charles x is tall without being of a too heavy frame flexible of movement and decidedly graceful by remembering that he is king and the lineal chief of the ancient and powerful family of the bourbons by deferring properly to history and the illusions of the past and by feeling tant soit peu more respect for those of the present day than is strictly philosophical or perhaps wise it is certainly possible to fancy that he has a good deal of that peculiar port and majesty that the poetry of feeling is so apt to impute to sovereigns i know not whether it is the fault of a cynical temperament or of republican prejudices but i can see no more about him than the easy grace of an old gentleman accustomed all his life to be a principal personage among the principal personages of the earth this you may think was quite sufficientbut it aid not altogether satisfy the exigence of my unpoetical ideas his countenance betrayed a species of vacant bonhommie rather than of thought or dignity of mind and while he possessed in a singular degree the mere physical machinery of his rank he was wanting in the majesty of character and expression without which no man can act well the representation of royalty even a little more severity of aspect would have better suited the part and rendered le grand couvert encore plus grand  the king seated himself after receiving the salutations of the courtiers within the railing taking no notice however of those who by a fiction of etiquette were not supposed to be in his presence the rest of the family occupied their respective places in the order i have named and the eating and drinking began from the score the different courses were taken off and served by footmen and pages in the manner already described which after all by substituting servants out of livery for pages is very much the way great dinners are served in great houses all over europe  as soon as the king was seated the north door of the gallery or that on the side opposite to the place where i had taken post was opened and the public was admitted passing slowly through the room without stopping a droller mélange could not be imagined than presented itself in the panoramic procession and long before the grand couvert was over i thought it much the most amusing part of the scene very respectable persons gentlemen certainly and i believe in a few instances ladies came in this way to catch a glimpse of the spectacle i saw several men that i knew and the women with them could have been no other than their friends to these must be added cochers de fiacres in their glazed hats bonnes in their high norman caps peasants soldiers in their shakos épiciers and garçons without number the constant passage for it lasted without intermission for an hour and a half of so many queer faces reminded me strongly of one of those mechanical panoramas that bring towns streets and armies before the spectator one of the droll effects of this scene was produced by the faces all of which turned like sunflowers towards the light of royalty as the bodies moved steadily on thus on entering the eyes were a little inclined to the right as they got nearer to the meridian they became gradually bent more aside when opposite the table every face was full and in retiring all were bent backwards over their owners shoulders constantly offering a dense crowd of faces looking towards a common centre while the bodies were coming on or moving slowly off the stage this you will see resembled in some measure the revolutions of the moon around our orb matter and a king possessing the same beneficent attraction i make no doubt these good people thought we presented a curious spectacle but i am persuaded they presented one that was infinitely more so  i had seen in america in divers places an englishman a colonel in the army we had never been introduced but had sat opposite to each other at tables dhôtes jostled each other in the presidents house met in steamboats in the streets and in many other places until it was evident our faces were perfectly familiar to both parties and yet we never nodded spoke or gave any other sign of recognition than by certain knowing expressions of the eyes in europe the colonel reappeared we met in london in paris in the public walks in the sightseeing places of resort until we evidently began to think ourselves a couple of monsieur tonsons tonight as i was standing near the public platform whose face should appear in the halo of countenances but that of my colonel the poor fellow had a wooden leg and he was obliged to stump on in his orbit as well as he could while i kept my eye on him determined to catch a look of recognition if possible when he got so far forward as to bring me in his line of sight our eyes met and he smiled involuntarily then he took a deliberate survey of my comfortable position and he disappeared in the horizon with some such expression on his features as must have belonged to commodore trunnion when he called out to hatchway while the hunter was leaping over the lieutenant oh dn you you are well anchored  i do not think the dinner in a culinary point of view was anything extraordinary the king ate and drank but little for unlike his two brothers and predecessors he is said to be abstemious the daupin played a better knife and fork but on the whole the execution was by no means great for frenchmen the guests sat so far apart and the music made so much noise that conversation was nearly out of the question though the king and the dauphin exchanged a few words in the course of the evening each of the gentlemen also spoke once or twice to his female neighbour and that was pretty much the amount of the discourse the whole party appeared greatly relieved by having something to do during the desert in admiring the service which was of the beautiful sèvres china they all took up the plates and examined them attentively and really i was glad they had so rational an amusement to relieve their ennui  once early in the entertainment m de talleyrand approached the king and showed him the bill of fare it was an odd spectacle to see this old diplomate descending to the pantomime of royalty and acting the part of a maître dhôtel had the duty fallen on cambacères one would understand it and fancy that it might be well done the king smiled on him graciously and i presume gave him leave to retire for soon after this act of loyal servitude the prince disappeared as for m louis he treated charles better than his brother treated sancho for i did not observe the slightest interference on his part during the whole entertainment though one of those near me said he had tasted a dish or two by way of ceremonyan act of precaution that i did not myself observe i asked my neighbour the abbé what he thought of m de talleyrand after looking up in my face distrustfully he whisperedmais monsieur cest un chat qui tombe toujours sur ses pieds a remark that was literally true tonight for the old man was kept on his feet longer than could have been agreeable to the owner of two such gouty legs  the duchesse de berri who sat quite near the place where i stood was busy a good deal of the time à lorgner the public through her eyeglass this she did with very little diffidence of manner and quite as coolly as an english duchess would have stared at a late intimate whom she was disposed to cut it certainly was neither a graceful nor a feminine nor a princely occupation the dauphine played the bourbon better though when she turned her saddened not to say cruel eyes on the public it was with an expression that almost amounted to reproach i did not see her smile once during the whole time she was at table and yet i thought there were many things to smile at  at length the fingerbowls appeared and i was not sorry to see them contrary to what is commonly practised in very great houses the pages placed them on the table just as henri puts them before us democrats every day i ought to have said that the service was made altogether in front or at the unoccupied side of the table nothing but the bill of fare in the hands of m de talleyrand appearing in the rear as soon as this part of the dinner was over the king arose and the whole party withdrew by the door on the further side of the galery in passing the gradins of the ladies he stopped to says a few kind words to an old woman who was seated there muffled in a cloak and the light of royalty vanished  the catastrophe is to come the instant the kings back was turned the gallery became a scene of confusion the musicians ceased playing and began to chatter the pages dashed about to remove the service and everybody was in motion observing that your  was standing undecided what to do i walked into the railed area brushed past the gorgeous state table and gave her my arm she laughed and said it had all been very magnificent and amusing but that some one had stolen her shawl a few years before i had purchased for her a merino shawl of singular fineness simplicity and beauty it was now old and she had worn it on this occasion because she distrusted the dirt of a palace and laying it carelessly by her side in the course of the evening she had found in its place a very common thing of the same colour the thief was deceived by its appearance your  being dressed for an evening party and had probably mistaken it for a cashmere so much for the company one meets at court too much importance however must not be attached to this little contretems as people of condition are apt to procure tickets for such places and to give them to their femmes de chambre probably half the women present the jeunes et jolies excepted were of this class but mentioning this affair to the old princesse de  she edified me by an account of the manner in which madame la comtesse de  had actually appropriated to the service of her own pretty person the cachemire of madame la baronne de  in the royal presence and how there was a famous quarrel à loutrance about it so i suspend my opinions as to the quality of the thief     letter x  road to versaillesorigin of versaillesthe present

laboured description of a place about which men have written and talked these two centuries it is impossible to pass over a spot of so much celebrity in total silence  the road to versailles lies between the park of st cloud and the village and manufactories of sèvres a little above the latter is a small palace called meudon which from its great elevation commands a fine view of paris the palace of st cloud of course stands in the park versailles lies six or eight miles farther west compiègne is about fifty miles from paris in one direction fontainebleau some thirty in another and rambouillet rather more remotely in a third all these palaces except versailles are kept up and from time to time are visited by the court versailles was stripped of its furniture in the revolution and even napoleon at a time when the french empire extended from hamburgh to rome shrunk from the enormous charge of putting it in a habitable state it is computed that the establishment at versailles first and last in matters of construction merely cost the french monarchy two hundred millions of dollars this is almost an incredible sum when we remember the low price of wages in france but on the other hand when we consider the vastness of the place how many natural difficulties were overcome and the multitude of works from the hands of artists of the first order it contained it scarcely seems sufficient  versailles originated as a huntingseat in the time of louis xiii in that age most of the upland near paris in this direction lay in forest royal chases and as hunting was truly a princely sport numberless temporary residences of this nature existed in the neighbourhood of the capital there are still many remains of this barbarous magnificence as in the wood of vincennes the forest of st germain compiègne fontainebleau and divers others but great inroads have been made in their limits by the progress of civilization and the wants of society so lately as the reign of louis xv they hunted quite near the town and we are actually at this moment dwelling in a country house at st ouen in which tradition hatch it he was wont to take his refreshments  the original building at versailles was a small chateau of a very ugly formation and it was built of bricks i believe it was enlarged but not entirely constructed by louis xiii a portion of this building is still visible having been embraced in the subsequent structures and judging from its architecture i should think it must be nearly as ancient as the time of francis i around this modest nucleus was constructed by a succession of monarchs but chiefly by louis xiv the most regal residence of europe in magnificence and extent if not in taste  the present chateau besides containing numberless wings and courts has vast casernes for the quarters of the household troops stables for many hundred horses and is surrounded by a great many separate hotels for the accommodation of the courtiers it offers a front on the garden in a single continuous line that is broken only by a projection in the centre of more than a third of a mile in length this is the only complete part of the edifice that possesses uniformity the rest of it being huge piles grouped around irregular courts or thrown forward in wings that correspond to the huge body like those of the ostrich there is on the front next the town however some attempt at simplicity and intelligibility of plan for there is a vast open court lined by buildings which have been commenced in the grecian style napoleon i believe did something here from which there is reason to suppose that he sometimes thought of inhabiting the palace indeed so long as france has a king it is impossible that such a truly royal abode can ever be wholly deserted at present it is the fashion to grant lodgings in it to dependants and favourites nothing that i have seen gives me so just and so imposing an idea of the old french monarchy as a visit to versailles apart from the vastness and splendour of the palace here is a town that actually contained in former times a hundred thousand souls that entirely owed its existence to the presence of the court other monarchs lived in large towns but here was a monarch whose presence created one figure to yourself the style of the prince when a place more populous than baltimore and infinitely richer in externals existed merely as an appendage to his abode  the celebrated garden contains two or three hundred acres of land besides the ground that is included in the gardens of the two trianons these trianons are small palaces erected in the gardens as if the occupants of the chateau having reached the acmé of magnificence and splendour in the principal residence were seeking refuge against the effect of satiety in these humbler abodes they appear small and insignificant after the palace but the great trianon is a considerable house and contains a fine suite of apartments among which are some very good rooms there are few english abodes of royalty that equal even this of le grand trianon the petit trianon was the residence of madame de maintenon it afterwards was presented to the unfortunate marie antoinette who in part converted its grounds into an english garden in addition to setting aside a portion into what is called la petite suisse  we went through this exceedingly pretty house and its gardens with melancholy interest the first is merely a pavilion in the italian taste though it is about half as large as the presidents house at washington i should think the great trianon has quite twice the room of our own executive residence and as you can well imagine from what has already been said the capitol itself would be but a speck among the endless edifices of the chateau the projection in the centre of the latter is considerably larger than the capitol and it materially exceeds that building in cubic contents now this projection is but a small part indeed of the long line of façade it actually appearing too short for the ranges of wings  marie antoinette was much censured for the amusements in which she indulged in the grounds of the little trianon and vulgar rumour exaggerating their nature no small portion of her personal unpopularity is attributable to this cause the family of louis xvi appears to have suffered for the misdeeds of its predecessors for it not being very easy to fancy anything much worse than the immoralities of louis xv the public were greatly disposed to visit the sins of the fathers on the children  la petite suisse is merely a romantic portion of the garden in which has been built what is called the swiss hamlet it contains the miniature abodes of the curé the farmer the dairywoman the gardedechasse and the seigneur besides the mill there is not much that is swiss however about the place with the exception of some resemblance in the exterior of the buildings here it is said the royal family used occasionally to meet and pass an afternoon in a silly representation of rural life that must have proved to be a prodigious caricature the king at least so the guide affirmed performed the part of the seigneur and occupied the proper abode the queen was the dairy woman and we were shown the marble tables that held her porcelain milkpans the present king as became his notorious propensity to fieldsports was the gardedechasse the late king was the miller and mirabile dictu the archbishop of paris did not disdain to play the part of the curé there was probably a good deal of poetry in this account though it is pretty certain that the queen did indulge in some of these phantasies there happened to be with me the day i visited this spot an american from our own mountains who had come fresh from home with all his provincial opinions and habits strong about him as the guide explained these matters i translated them literally into english for the benefit of my companion adding that the fact rendered the queen extremely unpopular with her subjects unpopular exclaimed my country neighbour why so sir i cannot say perhaps they thought it was not a fit amusement for a queen my mountaineer stood a minute cogitating the affair in his american mind and then nodding his head he saidi understand it now the people thought that a king and queen coming from yonder palace to amuse themselves in this toy hamlet in the characters of poor people were making game of them i do not know whether this inference will amuse you as much as it did me at the time  of the gardens and the jets deau so renowned i shall say little the former are in the old french style formal and stiff with long straight allées but magnificent by their proportions and ornaments the statuary and vases that are exposed to the open air in this garden must have cost an enormous sum they are chiefly copies from the antique  as you stand on the great terrace before the centre of the palace the view is down the principal avenue which terminates at the distance of two or three miles with a low naked hill beyond which appears the void of the firmament this conceit singularly helps the idea of vastness though in effect it is certainly inferior to the pastoral prettiness and rural thoughts of modern landscape gardening probably too much is attempted here for if the mind cannot conceive of illimitable space still less can it be represented by means of material substances  we examined the interior of the palace with melancholy pleasure the vast and gorgeous apartments were entirely without furniture though many of the pictures still remain the painted ceilings and the gildings too contribute to render the rooms less desolate than they would otherwise have been i shall not stop to describe the saloons of peace and war and all the other celebrated apartments that are so named from the subjects of their paintings but merely add that the state apartments lie en suite in the main body of the building and that the principal room or the great gallery as it is termed is in the centre with the windows looking up the main avenue of the garden this gallery greatly surpasses in richness and size any other room intended for the ordinary purposes of a palace that i have ever seen its length exceeds two hundred and thirty feet its width is about thirtyfive and its height is rather more than forty the walls are a complete succession of marbles mirrors and gildings i believe the windows and doors excepted that literally no part of the sides or ends of this room show any other material even some of the doors are loaded with these decorations the ceiling is vaulted and gorgeous with allegories and gildings they are painted by the best artists of france here louis xiv moved among his courtiers more like a god than a man and here was exhibited that mixture of grace and moral fraud of elegance and meanness of hope and disappointment of pleasure and mortification that form the characters and compose the existence of courtiers  i do not know the precise number of magnificent antechambers and saloons through which we passed to reach this gallery but there could not have been less than eight one of which as a specimen of the scale on which the palace is built is near eighty feet long and sixty wide continuing our course along the suite we passed among others a councilroom that looked more like state than business and then came to the apartments of the queen there were several drawingrooms and ballrooms and cardrooms and anterooms and the change from the gorgeousness of the state apartments to the neat tasteful chaste feminine white and gold of this part of the palace was agreeable for i had got to be tired of splendour and was beginning to feel a disposition to make game of the people by descending to rusticity  the bedroom of marie antoinette is in the suite it is a large chamber in the same style of ornament as the rest of her rooms and the dressingrooms bath and other similar conveniences were in that exquisite french taste which can only be equalled by imitation the chamber of the king looked upon the court and was connected with that of the queen by a winding and intricate communication of some length the door that entered the apartments of the latter opened into a dressingroom and both this door and that which communicated with the bedroom form a part of the regular wall being tapestried as such so as not to be immediately seena style of finish that is quite usual in french houses it was owing to this circumstance that marie antoinette made her escape undetected to the kings chamber the night the palace was entered by the fishwomen  we saw the rooms in which louis xiv and louis xv died the latter you may remember fell a victim to the smallpox and the disgusting body that had so lately been almost worshipped was deserted the moment he was dead it was left for hours without even the usual decent observances it was on the same occasion we have been told that his grandchildren including the heir were assembled in a private drawingroom waiting the result when they were startled by a hurried trampling of feet it was the courtiers rushing in a crowd to pay their homage to the new monarch all these things forced themselves painfully on our minds as we walked through the state rooms indeed there are few things that can be more usefully studied or which awaken a greater source of profitable recollections than a palace that has been occupied by a great and historical court still they are not poetical  the balcony in which la fayette appeared with the queen and her children opens from one of these rooms it overlooks the inner court or that in which the carriages of none but the privileged entered for all these things were regulated by arbitrary rules no one for instance was permitted to ride in the kings coach unless his nobility dated from a certain century the fourteenth i believe and these were your gentilshommes for the word implies more than a noble meaning an ancient nobleman  the writing cabinet private diningroom councilroom in ordinary library etc of the king came next the circuit ending in the salles des gardes and the apartments usually occupied by the officers and troops on service  there was one room we got into i scarce know how it was a long high gallery plainly finished for a palace and it seemed to be lighted from an interior court or well for one was completely caged when in it this was the celebrated bulls eye oeil de boeuf where the courtiers danced attendance before they were received it got its name from an oval window over the principal door  we looked at no more than the state apartments and those of the king and queen and yet we must have gone through some thirty or forty rooms of which the baths and dressingroom of the queen excepted the very smallest would be deemed a very large room in america perhaps no private house contains any as large as the smallest of these rooms with the exception of here and there a hall in a country house and no room at all with ceilings nearly as high and as noble to say nothing of the permanent decorations of which we have no knowledge whatever if we omit the windowglass and the mantels in both of which size apart we often beat even the french palaces  we next proceeded to the salle de spectacle which is a huge theatre it may not be as large as the french operahouse at paris but its dimensions did not appear to me to be much less it is true the stage was open and came into the view but it is a very large house for dramatic representations now neither this building nor the chapel seen on the exterior of the palace though additions that project from the regular line of wall obtrudes itself on the eye more than a verandah attached to a window on one of our largest houses in this place the celebrated dinner was given to the officers of the guards  the chapel is rich and beautiful no catholic church has pews or at all events they are very unusual though the municipalities do sometimes occupy them in france and of course the area was vacant we were most struck with the paintings on the ceiling in which the face of louis xiv was strangely and mystically blended with that of god the father pictorial and carved representations of the saviour and of the virgin abound in all catholic countries nor do they much offend unless when the crucifixion is represented with bleeding wounds for as both are known to have appeared in the human form the mind is not shocked at seeing them in the semblance of humanity but this was the first attempt to delineate the deity we had yet seen and it caused us all to shudder he is represented in the person of an old man looking from the clouds in the centre of the ceiling and the king appears among the angels that surround him flattery could not go much farther without encroaching on omnipotence itself  in returning from versailles to a tithe of the magnificence of which i have not alluded i observed carts coming out of the side of a hill loaded with the whitish stone that composes the building material of paris we stopped the carriage and went into the passage where we found extensive excavations a lane of fifteen or twenty feet was cut through the stone and the material was carted away in heavy square blocks piers were left at short intervals to sustain the superincumbent earth and in the end the place gets to be a succession of intricate passages separated by these piers which resemble so many small masses of houses among the streets of a town the entire region around paris lies on a substratum of this stone which indurates by exposure to the air and the whole secret of the celebrated catacombs of paris is just the same as that of this quarry with the difference that this opens on a level with the upper world lying in a hill while one is compelled to descend to get to the level of the others but enormous wheels scattered about the fields in the vicinity of the town show where shafts descend to new quarries on the plains which are precisely the same as those under paris the history of these subterranean passages is very simple the stone beneath has been transferred to the surface as a building material and the graves of the town after centuries were emptied into the vaults below any apprehensions of the caverns falling in on a great scale are absurd as the constant recurrence of the piers which are the living rock must prevent such a calamity though it is within the limits of possibility that a house or two might disappear quite lately it is said a tree in the garden of the luxembourg fell through owing to the water working a passage down into the quarries by following its roots the top of the tree remained above ground some distance and to prevent unnecessary panic the police immediately caused the place to be concealed by a high and close board fence the tree was cut away in the night the hole was filled up and few knew anything about it but it is scarcely possible that any serious accident should occur even to a single house without a previous and gradual sinking of its walls giving notice of the event the palace of the luxembourg one of the largest and finest edifices of paris stands quite near the spot where the tree fell through and yet there is not the smallest danger of the structures disappearing some dark night the piers below always affording sufficient support au reste the catacombs lie under no other part of paris than the quartier st jacques not crossing the river nor reaching even the faubourg st germain  i have taken you so unceremoniously out of the chateau of versailles to put you into the catacombs that some of the royal residences have not received the attention i intended we have visited compiègne this summer including it in a little excursion of about a hundred miles that we made in the vicinity of the capital though it scarcely offered sufficient matter of interest to be the subject of an especial letter we found the forest deserving of its name and some parts of it almost as fine as an old american wood of the second class we rode through it five or six miles to see a celebrated ruin called pierrefond which was one of those baronial holds out of which noble robbers used to issue to plunder on the highway and commit all sorts of acts of genteel violence the castle and the adjacent territory formed one of the most ancient seigneuries of france the place was often besieged and taken in the time of henry iv that monarch finding the castle had fallen into the hands of a set of desperadoes who were ranked with the leaguers sent the duc depernon against the place but he was wounded and obliged to raise the siege marshal biron was next despatched with all the heavy artillery that could be spared but he met with little better success this roused henry who finally succeeded in getting possession of the place in the reign of his son louis xiii the robberies and excesses of those who occupied the castle became so intolerable that the government seized it again and ordered it to be destroyed now you will remember that this castle stood in the very heart of france within fifty miles of the capital and but two leagues from a royal residence and all so lately as the year 1617 and that it was found necessary to destroy it on account of the irregularities of its owners what an opinion one is driven to form of the moral civilization of europe from a fact like this feudal grandeur loses greatly in a comparison with modern law and more humble honesty  it was easier however to order the chateau de pierrefond to be destroyed than to effect that desirable object little more was achieved than to make cuts into the external parts of the towers and walls and to unroof the different buildings and although this was done two hundred years since time has made little impression on the ruins we were shown a place where there had been an attempt to break into the walls for stones but which had been abandoned because it was found easier to quarry them from the living rock the principal towers were more than a hundred feet high and their angles and ornaments seemed to be as sharp and solid as ever this was much the noblest french ruin we had seen and it may be questioned if there are many finer out of italy in europe  the palace of compiègne after that of versailles hardly rewarded us for the trouble of examining it still it is large and in perfect repair but the apartments are commonplace though there are a few that are good a prince however is as well lodged even here as is usual in the north of europe the present king is fond of resorting to this house on account of the game of the neighbouring forest we saw several roebucks bounding among the trees in our drive to pierrefond13  footnote 13 pierrefond or pierrefont  i have dwelt on the palaces and the court so much because one cannot get a correct idea of what france was and perhaps i ought to say of what france through the reaction will be if this point were overlooked the monarch was all in all in the nationthe centre of light wealth and honour letters the arts and the sciences revolved around him as the planets revolve around the sun and if there ever was a civilized people whose example it would be fair to quote for or against the effects of monarchy i think it would be the people of france i was surprised at my own ignorance on the subject of the magnificence of these kings of which indeed it is not easy for an untravelled american to form any just notion and it has struck me you might be glad to hear a little on these points  after all i have said i find i have entirely omitted the orangery at versailles but then i have said little or nothing of the canals the jets deau of the great and little parks which united are fifty miles in circumference and of a hundred other things still as this orangery is on a truly royal scale it deserves a word of notice before i close my letter the trees are housed in winter in long vaulted galleries beneath the great terrace and there is a sort of subcourt in front of them where they are put into the sun during the pleasant season this place is really an orange grove and although every tree is in a box and is nursed like a child many of them are as large as it is usual to find in the orange groves of low latitudes several are very old two or three dating from the fifteenth century and one from the early part of it what notions do you get of the magnificence of the place when you are told that a palace subterraneous it is true is devoted to this single luxury and that acres are covered with trees in boxes     letter xi  laws of intercourseamericans in europeamericans and english visiting in americaetiquette of visitspresentations at foreign courtsroyal receptionsamerican pridepay of the president american diplomatist   to james stevenson esquire albany  i intend this letter to be useful rather than entertaining living as we americans do remote from the rest of the world and possessing so many practices peculiar to ourselves at the same time that we are altogether wanting in usages that are familiar to most other nations it should not be matter of surprise that we commit some mistakes on this side of the water in matters of taste and etiquette a few words simply expressed and a few explanations plainly made may serve to remove some errors and perhaps render your own contemplated visit to this part of the world more agreeable  there is no essential difference in the leading rules of ordinary intercourse among the polished of all christian nations though some of these rules may appear arbitrary it will be found on examination that they are usually derived from very rational and sufficient motives they may vary in immaterial points but even these variations arise from some valid circumstance  the american towns are growing so rapidly that they are getting to have the population of capitals without enjoying their commonest facilities the exaggerated tone of our largest towns for instance forbids the exchange of visits by means of servants it may suit the habits of provincial life to laugh at this as an absurdity but it may be taken pretty safely as a rule that men and women of as much common sense as the rest of their fellowcreatures with the best opportunities of cultivating all those tastes that are dependant on society and with no other possible motive than convenience would not resort to such a practice without a suitable inducement no one who has not lived in a large town that does possess these facilities can justly appreciate their great advantages or properly understand how much a place like new york with its three hundred thousand inhabitants loses by not adopting them we have conventions for all sorts of things in america some of which do good and others harm but i cannot imagine anything that would contribute more to the comfort of society than one which should settle the laws of intercourse on principles better suited to the real condition of the country than those which now exist it is not unusual to read descriptions deriding the forms of europe written by travelling americans but i must think they have been the productions of very young travellers or at least of such as have not had the proper means of appreciating the usages they ridicule taking my own experience as a guide i have no hesitation in saying that i know no people among whom the ordinary social intercourse is as uncomfortable and as little likely to stand the test of a rational examination as our own  the first rule allimportant for an american to know is that the latest arrival makes the first visit england is in some respects an exception to this practice but i believe it prevails in all the rest of europe i do not mean to say that departures are not made from this law in particular instances but they should always be taken as exceptions and as pointed compliments this rule has many conveniences and i think it also shows a more delicate attention to sentiment and feeling while the points of intrusion and of disagreeable acquaintances are left just where they would be under our own rule the stranger is made the judge of his own wishes it is moreover impossible in a large town to know of every arrival many americans who come to europe with every claim to attention pass through it nearly unnoticed from a hesitation about obtruding themselves on others under the influence of the opinions in which they have been educated this for a long time was my own case and it was only when a more familiar acquaintance with the practices of this part of the world made me acquainted with their advantages that i could consent freely to put myself forward  you are not to understand that any stranger arriving in a place like paris or london has a right to leave cards for whom he pleases it is not the custom except for those who by birth or official station or a high reputation may fairly deem themselves privileged to assume this liberty and even then it is always better to take some preliminary step to assure ones self that the visit will be acceptable the law of salutes is very much the law of visits in this part of the world the ship arriving sends an officer to know if his salute will be returned gun for gun and the whole affair it is true is conducted in rather a categorical manner but the governing principles are the same in both cases though more management may be required between two gentlemen than between two menofwar  the americans in europe on account of the countrys having abjured all the old feudal distinctions that still so generally prevail here labour under certain disadvantages that require on the one hand much tact and discretion to overcome and on the other occasionally much firmness and decision  the rule i have adopted in my own case is to defer to every usage in matters of etiquette so far as i have understood them that belongs to the country in which i may happen to be if as has sometimes happened but not in a solitary instance in france the claims of a stranger have been overlooked i have satisfied myself by remembering that in this respect at least the americans are the superiors for that is a point in which we seldom fail and if they are remembered to accept of just as much attention as shall be offered in cases in which those arbitrary distinctions are set up that by the nature of our institutions cannot either in similar or in any parallel cases exist in america and the party making the pretension is on neutral ground if the claim be in any manner pressed i would say that it became an american to resist it promptly neither to go out of his way to meet it nor to defer to it when it crosses his path in really good society awkward cases of this nature are not very likely to occur they are however more likely to occur as between our own people and the english than between those of any other nation for the latter in mixed general associations have scarcely yet learned to look upon and treat us as the possessors of an independent country it requires perfect selfpossession great tact and some nerve for an american who is brought much in contact with the english on the continent of europe to avoid a querulous and ungentlemanlike disposition to raise objections on these points and at the same time to maintain the position and command the respect with which he should never consent to dispense from my own little experience i should say we are better treated and have less to overlook in our intercourse with the higher than with the intermediate classes of the english  you will have very different accounts of these points from some of our travellers i only give you the results of my own observation under the necessary limitations of my own opportunities still i must be permitted to say that too many of our people in their habitual deference to england mistake offensive condescension for civility of the two i will confess i would rather encounter direct arrogance than the assumption of a right to be affable the first may at least be resisted of all sorts of superiority that of a condescending quality is the least palatable  i believe washington is the only place in america where it is permitted to send cards in every other town unless accompanied by an invitation and even then the card is supposed to be left it would be viewed as airs it is even equivocal to leave a card in person unless denied nothing can be worse adapted to the wants of american society than this rigid conformity to facts without porters with dwellings in which the kitchens and servants halls are placed just as far from the streetdoors as dimensions of the houses will allow with large straggling towns that cover as much ground as the more populous capitals of europe and these towns not properly divided into quarters with a society as ambitious of effect in its way as any i know and with people more than usually occupied with business and the family caresone is expected to comply rigidly with the most formal rules of village propriety it is easy to trace these usages to their source provincial habits and rustic manners but towns with three hundred thousand inhabitants ought to be free from both such rigid conditions cannot well be observed and a consequence already to be traced is that those forms of society which tend to refine it and to render it more human and graceful are neglected from sheer necessity carelessness in the points of association connected with sentiment and all personal civilities and attention have this root grows upon one like carelessness in dress until an entire community may get to be as ungracious in deportment as it is unattractive in attire  the etiquette of visits here is reduced to a sort of science a card is sent by a servant and returned by a servant it is polite to return it next day though three i believe is the lawful limits and it is politer still to return it the day it is received there is no affectation about sending the card as it is not at all unusual to put ep en personne on it by way of expressing a greater degree of attention even when the card is sent when the call is really made in person though the visitor does not ask to be admitted it is also common to request the porter to say that the party was at the gate all these niceties may seem absurd and supererogatory but depend on it they have a direct and powerful agency in refining and polishing intercourse just as begging a mans pardon when you tread on his toe has an effect to humanize though the parties know no offence was intended circumstances once rendered it proper that i should leave a card for a russian diplomate an act that i took care he should know indirectly i went out of my way to do as an acknowledgment for the civilities his countrymen showed to us americans my name was left at the gate of his hotel it was not in paris as i was taking a morning ride on returning home after an absence of an hour i found his card lying on my table instead however of its containing the usual official titles it was simply prince  i was profoundly emerged in the study of this new feature in the forms of etiquette when the friend who had prepared the way for the visit entered i asked an explanation and he told me that i had received a higher compliment than could be conveyed by a merely official card this being a proffer of personal attention you will get an invitation to dinner soon and sure enough one came before he had quitted the house now here was a delicate and flattering attention paid and one that i felt without trouble to either party one that the occupations of the diplomate would scarcely permit him to pay except in extraordinary cases under rules more rigid  there is no obligation on a stranger to make the first visit certainly but if he do not he is not to be surprised if no one notices him it is a matter of delicacy to obtrude on the privacy of such a person it being presumed that he wishes to be retired we have passed some time in a village near paris which contains six or eight visitable families with one of these i had some acquaintance and we exchanged civilities but wishing to be undisturbed i extended my visit no farther and i never saw anything of the rest of my neighbours they waited for me to make the advances  a person in society here who is desirous of relieving himself for a time from the labour and care of maintaining the necessary intercourse can easily do it by leaving cards of ppo it might be awkward to remain long in a place very publicly after such a step but i ventured on it once to extricate myself from engagements that interfered with more important pursuits with entire success i met several acquaintances in the street after the cards were sent and we even talked together but i got no more visits or invitations when ready to return to town all i had to do was to leave cards again and things went on as if nothing had happened i parried one or two allusions to my absence and had no further difficulty the only awkward part of it was that i accepted an invitation to dine en famille with a literary friend and one of the guests of whom there were but three happened to be a person whose invitation to dinner i had declined on account of quitting town as he was a sensible man i told him the simple fact and we laughed at the contretems and drank oar wine in peace  the americans who come abroad frequently complain of a want of hospitality in the public agents there is a strong disposition in every man under institutions like our own to mistake himself for a part of the government in matters with which he has no proper connexion while too many totally overlook those interests which it is their duty to watch in the first place the people of the united slates do not give salaries to their ministers of sufficient amount to authorize them to expect that any part of the money should be returned in the way of personal civilities fifty thousand francs a year is the usual sum named by the french as the money necessary to maintain a genteel town establishment with moderate evening entertainments and an occasional dinner this is three thousand francs more than the salary of the minister out of which he is moreover expected to maintain his regular diplomatic intercourse it is impossible for any one to do much in the way of personal civilities on such an allowance  there is moreover on the part of too many of our people an aptitude to betray a jealous sensitiveness on the subject of being presented at foreign courts i have known some claim it as a right when it is yielded to the minister himself as an act of grace the receptions of a sovereign are merely his particular mode of receiving visits no one will pretend that the president of the united states is obliged to give levees and dinners nor is a king any more compelled to receive strangers or even his own subjects unless it suit his policy and his taste his palace is his house and he is the master of it the same as any other man is master of his own abode it is true the public expects something of him and his allowance is probably regulated by this expectation but the interference does not go so far as to point out his company some kings pass years without holding a court at all others receive every week the public obligation to open his door is no more than an obligation of expediency of which he and he only can be the judge this being the rule not only propriety but fair dealing requires that all who frequent a court should comply with the conditions that are understood to be implied in the permission while there exists an exaggerated opinion on the part of some of our people on the subject of the fastidiousness of princes as respects their associates there exists among others very confused notions on the other side of the question a monarch usually cares very little about the quarterings and the nobility of the person he receives but he always wishes his court to be frequented by people of education accomplishments and breeding in europe these qualities are confined to castes and beyond a question as a general practice every king would not only prefer but were there a necessity for it he would command that his doors should be closed against all others unless they came in a character different from that of courtiers this object has in effect been obtained by establishing a rule that no one who has not been presented at his own court can claim to be presented at any foreign european court thus leaving each sovereign to see that no one of his own subjects shall travel with this privilege who would be likely to prove an unpleasant guest to any other prince but we have neither any prince nor any court and the minister is left to decide for himself who is and who is not proper to be presented  let us suppose a case a master and his servant make a simultaneous request to be presented to the king of france both are american citizens and if either has any political claim beyond mere courtesy to have his request attended to both have the minister is left to decide for himself he cannot so far abuse the courtesy that permits him to present his countrymen at all as to present the domestic and of course he declines doing it in this case perhaps public opinion would sustain him as unluckily the party of the domestics is small in america the duties usually falling to the share of foreigners and blacks but the principle may be carried upwards until a point is attained where a minister might find it difficult to decide between that which his own sense of propriety should dictate and that which others might be disposed to claim all other ministers get rid of their responsibility by the acts of their own courts but the minister of the republic is left exposed to the calumny abuse and misrepresentation of any disappointed individual should he determine to do what is strictly right  under these circumstances it appears to me that there are but two courses left for any agent of our government to pursue either to take official rank as his only guide or to decline presenting any one it is not his duty to act as a master of ceremonies every court has a regular officer for this purpose and any one who has been presented himself is permitted on proper representations to present others the trifling disadvantage will be amply compensated for by the great and peculiar benefits that arise from our peculiar form of government  these things will quite likely strike you as of little moment they are however of more concern than one living in the simple society of america may at first suppose the etiquette of visiting has of course an influence on the entire associations of a traveller and may not be overlooked while the single fact that one people were practically excluded from the european courts would have the same effect on their other enjoyments here that it has to exclude an individual from the most select circles of any particular town ordinary life is altogether coloured by things that in themselves may appear trifling but which can no more be neglected with impunity than one can neglect the varying fashions in dress  the americans are not a shoving people like their cousins the english their fault in this particular lies in a morbid pride with a stubbornness that is the result of a limited experience and which is too apt to induce them to set up their own provincial notions as the standard and to throw them backward into the intrenchments of selfesteem this feeling is peculiarly fostered by the institutions it is easy to err in this manner and it is precisely the failing of the countryman everywhere when he first visits town it is in fact the fault of ignorance of the world by referring to what i have just told you it will be seen that these are the very propensities which will be the most likely to make one uncomfortable in europe where so much of the initiative of intercourse is thrown upon the shoulders of the stranger  i cannot conclude this letter without touching on another point that suggests itself at the moment it is the fashion to decry the niggardliness of the american government on the subject of money as compared with those of this hemisphere nothing can be more unjust our working men are paid better than even those of england with the exception of a few who have high dignities to support i do not see the least necessity for giving the president a dollar more than he gets today since all he wants is enough to entertain handsomely and to shield him from loss under our system we never can have an exclusive court nor is it desirable for in this age a court is neither a school of manners nor a school of anything else that is estimable these facts are sufficiently proved by england a country whose mental cultivation and manners never stood as high as they do today and yet it has virtually been without a court for an entire generation a court may certainly foster taste and elegance but they may be quite as well fostered by other and less exclusive means but while the president may receive enough the heads of departments at home and the foreign ministers of the country are not more than half paid particularly the latter the present minister is childless his establishment and his manner of living are both handsome but not a bit more so than those of a thousand others who inhabit this vast capital and his intercourse with his colleagues is not greater than is necessary to the interests of his country now i know from his own statement that his expenses without a family exceed by one hundred per cent his salary with a personal income of eighty to a hundred thousand francs a years he can bear this drain on his private fortune but he is almost the only minister we ever had here who could  the actual position of our diplomatic agents in europe is little understood at home there are but two or three modes of maintaining the rights of a nation to say nothing of procuring those concessions from others which enter into the commercial relations of states and in some degree affect their interests the best method certainly as respects the two first is to manifest a determination to defend them by an appeal to force but so many conflicting interests stand in the way of such a policy that it is exceedingly difficult wisest and safest in the end though it be to carry it out properly at any rate such a course has never yet been in the power of the american government whatever it may be able to do hereafter with its increasing numbers and growing wealth but even strength is not always sufficient to obtain voluntary and friendly concessions for principle must in some degree be respected by the most potent people or they will be put to the ban of the world long diplomatic letters although they may answer the purposes of ministerial exposés and read well enough in the columns of a journal do very little in fact as makeweights in negotiations i have been told here sub rosâ and i believe it that some of our laboured efforts in this way to obtain redress in the protracted negotiation for indemnity have actually lain months in the bureaux unread by those who alone have power to settle the question some commis perhaps may have cursorily related their contents to his superior but the superior himself is usually too much occupied in procuring and maintaining ministerial majorities or in looking after the monopolizing concerns of european politics to wade through folios of elaborate argument in manuscript the public ought to understand that the point presents itself to him in the security of his masters capital and with little or no apprehension of its coming to an appeal to arms very differently from what it occasionally presents itself in the pages of a presidents message or in a debate in congress he has so many demands on his time that it is even difficult to have a working interview with him at all and when one is obtained it is not usual to do more than to go over the preliminaries the details are necessarily referred to subordinates  now in such a state of things any one accustomed to the world can readily understand how much may be effected by the kind feelings that are engendered by daily social intercourse a few words can be whispered in the ears of a minister in the corner of a drawingroom that would never reach him in his bureau then all the ministers are met in society while the diplomate properly speaking can claim officially to see but one in short in saving out of an overflowing treasury a few thousand dollars a year we trifle with our own interests frequently embarrass our agents and in some degree discredit the country i am not one of your sensitives on the subject of parade and appearance nor a member of the embroidery school still i would substitute for the irrational frippery of the european customs a liberal hospitality and a real elegance that should speak well for the hearts and tastes of the nation the salary of the minister at paris i know it by the experience of a housekeeper ought to be increased by at least one half and it would tell better for the interests of the country were it doubled even in this case however i do not conceive that an american would be justified in mistaking the house of an envoy for a national inn but that the proper light to view his allowances would be to consider them as made first as an act of justice to the functionary himself next as a measure of expediency as connected with the important interests of the country as it is i am certain that no one but a man of fortune can accept a foreign appointment without committing injustice to his heirs and i believe few do accept them without sincerely regretting the step in after years     letter xii  sir walter scott in parisconversation with himcopyright in americamiss scottfrench complimentssir walter scotts person and mannersignorance as to americafrench commercefrench translationsamerican luxury   to james e de kay esquire  we have not only had mr canning in paris but sir walter scott has suddenly appeared among us the arrival of the great unknown or indeed of any little unknown from england would be an event to throw all the reading clubs at home into a state of high moral and poetical excitement we are true village lionizers as the professors of the catholic religion are notoriously more addicted to yielding faith to miraculous interventions in the remoter dioceses than in rome itself as loyalty is always more zealous in a colony than in a court as fashions are more exaggerated in a province than in a capital and men are more prodigious to every one else than their own valetsso do we throw the haloes of a vast ocean around the honoured heads of the celebrated men of this eastern hemisphere this perhaps is the natural course of things and is as unavoidable as that the sun shall hold the earth within the influence of its attraction until matters shall be reversed by the earths becoming the larger and more glorious orb of the two not so in paris here men of every gradation of celebrity from napoleon down to the psalmanazar of the day are so very common that one scarcely turns round in the streets to look at them delicate and polite attentions however fall as much to the share of reputation here as in any other country and perhaps more so as respects literary men though there is so little wondermongering it would be quite impossible that the presence of sir walter scott should not excite a sensation he was frequently named in the journals received a good deal of private and some public notice but on the whole much less of both i think than one would have a right to expect for him in a place like paris i account for the fact by the french distrusting the forthcoming work on napoleon and by a little dissatisfaction which prevails on the subject of the tone of pauls letters to his kinsfolk this feeling may surprise you as coming from a nation as old and as great as france but alas we are all human  the king spoke to him in going to his chapel sir walter being in waiting for that purpose but beyond this i believe he met with no civilities from the court  as for myself circumstances that it is needless to recount had brought me to a slight degree within the notice of sir walter scott though we had never met nor had i ever seen him even in public so as to know his person still i was not without hopes of being more fortunate now while i felt a delicacy about obtruding myself any further on his time and attention several days after his arrival went by however without my good luck bringing me in his way and i began to give the matter up though the princesse  with whom i had the advantage of being on friendly terms flattered me with an opportunity of seeing the great writer at her house for she had a fixed resolution of making his acquaintance before he left paris coûte que coûte  it might have been ten days after the arrival of sir walter scott that i had ordered a carriage one morning with an intention of driving over to the other side of the river and had got as far as the lower flight of steps on my way to enter it when by the tramping of horses in the court i found that another coach was driving in it was raining and as my own carriage drove from the door to make way for the newcomer i stopped where i was until it could return the carriagesteps rattled and presently a large heavymoulded man appeared in the door of the hotel he was grey and limped a little walking with a cane his carriage immediately drove round and was succeeded by mine again so i descended we passed each other on the stairs bowing as a matter of course i had got to the door and was about to enter the carriage when it flashed on my mind that the visit might be to myself the two lower floors of the hotel were occupied as a girls boardingschool the reason of our dwelling in it for our own daughters were in the establishment au second there was nothing but our own appartement and above us again dwelt a family whose visitors never came in carriages the door of the boardingschool was below and men seldom came to it at all strangers moreover sometimes did honour me with calls under these impressions i paused to see if the visitor went as far as our flight of steps all this time i had not the slightest suspicion of who he was though i fancied both the face and form were known to me  the stranger got up the large stone steps slowly leaning with one hand on the iron railing and with the other on his cane he was on the first landing as i stopped and turning towards the next flight our eyes met the idea that i might be the person he wanted seemed then to strike him for the first time estce mons  que jai lhonneur de voir he asked in french and with but an indifferent accent monsieur je mappelle  eh bien doncje suis walter scott  i ran up to the landing shook him by the hand which he stood holding out to me cordially and expressed my sense of the honour he was conferring he told me in substance that the princesse  had been as good as her word and having succeeded herself in getting hold of him she had goodnaturedly given him my address by way of cutting short all ceremony he had driven from his hotel to my lodgings all this time he was speaking french while my answers and remarks were in english suddenly recollecting himself he saidwell here have i been parlezvousing to you in a way to surprise you no doubt but these frenchmen have got my tongue so set to their lingo that i have half forgotten my own language as we proceeded up the next flight of steps he accepted my arm and continued the conversation in english walking with more difficulty than i had expected to see you will excuse the vanity of my repeating the next observation he made which i do in the hope that some of our own exquisites in literature may learn in what manner a man of true sentiment and sound feeling regards a trait that they have seen fit to stigmatize unbecoming ill tell you what i most like he added abruptly and it is the manner in which you maintain the ascendency of your own country on all proper occasions without descending to vulgar abuse of ours you are obliged to bring the two nations in collision and i respect your liberal hostility this will probably be esteemed treason in our own selfconstituted mentors of the press one of whom i observe has quite lately had to apologize to his readers for exposing some of the sins of the english writers in reference to ourselves but these people are not worth our attention for they have neither the independence which belongs to masculine reason nor manhood even to prize the quality in others i am afraid the mother has not always treated the daughter well he continued feeling a little jealous of her growth perhaps for though we hope england has not yet begun to descend on the evil side we have a presentiment that she has got to the top of the ladder  there were two entrances to our apartments one the principal leading by an antechamber and salle à manger into the salon and thence through other rooms to a terrace and the other by a private corridor to the same spot the door of my cabinet opened on this corridor and though it was dark crooked and anything but savoury as it led by the kitchen i conducted sir walter through it under an impression that he walked with pain an idea of which i could not divest myself in the hurry of the moment but for this awkwardness on my part i believe i should have been the witness of a singular interview general lafayette had been with me a few minutes before and he had gone away by the salon in order to speak to mrs  having a note to write i had left him there and i think his carriage could not have quitted the court when that of sir walter scott entered if so the general must have passed out by the antechamber about the time we came through the corridor  there would be an impropriety in my relating all that passed in this interview but we talked over a matter of business and then the conversation was more general you will remember that sir walter was still the unknown14 and that he was believed to be in paris in search of facts for the life of napoleon notwithstanding the former circumstance he spoke of his works with great frankness and simplicity and without the parade of asking any promises of secrecy in short as he commenced in this style his authorship was alluded to by us both just as if it had never been called in question he asked me if i had a copy of the  by me and on my confessing i did not own a single volume of anything i had written he laughed and said he believed that most authors had the same feeling on the subject as for himself he cared not if he never saw a waverley novel again as long as he lived curious to know whether a writer as great and as practised as he felt the occasional despondency which invariably attends all my own little efforts of this nature i remarked that i found the mere composition of a tale a source of pleasure so much so that i always invented twice as much as was committed to paper in my walks or in bed and in my own judgment much the best parts of the composition never saw the light for what was written was usually written at set hours and was a good deal a matter of chance and that going over and over the same subject in proofs disgusted me so thoroughly with the book that i supposed every one else would be disposed to view it with the same eyes to this he answered that he was spared much of the labour of proofreading scotland he presumed being better off than america in this respect but still be said he would as soon see his dinner again after a hearty meal as to read one of his own tales when he was fairly rid of it  footnote 14 he did not avow himself for several months afterwards  he sat with me nearly an hour and he manifested during the time the conversation was not tied down to business a strong propensity to humour having occasion to mention our common publisher in paris he quaintly termed him with a sort of malicious fun our gosling15 adding that he hoped he at least laid golden eggs  footnote 15 his name was gosselin  i hoped that he had found the facilities he desired in obtaining facts for the forthcoming history he rather hesitated about admitting this one can hear as much as he pleases as a gentleman he is not always sure how much of it he can with propriety relate in a book besidesthrowing all his latent humour into the expression of his small grey eyesone may even doubt how much of what he hears is fit for history on another account he paused and his face assumed an exquisite air of confiding simplicity as he continued with perfect bonne foi and strong scottish feeling i have been to see my countryman mdonald and i rather think that will be about as much as i can do here now this was uttered with so much naïveté that i could hardly believe it was the same man who a moment before had shown so much shrewd distrust of oral relations of facts  i inquired when we might expect the work some time in the course of the winter he replied though it is likely to prove larger than i at first intended we have got several volumes printed but i find i must add to the matter considerably in order to dispose of the subject i thought i should get rid of it in seven volumes which are already written but it will reach i think to nine if you have two still to write i shall not expect to see the book before spring you may let me once get back to abbotsford and ill soon knock off those two fellows to this i had nothing to say although i thought such a tour de force in writing might better suit invention than history  when he rose to go i begged him to step into the salon that i might have the gratification of introducing my wife to him to this he very goodnaturedly assented and entering the room after presenting mrs  and my nephew w he took a seat he sat some little time and his fit of pleasantry returned for he illustrated his discourse by one or two apt anecdotes related with a slightly scottish accent that he seemed to drop and assume at will mrs  observed to him that the bergère in which he was seated had been twice honoured that morning for general lafayette had not left it more than half an hour sir walter scott looked surprised at this and said inquiringly i thought he had gone to america to pass the rest of his days on my explaining the true state of the case he merely observed he is a great man and yet i thought the remark was made coldly or in complaisance to us  when sir walter left us it was settled that i was to breakfast with him the following day but one i was punctual of course and found him in a new silk douillette that he had just purchased trying as hard as he could as he pleasantly observed to make a frenchman of himselfan undertaking as little likely to be successful i should think in the case of his scottish exterior and scottish interior too as any experiment well could be there were two or three visitors besides miss ann scott his daughter who was his companion in the journey he was just answering an invitation from the princesse  to an evening party as i entered here said he you are a friend of the lady and parlezvous so much better than i can you tell me whether this is for jeudi or lundi or mardi or whether it means no day at all i told him the day of the week intended you get notes occasionally from the lady or you could not read her scrawl so readily she is very kind to us and we often have occasion to read her writing well it is worth a very good dinner to get through a page of it i take my revenge in kind and i fancy she has the worst of it i dont know after all that she will get much the better of me with this plume dauberge he was quite right for although sir walter writes a smooth even hand and one that appears rather well than otherwise on a page it is one of the most difficult to decipher i have ever met with the is us ms ns as es ts etc etc for want of dots crossings and being fully rounded looking all alike and rendering the reading slow and difficult without great familiarity with his mode of handling the pen at least i have found it so  he had sealed the note and was about writing the direction when he seemed at a loss how do you address this ladyas her highness i was much surprised at this question from him for it denoted a want of familiarity with the world that one would not have expected in a man who had been so very much and so long courted by the great but after all his life has been provincial though as his daughter remarked in the course of the morning they had no occasion to quit scotland to see the world all the world coming to see scotland  the next morning he was with me again for near an hour and we completed our little affair after this we had a conversation on the law of copyrights in the two countries which as we possess a common language is a subject of great national interest i understood him to say that he had a double right in england to his works one under a statute and the other growing out of common law any one publishing a book let it be written by whom it might in england duly complying with the law can secure the right whereas none but a citizen can do the same in america i regret to say that i misled him on the subject of our copyright law which after all is not so much more illiberal than that of england as i had thought it  i told sir walter scott that in order to secure a copyright in america it was necessary the book should never have been published anywhere else this was said under the popular notion of the matter or that which is entertained among the booksellers reflection and examination have since convinced me of my error the publication alluded to in the law can only mean publication in america for as the object of doing certain acts previously to publication is merely to forewarn the american public that the right is reserved there can be no motive for having reference to any other publication it is moreover in conformity with the spirit of all laws to limit the meaning of their phrases by their proper jurisdiction let us suppose a case an american writes a book he sends a copy to england where it is published in march complying with the terms of our own copyright law as to the entries and notices the same work is published here in april now will it be pretended that his right is lost always providing that his own is the first american publication i do not see how it can be so by either the letter or the spirit of the law the intention is to encourage the citizen to write and to give him a just property in the fruits of his labour and the precautionary provisions of the law are merely to prevent others from being injured for want of proper information it is of no moment to either of these objects that the author of a work has already reaped emolument in a foreign country the principle is to encourage literature by giving it all the advantages it can obtain  if these views are correct why may not an english writer secure a right in this country by selling it in season to a citizen here an equitable trust might not probably would not be sufficient but a bona fide transfer for a valuable consideration i begin to think would it seems to me that all the misconception which has existed on this point has arisen from supposing that the term publication refers to other than a publication in the country but when one remembers how rare it is to get lawyers to agree on a question like this it becomes a layman to advance his opinion with great humility i suppose after all a good way of getting an accurate notion of the meaning of the law would be to toss a dollar into the air and cry heads or tails sir walter scott seemed fully aware of the great circulation of his books in america as well as how much he lost by not being able to secure a copyright still he admitted they produced him something our conversation on this subject terminated by a frank offer on his part of aiding me with the publishers of his own country16 but although grateful for the kindness i was not so circumstanced as to be able to profit by it  footnote 16 an offer that was twice renewed after intervals of several years  he did not appear to me to be pleased with paris his notions of the french were pretty accurate though clearly not free from the old fashioned prejudices after all he remarked i am a true scot never except on this occasion and the short visit i made to paris in 1815 having been out of my own country unless to visit england and i have even done very little of the latter i understood him to say he had never been in ireland at all  i met him once more in the evening at the hotel of the princesse  the party had been got together in a hurry and was not large our hostess contrived to assemble some exceedingly clever people however among whom were one or two women who are already historical and whom i had fancied long since dead all the female part of the company with the silent delicacy that the french so well understand appeared with ribbons hats or ornaments of some sort or other of a scottish stamp indeed almost the only woman in the room that did not appear to be a caledonian was miss scott she was in halfmourning and with her black eyes and jetblack hair might very well have passed for a french woman but for a slight peculiarity about the cheekbones she looked exceedingly well and was much admired having two or three more places to go to they stayed but an hour as a matter of course all the french women were exceedingly empressées in their manner towards the great unknown and as there were three or four that were very exaggerated on the score of romance he was quite lucky if he escaped some absurdities nothing could be more patient than his manner under it all but as soon as he very well could he got into a corner where i went to speak to him he said laughingly that he spoke french with so much difficulty he was embarrassed to answer the compliments i am as good a lion as needs be allowing my mane to be stroked as familiarly as they please but i cant growl for them in french how is it with you disclaiming the necessity of being either a good or a bad lion being very little troubled in that way for his amusement i related to him an anecdote pointing out to him a comtesse de  who was present i told him i had met this lady once a week for several months and at every soirée she invariably sailed up to me to sayoh monsieur  quelles livresvos charmans livresque vos livres sont charmans and i had just made up my mind that she was at least a woman of taste when she approached me with the utmost sangfroid and cried bon soir monsieur  je viens dacheter tous vos livres et je compte profiter de la première occasion pour les lire  i took leave of him in the antechamber as he went away for he was to quit paris the following evening  sir walter scotts person and manner have been so often described that you will not ask much of me in this way especially as i saw so little of him his frame is large and muscular his walk difficult in appearance though be boasted himself a vigorous mountaineer and his action in general measured and heavy his features and countenance were very scottish with the short thick nose heavy lips and massive cheeks the superior or intellectual part of his head was neither deep nor broad but perhaps the reverse though singularly high indeed it is quite uncommon to see a scull so round and towerlike in the formation though i have met with them in individuals not at all distinguished for talents i do not think a casual observer would find anything unusual in the exterior of sir walter scott beyond his physical force which is great without being at all extraordinary his eye however is certainly remarkable grey small and without lustre in his graver moments it appears to look inward instead of regarding external objects in a way though the expression more or less belongs to abstraction that i have never seen equalled his smile is goodnatured and social and when he is in the mood as happened to be the fact so often in our brief intercourse as to lead me to think it characteristic of the man his eye would lighten with a great deal of latent fun he spoke more freely of his private affairs than i had reason to expect though our business introduced the subject naturally and at such times i thought the expression changed to a sort of melancholy resolution that was not wanting in sublimity  the manner of sir walter scott is that of a man accustomed to see much of the world without being exactly a man of the world himself he has evidently great social tact perfect selfpossession is quiet and absolutely without pretension and has much dignity and yet it struck me that he wanted the ease and aplomb of one accustomed to live with his equals the fact of his being a lion may produce some such effect but i am mistaken if it be not more the influence of early habits and opinions than of anything else  scott has been so much the mark of society that it has evidently changed his natural manner which is far less restrained than it is his habit to be in the world i do not mean by this the mere restraint of decorum but a drilled simplicity or demureness like that of girls who are curbed in their tendency to fun and lightheartedness by the dread of observation i have seldom known a man of his years whose manner was so different in a têteàtête and in the presence of a third person in edinburgh the circle must be small and he probably knows every one if strangers do go there they do not go all at once and of course the old faces form the great majority so that he finds himself always on familiar ground i can readily imagine that in auld reekie and among the proper set warmed perhaps by a glass of mountaindew sir walter scott in his peculiar way is one of the pleasantest companions the world holds  there was a certain m de  at the soirée of the princesse  who has obtained some notoriety as the writer of novels i had the honour of being introduced to this person and was much amused with one of his questions you are to understand that the vaguest possible notions exist in france on the subject of the united states empires states continents and islands are blended in inextricable confusion in the minds of a large majority of even the intelligent classes and we sometimes hear the oddest ideas imaginable this ignorance quite pardonable in part is not confined to france by any means but exists even in england a country that ought to know us better it would seem that m de  either because i was a shade or two whiter than himself or because he did not conceive it possible that an american could write a book for in this quarter of the world there is a strong tendency to believe that every man whose name crosses the ocean from america is merely some european who has gone there or from some cause that to me is inexplicable took it into his head that i was an englishman who had amused a leisure year or two in the western hemisphere after asking me a few questions concerning the country he very coolly continuedet combien de temps avezvous passé en amérique monsieur comprehending his mistake for a little practice here makes one quick in such matters i answered monsieur nous y sommes depuis deux siècles i question if m de  has yet recovered from his surprise  the french when their general cleverness is considered are singularly ignorant of the habits institutions and civilization of other countries this is in part owing to their being little addicted to travelling their commercial enterprise is not great for though we occasionally see a frenchman carrying with him into pursuits of this nature the comprehensive views and one might almost say the philosophy that distinguish the real intelligence of the country such instances are rare the prevailing character of their commerce being caution and close dealing like the people of all great nations their attention is drawn more to themselves than to others and then the want of a knowledge of foreign languages has greatly contributed to their ignorance this want of knowledge of foreign languages in a nation that has traversed europe as conquerors is owing to the fact that they have either carried their own language with them or met it everywhere it is a want moreover that belongs rather to the last generation than to the present the returned emigrants having brought back with them a taste for english german italian and spanish which has communicated itself to all or nearly all the educated people of the country english in particular is now very generally studied and perhaps relatively more french under thirty years of age are to be found in paris who speak english than americans of the same age are to be found in new york who speak french  i think the limited powers of the language and the rigid laws to which it has been subjected contribute to render the french less acquainted with foreign nations than they would otherwise be in all their translations there is an effort to render the word however peculiar may be its meaning into the french tongue thus township and city met with in an american book would probably be rendered by canton or commune or ville neither of which conveys an accurate idea of the thing intended in an english or american book we should introduce the french word at once which would induce the reader to inquire into the differences that exist between the minor territorial divisions of his own country and those of the country of which he is reading in this manner is the door open for further information until both writers and readers come to find it easier and more agreeable to borrow words from others than to curtail their ideas by their national vocabularies the french however are beginning to feel their poverty in this respect and some are already bold enough to resort to the natural cure  the habit of thinking of other nations through their own customs betrays the people of this country into many ridiculous mistakes one hears here the queerest questions imaginable every day all of which veiled by the good breeding and delicacy that characterize the nation betray an innocent sense of superiority that may be smiled at and which creates no feeling of resentment a savant lately named to me the coasting tonnage of france evidently with the expectation of exciting my admiration and on my receiving the information coolly he inquired with a little sarcasm of mannerwithout doubt you have some coasting tonnage also in america the coasting tonnage of the united slates monsieur is greater than the entire tonnage of france the man looked astonished and i was covered with questions as to the nature of the trade that required so much shipping among a population numerically so small it could not possibly be the consumption of a countryhe did not say it but he evidently thought itso insignificant and poor i told him that bread wine and every other article of the first necessity excepted the other consumption of america especially in luxuries did not fall so much short of that of france as he imagined owing to the great abundance in which the middling and lower classes lived unlike europe articles that were imported were mere necessaries of life in america such as tea coffee sugar etc etc the lowest labourer usually indulging in them he left me evidently impressed with new notions for there is a desire to learn mingled with all their vanity  but i will relate a laughable blunder of a translator by way of giving you a familiar example of the manner in which the french fall into error concerning the condition of other nations and to illustrate my meaning in one of the recent american novels that have been circulated here a character is made to betray confusion by tracing lines on the table after dinner with some wine that had been spilt a sort of idle occupation sufficiently common to allow the allusion to be understood by every american the sentence was faithfully rendered but not satisfied with giving his original the translator annexes a note in which he says one sees by this little trait that the use of tablecloths at the time of the american revolution was unknown in america you will understand the train of reasoning that led him to this conclusion in france the cover is laid perhaps on a coarse table of oak or even of pine and the cloth is never drawn the men leaving the table with the women in america the table is of highly polished mahogany the cloth is removed and the men sit as in england now the french custom was supposed to be the custom of mankind and wine could not be traced on the wood had there been a cloth america was a young and semicivilized nation and ergo in 1779 there could have been no tablecloths known in americawhen men even visit a people of whom they have been accustomed to think in this way they use their eyes through the medium of the imagination i lately met a french traveller who affirmed that the use of carpets was hardly known among us     letter xiii  french manufacturessèvres chinatapestry of the gobelinspaper for hangingsthe savonneriefrench carpetsamerican carpets transfer of old pictures from wood to canvasscoronation coach the arts in francein americaamerican prejudice   to james e de kay esquire  in my last i gave you a few examples of the instances in which the french have mistaken the relative civilization of their country and america and i shall now give you some in which we have fallen into the same error or the other side of the question  there has lately been an exhibition of articles of french manufacture at paris one of i believe the triennial collections of this character that have been established here the court of the louvre was filled with temporary booths for the occasion and vast ranges of the unfinished apartments in that magnificent palace have been thrown open for the same purpose the court of the louvre of itself is an area rather more than four hundred feet square and i should think fully a quarter of a mile of rooms in the building itself are to be added to the space occupied for this purpose  the first idea with which i was impressed on walking through the booths and galleries on this occasion was the great disproportion between the objects purely of taste and luxury and the objects of use the former abounded were very generally elegant and wellimagined while the latter betrayed the condition of a nation whose civilization has commenced with the summit instead of the base of society  in france nearly every improvement in machinery is the result of scientific research is unobjectionable in principles profound in the adaptation of its parts to the end and commonly beautiful in form but it ends here rarely penetrating the mass and producing positive results the conservatoire des arts for instance is full of beautiful and ingenious ploughs while france is tilled with heavy costly and cumbrous implements of this nature one sees light mould turning up here under a sort of agricultural diligences drawn by four and even six heavy horses which in america would be done quite as well and much sooner by two you know i am farmer enough to understand what i say on a point like this in france the cutlery ironware glass doorfastenings hinges locks fireirons axes hatchets carpenters tools and in short almost everything that is connected with homely industry and homely comfort is inferior to the same thing in america it is true many of our articles are imported but this produces no change in the habits of the respective people our manufactories are merely in birmingham instead of being in philadelphia  i have now been long enough in france to understand that seeing an article in an exhibition like the one i am describing is no proof that it enters at all into the comforts and civilization of the nation although it may be an object as homely as a harrow or a spade the scientific part of the country has little influence in this way on the operative the chasm between knowledge and ignorance is so vast in france that it requires a long time for the simplest idea to find its way across it  exhibitions are everywhere bad guides to the average civilization of a country as it is usual to expose only the objects that have been wrought with the greatest care in a popular sense they are proofs of what can be done rather than of what is done the cloths that i saw in the booths for instance are not to be met with in the shops the specimens of firearms glass cutlery etc etc too are all much superior to anything one finds on sale but this is the case everywhere from the boardingschool to the military parade men invariably putting the best foot foremost when they are to be especially inspected this is not the difference i mean familiar as every american at all accustomed to the usages of genteel life in his own country must be with the better manufactures of great britain i think he would be struck by the inferiority of even the best specimens of the commoner articles that were here laid before the public but when it came to the articles of elegance and luxury as connected with forms taste and execution though not always in ingenuity and extent of comfort i should think that no englishman let his rank in life be what it would could pass through this wilderness of elegancies without wonder  even the manufactures in which we or rather the english for i now refer more to use than to production ordinarily excel such as carpets rugs porcelain plate and all the higher articles of personal comfort as exceptions surpass those of which we have any notion i say as exceptions not in the sense by which we distinguish the extraordinary efforts of the ordinary manufacturer in order to make a figure at an exhibition but certain objects produced in certain exclusive establishments that are chiefly the property of the crown as they have been the offspring of regal taste and magnificence  of this latter character is the sèvres china there are manufactures of this name of a quality that brings them within the reach of moderate fortunes it is true but one obtains no idea of the length to which luxury and taste have been pushed in this branch of art without examining the objects made especially for the king who is in the habit of distributing them as presents among the crowned heads and his personal favourites after the ware has been made with the greatest care and of the best materials artists of celebrity are employed to paint it you can easily imagine the value of these articles when you remember that each plate has a design of its own beautifully executed in colours and presenting a landscape or an historical subject that is fit to be framed and suspended in a gallery one or two of the artists employed in this manner have great reputations and it is no uncommon thing to see miniatures in gilded frames which on examination prove to be on porcelain of course the painting has been subject to the action of heat in the baking as respects the miniatures there is not much to be said in their favour they are well drawn and well enough coloured but the process and the material give them a glossy unnatural appearance which must prevent them from ever being considered as more than so many tours de force in the arts but on vases dinnersets and all ornamental furniture of this nature in which we look for the peculiarities of the material they produce a magnificence of effect that i cannot describe vases of the value of ten or fifteen thousand francs or even of more money are not uncommon and at the exhibition there was a little table the price of which i believe was two thousand dollars that was a perfect treasure in its way  busts and even statues i believe have been attempted in this branch of art this of course is enlisting the statuary as well as the painter in its service i remember to have seen when at sèvres many busts of the late duc de berri in the process of drying previously to being put into the oven our cicerone on that occasion made us laugh by the routine with which he went through his catalogue of wonders he had pointed out to us the unbaked busts in a particular room and on entering another apartment where the baked busts were standing he exclaimedah voilà son altesse royale toute cuite this is just the amount of the criticism i should hazard on this branch of the sèvres art or on that which exceeds its legitimate limitsbehold his royal highness ready cooked  the value of some of the single plates must be very considerable and the king frequently in presenting a solitary vase or ornament of the sèvres porcelain presents thousands  the tapestry is another of the costly works that it has suited the policy of france to keep up while her ploughs and axes and carts and other ordinary implements are still so primitive and awkward the exhibition contained many specimens from the gobelins that greatly surpassed my expectations they were chiefly historical subjects with the figures larger than life and might very well have passed with a novice at a little distance for oilpaintings the dimensions of the apartment are taken and the subject is designed of course on a scale suited to the room the effect of this species of ornament is very noble and imposing and the tapestries have the additional merit of warmth and comfort hangings in cloth are very common in paris but the tapestry of the gobelins is chiefly confined to the royal palaces our neighbour the duc de  has some of it however in his hotel a present from the king but the colours are much faded and the work is otherwise the worse for time i have heard him say that one piece he has even in its dilapidated state is valued at seven thousand francs occasionally a little of this tapestry is found in this manner in the great hotels but as a rule its use is strictly royal  the paper for hangings is another article in which the french excel we get very pretty specimens of their skill in this manufacture in america but with occasional exceptions nothing that is strictly magnificent finds its way into our markets i was much struck with some of these hangings that were made to imitate velvet the cloth appeared to be actually incorporated with the paper and by no ingenuity of which i was master could i detect the means the style of paper is common enough everywhere but this exhibition had qualities far surpassing anything of the sort i had ever before seen curiosity has since led me to the papermaker in order to penetrate the secrets of his art and there like the affair of columbus and the egg i found the whole thing as simple as heart could wish you will probably smile when you learn the process by which paper is converted into velvet which is briefly this  wooden moulds are used to stamp the designs each colour being put on by laying a separate mould on its proper place one mould being used after another though only one is used on any particular occasion thus all the black is put on now the green tomorrow and the yellow next day as to the velvets they are produced as followswool is chopped fine and dyed the desired hue i am not certain that cotton or even other materials may not be used this chopped and coloured wool is thrown into a tub the mould is covered with some glutinous substance and when applied it leaves on the paper the adhesive property as types leave the ink the paper passes immediately over the tub and a boy throws on the wool a light blow or two of a rattan tosses it about and finally throws all back again into the tub that has not touched the glue the printed part of course is covered with blue or purple or scarlet wood and is converted by a touch of the wand into velvet the process of covering a yard lasts about ten seconds and i should think considerably more than a hundred yards of paper could be velvetized in an hour we laughed at the discovery and came away satisfied that solomon could have known nothing about manufacturing paperhangings or he would not have said there was nothing new under the sun  but the manufacture of france that struck me as being strictly in the best taste in which perfection and magnificence are attained without recourse to conceits or doing violence to any of the proprieties are the products of the savonnerie and the exquisitely designed and executed works of beauvais these include chair bottoms and backs hangings for rooms and i believe carpets at all events if the carpets do not come from these places they are quite worthy to have that extraction flowers arabesques and other similar designs exquisitely coloured and drawn chiefly limit the efforts of the former and the carpets were in single pieces and made to fit the room nothing that you have ever seen or probably have imagined at all equals the magnificence of some of these princely carpets indeed i know nothing that runs a closer parallel to the general civilization between france and england and i might almost add of america than the history of their respective carpets in france a vast majority of the people hardly know what a carpet is they use mud floors or rising a little above the very lowest classes coarse stone and rude tiles are substituted the middling classes out of the large towns have little else besides painted tiles the wooden parquet is met with in all the better houses and is well made and well kept there is a finish and beauty about them that is not misplaced even in a palace among all these classes until quite lately carpets were unknown or at least they were confined to the very highest class of society the great influx of english has introduced them into the public hotels and common lodginghouses but i have visited among many french of rank and fortune in the dead of winter and found no carpets a few of a very coarse quality made of rags adroitly tortured into laboured designs are seen it is true even in indifferent houses but the rule is as i have told you in short carpets in this country until quite lately have been deemed articles of high luxury and like nearly everything else that is magnificent and luxurious at the point where they have been taken up they infinitely exceed anything of the sort in england the classical designs perfect drawings and brilliant colours defeat every effort to surpass themi had almost said all competition  in all america except in the new regions with here and there a dwelling on the frontier there is scarcely a house to be found without carpets the owners of which are at all above the labouring classes even in many of the latter they are to be found we are carpeted frequently from the kitchen to the garret the richness and rarity of the manufacture increasing as we ascend in the scale of wealth and fashion until we reach the uttermost limits of our habitsa point where beauty and neatness verge upon elegance and magnificence at this point however we stop and the turn of the french commences now this is the history of the comparative civilization of the two countries in a multitude of other matters perhaps it would be better to say it is the general comparative history of the two countries the english differ from us only in carrying their scale both higher and lower than ourselves in being sometimes magnificent and sometimes impoverished but rarely indeed do they equal the french in the light classical and elegant taste that so eminently distinguishes these people there is something ponderous and purseproud about the magnificence of england that is scarcely ever visible here though taste is evidently and rapidly on the increase in england on the one hand as comfort is here on the other the french have even partially adopted the two words fashionable and comfortable  one of the most curious things connected with the arts in france is that of transferring old pictures from wood to canvass a large proportion of the paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were done on wood or copper and many of the former are or have been in danger of being lost from decay in order to meet the evil a process has been invented by which the painting is transferred to canvass where it remains to all appearance as good as ever i have taken some pains to ascertain in what manner this nice operation is performed i have seen pictures in various stages of the process though i have never watched any one through it all and in one instance i saw a small wouvermans stripped to the shirt if it may be so expressed or in other words when it was nothing but paint from what i have seen and been told i understand the mode of effecting this delicate and almost incredible operation to be as follows  a glue is rubbed over the face of the picture which is then laid on a piece of canvass that is properly stretched and secured to receive it weights are now laid on the back of the picture and it is left for a day or two in order that the glue may harden the weights are then removed and the operator commences removing the wood first with a plane and when he approaches the paint with sharp delicate chisels the paint is kept in its place by the canvass to which it is glued and which is itself secured to the table and although the entire body of the colours hardened as it is by time is usually not thicker than a thin wafer the wood is commonly taken entirely from it should a thin fragment be left however or a crack made in the paint it is considered of no great moment the wouvermans alluded to was pure paint however and i was shown the pieces of wood much wormeaten that had been removed when the wood is away glue is applied to the back of the paint and to the canvass on which it is intended the picture shall remain the latter is then laid on the paint new weights are placed above it and they are left two or three days longer for this new glue to harden when it is thought the adhesion between the second canvass and the paint is sufficient the weights are removed the picture is turned and warm water is used in loosening the first canvass from the face of the picture until it can be stripped off more or less of the varnish of the picture usually comes off with the glue rendering the separation easier the painting is then cleaned retouched and should it be necessary varnished and framed after which it commonly looks as well and is really as sound and as good as ever so far at least as the consistency is concerned  among other wonders in the exhibition was the coronation coach of charles x this carriage is truly magnificent it is quite large as indeed are all the royal carriages perhaps as large as an american stagecoach the glass pure and spotless as air goes all round the upper compartments so as to admit of a view of the whole interior the panels are beautifully painted in design the top has gilded and wellformed angels blowing trumpets and the crown of france surmounts the centre the wheels and train and pole are red striped with gold all the leather is red morocco gilt as is the harness plumes of ostrich feathers ornament the angles and altogether it is a most glittering and gorgeous vehicle the paintings the gildings and all the details are well executed except the running gear which struck me as clumsy and imperfect the cost is said to have been about sixty thousand dollars  many new rooms in the louvre were thrown open on this occasion in order that the paintings on their ceilings might be viewed and as i walked through this gorgeous magnificence i felt how small were our highest pretensions to anything like elegance or splendour the very extreme of art of this nature may of itself be of no great direct benefit it is true but is should be remembered that the skill which produces these extraordinary fruits in its road to the higher points of magnificence produces all that embellishes life in the intermediate gradations  in america in the eagerness of gain and with the contracted habits that a love of gain engenders which by their own avidity as is usual with the grosser passions too often defeat their own ends we overlook the vast importance of cultivating the fine arts even in a pecuniary sense to say nothing of the increased means of enjoying the very money that is so blindly pursued which their possession entails france is at this moment laying all christendom under contribution simply by means of her taste italy where the arts have flourished still longer and where they have still more effectually penetrated society would drive the english and french out of every market on earth were the national energy at all equal to the national tastes these things do not as exclusively belong to extreme luxury as they may at first seem science skill of the nicest investigation and great research are all enlisted in their behalf and in time implements of the most homely uses derive perfection as byplays from the investigations consequent on the production of luxuries it is true that by blending a certain amount of information with practice as in the case of the american labourer our wants find the means of furnishing their own supplies but apart from the fact that the man who makes a chair is not obliged to sit in it and is therefore content to consult his profits merely the impulses of practice are much aided by the accumulated knowledge of study the influence that the arts of design have had on the french manufactures is incalculable they have brought in the aid of chemistry and mathematics and a knowledge of antiquity and we can trace the effects in the bronzes the porcelain the hangings the chintzes the silks down to the very ribands of the country we shall in vain endeavour to compete with the great european nations unless we make stronger efforts to cultivate the fine arts of what avails our beautiful glass unless we know how to cut it or of what great advantage in the strife of industry will be even the skilful glasscutter should he not also be the tasteful glasscutter it is true that classical forms and proportions are as yet of no great account among us and the great mass of the american people still cling to their own uninstructed fancies in preference to the outlines and proportions of the more approved models and to those hues which art has demonstrated to be harmonious this is the history of every society in its progress to perfection and cut off as we are from the rest of the civilized world it is not to be expected that we are to make an extraordinary exception but while we may be satisfied with our own skill and taste the happy lot of all ignorance our customers will not have the same selfcomplacency to induce them to become purchasers we find this truth already we beat all nations in the fabrication of common unstamped cottons were trade as free as some political economists pretend we should drive all our competitors out of every market as respects this one article but the moment we attempt to print or to meddle with that part of the business which requires taste we find ourselves inferior to the europeans whose forms we are compelled to imitate and of course to receive when no longer novel and whose hues defy our art  the wisest thing the united states could do would be to appropriate thirty or forty millions to the formation of a marine not to secure the coast as our henroost statesmen are always preaching but to keep in our own hands the control of our own fortunes by rendering our enmity or friendship of so much account to europe that no power shall ever again dare trespass on our national rightsand one of the next wisest measures i honestly believe would be to appropriate at once a million to the formation of a national gallery in which copies of the antique antiques themselves pictures bronzes arabesques and other models of true taste might be collected before which the young aspirants for fame might study and with which become imbued as the preliminary step to an infusion of their merits into society without including the vast influence of such a cultivation on the manners associations intellects and habits of the peoplean influence that can scarcely be appreciated too highlyfifty years would see the first cost returned fiftyfold in the shape of the muchbeloved dollars will this happen not till men of enlightened mindsstatesmen instead of political partizansare sent to washington it is the misfortune of america to lie so remote from the rest of the civilized world as to feel little of the impulses of a noble competition our rivalry commonly limiting itself to the vulgar exhibitions of individual vanity and this the more to our disadvantage as denied access to the best models for even this humble species of contention with the antagonists we are compelled to choose victory is as bad as defeat  one of the great impediments to a high class of improvement in america is the disposition to resent every intimation that we can be any better than we are at present few perhaps no country has ever enduced so much evildisposed and unmerited abuse as our own it is not difficult to trace the reasons and every american should meet it with a just and manly indignation but being deemed a nation of rogues barbarous and manifesting the vices of an ancestry of convicts is a very different thing from standing at the head of civilization this tendency to repel every suggestion of inferiority is one of the surest signs of provincial habits it is exactly the feeling with which the resident of the village resents what he calls the airs of the town and that which the inland trader brings with him among those whom he terms the dandies of the seaboard in short it is the jealousy of inferiority on the exciting points whatever may be the merits of its subject in other matters and furnishes of itself the best possible proof that there is room for amendment the french have a clever and pithy saying that ofon peut tout dire à un grand peuple one may tell all to a great nation17  footnote 17every one was telling me that i should find the country so altered after an absence of eight years that i should not know it altered indeed i found it but not quite so evidently improved it struck me that there was a vast expansion of mediocrity that was well enough in itself but which was so overwhelming as nearly to overshadow everything that once stood prominent as more excellent this was perhaps no more than a natural consequence of the elasticity and growth of a young vigorous community which in its agregate character as in that of its individuals must pass through youth to arrive at manhood still it was painful and doubly so to one coming from europe i saw the towns increased more tawdry than ever but absolutely with less real taste than they had in my youth the art of painting alone appeared to me to have made any material advances in the right direction if one excepts increase in wealth and in the facilities to create wealth the steamboats were the only objects that approached magnificence but while they had increased in show they had less comfort and respectability the taverns as a whole had deteriorated though the three first i happened to enter might well compete with a very high class of european inns viz heads barnums and gadsbys     letter xiv  false notionscontinental mannerspeople of parisparisian women french beautymen of francefrench soldiers   to james stevenson esquire albany  i cannot tell you whence the vulgar notions that we entertain of the french which with many other pernicious prejudices have made a part of our great inheritance from england have been originally obtained certainly i have seen no thing nor any person after a long residence in the country to serve as models to the flippant marquis the overdressed courtiers or the petites maîtresses of the english dramatists even a french perruquier is quite as homely and plain a personage as an english or an american barber but these athenians grossly caricature themselves as well as their neighbours although paris is pretty well garnished with english of all degrees from the duke down it has never yet been my luck to encounter an english dandy now and then one meets with a dresser a man who thinks more of his appearance than becomes his manhood or than comports with good breeding and occasionally a woman is seen who is a mere appendage to her attire but i am persuaded that as a rule neither of these vulgar classes exists among people of any condition in either country it is impossible for me to say what changes the revolution and the wars and the new notions may have produced in france but there is no sufficient reason for believing that the present cropped and fringeless bewhiskered and laceless generation of france differs more from their bewigged belaced and powdered predecessors than the men and women of any other country differ from their particular ancestors boys wore cocked hats and breaches and swords in america previously to the revolution and our immediate fathers flourished in scarlet coats powder ruffled fingers and embroidered waistcoats  the manners of the continent of europe are more finished than those of england and while quiet and simplicity are the governing rules of good breeding everywhere even in unsophisticated america this quiet and simplicity is more gracious and more graceful in france than in the neighbouring island as yet i see no other difference in mere deportment though there is abundance when one goes into the examination of character  i have met with a good many people of the old court at paris and though now and then there is a certain roué atmosphere about them both men and women as if too much time had been passed at coblentz they have generally in other respects been models of elegant demeanour usually they are simple dignified and yet extremely graciousgracious without the appearance of affability a quality that is almost always indicative of a consciousness of superiority the predominant fault of manner here is too strong a hand in applying flattery but this is as much the fault of the head as of breeding the french are fond of hearing pleasant things they say themselves that a frenchman goes into society to make himself agreeable and an englishman to make himself disagreeable and the dire is not altogether without foundation in truth i never met a frenchman in society here who appeared to wish to enhance his importance by what are called airs though a coxcomb in feeling is an animal not altogether unknown to the natural history of paris nor is the zoological science of m cuvier indispensable to his discovery  i shall probably surprise you with one of my opinions i think the population of paris physically speaking finer than that of london fine men and fine women are by no means as frequent after allowing for the difference in whole numbers in the french as in the english capital but neither are there as many miserable pallid and squalid objects the french are a smaller race than the english much smaller than the race of english gentlemen so many of whom congregate at london but the population of paris has a sturdy healthful look that i do not think is by any means as general in london in making this comparison allowance must be made for the better dress of the english and for their fogs whose effect is to bleach the skin and to give a colour that has no necessary connexion with the springs of life although the female portion of the population of paris has probably as much colour as that of london it might possibly be safer to say that the female population of paris is finer than that of london though i think on the whole the males may be included also i do not mean by this that there is relatively as much female beauty in paris as in london for in this respect the latter has immeasurably the advantage but looks apart that the physique of the french of paris is superior to that of the english of london the population of paris is a favourable specimen of that of the kingdom while that of london westminster excepted is not at all above the level of the entire country if indeed it be as good18  footnote 18 this opinion remains the same in the writer who between the years 1806 and 1833 has been six times in london and between the years 1826 and 1833 five times in paris in 1833 he left paris for london sailing for home from the latter place a few days after his arrival he went to washington where during the session of congress dress and air not considered he thought he had never met so large a proportion of fine men in any part of the world he was particularly struck with their size as was an american friend who was with him and who had also passed many years abroad having left liverpool the same day the writer sailed from portsmouth  the very general notion which exists in america that the french are a slightlybuilt airy people and that their women in particular are thin and without embonpoint is a most extraordinary one for there is not a particle of foundation for it the women of paris are about as tall as the women of america and could a fair sample of the two nations be placed in the scales i have no doubt it would be found that the french women would outweigh the americans in the proportion of six to five instead of being meagre they are compactly built with good busts inclining to be full and welllimbed as any one may see who will take the trouble to walk the streets after a hard shower for as falstaff told prince henry you are straight enough in the shoulders you care not who sees your back indeed i know no females to whom the opinion which we entertain of the french women may better apply than to our own and yet i know none who are so generally welllooking  the french are not a handsome nation personal beauty in either sex is rare there is a want of simplicity of repose of dignity and even of harmonious expression what they themselves call finesse in their countenances and yet the liveliness of the eyes and the joyous character of their looks render them agreeable you are not to understand from this that great personal beauty does not exist in france however for there are so many exceptions to the rule that they have occasionally made me hesitate about believing it a rule at all the french often possess a feature in great perfection that is very rare in england where personal beauty is so common in both sexes it is in the mouth and particularly in the smile want of finesse about the mouth is a general european deficiency the italians have more of it than any other people i know and it is as prevalent an advantage in america but the races of saxon root fail in the chin which wants nobleness and volume here it is quite common to see profiles that would seem in their proper places on a roman coin  although female beauty is not common in france when it is found it is usually of a very high order the sweet cherublike guileless expression that belongs to the english female face and through it to the american is hardly ever perhaps never met with here the french countenance seldom conveys the idea of extreme infantile innocence even in the children there is a manner which while it does not absolutely convey an impression of an absence of the virtues i think leaves less conviction of its belonging to the soul of the being than the peculiar look i mean one always sees womanmodest amiable spirituelle feminine and attractive if you will in a french girl while one sometimes sees an angel in a young english or american face i have no allusion now to religious education or to religious feelings which are quite as general in the sex particularly the young of good families under their characteristic distinctions here as anywhere else in this particular the great difference is that in america it is religion and in france it is infidelity that is metaphysical  there is a coquettish prettiness that is quite common in france in which air and manner are mingled with a certain sauciness of expression that is not easily described but which while it blends well enough with the style of the face is rather pleasing than captivating it marks the peculiar beauty of the grisette who with her little cap hands stuck in the pockets of her apron mincing walk coquettish eye and wellbalanced head is a creature perfectly sui generis such a girl is more like an actress imitating the character than one is apt to imagine the character itself i have met with imitators of these roguish beauties in a higher station such as the wives and daughters of the industrious classes as it is the fashion to call them here and even among the banking community but never among women of condition whose deportment in france whatever may be their morals is usually marked by gentility of air and a perfectly good tone of manner always excepting that small taint of rouéism to which i have already alluded and which certainly must have come from the camp and emigration  the highest style of the french beauty is the classical i cannot recall a more lovely picture a finer union of the grand and the feminine than the duchesse de  in full dress at a carnival ball where she shone peerless among hundreds of the élite of europe i see her now with her small wellseated head her large dark brilliant eye rivetted on the mazes of a polonaise danced in character her hair black as the ravens wing clustering over a brow of ivory her graceful form slightly inclining forward in delighted and graceful attention her features just grecian enough to be a model of delicate beauty just roman enough to be noble her colour heightened to that of youth by the heat of the room and her costume in which all the art of paris was blended with a critical knowledge of the just and the becoming and yet this woman was a grandmother  the men of france have the same physical and the same conventional peculiarities as the women they are short but sturdy including all france for there is a material difference in this respect between the north and the south i should think the average stature of the french men not women to be quite an inch and a half below the average stature of america and possibly two inches at home i did not find myself greatly above the medium height and in a crowd i was always compelled to stand on tiptoe to look over the heads of those around me whereas here i am evidently un grand and can see across the champs elysées without any difficulty you may remember that i stand as near as may be to five feet ten it follows that five feet ten is rather a tall man in france you are not to suppose however that there are not occasionally men of great stature in this country one of the largest men i have ever seen appears daily in the garden of the tuileries and i am told he is a frenchman of one of the northeastern provinces that part of the kingdom is german rather than french however and the population still retain most of the peculiarities of their origin  the army has a look of service and activity rather than of force i should think it more formidable by its manoeuvres than its charges indeed the tactics of napoleon who used the legs of his troops more than their muskets aiming at concentrating masses on important points goes to show that he depended on alertness instead of bottom this is just the quality that would be most likely to prevail against your methodical slowthinking and slowmoving german and i make no question the short sturdy nimble legs of the little warriors of this country have gained many a field  a general officer himself a sixfooter told me lately that they had found the tall men of very little use in the field from their inability to endure the fatigues of a campaign when armies shall march on railroads and manoeuvre by steam the grenadiers will come in play again but as it is the french are admirably adapted by their physique to return the career that history has given them the romans resembled them in this respect cicero admitting that many people excelled them in size strength beauty and even learning though he claimed a superiority for his countrymen on the score of love of country and reverence for the gods the french are certainly patriotic enough though their reverence for the gods may possibly be questioned  the regiments of the guards the heavy cavalry and the artillery are all filled with men chosen with some care these troops would i think form about an average american army on the score of size the battalions of the line receive the rest as much attention is bestowed in adapting the duty to the physique and entire corps are composed of men of as nearly as possible the same physical force some of the regiments certainly make but an indifferent figure as to dimensions while others appear particularly well still if not overworked i should think these short men would do good service i think i have seen one or two regiments in which the average height has not exceeded five feet three inches the chances of not being hit in such a corps are worth something for the proportion compared to the chances in a corps of sixfooters is as sixtythree to seventytwo or is oneeighth in favour of the lilliputians i believe the rule for retreating is when onethird of the men are hors de combat  now supposing a regiment of three thousand grenadiers were obliged to retire with a loss of one thousand men the little fellows under the same fire should have at the same time two thousand one hundred and thirtyseven sound men left and of course unless bullied out of it they ought to gain the day     letter xv  perversion of

supervision throws us again into the hands of the demagogue in his new or rather true character of a courtier so it is with life in politics religion arms arts and letters yea even the republic of letters as it is called is the prey of schemes and parasites and things in fact are very different from things as they seem to be  in the seventeen years that i have been a married man said captain

pronounced eulogies on their predecessors you may be curious to know what impression the assembled genius of france produced on a stranger from the western world i can only answer none the academy of the sciences can scarcely ever be less than distinguished in such a nation but when i came to look about me and to inquire after the purely literary men i was forcibly struck with the feebleness of the catalogue of names not one in five was at all known to me and very few even of those who were could properly be classed among the celebrated writers of the day as france has many very clever men who were not on the list i was desirous of knowing the reason and then learned that intrigue courtfavour and logrolling to use a quaint american term made members of the academy as well as members of the cabinet a moments reflection might have told me it could not well be otherwise it would be so in america if we were burthened with an academy it is so as respects collegiate honours and what reason is there for supposing it should not be so in a country so notoriously addicted to intrigue as france  one ought not to be the dupe of these things there are a few great names distinguished by common consent whose claims it is necessary to respect these men form the front of every honorary institution if there are to be knights and nobles and academicians they must be of the number not that such distinctions are necessary to them but that they are necessary to the distinctions after which the oi polloi are enrolled as they can find interest something very like an admission of this is contained in an inscription on the statue of molière which stands in the vestibule of the hall of the academy which frankly says though we are not necessary to your glory you are necessary to ours he was excluded from the forty by intrigue on account of his profession being that of a player shakspeare himself would have fared no better now fancy a country in which there was a club of select authors that should refuse to enrol the name of william shakspeare on their list  the sitting was well attended and i dare say the addresses were not amiss though there is something exceedingly tiresome in one of these eulogies that is perpetrated by malice prepense the audience applauded very much after the fashion of those impromptus which are made à loisir and i could not but fancy that a good portion of the assembly began to think the academy was what the cockneys call a rum place before they heard the last of it we had a poem by comte daru to which i confess i did not listen notwithstanding my personal respect for the distinguished writer simply because i was most heartily wearied before he began and because i can never make anything of french poetry in the academy or out of it  it would be unjust to speak lightly of any part of the french academy without a passing remark in honour of those sections of it to which honour is due in these sections may be included i think that of the arts as well as that of the sciences the number of respectable artists that exist in this country is perfectly astonishing the connoisseurs i believe dispute the merits of the school and ignorant as i am in such matters i can myself see that there is a prevalent disposition both in statuary and painting to sacrifice simplicity to details and that the theatrical is sometimes mistaken for the grand but after admitting both these faults and some defects in colouring there still remains a sufficient accumulation of merit to create wonder in one like myself who has not had previous opportunities of ascertaining the affluence of a great nation in this respect  as regards the scientific attainments of the french it is unnecessary to say anything though i believe you will admit that they ought at least to have the effect of counteracting some of the prejudices about dancingmasters petits maîtres and perruquiers that have descended to us through english novels and plays such a man as laplace alone is sufficient to redeem an entire people from these imputations the very sight of one of his demonstrations will give common men like ourselves headaches and you will remember that having successfully got through one of the toughest of them he felicitated himself that there was but one other man living who could comprehend it now it was made  what a noble gift would it have been to his fellowcreatures had some competent follower of laplace bestowed on them a comprehensive but popular compend of the leading astronomical facts to be used as one of the most ordinary schoolbooks apart from the general usefulness of this peculiar species of knowledge and the chances that by thus popularizing the study sparks might be struck from the spirit of some dormant newton i know no inquiry that has so strong a tendency to raise the mind from the gross and vulgar pursuits of the world to a contemplation of the power and designs of god it has often happened to me when filled with wonder and respect for the daring and art of man i have been wandering through the gorgeous halls of some palace or other public edifice that an orrery or a diagram of the planetary system has met my eye and recalled me in a moment from the consideration of art and its intrinsic feebleness to that of the sublimity of nature at such times this globe has appeared so insignificant in comparison with the mighty system of which it forms so secondary a part that i felt a truly philosophical indifference not to give it a better term for all it contained admiration of human powers as connected with the objects around me has been lost in admiration of the mysterious spirit which could penetrate the remote and sublime secrets of the science and on no other occasions have i felt so profound a conviction of my own isolated insignificance or so lively a perception of the stupendous majesty of the deity  passing by the common and conceded facts of the dimensions of the planets and the extent of their orbits what thoughts are awakened by the suggestion that the fixed stars are the centres of other solar systems and the eccentric comets are links to connect them all in one great and harmonious design the astronomers tell us that some of these comets have no visible nucleusesthat the fixed stars are seen through their apparent densest parts and that they can be nothing but luminous gases while on the other hand others do betray dark compact bodies of more solid matter fixed stars unaccountably disappear as if suddenly struck out of their places now we know that aerolites are formed in the atmosphere by a natural process and descend in masses of pure iron why may not the matter of one globe dispersed into its elements by the fusion of its consummation reassemble in the shape of comets gaseous at first and slowly increasing and condensing in the form of solid matter varying in their course as they acquire the property of attraction until they finally settle into new and regular planetary orbits by the power of their own masses thus establishing a regular reproduction of worlds to meet the waste of eternity were the earth dissolved into gases by fusion what would become of its satellite the moon might not the principles of our planet thus volatilized yield to its nearer attraction assemble around that orb which losing its governing influence should be left to wander in infinite space subject to a new but eccentric law of gravity until finally reduced again within the limits of some new system how know we that such is not the origin of comets  many astronomers have believed that the solar system in company with thousands of other systems revolves around a common centre in orbits so vast as to defy computation and a religious sentiment might well suggest that this centre of the universe is the throne of the most high here we may fancy the deity seated in power and controlling by his will the movements of worlds directing each to the completion of his own mysterious and benevolent designs  it certainly might be dangerous to push our speculations too far but there can be no risk in familiarizing men to consider the omnipotence of god and to feel their own comparative insignificance what ideas of vastness are obtained by a knowledge of the fact that there exist stars in the firmament which ordinary telescopes show us only as single bodies but which on examination by using reflectors of a higher power are found to be clusters of orbsclusters of worldsor clusters of suns these again are found to be binary stars or two stars revolving round each other while they are thought at the same time to revolve around their central sun and accompanied by this again probably to revolve round the great common centre of all  but in the words of the quaint old song i must cry holla my fancy whither dost thou go before taking leave of the stars altogether however i will add that the french and i believe all europe with the exception of england follow the natural order of time in counting the seasons thus the spring commences with the vernal equinox and the autumn with the autumnal this division of the year leaves nearly the whole of march as a winter month june as a spring month and september as belonging to the summer no general division of the seasons can suit all latitudes but the equinoxes certainly suggest the only two great events of the year that equally affect the entire sphere had the old method of computing time continued the seasons would gradually have made the circle of the months until their order was reversed as they are now known to be in the northern and southern hemispheres  quitting the academy which with its schools of the classical and the romantic has tempted me to a higher flight than i could have believed possible let us descend to the theatres of paris talma was still playing last year when we arrived and as in the case of repentance i put off a visit to the théâtre français with a full determination to go because it might be made at any time in the meanwhile he fell ill and died and it never was my good fortune to see that great actor mademoiselle mars i have seen and certainly in her line of characters i have never beheld her equal indeed it is scarcely possible to conceive of a purer more severe more faultless and yet more poetical representation of common nature than that which characterizes her art her acting has all the finish of high breeding with just as much feeling as is necessary to keep alive the illusion as for rant there is not as much about her whole system as would serve a common english or american actress for a single length  to be frank with you so great is the superiority of the french actors in vaudevilles the light opera and genteel comedy that i fear i have lost my taste for the english stage of tragedy i say nothing for i cannot enter into the poetry of the country at all but in all below it these people to my taste are immeasurably our superiors and by ours you know i include the english stage the different lines here are divided among the different theatres so that if you wish to laugh you can go to the variétés to weep to the théâtre français or to gape to the odéon at the porte st martin one finds vigorous touches of national character and at the gymnase the fashionable place of resort just at this moment national traits polished by convention besides these there are many other theatres not one of which in its way can be called less than tolerable  one can say but little in favour of the morals of too many of the pieces represented here in this particular there is a strange obliquity of reason arising out of habitual exaggeration of feeling that really seems to disqualify most of the women even from perceiving what is monstrous provided it be sentimental and touching i was particularly advised to go to the théâtre madame to see a certain piece by a côterie of very amiable women whom i met the following night at a house where we all regularly resorted once a week on entering they eagerly inquired if i had not been charmed fascinated if any thing could be better played or more touching better played it could not easily be but i had been so shocked with the moral of the piece that i could scarcely admire the acting the moral this was the first time they had heard it questioned i was obliged to explain a certain person had been left the protector of a friends daughter then an infant he had the child educated as his sister and she grew to be a woman ignorant of her real origin in the meantime she has offers of marriage all of which she unaccountably refuses in fine she was secretly cherishing a passion for her guardian and supposed brother an explanation is had they marry and the piece closes i objected to the probability of a welleducated young womans falling in love with a man old enough to be selected as her guardian when she was an infant and against whom there existed the trifling objection of his being her own brother  but he was not her brothernot even a relative true but she believed him to be her brother and naturedo you count nature as nothinga secret sentiment told her he was not her brother and use and education and an open sentiment and all the world told her he was such a woman was guilty of a revolting indelicacy and a heinous crime and no exaggerated representation of love a passion of great purity in itself can ever do away with the shocking realities of such a case  i found no one to agree with me he was not her brother and though his tongue and all around her told her he was her heart that infallible guide told her the truth what more could any reasonable man ask  it was à propos of this play and of my objection to this particular feature of it that an exceedingly clever french woman laughingly told me she understood there was no such thing as love in america that a people of manners as artificial as the french should suppose that others under the influence of the cold formal exterior which the puritans have entailed on so large a portion of the public were without strong feeling is not altogether as irrational as may at first appear art in ordinary deportment is both cause and effect that which we habitually affect to be gets in the end to be so incorporated with our natural propensities as to form a part of the real man we all know that by discipline we can get the mastery of our strongest passions and on the other hand by yielding to them and encouraging them that they soon get the mastery over us thus do a highly artificial people fond of and always seeking high excitement come in time to feel it artificially as it were by natural impulses  i have mentioned the anecdote of the play because i think it characteristic of a tone of feeling that is quite prevalent among a large class of the french though i am far from saying there is not a class who would at once see the grave sacrifice of principle that is involved in building up the sentiments of a fiction on such a foundation of animal instinct i find on recollection however that miss lee in one of her canterbury tales has made the love of her plot hinge on a very similar incident surely she must have been under the influence of some of the german monstrosities that were so much in vogue about the time she wrote for even juvenal would scarcely have imagined anything worse as the subject of his satire  you will get a better idea of the sentimentalism that more or less influences the tables of this country however if i tell you that the ladies of the côterie in which the remarks on the amorous sister were made once gravely discussed in my presence the question whether madame de staël was right or wrong in causing corinne to go through certain sentimental experiences as our canters call it at home on a clouded day instead of choosing one on which the sun was bright or vice versa for i really forget whether it was on the windy side of sensibility or not that the daughter of necker was supposed to have erred  the first feeling is that of surprise at finding a people so artificial in their ordinary deportment so chaste and free from exaggeration in their scenic representations of life but reflection will show us that all finish has the effect of bringing us within the compass of severe laws and that the high taste which results from cultivation repudiates all excess of mere manner the simple fact is that an educated frenchman is a great actor all the while and that when he goes on the stage he has much less to do to be perfect than an englishman who has drilled himself into coldness or an american who looks upon strong expressions of feeling as affectation when the two latter commence the business of playing assumed parts they consider it as a new occupation and go at it so much in earnest that everybody sees they are acting19  footnote 19 mr mathews and mr power were the nearest to the neat acting of france of any male english performers the writer ever saw the first sometimes permitted himself to be led astray by the caricatures he was required to represent and by the tastes of his audience but the latter so far as the writer has seen him appears determined to be chaste come what come will  you will remember i say nothing in favour of the french tragic representations when a great and an intellectual nation like france unites to applaud images and sentiments that are communicated through their own peculiar forms of speech it becomes a stranger to distrust his own knowledge rather than their taste i dare say that were i more accustomed to the language i might enjoy corneille and racine and even voltaire for i can now greatly enjoy molière but to be honest in the matter all reciters of heroic french poetry appear to me to depend on a pompous declamation to compensate for the poverty of the idioms and the want of nobleness in the expressions i never heard any one poet or actor he who read his own verses or he who repeated those of others who did not appear to mouth and all their tragic playing has had the air of being on stilts napoleon has said from the sublime to the ridiculous it is but a step this is much truer in france than in most other countries for the sublime is commonly so sublimated that it will admit of no great increase racine in a most touching scene makes one of his heroic characters offer to wipe off the tears of a heroine lest they should discolour her rouge i had a classmate at college who was so very ultra courtly in his language that he never forgot to say mr julius caesar and mr homer  there exists a perfect mania for letters throughout europe in this piping time of peace statesmen soldiers peers princes and kings hardly think themselves illustrated until each has produced his book the world never before saw a tithe of the names of people of condition figuring in the catalogues of its writers some thinks he writes cinnahe owns to panurge applies to half the people one meets in society i was at a dinner lately given by the marquis de  when the table was filled with peers generals exministers exambassadors naturalists philosophers and statesmen of all degrees casting my eyes round the circle i was struck with the singular prevalence of the cacoethes scribendi among so many men of different educations antecedents and pursuits there was a soldier present who had written on taste a politician on the art of war a diplomate who had dabbled in poetry and a jurist who pretended to enlighten the world in ethics it was the drollest assemblage in the world and suggested many queer associations for i believe the only man at table who had not dealt in ink was an old lieutenantgeneral who sat by me and who when i alluded to the circumstance strongly felicitated himself that he had escaped the mania of the age as it was an illustration of itself among the convives were cuvier villemain daru and several others who are almost as well known to science and letters  half the voluntary visits i receive are preceded by a volume of some sort or other as a token of my new acquaintance being a regularly initiated member of the fraternity of the quill in two or three instances i have been surprised at subsequently discovering that the regular profession of the writer is arms or some other pursuit in which one would scarcely anticipate so strong a devotion to letters in short such is the actual state of opinion in europe that one is hardly satisfied with any amount or any quality of glory until it is consummated by that of having written a book napoleon closed his career with the quill and his successor was hardly on his throne before he began to publish the principal officers of the empire and émigrés without number have fairly set to work as so many disinterested historians and even a lady who by way of abbreviation is called the widow of the grand army is giving us regularly volumes whose eccentricities and periodicity as the astronomers say can be reduced to known laws by the use of figures  in the middle ages golden spurs were the object of every mans ambition without them neither wealth nor birth nor power was properly esteemed and at the present time passing from the lance to the pen from the casque and shield to the inkpot and fools cap we all seek a passport from the order of letters does this augur good or evil for the world the public press of france is conducted with great spirit and talents on all sides it has few points in common with our own beyond the mere fact of its general character in america a single literary man putting the best face on it enters into a compact with some person of practical knowledge a printer perhaps and together they establish a newspaper the mechanical part of which is confided to the care of the latter partner and the intellectual to the former in the country half the time the editor is no other than the printer himself the division of labour not having yet reached even this important branch of industry but looking to the papers that are published in the towns one man of letters is a luxury about an american print there are a few instances in which there are two or three but generally the subordinates are little more than scissorsmen now it must be apparent at a glance that no one individual can keep up the character of a daily print of any magnitude the drain on his knowledge and other resources being too great this i take it is the simple reason why the press of america ranks no higher than it does the business is too much divided too much is required and this too in a country where matters of grave import are of rare occurrence and in which the chief interests are centred in the vulgar concerns of mere party politics with little or no connexion with great measures or great principles you have only to fancy the superior importance that attaches to the views of powerful monarchs the secret intrigues of courts on whose results perhaps depend the fortunes of christendom and the serious and radical principles that are dependent on the great changes of systems that are silently working their way in this part of the world and which involve material alterations in the very structure of society to get an idea of how much more interest a european journal ceteris paribus must be compared to an american journal by the nature of its facts alone it is true that we get a portion of these facts as light finally arrives from the remoter stars but mutilated and necessarily shorn of much of their interest by their want of importance to our own country i had been in europe some time before i could fully comprehend the reason why i was ignorant of so many minor points of its political history for from boyhood up i had been an attentive reader of all that touched this part of the world as it appeared in our prints by dint of inquiry however i believe i have come at the fact the winds are by no means as regular as the daily prints and it frequently happens especially in the winter and spring months that five or six packets arrive nearly together bringing with them the condensed intelligence of as many weeks now newspaper finders notoriously seek the latest news and in the hurry and confusion of reading and selecting and bringing out to meet the wants of the day many of the connecting links are lost readers get imperfect notions of men and things and from a want of a complete understanding of the matter the mind gives up without regret the little and unsatisfactory knowledge it had so casually obtained i take it this is a principal cause of the many false notions that exist among us on the subject of europe and its events  in france a paper is established by a regular subscription of capital a principal editor is selected and he is commonly supported in the case of a leading journal by four or five paid assistants in addition to this formidable corps many of the most distinguished men of france are known to contribute freely to the columns of the prints in the interest of their cause  the laws of france compel a journal that has admitted any statement involving facts concerning an individual to publish his reply that the antidote may meet the poison this is a regulation that we might adopt with great advantage to truth and the character of the country  there is not at this moment within my knowledge a single critical literary journal of received authority in all france this is a species of literature to which the french pay but little attention just now although many of the leading daily prints contain articles on the principal works as they appear  by the little that has come under my observation i should say the fraudulent and disgusting system of puffing and of abusing as interest or pique dictates is even carried to a greater length in france than it is in either england or america the following anecdote which relates to myself may give you some notion of the modus operandi  all the works i had written previously to coming to europe had been taken from the english editions and translated appearing simultaneously with their originals having an intention to cause a new book to be printed in english in paris for the sake of reading the proofs the necessity was felt of getting some control over the translation lest profiting by the interval necessary to send the sheets home to be reprinted it might appear as the original book i knew that the sheets of previous books had been purchased in england and i accordingly sent a proposition to the publishers that the next bargain should be made with me under the impression that an authors price would be asked they took the alarm and made difficulties finding me firm and indisposed to yield to some threats of doing as they pleased the matter was suspended for a few days just at this moment i received through the post a single number of an obscure newspaper whose existence until then was quite unknown to me surprised at such an attention i was curious to know the contents the journal contained an article on my merits and demerits as a writer the latter being treated with a good deal of freedom when one gets a paper in this manner containing abuse of himself he is pretty safe in believing its opinions dishonest but i had even better evidence than common in this particular case for i happened to be extolled for the manner in which i had treated the character of franklin a personage whose name even had never appeared in anything i had written this of course settled the character of the critique and the next time i saw the individual who had acted as agent in the negociation just mentioned i gave him the paper and told him i was half disposed to raise my price on account of the pitiful manoeuvre it contained we had already come to terms the publishers finding that the price was little more than nominal and the answer was a virtual conclusion that the article was intended to affect my estimate of the value of the intended work in france and to bring me under subjection to the critics20  footnote 20 the writer suffers this anecdote to stand as it was written nine years since but since his return home he has discovered that we are in no degree behind the french in the corruption and frauds that render the pursuits of a writer one of the most humiliating and revolting in which a man of any pride of character can engage unless he resolutely maintains his independence a temerity that is certain to be resented by all those who unequal to going alone in the paths of literature seek their ends by clinging to those who can either as pirates or robbers  i apprehend that few books are brought before the public in france dependent only on their intrinsic merits and the system of intrigue which predominates in everything is as active in this as in other interests  in france a book that penetrates to the provinces may be said to be popular and as for a book coming from the provinces it is almost unheard of the despotism of the trade on this point is unyielding paris appears to deem itself the arbiter in all matters of taste and literature and it is almost as unlikely that a new fashion should come from lyon or bordeaux or marseilles as that a new work should be received with favour that was published in either of those towns the approbation of paris is indispensable and the publishers of the capital assisted by their paid corps of puffers and detractors are sufficiently powerful to prevent that potent public to whom all affect to defer from judging for itself  we have lately had a proof here of the unwillingness of the parisians to permit others to decide for them in anything relating to taste in a case that refers to us americans madame malibran arrived from america a few months since in europe she was unknown but the great name of her father stood in her stead unluckily it was whispered that she had met with great success in america america and this too in conjunction with music and the opera the poor woman was compelled to appear under the disadvantage of having brought an american reputation with her and seriously this single fact went nigh to destroy her fortunes those wretches who as coleridge expresses it are animalculae who live by feeding on the body of genius affected to be displeased and the public hesitated at their suggestions about accepting an artist from the colonies as they still have the audacity to call the great republic i have no means of knowing what sacrifices were made to the petty tyrants of the press before this woman who has the talents necessary to raise her to the summit of her profession was enabled to gain the favour of a generous and discerning public     letter xvi  environs of parisvillage of st ouenour house therelife on the riverparisian cockneysa pretty grisettevoyage across the seine a rash adventurervillage fêtemontmorencyview near paris   to james stevenson esquire albany  we have been the residents of a french village ever since the 1st of june and it is now drawing to the close of october we had already passed the greater part of a summer and entire autumn winter and spring within the walls of paris and then we thought we might indulge our tastes a little by retreating to the fields to catch a glimpse of country life you will smile when i add that we are only a league from the barrière de clichy this is the reason i have not before spoken of the removal for we are in town three or four times every week and never miss an occasion when there is anything to be seen i shall now proceed however to let you into the secret of our actual situation  i passed the month of may examining the environs of the capital in quest of an house as this was an agreeable occupation we were in no hurry but having set up my cabriolet we killed two birds with one stone by making ourselves familiarly acquainted with nearly every village or hamlet within three leagues of paris a distance beyond which i did not wish to go  on the side of st cloud which embraces passy auteuil and all the places that encircle the bois de boulogne the hyde park of paris there are very many pleasant residences but from one cause or another no one suited us exactly and we finally took a house in the village of st ouen the runnymeade of france when louis xviii came in 1814 to his capital in the rear of the allies he stopped for a few days at st ouen a league from the barriers where there was a small chateau that was the property of the crown here he was met by m de talleyrand and others and hence he issued the celebrated charter that is to render france for evermore a constitutional country  the chateau has since been razed and a pavilion erected in its place which has been presented to the comtesse de  a lady who reversing the ordinary lot of courtiers is said to cause majesty to live in the sunshine of her smiles what an appropriate and encouraging monument to rear on the birthplace of french liberty at the opposite extremity of the village is another considerable house that was once the dwelling of m necker and is now the property and country residence of m ternaux or the baron ternaux if it were polite to style him thus the most celebrated manufacturer of france i say polite for the mere fanfaronnade of nobility is little in vogue here the wags tell a story of some one who was formally announced as monsieur le marquis dun tel turning short round on the servant and exclaiming with indignation marquis toimême but this story savours of the bonapartists for as the emperor created neither marquis nor vicomtes there was a sort of affectation of assuming these titles at the restoration as proofs of belonging to the old régime  st ouen is a cluster of small mean stone houses stretched along the right bank of the seine which after making a circuit of near twenty miles winds round so close to the town again that they are actually constructing a basin near the village for the use of the capital it being easier to wheel articles from this point to paris than to contend with the current and to tread its shoals in addition to the two houses named however it has six or eight respectable abodes between the street and the river one of which is our own  this place became a princely residence about the year 1800 since which time it has been more or less frequented as such down to the 4th june 1814 the date of the memorable charter21 madame de pompadour possessed the chateau in 1745 so you see it has been dust to dust with this place as with all that is frail  footnote 21 the chateau of st ouen rather less than two centuries since passed into the possession of the duc de gesvre dulaure gives the followinga part of a letter from this noblemanas a specimen of the education of a duc in the seventeenth centurymonsieur me trouvant obligé de randre une bonne

great connétable anne de montmorency could not write his name and as his signature became necessary his secretary stood over his shoulder to tell him when he had made enough piès de mouche to answer the purpose  the village of st ouen small dirty crowded and unsavoury as it is has a place like every other french village when we drove into it to look at the house i confess to having laughed outright at the idea of inhabiting such a hole two large portescochères however opened from the square and we were admitted through the bestlooking of the two into a spacious and an extremely neat court on one side of the gate was a lodge for a porter and on the other a building to contain gardeners tools plants etc the walls that separate it from the square and the adjoining gardens are twelve or fourteen feet high and once within them the world is completely excluded the width of the grounds does not exceed a hundred and fifty feet the length the form being that of a parallelogram may be three hundred or a little more and yet in these narrow limits which are planted à langlaise so well is everything contrived that we appear to have abundance of room the garden terminates in a terrace that overhangs the river and from this point the eye ranges over a wide extent of beautiful plain that is bounded by fine bold hills which are teeming with gray villages and bourgs  the house is of stone and not without elegance it may be ninety feet in length by some forty in width the entrance is into a vestibule which has the offices on the right and the great staircase on the left the principal salon is in front this is a good room near thirty feet long fifteen or sixteen high and has three good windows that open on the garden the billiardroom communicates on one side and the salle à manger on the other next the latter come the offices again and next the billiardroom is a very pretty little boudoir up stairs are suites of bedrooms and dressingrooms every thing is neat and the house is in excellent order and well furnished for a country residence now all this i get at a hundred dollars a month for the five summer months there are also a carriagehouse and stabling for three horses the gardener and porter are paid by the proprietor the village however is not in much request and the rent is thought to be low  among the great advantages enjoyed by a residence in europe are the facilities of this nature furnished apartments or furnished houses can be had in almost every town of any size and owning your own linen and plate nearly every other necessary is found you it is true that one sometimes misses comforts to which he has been accustomed in his own house but in france many little things are found it is not usual to meet with elsewhere thus no principal bedroom is considered properly furnished in a good house without a handsome secretary and a bureau these two articles are as much matters of course as are the eternal two rooms and folding doors in new york  this then has been our tusculum since june m ternaux enlivens the scene occasionally by a dinner and he has politely granted us permission to walk in his grounds which are extensive and well laid out for the old french style we have a neighbour on our left name unknown who gives suppers in his garden and concerts that really are worthy of the grand opera occasionally we get a song in a female voice that rivals the best of madame malibrans on our right lives a staid widow whose establishment is as tranquil as our own  one of our great amusements is to watch the living life on the river there is no still life in france all the washerwomen of the village assemble three days in the week beneath our terrace and a merrier set of grisettes is not to be found in the neighbourhood of paris they chat and joke and splash and scream from morning to night lightening the toil by neverceasing good humour occasionally an enormous scowlike barge is hauled up against the current by stout horses loaded to the waters edge or one without freight comes dropping down the stream nearly filling the whole river as it floats broadside to there are three or four islands opposite and now and then a small boat is seen paddling among them we have even tried punting ourselves but the amusement was soon exhausted  sunday is a great day with us for then the shore is lined with parisians as thoroughly cockney as if bowbells could be heard in the quartier montmartre these good people visit us in all sorts of ways some on donkeys some in cabriolets some in fiacres and by far the larger portion on foot they are perfectly inoffensive and unobtrusive being in this respect just as unlike an american inroad from a town as can well be these crowds pass vineyards on their way to us unprotected by any fences this point in the french character however about which so much has been said to our disadvantage as well as to that of the english is subject to some explanation the statues promenades gardens etc etc are almost without exception guarded by sentinels and then there are agents of the police in common clothes scattered through the towns in such numbers as to make depredations hazardous in the country each commune has one or more gardes champêtres whose sole business it is to detect and arrest trespassers when to these are added the gendarmes à pied and à cheval who are constantly in motion one sees that the risk of breaking the laws is attended with more hazard here than with us there is no doubt on the other hand that the training and habits produced by such a system of watchfulness enter so far into the character of the people that they cease to think of doing that which is so strenuously denied them  some of our visitors make their appearance in a very quaint style i met a party the other day among whom the following family arrangement had obtainedthe man was mounted on a donkey with his feet just clear of the ground the wife a buxom brunette was trudging afoot in the rear accompanied by the two younger children a boy and girl between twelve and fourteen led by a small dog fastened to a string like the guide of a blind mendicant while the eldest daughter was mounted on the crupper maintaining her equilibrium by a masculine disposition of her lower limbs she was a fine rosycheeked grisette of about seventeen and as they ambled along just fast enough to keep the cur on a slow trot her cap flared in the wind her black eyes flashed with pleasure and her dark ringlets streamed behind her like so many silken pennants she had a ready laugh for every one she met and a sort of malicious pleasure in asking by her countenance if they did not wish they too had a donkey as the seat was none of the most commodious she had contrived to make a pair of stirrups of her petticoats the gown was pinned up about her waist leaving her knees instead of her feet as the points dappui the wellturned legs and the ankles with such a chaussure as at once marks a parisienne were exposed to the admiration of a parterre of some hundreds of idle wayfarers truly it is no wonder that sculptors abound in this country for capital models are to be found even in the highways the donkey was the only one who appeared displeased with this monture and he only manifested dissatisfaction by lifting his hinder extremities a little as the man occasionally touched his flanks with a nettle that the ass would much rather have been eating  not long since i passed half an hour on the terrace an amused witness of the perils of a voyage across the seine in a punt the adventurers were a bourgeois his wife sister and child honest pierre the waterman had conditioned to take the whole party to the island opposite and to return them safe to the main for the modicum of five sous the old fox invariably charged me a franc for the same service there was much demurring and many doubts about encountering the risk and more than once the women would have receded had not the man treated the matter as a trifle he affirmed parole dhonneur that his father had crossed the maine a dozen times and no harm had come of it this encouraged them and with many pretty screams mes fois and oh dieu they finally embarked the punt was a narrow scow that a ton weight would not have disturbed the river was so low and sluggish that it might have been forded twothirds of the distance and the width was not three hundred feet pierre protested that the danger was certainly not worth mentioning and away he went as philosophical in appearance as his punt the voyage was made in safety and the bows of the boat had actually touched the shore on its return before any of the passengers ventured to smile the excursion like most travelling was likely to be most productive of happiness by the recollections but the women were no sooner landed than that rash adventurer the husband brother and father seized an oar and began to ply it with all his force he merely wished to tell his confrères of the rue montmartre how a punt might be rowed pierre had gallantly landed to assist the ladies and the boat relieved of its weight slowly yielded to the impulse of the oar and inclined its bows from the land oh edouard mon mari mon frèreque faistu exclaimed the ladies ce nest rien returned the man puffing and giving another lusty sweep by which he succeeded in forcing the punt fully twenty feet from the shore edouard cher edouard laissemoi mamuserje mamuse je mamuse cried the husband in a tone of indignant remonstrance but edouard a tight sleek little épicier of about fiveandthirty had never heard that an oar on each side was necessary in a boat and the harder he pulled the less likely was he to regain the shore of this he began to be convinced as he whirled more into the centre of the current and his efforts now really became frantic for his imagination probably painted the horrors of a distant voyage in an unknown bark to an unknown land and all without food or compass the women screamed and the louder they cried the more strenuously he persevered in saying laissemoi mamuserje mamuse je mamuse by this time the perspiration poured from the face of edouard and i called to the imperturbable pierre who stood in silent admiration of his punt while playing such antics and desired him to tell the man to put his oar on the bottom and to push the boat ashore oui monsieur said the rogue with a leer for he remembered the francs and we soon had our adventurer safe on terra firma again then began the tender expostulations the affectionate reproaches and the kind injunctions for the truant to remember that he was a husband and a father edouard secretly cursing the punt and all rivers in his heart made light of the matter however protesting to the last that he had only been enjoying himself  we have had a fête too for every village in the vicinity of paris has its fête the square was filled with whirligigs and flyinghorses and all the ingenious contrivances of the french to make and to spend a sou pleasantly there was service in the parish church at which our neighbours sang in a style fit for st peters and the villagers danced quadrilles on the green with an air that would be thought fine in many a country drawingroom  i enjoy all this greatly for to own the truth the crowds and mannered sameness of paris began to weary me our friends occasionally come from town to see us and we make good use of the cabriolet as we are near neighbours to st denis we have paid several visits to the tombs of the french kings and returned each time less pleased with most of the unmeaning obsequies that are observed in their vaults there was a ceremony not long since at which the royal family and many of the great officers of the court assisted and among others m de talleyrand the latter was in the body of the church when a man rushed upon him and actually struck him or shoved him to the earth using at the same time language that left no doubt of the nature of the assault there are strange rumours connected with the affair the assailant was a marquis de  and it is reported that his wrongs real or imaginary are connected with a plot to rob one of the dethroned family of her jewels or of some crown jewels i cannot say which at the epoch of the restoration the journals said a good deal about it at the time but events occur so fast here that a quarrel of this sort produces little sensation i pretend to no knowledge of the merits of this affair and only give a general outline of what was current in the public prints at the time  we have also visited enghien and montmorency the latter as you know already stands on the side of a low mountain in plain view of paris it is a town of some size with very uneven streets some of them being actually sharp acclivities and a gothic church that is seen from afar and that is well worth viewing near by these quaint edifices afford us deep delight by their antiquity architecture size and pious histories what matters it to us how much or how little superstition may blend with the rites when we know and feel that we are standing in a nave that has echoed with orisons to god for a thousand years this of montmorency is not quite so old however having been rebuilt only three centuries since  dulaure a severe judge of aristocracy denounces the pretension of the montmorencies to be the premiers barons chrétiens affirming that they were neither the first barons nor the first christians by a great many he says that the extravagant title has most probably been a warcry in the time of the crusaders according to his account of the family it originated about the year 1008 in a certain borchard who proving a bad neighbour to the abbey of st denis the vassals of which he was in the habit of robbing besides now and then despoiling a monk the king caused his fortress in the isle st denis to be razed after which by a treaty he was put in possession of the mountain hard by with permission to erect another hold near a fountain at a place called in the charters montmorenciacum hence the name and the family this writer thinks that the first castle must have been built of wood  we took a road that led us up to a bluff on the mountain behind the town where we obtained a new and very peculiar view of paris and its environs i have said that the french towns have no straggling suburbs a few winehouses to save the octroi are built near the gates compactly as in the town itself and there the buildings cease as suddenly as if pared down by a knife the fields touch the walls in many places and between st ouen and the guinguettes and winehouses at the barrière de clichy a distance of two miles there is but a solitary building a wide plain separates paris on this side from the mountains and of course our view extended across it the number of villages was absolutely astounding although i did not attempt counting them i should think not fewer than a hundred were in sight all grey picturesque and clustering round the high nave and church tower like chickens gathering beneath the wing the day was clouded and the hamlets rose from their beds of verdure sombre but distinct with their faces of wall now in subdued light and now quite shaded resembling the glorious darks of rembrandts pictures     letter xvii  rural drivesfrench peasantryview of montmartrethe boulevards the abattoirssearch for lodgingsa queer breakfastroyal progresses and magnificencefrench carriages and horsesmodes of conveyancedrunkennessfrench criminal justicemarvellous stories of the police   to capt m perry usn  i am often in the saddle since our removal to st ouen i first commenced the business of exploring in the cabriolet with my wife for a companion during which time several very pretty drives of whose existence one journeying along the great roads would form no idea were discovered at last as these became exhausted i mounted and pricked into the fields the result has been a better knowledge of the details of ordinary rural life in this country than a stranger would get by a residence after the ordinary fashion of years  i found the vast plain intersected by roads as intricate as the veins of the human body the comparison is not unapt by the way and may be even carried out much further for the grandes routes can be compared to the arteries the chemins vicinaux or crossroads to the veins and the innumerable paths that intersect the fields in all directions to the more minute bloodvessels circulation being the object common to all  i mount my horse and gallop into the fields at random merely taking care not to quit the paths by the latter one can go in almost any direction and as they are very winding there is a certain pleasure in following their sinuosities doubtful whither they tend much of the plain is in vegetables for the use of paris though there is occasionally a vineyard or a field of grain the weather has become settled and autumnal and is equally without the chilling moisture of the winter or the fickleness of the spring the kindhearted peasants see me pass among them without distrust and my salutations are answered with cheerfulness and civility even at this trifling distance from the capital i miss the brusque ferocity that is so apt to characterise the deportment of its lower classes who are truly the people that voltaire has described as ou singes ou tigres nothing i think strikes an american more than the marked difference between the town and country of france with us the towns are less townlike and the country less countrylike than is usually the case our towns are provincial from the want of tone that can only be acquired by time while it is a fault with our country to wish to imitate the towns i now allude to habits only for nature at home owing to the great abundance of wood is more strikingly rural than in any other country i know the inhabitant of paris can quit his own door in the centre of the place and after walking an hour he finds himself truly in the country both as to the air of external objects and as to the manners of the people the influence of the capital doubtless has some little effect on the latter but not enough to raise them above the ordinary rusticity for the french peasants are as rustic in their appearance and habits as the upper classes are refined  one of my rides is through the plain that lies between st ouen and montmartre ascending the latter by its rear to the windmills that night and day are whirling their ragged arms over the capital of france thence i descend into the town by the carriage road a view from this height is like a glimpse into the pages of history for every foot of land that it commands and more than half the artificial accessories are pregnant of the past looking down into the fissures between the houses men appear the mites they are and one gets to have a philosophical indifference to human vanities by obtaining these birdseye views of them in the mass it was a happy thought that first suggested the summits of mountains for religious contemplation nor do i think the father of evil discovered his usual sagacity when he resorted to such a place for the purposes of selfish temptation perhaps however it would be better to say he betrayed the grovelling propensities of his own nature the cathedral of notre dame should have been reared on this noble and isolated height that the airs of heaven might whisper through its fane breathing the chaunts in honour of god  dismounting manfully i have lately undertaken a far more serious enterprisethat of making the entire circuit of paris on foot my companion was our old friend captain  we met by appointment at eleven oclock just without the barrière de clichy and ordering the carriage to come for us at five off we started taking the direction of the eastern side of the town you probably know that what are commonly called the boulevards of paris are no more than a circular line of wide streets through the very heart of the place which obtain their common appellation from the fact that they occupy the sites of the ancient walls thus the street within this circuit is called by its name whatever it may happen to be and if continued without the circuit the term of faubourg or suburb is added as in the case of the rue st honoré and the rue du faubourg st honoré the latter being strictly a continuation of the former but lying without the site of the ancient walls as the town has increased it has been found necessary to enlarge its enceinte and the walls are now encircled with wide avenues that are called the outer boulevards there are avenues within and without the walls and immediately beneath them and in many places both are planted our route was on the exterior  we began the march in good spirits and by twelve we had handsomely done our four miles and a half of course we passed the different barrières and the gate of père lachaise the captain commenced with great vigour and for near two hours as he expressed himself he had me a little on his lee quarter not more however he thought than was due to his superior rank for he had once been my senior as a midshipman at the barrière du trône we were compelled to diverge a little from the wall in order to get across the river by the pont dausterlitz by this time i had ranged up abeam of the commodore and i proposed that we should follow the river up as far as the wall again in order to do our work honestly but to this he objected that he had no wish to puzzle himself with spherical trigonometry that plane sailing was his humour at the moment and that he had moreover just discovered that one of his boots pinched his foot accordingly we proceeded straight from the bridge not meeting the wall again until we were beyond the abattoir these abattoirs are slaughterhouses that napoleon caused to be built near the walls in some places within and in others without them according to the different localities there are five or six of them that of montmartre being the most considerable they are kept in excellent order and the regulations respecting them appear to be generally good the butchers sell their meats in shops all over the town a general custom in europe and one that has more advantages than disadvantages as it enables the inhabitant to order a meal at any moment this independence in the mode of living distinguishes all the large towns of this part of the world from our own for i greatly question if there be any civilized people among whom the individual is as much obliged to consult the habits and tastes of all in gratifying his own as in free and independent america a part of this uncomfortable feature in our domestic economy is no doubt the result of circumstances unavoidably connected with the condition of a young country but a great deal is to be ascribed to the practice of referring everything to the public and not a little to those religious sects who extended their supervision to all the affairs of life that had a chief concern in settling the country and who have entailed so much that is inconvenient and ungraceful i might almost say in some instances disgraceful on the nation blended with so much that forms its purest sources of pride men are always an inconsistent medley of good and bad  the captain and myself had visited the abattoir of montmartre only a few days previously to this excursion and we had both been much gratified with its order and neatness but an unfortunate pile of hocks hoofs tallow and nameless fragments of carcasses had caught my companions eye i found him musing over this omnium gatherum which he protested was worse than a breadpudding at saratoga by some process of reasoning that was rather material than philosophical he came to the conclusion that the substratum of all the extraordinary compounds he had met with at the restaurans was derived from this pile and he swore as terribly as any of our army in flanders that not another mouthful would he touch while he remained in paris if the dish put his knowledge of natural history at fault he had all along suspected he had been eating cats and vermin but his imagination had never pictured to him such a store of abominations for the casserole as were to be seen in this pile in vain i asked him if he did not find the dishes good cats might be good for anything he knew but he was too old to change his habits on the present occasion he made the situation of the abattoir divry an excuse for not turning up the river by the wall i do not think however we gained anything in the distance the détour to cross the bridge more than equalling the ground we missed  we came under the wall again at the barrière de ville juif and followed it keeping on the side next the town until we fairly reached the river once more beyond vaugirard here we were compelled to walk some distance to cross the pont de jena and again to make a considerable circuit through passy on account of the gardens in order to do justice to our task about this time the commodore fairly fell astern and he discovered that the other boot was too large i kept talking to him over my shoulder and cheering him on and he felicitated me on frogs agreeing so well with my constitution at length we came in at the barrière de clichy just as the clocks struck three or in four hours to a minute from the time we had left the same spot we had neither stopped eaten nor drunk a mouthful the distance is supposed to be about eighteen miles but i can hardly think it is so much for we went rather further than if we had closely followed the wall  our agility having greatly exceeded my calculations we were obliged to walk two miles further in order to find the carriage the time expended in going this distance included we were just four hours and a half on our feet the captain protested that his boots had disgraced him and forthwith commanded another pair a subterfuge that did him no good  one anecdote connected with the sojourn of this eccentric but really excellenthearted and intelligent man22 at paris is too good not to be told he cannot speak a word of pure french and of all anglicizing of the language i have ever heard his attempts at it are the most droll he calls the tuileries tullyrees the jardin des plantes the garden dis plants the guillotine gullyteen and the garçons of the cafés gassons choleric with whiskers like a bear and a voice of thunder if anything goes wrong he swears away starboard and larboard in french and english in delightful discord  footnote 22 he is since dead  he sought me out soon after his arrival and carried me with him as an interpreter in quest of lodgings we found a very snug little apartment of four rooms that he took the last occupant was a lady who in letting the rooms conditioned that marie her servant must be hired with them to look after the furniture and to be in readiness to receive her at her return from the provinces a few days after this arrangement i called and was surprised on ringing the bell to hear the cry of an infant after a moments delay the door was cautiously opened and the captain in his gruffest tone demanded cur vully voo an exclamation of surprise at seeing me followed but instead of opening the door for my admission he held it for a moment as if undecided whether to be at home or not at this critical instant an infant cried again and the thing became too ridiculous for further gravity we both laughed outright i entered and found the captain with a child three days old tucked under his right arm or that which had been concealed by the door the explanation was very simple and infinitely to his credit  marie the locum tenens of the lady who had let the apartment and the wife of a coachman who was in the country was the mother of the infant after its birth she presented herself to her new master told her story adding by means of an interpreter that if he turned her away she had no place in which to lay her head the kindhearted fellow made out to live abroad as well as he could for a day or twoan easy thing enough in paris by the wayand when i so unexpectedly entered marie was actually cooking the captains breakfast in the kitchen while he was nursing the child in the salon  the dialogues between the captain and marie were to the last degree amusing he was quite unconscious of the odd sounds he uttered in speaking french but thought he was getting on very well being rather minute and particular in his orders and she felt his kindness to herself and child so sensibly that she always fancied she understood his wishes i was frequently compelled to interpret between them first asking him to explain himself in english for i could make but little of his french myself on one occasion he invited me to breakfast as we were to pass the day exploring in company by way of inducement he told me that he had accidentally found some cocoa in the shell and that he had been teaching marie how to cook it shipfashion i would not promise as his hour was rather early and the distance between us so great but before eleven i would certainly be with him i breakfasted at home therefore but was punctual to the latter engagement i hope you have breakfasted cried the captain rather fiercely as i entered i satisfied him on this point and then after a minute of demure reflection he resumed you are lucky for marie boiled the cocoa and after throwing away the liquor she buttered and peppered the shells and served them for me to eat i dont see how she made such a mistake for i was very particular in my directions and be dd to her i dont care so much about my own breakfast neither for that can be had at the next café but the poor creature has lost hers which i told her to cook out of the rest of the cocoa i had the curiosity to inquire how he had made out to tell marie to do all this why i showed her the cocoa to be sure and then told her to boily vousmême there was no laughing at this and so i went with the captain to a café after which we proceeded in quest of the gullyteen which he was particularly anxious to see  my rides often extend to the heights behind malmaison and st cloud where there is a fine country and where some of the best views in the vicinity of paris are to be obtained as the court is at st cloud i often meet different members of the royal family dashing to or from town or perhaps passing from one of their abodes to another the style is pretty uniform for i do not remember to have ever met the king but once with less than eight horses the exception was quite early one morning when he was going into the country with very little éclat accompanied by the dauphine even on this occasion he was in a carriage and six followed by another with four and attended by a dozen mounted men these royal progresses are truly magnificent and they serve greatly to enliven the road as we live so near the country palace the king has been quite lately to a camp formed at st omer and i happened to meet a portion of his equipages on their return the carriages i saw were very neatly built postchaises well leathered and contained what are here called the officers of the mouth alias cooks and purveyors they were all drawn by four horses this was a great occasionfurniture being actually sent from the palace of compiègne for the kings lodgings and the court is said to have employed seventy different vehicles to transport it i saw about a dozen  returning the other night from a dinnerparty given on the banks of the seine a few miles above us i saw flaring lights gleaming along the highway which at first caused nearly as much conjecture as some of the adventures of don quixotte my horse proving a little restive i pulled up placing the cabriolet on one side of the road for the first impression was that the cattle employed at some funeral procession had taken flight and were running away it proved to be the dauphine dashing towards st cloud this was the first time i had ever met any of the royal equipages at night and the passage was much the most picturesque of any i had hitherto seen footmen holding flaming flambeaux rode in pairs in front by the side of the carriage and in its rear the piqueur scouring along the road in advance like a rocket by the way a lady of the court told me lately that louis xviii had lost some of his french by the emigration for he did not know how to pronounce this word piqueur  on witnessing all this magnificence the mind is carried back a few generations in the inquiry after the progress of luxury and the usages of our fathers coaches were first used in england in the reign of elizabeth it is clear enough by the pictures in the louvre that in the time of louis xiv the royal carriages were huge clumsy vehicles with at least three seats mademoiselle de montpensier in her memoirs tells us how often she took her place at the window in order to admire the graceful attitudes of m de lauzun who rode near it there is still in existence in the bibliothèque du roi a letter of henry iv to sully in which the king explains to the grand master the reason why he could not come to the arsenal that day the excuse being that the queen was using the carriage today his descendant seldom moves at a pace slower than ten miles the hour is drawn by eight horses and is usually accompanied by one or more empty vehicles of equal magnificence to receive him in the event of an accident  notwithstanding all this regal splendour the turnouts of paris as a whole are by no means remarkable the genteelest and the fashionable carriage is the chariot i like the proportions of the french carriages better than those of the english or our own the first being too heavy and the last too light the french vehicles appear to me to be in this respect a happy medium but the finish is by no means equal to that of the english carriages nor at all better than that of ours there are relatively a large proportion of shabbygenteel equipages at paris even the vehicles that are seen standing in the court of the tuileries on a reception day are not at all superior to the better sort of american carriages though the liveries are much more showy  few people here own the carriages and horses they use even the strangers who are obliged to have travelling vehicles rarely use them in town the road and the streets requiring very different sorts of equipages there are certain jobdealers who furnish all that is required for a stipulated sum you select the carriage and horses on trial and contract at so much a month or at so much a year the coachman usually comes with the equipage as does the footman sometimes though both are paid by the person taking the coach they will wear your livery if you choose and you can have your arms put on the carriage if desirable i pay five hundred francs a month for a carriage and horses and forty francs for a coachman i believe this is the usual price i have a right to have a pair of horses always at my command finding nothing but the stable and even this would be unnecessary in paris if we go away from our own stable i pay five francs a day extra there is a very great convenience to strangers in particular in this system for one can set up and lay down a carriage without unnecessary trouble or expense as it may be wanted in everything of this nature we have no town that has the least character or the conveniences of a capital  the french have little to boast of in the way of horseflesh most of the fine coach and cabriolet cattle of paris come from mecklenburgh though some are imported from england it is not common to meet with a very fine animal of the native breed in america land is so plenty and so cheap that we keep a much larger proportion of brute force than is kept here it is not uncommon with us to meet with those who live by days work using either oxen or horses the consequence is that many beasts are raised with little care and with scarcely any attention to the breeds we find many good ones in spite of bad grooming little training and hard work i greatly question if even england possesses a larger proportion of good horses comparing the population of the two countries than america our animals are quicker footed and at trotting i suspect we could beat the world christendom certainly the great avenue between the garden of the tuileries and the bois de boulogne with the allées of the latter are the places to meet the fastgoers of the french capital and i am strongly of opinion that there is no such exhibition of speed in either as one meets on the third avenue of new york as for the avenue de neuilly our sulky riders would vanish like the wind from anything i have seen on it although one meets there occasionally fine animals from all parts of europe  the cattle of the diligences of the posthouses and even of the cavalry of france are solid hardy and good feeders but they are almost entirely without speed or action the two former are very much the same and it is a hard matter to get more than eight miles out of them without breaking into a gallop or more than ten if put under the whip now a short time previously to leaving home i went eleven measured miles in a public coach in two minutes less than an hour the whip untouched i sat on the box by the side of the driver and know that this was done under a pull that actually disabled one of his arms and that neither of the four animals broke its trot it is not often our roads will admit of this but had we the roads of england i make little doubt we should altogether outdo her in speed as for the horses used here in the public conveyances and for the post routes they are commonly compact clumsy beasts with less force than their shape would give reason to suppose their manes are long and shaggy the fetlocks are rarely trimmed the shoes are seldom corked and when there is a little coquetry the tail is braided in this trim with a coarse harness that is hardly ever cleaned traces of common rope and half the time no blinkers or reins away they scamper with their heads in all directions like the classical representation of a team in an ancient car through thick and thin working with all their might to do two posts within an hour one being the legal measure these animals appear to possess a strange bonhomie being obedient willing and tractable although in the way of harness and reins they are pretty much their own masters  my excursions in the environs have made me acquainted with a great variety of modes of communication between the capital and its adjacent villages although paris is pared down so accurately and is almost without suburbs the population within a circuit of ten miles in each direction is almost equal to that of paris itself st denis has several thousands st germain the same and versailles is still a town of considerable importance all these places with villages out of number keep up daily intercourse with the city and in addition to the hundreds of vegetable carts that constantly pass to and fro there are many conveyances that are exclusively devoted to passengers the cheapest and lowest is called a coucou for no reason that i can see unless it be that a man looks very like a fool to have a seat in one of them they are large cabriolets with two and even three seats the wheels are enormous and there is commonly a small horse harnessed by the side of a larger in the hills to drag perhaps eight or nine people one is amazed to see the living carrion that is driven about a place like paris in these uncouth vehicles the river is so exceedingly crooked that it is little used by travellers above rouen  the internal transportation of france where the lines of the rivers are not followed is carried on almost exclusively in enormous carts drawn by six and even eight heavy horses harnessed in a line the burthen is often as large as a load of hay not quite so high perhaps but generally longer care being had to preserve the balance in such a manner as to leave no great weight on the shaft horse these teams are managed with great dexterity and i have often stopped and witnessed with admiration the entrance of one of them into a yard as it passed from a crowded street probably not more than thirty feet wide but the evolutions of the diligence guided as it chiefly is by the whip and moving on a trot are really nice affairs i came from la grange some time since in one and i thought that we should dash everything to pieces in the streets and yet nothing was injured at the close of the journey our team of five horses two on the pole and three on the lead wheeled without breaking its trot into a street that was barely wide enough to receive the huge vehicle and this too without human direction the driver being much too drunk to be of any service these diligences are uncouth objects to the eye but for the inside passengers they are much more comfortable so far as my experience extends than either the american stage or the english coach  the necessity of passing the barrière two or three times a day has also made me acquainted with the great amount of drunkenness that prevails in paris wine can be had outside of the walls for about half the price which is paid for it within the town as it escapes the octroi or city duty the people resort to these places for indulgence and there is quite as much low blackguardism and guzzling here as is to be met with in any seaport i know  provisions of all sorts too are cheaper without the gates for the same reason and the lower classes resort to them to celebrate their weddings and on other eating and drinking occasions ici on fait festins et noces23 is a common sign no barrier being without more or less of these houses the guinguettes are low gardens answering to the english teagardens of the humblest class with a difference in the drinkables and other fare the base of montmartre is crowded with them  footnote 23 weddings and merrymakings are kept here  one sometimes meets with an unpleasant adventure among these exhilarated gentry for though i think a low frenchman is usually better natured when a little grisé than when perfectly sober this is not always the case quite lately i had an affair that might have terminated seriously but for our good luck it is usual to have two sets of reins to the cabriolets the horses being very spirited and the danger from accidents in streets so narrow and crowded being great i had dined in town and was coming out about nine oclock the horse was walking up the ascent to the barrière de clichy when i observed by the shadow cast from a bright moon that there was a man seated on the cabriolet behind charles was driving and i ordered him to tell the man to get off finding words of no effect charles gave him a slight tap with his whip the fellow instantly sprang forward seized the horse by the reins and attempted to drag him to one side of the road failing in this he fled up the street charles now called out that he had cut the reins i seized the other pair and brought the horse up and as soon as he was under command we pursued our assailant at a gallop he was soon out of breath and we captured him as i felt very indignant at the supposed outrage which might have cost not us only but others their lives i gave him in charge to two gendarmes at the gate with my address promising to call at the police office in the morning  accordingly next day i presented myself and was surprised to find that the man had been liberated i had discovered in the interval that the leather had broken and had not been cut which materially altered the animus of the offence and i had come with an intention to ask for the release of the culprit believing it merely a sally of temper which a nights imprisonment sufficiently punished but the man being charged with cutting the rein i thought the magistrate had greatly forgotten himself in discharging him before i appeared indeed i made no scruple in telling him so we had some warm words and parted i make no doubt i was mistaken for an englishman and that the old national antipathy was at work against me  i was a good deal surprised at the termination of this my first essay in french criminal justice so many eulogiums have been passed on the police that i was not prepared to find this indifference to an offence like that of wantonly cutting the reins of a spirited cabriolet horse in the streets of paris for such was the charge on which the man stood committed i mentioned the affair to a friend and he said that the police was good only for political offences and that the government rather leaned to the side of the rabble in order to find support with them in the event of any serious movement this you will remember was the opinion of a frenchman and not mine for i only relate the facts one conjecture excepted and to do justice to all parties it is proper to add that my friend is warmly opposed to the present régime  i have uniformly found the gendarmes civil and even obliging and i have seen them show great forbearance on various occasions as to the marvellous stories we have heard of the police of paris i suspect they have been gotten up for effect such things being constantly practised here one needs be behind the curtain in a great many things to get a just idea of the true state of the world a laughable instance has just occurred within my knowledge of a story that has been got up for effect the town was quite horrified lately with an account in the journals of a careless nurse permitting a child to fall into the fossé of the great bears in the jardin des plantes and of the bears eating up the dear little thing to the smallest fragment before succour could be obtained happening to be at the garden soon after in the company of one connected with the establishment i inquired into the circumstances and was told that the nurses were very careless with the children and that the story was published in order that the bears should not eat up any child hereafter rather than because they had eaten up a child heretofore     letter xviii  personal intercourseparisian society and hospitalityinfluence of moneyfiacresm de lamethstrife of courtesystandard of delicacyfrench

traitsinfluence of a court   to mrs pomeroy cooperstown  i have said very little in my previous letters on the subject of our personal intercourse with the society of paris it is not always easy for one to be particular in these matters and maintain the reserve that is due to others violating the confidence he may have received through his hospitality is but an indifferent return from the guest to the host still there are men if i may so express it so public in their very essence certainly in their lives that propriety is less concerned with a repetition of their sentiments and with delineations of their characters than in ordinary cases for the practice of the world has put them so much on their guard against the representations of travellers that there is more danger of rendering a false account by becoming their dupes than of betraying them in their unguarded moments i have scarcely ever been admitted to the presence of a real notoriety that i did not find the man or womansex making little differencean actor and this too much beyond the everyday and perhaps justifiable little practices of conventional life inherent simplicity of character is one of the rarest as tempered by the tone imparted by refinement it is the loveliest of all our traits though it is quite common to meet with those who affect it with an address that is very apt to deceive the ordinary and most especially the flattered observer  opportunity rather than talents is the great requisite for circulating gossip a very moderate degree of ability sufficing for the observation which shall render private anecdotes more especially when they relate to persons of celebrity of interest to the general reader but there is another objection to being merely the medium of information of this low quality that i should think would have great influence with every one who has the common selfrespect of a gentleman there is a tacit admission of inferiority in the occupation that ought to prove too humiliating to a man accustomed to those associations which imply equality it is permitted to touch upon the habits and appearance of a truly great man but to dwell upon the peculiarities of a duke merely because he is a duke is as much as to say he is your superior a concession i do not feel disposed to make in favour of any mere duke in christendom  i shall not however be wholly silent on the general impressions left by the little i have seen of the society of paris and occasionally when it is characteristic an anecdote may be introduced for such things sometimes give distinctness as well as piquancy to a description  during our first winter in paris our circle never very large was principally confined to foreign families intermingled with a few french but since our return to town from st ouen we have seen more of the people of the country i should greatly mislead you however were i to leave the impression that our currency in the french capital has been at all general for it certainly has not neither my health leisure fortune nor opportunities have permitted this i believe few perhaps no americans have very general access to the best society of any large european town at all events i have met with no one who i have had any reason to think was much better off than myself in this respect and i repeat my own familiarity with the circles of the capital is nothing to boast of it is in paris as it is everywhere else as respects those who are easy of access in all large towns there is to be found a troublesome and pushing set who requiring notoriety obtrude themselves on strangers sometimes with sounding names and always with offensive pretensions of some sort or other but the truly respectable and estimable class in every country except in cases that cannot properly be included in the rule are to be sought now one must feel that he has peculiar claims or be better furnished with letters than happened to be my case to get a ready admission into this set or having obtained it to feel that his position enabled him to maintain the intercourse with the ease and freedom that could alone render it agreeable to be shown about as a lion when circumstances offer the means to be stuck up at a dinnertable as a piece of luxury like strawberries in february or peaches in aprilcan hardly be called association the terms being much on a par with that which forms the liaisons between him who gives the entertainment and the hired plate with which his table is garnished with this explanation then you are welcome to an outline of the little i know on the subject  one of the errors respecting the french which has been imported into america through england is the impression that they are not hospitable since my residence here i have often been at a loss to imagine how such a notion could have arisen for i am acquainted with no town in which it has struck me there is more true hospitality than in paris not only are dinners balls and all the minor entertainments frequent but there is scarcely a man or a woman of any note in society who does not cause his or her doors to be opened once a fortnight at least and in half the cases once a week at these soirées invitations are sometimes given it is true but then they are general and for the whole season and it is not unusual even to consider them free to all who are on visiting terms with the family the utmost simplicity and good taste prevail at these places the refreshments being light and appropriate and the forms exacting no more than what belongs to good breeding you will at once conceive the great advantages that a stranger possesses in having access to such social resources one with a tolerable visiting list may choose his circle for any particular evening and if by chance the company should not happen to be to his mind he has still before him the alternative of several other houses which are certain to be open it is not easy to say what can be more truly hospitable than this  the petits soupers once so celebrated are entirely superseded by the new distribution of time which is probably the most rational that can be devised for a town life the dinner is at six an hour that is too early to interfere with the engagements of the evening it being usually over at eight and too late to render food again necessary that night an arrangement that greatly facilitates the evening intercourse releasing it at once from all trouble and parade  it has often been said in favour of french society that once within the doors of a salon all are equal this is not literally so it being impossible that such a state of things can exist nor is it desirable that it should since it is confounding all sentiment and feeling overlooking the claims of age services merit of every sort and setting at nought the whole construction of society it is not absolutely true that even rank is entirely forgotten in french society though i think it sufficiently so to prevent any deference to it from being offensive the social pretensions of a french peer are exceedingly well regulated nor do i remember to have seen an instance in which a very young man has been particularly noticed on account of his having claims of this sort distinguished men are so very numerous in paris that they excite no great feeling and the even course of society is little disturbed on their account  although all within the doors of a french salon are not perfectly equal none are made unpleasantly to feel the indifference i dare say there are circles in paris in which the mere possession of money may be a source of evident distinction but it must be in a very inferior set the french while they are singularly alive to the advantages of money and extremely liable to yield to its influence in all important matters rarely permit any manifestations of its power to escape them in their ordinary intercourse as a people they appear to me to be ready to yield everything to money but its external homage on these points they are the very converse of the americans who are hard to be bought while they consider money the very base of all distinction the origin of these peculiarities may be found in the respective conditions of the two countries  in america fortunes are easily and rapidly acquired pressure reduces few to want he who serves is if anything more in demand than he who is to be served and the want of temptation produces exemption from the liability to corruption men will and do daily corrupt themselves in the rapacious pursuit of gain but comparatively few are in the market to be bought and sold by others notwithstanding this money being every mans goal there is a secret profound and general deference for it while money will do less than in almost any other country in christendom here few young men look forward to gaining distinction by making money they search for it as a means whereas with us it is the end we have little need of arms in america and the profession is in less request than that of law or merchandize of the arts and letters the country possesses none or next to none and there is no true sympathy with either the only career that is felt as likely to lead and which can lead to distinction independently of money is that of politics and as a whole this is so much occupied by sheer adventurers with little or no pretentions to the name of statesmen that it is scarcely reputable to belong to it although money has no influence in politics or as little as well may be even the successful politician is but a secondary man in ordinary society in comparison with the millionnaire now all this is very much reversed in paris money does much while it seems to do but little the writer of a successful comedy would be a much more important personage in the côteries of paris than m rothschild and the inventor of a new bonnet would enjoy much more éclat than the inventor of a clever speculation i question if there be a community on earth in which gambling risks in the funds for instance are more general than in this and yet the subject appears to be entirely lost sight of out of the bourse  the little social notoriety that is attached to military distinction here has greatly surprised me it really seems as if france has had so much military renown as to be satiated with it one is elbowed constantly by generals who have gained this or that victory and yet no one seems to care anything about them i do not mean that the nation is indifferent to military glory but society appears to care little or nothing about it i have seen a good deal of fuss made with the writer of a few clever verses but i have never seen any made with a hero perhaps it was because the verses were new and the victories old  the perfect good taste and indifference which the french manifest concerning the private affairs and concerning the mode of living of one who is admitted to the salons has justly extorted admiration even from the english the people of all others who most submit to a contrary feeling a hackneycoach is not always admitted into a courtyard but both men and women make their visits in them without any apparent hesitation no one seems ashamed of confessing poverty i do not say that women of quality often use fiacres to make their visits but men do and i have seen women in them openly whom i have met in some of the best houses in paris it is better to go in a private carriage or in a remise if one can but few hesitate when their means are limited about using the former in order to appreciate this selfdenial or simplicity or good sense it is necessary to remember that a paris fiacre is not to be confounded with any other vehicle on earth i witnessed a short time since a ludicrous instance of the different degrees of feeling that exist on this point among different people a and myself went to the house of an english woman our acquaintance who is not very choice in her french a mrs  the wife of a colonel in the english army sat next a as a french lady begged that her carriage might be ordered our hostess told her servant to order the fiacre of madame  now madame  kept her chariot to my certain knowledge but she disregarded the mistake a soon after desired that our carriage might come next the good woman of the house who loved to be busy again called for the fiacre of madame  i saw the foot of a in motion but catching my eye she smiled and the thing passed off the voiture de madame  or our own carriage was announced just as mrs  was trying to make a servant understand she wished for hers le fiacre de madame  again put in the bustling hostess this was too much for a colonels lady and with a very pretty air of distress she took care to explain in a way that all might hear her that it was a remise  i dare say vulgar prejudices influence vulgar minds here as elsewhere and yet i must say that i never knew any one hesitate about giving an address on account of the humility of the lodgings it is to be presumed that the manner in which families that are historical and of longestablished rank were broken down by the revolution has had an influence in effecting this healthful state of feeling  the great tact and careful training of the women serve to add very much to the grace of french society they effectually prevent all embarrassments from the question of precedency by their own decisions indeed it appears to be admitted that when there is any doubt on these points the mistress of the house shall settle it in her own way i found myself lately at a small dinner the only stranger and the especially invited guest standing near madame la marquise at the moment the service was announced a bishop made one of the trio i could not precede a man of his years and profession and he was too polite to precede a stranger it was a nice point had it been a question between a duke and myself as a stranger and under the circumstances of the invitation i should have had the pas but even the lady hesitated about discrediting a father of the church she delayed but an instant and smiling she begged us to follow her to the table avoiding the decision altogether in america such a thing could not have happened for no woman by a fiction of society is supposed to know how to walk in company without support but here a woman will not spoil her curtsey on entering a room by leaning on an arm if she can well help it the practice of tucking up a brace of females liver and gizzard as the english coarsely but not inaptly term it under ones arms in order to enter a small room that is crowded in a way to render the movements of even one person difficult does not prevail here it being rightly judged that a proper tenue a good walk and a graceful movement are all impaired by it this habit also singularly contributes to the comfort of your sex by rendering them more independent of ours no one thinks except in very particular cases of going to the door to see a lady into her carriage a custom too provincial to prevail in a capital anywhere still there is an amusing assiduity among the men on certain points of etiquette that has sometimes made me laugh though in truth every concession to politeness being a tribute to benevolence is respectable unless spoiled in the manner as we are gossiping about trifles i will mention a usage or two that to you will at least be novel  i was honoured with a letter from le chevalier alexandre de lameth24 accompanied by an offering of a book and i took an early opportunity to pay my respects to him i found this gentleman who once played so conspicuous a part in the politics of france and who is now a liberal deputy at breakfast in a small cabinet at the end of a suite of four rooms he received me politely conversed a good deal of america in which country he had served as a colonel under rochambeau and i took my leave that m de lameth should rise and even see me into the next room was what every one would expect and there i again took my leave of him but he followed me to each door in succession and when with a little gentle violence i succeeded in shutting him in the antechamber he seemed to yield to my entreaties not to give himself any further trouble i was on the landing on my way down when hearing the door of m de lameths apartment open i turned and saw its master standing before it to give and receive the last bow although this extreme attention to the feelings of others and delicacy of demeanour rather marks the frenchman of the old school perhaps it is by no means uncommon here general lafayette while he permits me to see him with very little ceremony scarcely ever suffers me to leave him without going with me as far as two or three doors this in my case he does more from habit than anything else for he frequently does not even rise when i enter and sometimes when i laughingly venture to say so much ceremony is scarcely necessary between us he will take me at my word and go back to his writing with perfect simplicity  footnote 24 since dead  the reception between the women i see plainly is graduated with an unpretending but nice regard to their respective claims they rise even to men a much more becoming and graceful habit than that of america except in evening circles or in receiving intimates i never saw a french woman offer her hand to a male visitor unless a relative though it is quite common for females to kiss each other when the réunion is not an affair of ceremony the practice of kissing among men still exists though it is not very common at paris it appears to be gradually going out with the earrings i have never had an offer from a frenchman of my own age to kiss me but it has frequently occurred with my seniors general lafayette practises it still with all his intimates  i was seated the other evening in quiet conversation with madame la princesse de  several people had come and gone in the course of an hour and all had been received in the usual manner at length the huissier walking fast through the antechamber announced the wife of an ambassador the princesse at the moment was seated on a divan with her feet raised so as not to touch the floor i was startled with the suddenness and vehemence of her movements she sprang to her feet and rather ran than walked across the vast salon to the door where she was met by her visitor who observing the empressement of her hostess through the vista of rooms had rushed forward as fast as decorum would at all allow in order to anticipate her at the door it was my impression at first that they were bosom friends about to be restored to each other after a long absence and that the impetuosity of their feelings had gotten the better of their ordinary selfcommand no such thing it was merely a strife of courtesy for the meeting was followed by an extreme attention to all the forms of society profound curtsies and the elaborated demeanour which marks ceremony rather than friendship  much has been said about the latitude of speech among the women of france and comparisons have been made between them and our own females to the disadvantage of the former if the american usages are to be taken as the standard of delicacy in such matters i know of no other people who come up to it as to our mere feelings habit can render anything proper or anything improper and it is not an easy matter to say where the line in conformity with good sense and good taste should be actually drawn i confess a leaning to the american school but how far i am influenced by education it would not be easy for me to say myself foreigners affirm that we are squeamish and that we wound delicacy oftener by the awkward attempts to protect it than if we had more simplicity there may be some truth in this for though cherishing the notions of my youth i never belonged to the ultra school at home which i believe you will agree with me rather proves low breeding than good breeding one sees instances of this truth not only every day but every hour of the day yesterday in crossing the tuileries i was witness of a ludicrous scene that sufficiently illustrates what i mean the statues of the garden have little or no drapery a countryman and two women of the same class in passing one were struck with this circumstance and their bursts of laughter running and hiding their faces and loud giggling left no one in ignorance of the cause of their extreme bashfulness thousands of both sexes pass daily beneath the same statue without a thought of its nudity and it is looked upon as a noble piece of sculpture  in dismissing this subject which is every way delicate i shall merely say that usage tolerates a license of speech of which you probably have no idea but that i think one hears very rarely from a french woman of condition little that would not be uttered by an american female under similar circumstances so far as my experience goes there is a marked difference in this particular between the women of a middle station and those of a higher rank by rank however i mean hereditary rank for the revolution has made a pêle mêle in the salons of paris  although the petits soupers have disappeared the dinners are very sufficient substitutes they are given at a better hour and the service of a french entertainment so quiet so entirely free from effort or chatter about food is admirably adapted to rendering them agreeable i am clearly of opinion that no one ought to give any entertainment that has not the means of making it pass off as a matterofcourse thing and without effort i have certainly seen a few fussy dinners here but they are surprisingly rare at home we have plenty of people who know that a party that has a laboured air is inherently vulgar but how few are there that know how to treat a brilliant entertainment as a mere matter of course paris is full of those desirable houses in which the thing is understood  the forms of the table vary a little according to the set one is in in truly french houses until quite lately i believe it was not the custom to change the knifethe duty of which by the way is not great the cookery requiring little more than the fork in families that mingle more with strangers both are changed as with us a great dinner is served very much as at home so far as the mere courses are concerned though i have seen the melons follow the soup this i believe to be in good taste though it is not common and it struck me at first as being as much out of season as the old new england custom of eating the pudding before the meat but the french give small dinners small in name though certainly very great in execution in which the dishes are served singly or nearly so the entertainment resembling those given by the turks and being liable to the same objection for when there is but a single dish before one and it is not known whether there is to be any more it is an awkward thing to decline eating such dinners are generally of the best quality but i think they should never be given except where there is sufficient intimacy to embolden the guest to say jam satis  the old devotion to the sex is not so exclusively the occupation of a french salon as it was probably half a century since i have been in several where the men were grouped in a corner talking politics while the women amused each other as best they could in cold formal lines looking like so many figures placed there to show off the latest modes of the toilette i do not say this is absolutely common but it is less rare than you might be apt to suppose  i can tell you little of the habit of reading manuscripts in society such things are certainly done for i have been invited to be present on one or two occasions but having a horror of such exhibitions i make it a point to be indisposed the choice lying between the megrims before or after them once and once only i have heard a poet recite his verses in a wellfilled drawingroom and though i have every reason to think him clever my ear was so little accustomed to the language that in the mouthing of french recitation i lost nearly all of it  i have had an odd pleasure in driving from one house to another on particular evenings in order to produce as strong contrasts as my limited visitinglist will procure having a fair opportunity a few nights since in consequence of two or three invitations coming in for the evening on which several houses where i occasionally called were opened i determined to make a night of it in order to note the effect as a did not know several of the people i went alone and you may possibly be amused with an account of my adventures they shall be told  in the first place i had to dress in order to go to dinner at a house that i had never entered and with a family of which i had never seen a soul these are incidents which frequently come over a stranger and at first were not a little awkward but use hardens us to much greater misfortunes at six then i stepped punctually into my coupé and gave charles the necessary number and street i ought to tell you that the invitation had come a few days before and in a fit of curiosity i had accepted it and sent a card without having the least idea who my host and hostess were beyond their names there was something piquant in this ignorance and i had almost made up my mind to go in the same mysterious manner leaving all to events when happening in an idle moment to ask a lady of my acquaintance and for whom i have a great respect if she knew a madame de  to my surprise her answer was most certainly she is my cousin and you are to dine there tomorrow i said no more though this satisfied me that my hosts were people of some standing while driving to their hotel it struck me under all the circumstances it might be well to know more of them and i stopped at the gate of a female friend who knows everybody and who i was certain would receive me even at that unseasonable hour i was admitted explained my errand and inquired if she knew a m de  quelle question she exclaimedm de  est chancelier de france absurd and even awkward as it might have proved but for this lucky thought i should have dined with the french lord high chancellor without having the smallest suspicion of who he was  the hotel was a fine one though the apartment was merely good and the reception service and general style of the house were so simple that neither would have awakened the least suspicion of the importance of my hosts the party was small and the dinner modest i found the chancelier a grave dignified man a little curious on the subject of america and his wife apparently a woman of great good sense and i should think of a good deal of attainment everything went off in the quietest manner possible and i was sorry when it was time to go  from this dinner i drove to the hotel of the marquis de marbois to pay a visit of digestion m de marbois retires so early on account of his great age that one is obliged to be punctual or he will find the gate locked at nine the company had got back into the drawingroom and as the last weeks guests were mostly there as well as those who had just left the table there might have been thirty people present all of whom were men but two one of the ladies was madame de souza known in french literature as the writer of several clever novels of society in the drawingroom were grouped in clusters the grand referendary m cuvier m daru m villemain m de plaisance mr brown and many others of note there seemed to be something in the wind as the conversation was in low confidential whispers attended by divers ominous shrugs this could only be politics and watching an opportunity i questioned an acquaintance the fact was really so the appointed hour had come and the ministry of m de villèle was in the agony the elections had not been favourable and it was expedient to make an attempt to reach the old end by what is called a new combination it is necessary to understand the general influence of political intrigues on certain côteries of paris to appreciate the effect of this intelligence on a drawingroom filled like this with men who had been actors in the principal events of france for forty years the name of m cuvier was even mentioned as one of the new ministers comte roy was also named as likely to be the new premier i was told that this gentleman was one of the greatest landed proprietors of france his estates being valued at four millions of dollars the fact is curious as showing not on vulgar rumour but from a respectable source what is deemed a firstrate landed property in this country it is certainly no merit nor do i believe it is any very great advantage but i think we might materially beat this even in america the company soon separated and i retired  from the place de la madeleine i drove to a house near the carrousel where i had been invited to step in in the course of the evening all the buildings that remain within the intended parallelogram which will some day make this spot one of the finest squares in the world have been bought by the government or nearly so with the intent to have them pulled down at a proper time and the court bestows lodgings ad interim among them on its favourites madame de  was one of these favoured persons and she occupies a small apartment in the third story of one of these houses the rooms were neat and wellarranged but small probably the largest does not exceed fifteen feet square the approach to a paris lodging is usually either very good or very bad in the new buildings may be found some of the mediocrity of the new order of things but in all those which were erected previously to the revolution there is nothing but extremes in this as in most other things great luxury and elegance or great meanness and discomfort the house of madame de  happens to be of the latter class and although all the disagreeables have disappeared from her own rooms one is compelled to climb up to them through a dark well of a staircase by flights of steps not much better than those we use in our stables you have no notion of such staircases as those i had just descended in the hotels of the chancelier and the président premier25 nor have we any just idea as connected with respectable dwellings of these i had now to clamber up m de  is a man of talents and great respectability and his wife is exceedingly clever but they are not rich he is a professor and she is an artist after having passed so much of my youth on topgallant yards and in becketting royals you are not to suppose however i had any great difficulty in getting up these stairs narrow steep and winding as they were  footnote 25 m de marbois was the first president of the court of accounts  we are now at the door and i have rung on whom do you imagine the curtain will rise on a réunion of philosophers come to discuss questions in botany with m de  or on artists assembled to talk over the troubles of their profession with his wife the door opens and i enter  the little drawingroom is crowded chiefly with men two cardtables are set and at one i recognize a party in which are three dukes of the vieille cour with m de duras at their head the rest of the company was a little more mixed but on the whole it savoured strongly of coblentz and the émigration this was more truly french than anything i had yet stumbled on one or two of the grandees looked at me as if better informed than scott they knew that general lafayette had not gone to america to live some of these gentlemen certainly do not love us but i had cut out too much work for the night to stay and return the big looks of even dukes and watching an opportunity when the eyes of madame de  were another way i stole out of the room  charles now took his orders and we drove down into the heart of the town somewhere near the general postoffice or into those mazes of streets that near two years of practice have not yet taught me to thread we entered the court of a large hotel that was brilliantly lighted and i ascended by a noble flight of steps to the first floor antechambers communicated with a magnificent saloon which appeared to be near forty feet square the ceilings were lofty and the walls were ornamented with military trophies beautifully designed and which had the air of being embossed and gilded i had got into the hotel of one of napoleons marshals you will say or at least into one of a marshal of the old régime the latter conjecture may be true but the house is now inhabited by a great woollen manufacturer whom the events of the day has thrown into the presence of all these military emblems i found the worthy industriel surrounded by a group composed of men of his own stamp eagerly discussing the recent changes in the government the women of whom there might have been a dozen were ranged like a neglected parterre along the opposite side of the room i paid my compliments staid a few minutes and stole away to the next engagement  we had now to go to a little retired house on the champs elysées there were only three or four carriages before the door and on ascending to a small but very near apartment i found some twenty people collected the mistress of the house was an english lady single of a certain age and a daughter of the earl of  who was once governor of new york here was a very different set one or two ladies of the old court women of elegant manners and seemingly of good informationseveral english women pretty quiet and clever besides a dozen men of different nations this was one of those little réunions that are so common in paris among the foreigners in which a small infusion of french serves to leaven a considerable batch of human beings from other parts of the world as it is always a relief to me to speak my own language after being a good while among foreigners i staid an hour at this house in the course of the evening an irishman of great wit and of exquisite humour one of the paragons of the age in his way came in in the course of conversation this gentleman who is the proprietor of an irish estate and a catholic told me of an atrocity in the laws of his country of which until then i was ignorant it seems that any younger brother next heir might claim the estate by turning protestant or drive the incumbent to the same act i was rejoiced to hear that there was hardly an instance of such profligacy known26 to what baseness will not the struggle for political ascendency urge us  footnote 26 i believe this infamous law however has been repealed  in the course of the evening mr  the irish gentleman gravely introduced me to a sir james  adding with perfect gravity a gentleman whose father humbugged the popehumbugged infallibility one could not but be amused with such an introduction urged in a way so infinitely droll and i ventured at a proper moment to ask an explanation which unless i was also humbugged was as follows  among the détenus in 1804 was sir william  the father of sir james  the person in question taking advantage of the presence of the pope at paris he is said to have called on the goodhearted pius with great concern of manner to state his case he had left his sons in england and through his absence they had fallen under the care of two presbyterian aunts as a father he was naturally anxious to rescue them from this perilous situation now pius continued my merry informant quite naturally supposed that all this solicitude was in behalf of two orthodox catholic souls and he got permission from napoleon for the return of so good a father to his own country never dreaming that the conversion of the boys if it ever took place would only be from the protestant episcopal church of england to that of calvin or a rescue from one of the devils furnaces to pop them into another i laughed at this story i suppose with a little incredulity but my irish friend insisted on its truth ending the conversation with a significant nod catholic as he was and sayinghumbugged infallibility  by this time it was eleven oclock and as i am obliged to keep reasonable hours it was time to go to the party of the evening count  of the  legation gave a great ball my carriage entered the line at the distance of near a quarter of a mile from the hotel gendarmes being actively employed in keeping us all in our places it was half an hour before i was set down and the quadrilles were in full motion when i entered it was a brilliant affair much the most so i have ever yet witnessed in a private house some said there were fifteen hundred people present the number seems incredible and yet when one comes to calculate it may be so as i got into my carriage to go away charles informed me that the people at the gates affirmed that more than six hundred carriages had entered the court that evening by allowing an average of little more than two to each vehicle we get the number mentioned  i do not know exactly how many rooms were opened on this occasion but i should think there were fully a dozen two or three were very large salons and the one in the centre which was almost at feverheat had crimson hangings by way of cooling one i have never witnessed dancing at all comparable to that of the quadrilles of this evening usually there is either too much or too little of the dancingmaster but on this occasion every one seemed inspired with a love of the art it was a beautiful sight to see a hundred charming young women of the first families of europe for they were there of all nations dressed with the simple elegance that is so becoming to the young of the sex and which is never departed from here until after marriage moving in perfect time to delightful music as if animated by a common soul the men too did better than usual being less lugubrious and mournful than our sex is apt to be in dancing i do not know how it is in private but in the world at paris every young woman seems to have a good mother or at least one capable of giving her both a good tone and good taste  at this party i met the  an intimate friend of the ambassador and one who also honours me with a portion of her friendship in talking over the appearance of things she told me that some hundreds of applications for invitations to this ball had been made applications i cannot conceive of such meanness in what manner directly by note by personal intercessionalmost by tears be certain of it many hundreds have been refused in america we hear of refusals to go to balls but we have not yet reached the pass of sending refusals to invite do you see mademoiselle  dancing in the set before you she pointed to a beautiful french girl whom i had often seen at her house but whose family was in a much lower station in society than herself certainlypray how came she here i brought her her mother was dying to come too and she begged me to get an invitation for her and her daughter but it would not do to bring the mother to such a place and i was obliged to say no more tickets could be issued i wished however to bring the daughter she is so pretty and we compromised the affair in that way and to this the mother assented assented how can you doubt itwhat funny american notions you have brought with you to france  i got some droll anecdotes from my companion concerning the ingredients of the company on this occasion for she could be as sarcastic as she was elegant a young woman near us attracted attention by a loud and vulgar manner of laughing do you know that lady demanded my neighbour i have seen her before but scarcely know her name she is the daughter of your acquaintance the marquise de  then she is or was a mademoiselle de  she is not nor properly ever was a mademoiselle de  in the revolution the marquis was imprisoned by you wicked republicans and the marquise fled to england whence she returned after an absence of three years bringing with her this young lady then an infant a few months old and monsieur le marquis he never saw his daughter having been beheaded in paris about a year before her birth quelle contretems nestce pas  it is a melancholy admission but it is no less true that good breeding is sometimes quite as active a virtue as good principles how many more of the company present were born about a year after their fathers were beheaded i have no means of knowing but had it been the case with all of them the company would have been of as elegant demeanour and of much more retenue of deportment than we are accustomed to see i will not say in good but certainly in general society at home one of the consequences of good breeding is also a disinclination positively a distaste to pry into the private affairs of others the little specimen to the contrary just named was rather an exception owing to the character of the individual and to the indiscretion of the young lady in laughing too loud and then the affair of a birth so very posthumous was rather too patent to escape all criticism  my friend was in a gossiping mood this evening and as she was well turned of fifty i ventured to continue the conversation as some of the liaisons which exist here must be novel to you i shall mention one or two more  a madame de j passed us leaning on the arm of m de c i knew the former who was a widow had frequently visited her and had been surprised at the intimacy which existed between her and m de c who always appeared quite at home in her house i ventured to ask my neighbour if the gentleman were the brother of the lady her brother it is to be hoped not as he is her husband why does she not bear his name if that be the case because her first husband is of a more illustrious family than her second and then there are some difficulties on the score of fortune no no these people are bona fide married tenezdo you see that gentleman who is standing so assiduously near the chair of madame de s he who is all attention and smiles to the lady certainlyhis politeness is even affectionate well it ought to be for it is m de s her husband they are a happy couple then hors de doutehe meets her at soirées and balls is the pink of politeness puts on her shawl sees her safe into her carriage and then they drive home together as loving as darby and joan and then he jumps into his cabriolet and drives to the lodgings of  bon soir monsieuryou are making me fall into the vulgar crime of scandal  now as much as all this may sound like invention it is quite true that i repeat no more to you than was said to me and no more than what i believe to be exact as respects the latter couple i have been elsewhere told that they literally never see each other except in public where they constantly meet as the best friends in the world  i was lately in some english society when lady g bet a pair of gloves with lord r that he had not seen lady r in a fortnight the bet was won by the gentleman who proved satisfactorily that he had met his wife at a dinnerparty only ten days before  after all i have told you and all that you may have heard from others i am nevertheless inclined to believe that the high society of paris is quite as exemplary as that of any other large european town if we are any better ourselves is it not more owing to the absence of temptation than to any other cause put large garrisons into our towns fill the streets with idlers who have nothing to do but to render themselves agreeable and with women with whom dress and pleasure are the principal occupations and then let us see what protestantism and liberty will avail us in this particular the intelligent french say that their society is improving in morals i can believe this of which i think there is sufficient proof by comparing the present with the past as the latter has been described to us by the past i do not mean the period of the revolution when vulgarity assisted to render vice still more odiousa happy union perhaps for those who were to followbut the days of the old régime chance has thrown me in the way of three or four old dowagers of that period women of high rank and still in the first circles who amid all their finesse of breeding and ease of manner have had a most desperate roué air about them their very laugh at times has seemed replete with a bold levity that was as disgusting as it was unfeminine i have never in any other part of the world seen loose sentiments affichés with more effrontery these women are the complete antipodes of the quiet elegant princesse de  who was at lady  s this evening though some of them write princesses on their cards too  the influence of a court must be great on the morals of those who live in its purlieus conversing with the duc de  a man who has had general currency in the best society of europe on this subject he said england has long decried our manners previously to the revolution i admit they were bad perhaps worst than her own but i know nothing in our history as bad as what i lately witnessed in england you know i was there quite recently the king invited me to dine at windsor i found every one in the drawingroom but his majesty and lady  she entered but a minute before him like a queen her reception was that of a queen young unmarried females kissed her hand now all this might happen in france even now but louis xv the most dissolute of our monarchs went no farther at windsor i saw the husband sons and daughters of the favourite in the circle le parc des cerfs was not as bad as this  and yet m de  since we are conversing frankly listen to what i witnessed but the other day in france you know the situation of things at st ouen and the rumours that are so rife we had the fête dieu during my residence there you who are a catholic need not be told that your sect believe in the doctrine of the real presence there was a reposoir erected in the garden of the chateau and god in person was carried with religious pomp to rest in the bowers of the exfavourite it is true the husband was not present he was only in the provinces  the influence of a throne makes sad parasites and hypocrites said m de  shrugging his shoulders  and the influence of the people too though in a different way a courtier is merely a welldressed demagogue  it follows then that man is just a poor devil  but i am gossiping away with you when my asmodean career is ended and it is time i went to bed good night     letter xix  garden of the tuileriesthe french parliamentparliamentary speakersthe tribuneroyal initiativethe chartermongrel governmentministerial responsibilityelections in francedoctrinairesdifferences of opinioncontroversy   to jacob sutherland esq new york  the chambers have been opened with the customary ceremonies and parade it is usual for the king attended by a brilliant cortège to go on these occasions from the tuileries to the palais bourbon through lines of troops under a salute of guns the french love spectacles and their monarch if he would be popular is compelled to make himself one at every plausible opportunity  the garden of the tuileries is a parallelogram of i should think fifty acres of which one end is bounded by the palace it has a high vaulted terrace on the side next the river as well as at the opposite end and one a little lower next the rue de rivoli there is also a very low broad terrace immediately beneath the windows of the palace which separates the buildings from the parterres you will understand that the effect of this arrangement is to shut out the world from the persons in the garden by means of the terraces and indeed to enable them by taking refuge in the woods that fill quite half the area to bury themselves almost in a forest the public has free access to this place from an early hour in the morning to eight or nine at night according to the season when it is required to clear them a party of troops marches by beat of drum from the chateau through the great allée to the lower end of the garden this is always taken as the signal to disperse and the world begins to go out at the different gates it is understood that the place is frequently used as a promenade by the royal family after this hour especially in the fine season but as it would be quite easy for any one evilly disposed to conceal himself among the trees statues and shrubs the troops are extended in very open order and march slowly back to the palace of course driving every one before them each gate is locked as the line passes it  the only parts of the garden which appear on the exterior to be on a level with the street though such is actually the fact with the whole of the interior are the great gate opposite the palace and a side gate near its southern end the latter being the way by which one passes out to cross the pont royal  in attempting to pass in at this gate the other morning for the first time at that hour i found it closed a party of ladies and gentlemen were walking on the low terrace beneath the palace windows and a hundred people might have been looking at them from without a second glance showed me that among some children were the heir presumptive and his sister mademoiselle dartois the exhibition could merely be an attempt to feel the public pulse for the countryhouse of la bagatelle to which the children go two or three times a week is much better suited to taking the air i could not believe in the indifference that was manifested had i not seen it the children are both engaging particularly the daughter and yet these innocent and perfectly inoffensive beings were evidently regarded more with aversion than with affection  the display of the opening of the session produced no more effect on the public mind than the appearance on the terrace of les enfans de france the parisians are the least loyal of charless subjects and though the troops and a portion of the crowd cried vive le roi it was easy to see that the disaffected were more numerous than the wellaffected  i have attended some of the sittings since the opening and shall now say a word on the subject of the french parliamentary proceedings the hall is an amphitheatre like our own the disposition of the seats and speakers chair being much the same as at washington the members sit on benches however that rise one behind the other and through which they ascend and descend by aisles these aisles separate the different shades of opinion for those who think alike sit together thus the gauche or left is occupied by the extreme liberals the centre gauche by those who are a shade nearer the bourbons the centre droit or right centre by the true bourbonists and so on to the farthest point of the semicircle some of the members affect even to manifest the minuter shades of their opinions by their relative positions in their own sections and i believe it is usual for each one to occupy his proper place  you probably know that the french members speak from a stand immediately beneath the chair of the president called a tribune absurd as this may seem i believe it to be a very useful regulation the vivacity of the national character rendering some such check on loquacity quite necessary without it a dozen would often be on their feet at once as it is even this sometimes happens no disorder that ever occurs in our legislative bodies will give you any just notion of that which frequently occurs here the president rings a bell as a summons to keep order and as a last resource he puts on his hat a signal that the sitting is suspended  the speaking of both chambers is generally bad twothirds of the members read their speeches which gives the sitting a dull monotonous character and as you may suppose the greater part of their lectures are very little attended to the most parliamentary speaker is m royer collard who is just now so popular that he has been returned for seven different places at the recent election  m constant is an exceedingly animated speaker resembling in this particular mr mduffie m constant however has a different motion from the last gentleman his movement being a constant oscillation over the edge of the tribune about as fast and almost as regular as that of the pendulum of a large clock it resembles that of a sawyer in the mississippi general lafayette speaks with the steadiness and calm that you would expect from his character and is always listened to with respect many professional men speak well and exercise considerable influence in the house for here as elsewhere the habit of public and extemporaneous speaking gives an immediate ascendency in deliberative bodies  some of the scenes one witnesses in the chamber of deputies are amusing by their exceeding vivacity the habit of crying Écoutez prevails as in the english parliament though the different intonations of that cry are not well understood i have seen members run at the tribune like children playing puss in a corner and on one occasion i saw five different persons on its steps in waiting for the descent of the member in possession when a great question is to be solemnly argued the members inscribe their names for the discussion and are called on to speak in the order in which they stand on the list  the french never sit in committee of the whole but they have adopted in its place an expedient that gives power more control over the proceedings of the two houses at the commencement of the session the members draw for their numbers in the bureaux as they are called of these bureaux there are ten or twelve and as a matter of course they include all the members as soon as the numbers are drawn the members assemble in their respective rooms and choose their officers a president and secretary these elections are always supposed to be indicative of the political tendency of each bureau those which have a majority of liberals choosing officers of their own opinions and vice versa these bureaux are remodelled periodically by drawing anew the term of duration being a month or six weeks i believe the chamber retains the power to refer questions or not to these bureaux their institution being no more than a matter of internal regulation and not of constitutional law it is however usual to send all important laws to them where they are discussed and voted on the approbation of a majority of the bureaux being in such cases necessary for their reception in the chambers  the great evil of the present system is the initiative of the king by this reservation in the charter the crown possesses more than a veto all laws actually emanating from the sovereign the tendency of such a regulation is either to convert the chambers into the old lits de justice or to overthrow the throne an event which will certainly accompany any serious change here as might have been as would have been anticipated by any one familiar with the action of legislative bodies in our time this right is already so vigorously assailed as to give rise to constant contentions between the great powers of the state all parties are agreed that no law can be presented that does not come originally from the throne but the liberals are for putting so wide a construction on the right to amend as already to threaten to pervert the regulation this has driven some of the bourbonists to maintain that the chambers have no right at all to amend a royal proposition any one may foresee that this is a state of things which cannot peaceably endure for any great length of time the ministry are compelled to pack the chambers and in order to effect their objects they resort to all the expedients of power that offer as those who drew up the charter had neither the forethought nor the experience to anticipate all the embarrassments of a parliamentary government they unwittingly committed themselves and illegal acts are constantly resorted to in order that the system may be upheld the charter was bestowed ad captandum and is a contradictory mélange of inexpedient concessions and wily reservations the conscription undermined the popularity of napoleon and louis xviii in his charter says the conscription is abolished the recruiting for the army and navy shall be settled by a law now the conscription is not abolished but if pushed on this point a french jurist would perhaps tell you it is now established by law the feudal exclusiveness on the subject of taxation is done away with all men being equally liable to taxation the nett pay of the army is about two sous a day this is settled by law passed by the representatives of those who pay two hundred francs a year in direct taxation the conscription in appearance is general and fair enough but he who has money can always hire a substitute at a price quite within his power it is only the poor man who is never in possession of one or two thousand francs that is obliged to serve seven years at two sous a day nett  france has gained beyond estimate by the changes from the old to the present system but it is in a manner to render further violent changes necessary i say violent for political changes are everywhere unavoidable since questions of polity are after all no other than questions of facts and these are interests that will regulate themselves directly or indirectly the great desideratum of a government after settling its principles in conformity with controlling facts is to secure to itself the means of progressive change without the apprehension of convulsion such is not the case with france and further revolutions are inevitable the mongrel government which exists neither can stand nor does it deserve to stand it contains the seeds of its own destruction here you will be told that the king is a jesuit that he desires to return to the ancient regime and that the opposition wishes merely to keep him within the limits of the charter my own observations lead to a very different conclusion the difficulty is in the charter itself which leaves the government neither free nor despotic in short without any distinctive character  this defect is so much felt that in carrying out the details of the system much that properly belongs to it has been studiously omitted the king can do no wrong here as in england but the ministers are responsible by way of making a parade of this responsibility every official act of the king is countersigned by the minister of the proper department and by the theory of the government that particular minister is responsible for that particular act now by the charter the peers are the judges of political crimes by the charter also it is stipulated that no one can be proceeded against except in cases expressly provided for by law and in the forms prescribed by the law you will remember that all the previous constitutions being declared illegal louis xviii dates his reign from the supposed death of louis xvii and that there are no fundamental precedents that may be drawn in to aid the constructions but that the charter must be interpreted by its own provisions it follows then as a consequence that no minister can be legally punished until a law is enacted to dictate the punishment explain the offences and point out the forms of procedure now no such law has ever been proposed and although the chambers may recommend laws to the king they must await his pleasure in order even to discuss them openly and enlist the public feeling in their behalf the responsibility of the ministers was proposed ad captandum like the abolition of the conscription but neither has been found convenient in practice27  footnote 27 when the ministers of charles x were tried it was without law and they would probably have escaped punishment altogether on this plea had not the condition of the public mind required a concession   the electors of france are said to be between eighty and one hundred thousand the qualifications of a deputy being much higher than those of an elector it is computed that the four hundred and fifty members must be elected from among some four or five thousand available candidates it is not pretended that france does not contain more than this number of individuals who pay a thousand francs a year in direct taxes for taxation is so great that this sum is soon made up but a deputy must be forty years old a regulation which at once excludes fully one half the men of itself and then it will be recollected that many are superannuated several hundreds are peers others cannot quit their employments etc etc i have seen the number of available candidates estimated as low even as three thousand  the elections in france are conducted in a mode peculiar to the nation the electors of the highest class have two votes or for representatives of two descriptions this plan was an afterthought of the king for the original charter contains no such regulation but the munificent father of the national liberties saw fit subsequently to qualify his gift had louis xviii lived a little longer he would most probably have been dethroned before this the hopes and expectations which usually accompany a new reign having most probably deferred the crisis for a few years the electors form themselves into colleges into which no one who is not privileged to vote is admitted this is a good regulation and might be copied to advantage at home a law prescribing certain limits around each poll and rendering it penal for any but those authorized to vote at that particular poll to cross it would greatly purify our elections the government here appoints the presiding officer of each electoral college and the selection is always carefully made of one in the interests of the ministry though in what manner such a functionary can influence the result is more than i can tell you it is however thought to be favourable to an individuals own election to get this nomination the vote is by ballot though the charter secures no such privilege indeed that instrument is little more than a declaration of rights fortified by a few general constituent laws  the same latitude exists here in the constructions of the charter as exists at home in the constructions of the constitution the french have however one great advantage over us in daring to think for themselves for though there is a party of doctrinaires who wish to imitate england too it is neither a numerous nor a strong party these doctrinaires as the name implies are men who wish to defer to theories rather than facts a class that is to be found all over the world for obvious reasons the english system has admirers throughout europe as well as in america since nothing can be more agreeable for those who are in a situation to look forward to such an advantage than to see themselves elevated into as lafayette expresses so many little legitimacies the peerage with its exclusive and hereditary benefits is the aim of all the nobility of europe and wishes of this sort make easy converts to any philosophy that may favour the desire  one meets here with droll evidences of the truth of what i have just told you i have made the acquaintance of a russian of very illustrious family and he has always been loud and constant in his eulogiums of america and her liberty alluding to the subject the other day he amused me by naïvely observing ah you are a happy peopleyou are freeand so are the english now in russia all rank depends on the commission one bears in the army or on the will of the emperor i am a prince my father was a prince my grandfather too but it is of no avail i get no privileges by my birth whereas in england where i have been it is so differentand i dare say it is different in america too i told him it was indeed very different in america he sighed and seemed to envy me  the party of the doctrinaires is the one that menaces the most serious evil to france it is inherently the party of aristocracy and in a country as far advanced as france it is the combinations of the few that after all are most to be apprehended the worst of it is that in countries where abuses have so long existed the people get to be so disqualified for entertaining free institutions that even the disinterested and wellmeaning are often induced to side with the rapacious and selfish to prevent the evils of reaction  in a country so much inclined to speculate to philosophize and to reason on everything it is not surprising that a fundamental law as vaguely expressed as the charter should leave ample room for discussion we find that our own long experience in these written instruments does not protect us from violent differences of opinion some of which are quite as extravagant as any that exist here though possibly less apt to lead to as grave consequences28  footnote 28 the discussion which grew out of the law to protect american industry affords a singular instance of the manner in which clever men can persuade themselves and others into any notion however extravagant the uncouth doctrine of nullification turned on the construction that might be put on the intimacy of the relations created by the union and on the nature of the sovereignties of the states  because the constitution commences with a declaration that it is formed and adopted by we the people of the united states overlooking not only all the facts of the case but misconceiving the very meaning of the words they quote one party virtually contended that the instrument was formed by a consolidated nation on this point their argument certainly sustained in part by unanswerable truth mainly depends  the word people has notoriously several significations it means a population it means the vulgar it means any particular portion of a population as rich people poor people mercantile people etc etc in a political sense it has always been understood to mean that portion of the population of a country which is possessed of political rights on this sense then it means a constituency in a representative government and so it has always been understood in england and is understood today in france when a question is referred to the people at an election in england it is not referred to a tithe of the population but to a particular portion of it in south carolina and louisiana in the popular sense of mr webster there is no people to refer to a majority of the men of both states possessing no civil rights and scarcely having civil existence besides people in its broad signification includes men women and children and no one will contend that the two latter had anything to do with the formation of our constitution it follows then that the term has been used in a limited sense and we must look to incidental facts to discover its meaning  the convention was chosen not by any common constituency but by the constituencies of the several states which at that time embraced every gradation between a democratical and an aristocratically polity thirteen states existed in 1787 and yet the constitution was to go into effect when it was adopted by any nine of them it will not be pretended that this decision would be binding on the other four and yet it is possible that these four dissenting states should contain more than half of all the population of the confederation it would be very easy to put a proposition in which it might be demonstrated arithmetically that the constitution could have been adopted against a considerable majority of whole numbers in the face of such a fact it is folly to suppose the term people is used in any other than a conventional sense it is well known in addition to the mode of its adoption that every provision of the constitution can be altered with a single exception by threefourths of the states perhaps more than half of the entire population excluding the territories and the district is in six of the largest states at this moment but whether this be so or not such a combination could easily he made as would demonstrate that less than a third of the population of the country can at any time alter the constitution  it is probable that the term we the people was used in a sort of contradistinction to the old implied right of the sovereignty of the king just as we idly substituted the words god save the people at the end of a proclamation for god save the king it was a form but if it is desirable to affix to them any more precise signification it will not do to generalize according to the argument of one party but we are to take the words in their limited and appropriate meaning and with their accompanying facts they can only allude to the constituencies and these constituencies existed only through the states and were as varied as their several systems if the meaning of the term we the people was misconceived it follows that the argument which was drawn from the error was worthless the constitution of the united states was not formed by the people of the united states but by such a portion of them as it suited the several states to invest with political powers and under such combinations as gave the decision to anything but a majority of the nation in other words the constitution was certainly formed by the states as political bodies and without any necessary connexion with any general or uniform system of polity  any theory based on the separate sovereignties of the states has on the other hand a frail support the question was not who formed the constitution but what was formed all the great powers of sovereignty such as foreign relations the right to treat make war and peace to control commerce to coin money etc etc are expressly ceded but these are not after all the greatest blows that are given to the doctrine of reserved sovereignty a power to alter the constitution as has just been remarked has been granted by which even the dissenting states have become bound the only right reserved is that of the equal representation in the senate and it would follow perhaps as a legitimate consequence the preservation of the confederated polity but south carolina could under the theory of the constitution be stripped of her right to control nearly every social interest every man woman and child in the state dissenting it is scarcely worth while to construct a sublimated theory on the sovereignty of a community so situated by the legitimate theory of the government under which it actually exists  no means can be devised that will always protect the weak from the aggressions of the strong under the forms of law and nature has pointed out the remedy when the preponderance of good is against submission but one cannot suppress his expression of astonishment at finding any respectable portion of a reasoning community losing sight of this simple and selfevident truth to uphold a doctrine as weak as that of nullification viewed as a legal remedy  if the american statesmen quasi and real would imitate the good curate and the bachelor of don quixote by burning all the political heresies with which their libraries not to say their brains are now crammed and set seriously about studying the terms and the nature of the national compact without reference to the notions of men who had no connexion with the country the public would be the gainers and occasionally one of them might stand a chance of descending to posterity in some other light than that of the mere leader of a faction     letter xx  excursion with lafayettevincennesthe donjonlagrangethe towersinterior of the housethe

you of lagrange though i have now been there no less than three times shortly after our arrival in paris general lafayette had the kindness to send us an invitation but we were deterred from going for sometime by the indisposition of one of the family in the autumn of 1826 i went however alone in the spring i went again carrying mrs  with me and i have now just returned from a third visit in which i went with my wife accompanied by one or two more of the family  it is about twentyseven miles from paris to rosay a small town that is a league from the castle this is not a postroute the great road ending at rosay and we were obliged to go the whole distance with the same horses paris is left by the boulevard de la bastille the barrière du trône and the chateau and woods of vincennes the second time i went into brie it was with the general himself and in his own carriage he showed me a small pavilion that is still standing in a garden near the old site of the bastille and which he told me once belonged to the hotel that beaumarchais inhabited when in his glory and in which pavilion this witty writer was accustomed to work the roof was topped by a vane to show which way the wind blew and in pure fanfaronnade or to manifest his contempt for principles the author of figaro had caused a large copper pen to do the duty of a weathercock and there it stands to this day a curious memorial equally of his wit and of his audacity  at the barrière du trône the general pointed out to me the spot where two of his female connexions suffered under the guillotine during the reign of terror on one occasion in passing we entered the castle of vincennes which is a sort of citadel for paris and which has served for a state prison since the destruction of the bastille almost all of these strong old places were formerly the residences of the kings or of great nobles the times requiring that they should live constantly protected by ditches and walls  vincennes like the tower of london is a collection of old buildings enclosed within a wall and surrounded by a ditch the latter however is dry the most curious of the structures and the one which gives the place its picturesque appearance in the distance is a cluster of exceedingly slender tall round towers in which the prisoners are usually confined and which is the donjon of the hold this building which contains many vaulted rooms piled on each other was formerly the royal abode and it has even now a ditch of its own though it stands within the outer walls of the place there are many other high towers on the walls and until the reign of napoleon there were still more but he caused them to be razed to the level of the walls which of themselves are sufficiently high  the chapel is a fine building being gothic it was constructed in the time of charles v there are also two or three vast corps de bâtimens which are almost palaces in extent and design though they are now used only as quarters for officers etc etc the donjon dates from the same reign the first room in this building is called the salle de la question a name which sufficiently denotes its infernal use that of the upper story is the room in which the kings of france formerly held their councils the walls are sixteen feet thick and the rooms are thirty feet high as there are five stories this donjon cannot be less than a hundred and forty or fifty feet in elevation the view from the summit is very extensive though it is said that in the time of napoleon a screen was built around the battlement to prevent the prisoners when they took the air from enjoying it as this conqueror was cruel from policy alone it is probable this was merely a precaution against signals for it is quite apparent if he desired to torment his captives france has places better adapted to the object than even the donjon of vincennes i am not his apologist however for while i shall not go quite as far as the englishman who maintained in a laboured treatise that napoleon was the beast of the revelations i believe he was anything but a god  vincennes was a favourite residence of st louis and there is a tradition that he used to take his seat under a particular oak in the adjoining forest where all who pleased were permitted to come before him and receive justice from himself henry v of england died in the donjon of vincennes and i believe his successor henry vi was born in the same building one gets a better notion of the state of things in the ages of feudality by passing an hour in examining such a hold than in a weeks reading after going through this habitation and studying its barbarous magnificence i feel much more disposed to believe that shakspeare has not outraged probability in his dialogue between henry and catharine than if i had never seen it bad as that celebrated lovescene is  shortly after quitting vincennes the road crosses the marne and stretches away across a broad bottom there is little of interest between paris and rosay the principal house is that of grosbois which once belonged to moreau i believe but is now the property of the prince de wagram the young son of berthier the grounds are extensive and the house is large though i think neither in very good taste at least so far as one could judge in passing  there are two or three ruins on this road of some historical interest but not of much beauty there is usually a nakedness unrelieved by trees or other picturesque accessories about the french ruins which robs them of half their beauty and dirty squalid hamlets and villages half the time come in to render the picture still less interesting  at rosay another route is taken and lagrange is approached by the rear after turning a small bit of wood it is possible to see the tops of the towers for an instant on the great road before reaching the town  it is not certainly known in what age the chateau was built but from its form and a few facts connected with its origin whose dates are ascertained it is thought to be about five hundred years old it never was more than a secondrate building of its class though it was clearly intended for a baronial hold originally the name was lagrange en brie but by passing into a new family it got the appellation of lagrange bléneau by which it is known at present you are sufficiently familiar with french to understand that grange means barn or granary and that a liberal translation would make it bléneau farm  in 1399 a marriage took place between the son of the lord of lagrange en brie with a daughter of a branch of the very ancient and great family of courtenay which had extensive possessions at that time in brie it was this marriage which gave the new name to the castle the estate in consequence passing into the line of courtenaybléneau in 1595 the property by another marriage with an heiress passed into the wellknown family daubussons comtes de la feuillade the first proprietor of this name was the grandfather of the mareschal de la feuillade the courtier who caused the place des victoires to be constructed at paris and he appropriated the revenues of the estate which in 1686 were valued at nine thousand francs to the support and completion of his work of flattery the property at that time was however much more extensive than it is at present the son of this courtier dying without issue in 1726 the estate was purchased by m dupré one of the judges of france  with this magistrate commences i believe the connexion of the ancestors of the lafayettes with the property the only daughter married m daguesseau and her daughter again married the duc de noaillesdayen 29 carrying with her as a marriage portion the lands of fontenay lagrange etc etc or in other words the ancient possessions of m de lafeuillade the marquis de lafayette married one of the mesdemoiselles de noailles while he was still a youth and when the estate after a short sequestration was restored to the family general lafayette received the chateau of lagrange with some six or eight hundred acres of land around it as his wifes portion  footnote 29 mr adams in his eulogy on lafayette has called the duc de noailles the first peer of france the fact is of no great moment but accuracy is always better than error i believe the duc de noailles was the youngest of the old ducs et pairs of france the duc duzès i have always understood was the oldest  although the house is not very spacious for a chateau of the region in which it stands it is a considerable edifice and one of the most picturesque i have seen in this country the buildings stand on three sides of an irregular square the fourth side must have been either a high wall or a range of low offices formerly to complete the court and the defences but every vestige of them has long since been removed the ditch too which originally encircled the whole castle has been filled in on two sides though still remaining on the two others and greatly contributing to the beauty of the place as the water is living and is made to serve the purposes of a fishpond we had carp from it for breakfast the day after our arrival  lagrange is constructed of hewn stone of a good greyish colour and in parts of it there are some respectable pretensions to architecture i think it probable that one of its fronts has been rebuilt the style being so much better than the rest of the structure there are five towers all of which are round and have the plain high pyramidal roof so common in france they are without cornices battlements of any sort or indeed any relief to the circular masonry one however has a roof of a square form though the exterior of the lower itself is at least in part round all the roofs are of slate  the approach to the castle is circuitous until quite near it when the road enters a little thicket of evergreens crosses a bridge and passes beneath an arch to the court which is paved the bridge is now permanent though there was once a draw and the grooves of a portcullis are still visible beneath the arch the shortest side of the square is next the bridge the building offering here but little more than the two towers and the room above the gateway one of these towers forms the end of this front of the castle and the other is of course at an angle on the exterior they are both buried in ivy as well as the building which connects them this ivy was planted by charles fox who in company with general fitzpatrick visited lagrange after the peace of amiens the windows which are small and irregular on this side open beautifully through the thick foliage and as this is the part of the structure that is occupied by the children of the family their blooming faces thrust through the leafy apertures have a singularly pleasing effect the other three towers stand one near the centre of the principal corps de bâtiment one at the other angle and the third at the end of the wing opposite that of the gate the towers vary in size and are all more or less buried in the walls though still so distinct as greatly to relieve the latter and everywhere to rise above them on the open side of the court there is no ditch but the ground which is altogether parklike and beautifully arranged falls away dotted with trees and copses towards a distant thicket  besides the rezdechaussée which is but little above the ground there are two good stories all round the building and even more in the towers the diningroom and offices are below and there is also a small oratory or chapel though i believe none of the family live there the entrance to the principal apartments is opposite the gate and there is also here an exterior door which communicates directly with the lawn the ditch running behind the other wing and in front of the gate only the great staircase is quite good being spacious easy of ascent and of marble with a handsome iron railing it was put there by the mother of madame lafayette i believe and the general told me it was nearly the only thing of value that he found among the fixtures on taking possession it had escaped injury  i should think the length of the house on the side of the square which contains the staircase might be ninety feet including the tower at the end and the tower at the angle and perhaps the side which contains the offices may be even a little longer though this will also include the same tower in the same angle as well as the one at the opposite corner while the side in which is the gateway can scarcely exceed sixty feet if my estimates which are merely made by the eye are correct including the towers this would give an outside wall of two hundred and fifty feet in circuit like most french buildings the depth is comparatively much less i question if the outer drawingroom is more than eighteen feet wide though it is near thirty long this room has windows on the court and on the lawn and is the first apartment one enters after ascending the stairs it communicates with the inner drawingroom which is in the end tower of this side of the chateau is quite round of course and may be twenty feet in diameter  the generals apartments are on the second floor they consist of his bedroom a large cabinet and the library the latter is in the tower at the angle on the side of the staircase it is circular and from its windows overlooks the moat which is beautifully shaded by willows and other trees it contains a respectable collection of books besides divers curiosities  the only bedrooms i have occupied are one in the tower immediately beneath the library and the other in the side tower or the only one which does not stand at an angle or at an end of the building i believe however that the entire edifice with the exception of the oratory the offices the diningroom which is a large apartment on the rezdechaussée the two drawingrooms two or three cabinets and the library and perhaps a familyroom or two such as a schoolroom paintingroom etc is subdivided into sleeping apartments with the necessary cabinets and dressingrooms including the family i have known thirty people to be lodged in the house besides servants and i should think it might even lodge more indeed its hospitality seems to know no limits for every newcomer appears to be just as welcome as all the others  the cabinet of lafayette communicates with the library and i passed much of the time during our visit alone with him in these two rooms i may say that this was the commencement of a confidence with which he has since continued to treat me and of a more intimate knowledge of the amiable features and simple integrity of his character that has greatly added to my respect no one can be pleasanter in private and he is full of historical anecdotes that he tells with great simplicity and frequently with great humour the cabinet contains many portraits and among others one of madame de staël and one of his own father the former i am assured is exceedingly like it is not the resemblance of a very fascinating woman in the latter i find more resemblance to some of the grandchildren than to the son although there is something about the shape of the head that is not unlike that of lafayettes  general lafayette never knew his father who was killed when he was quite an infant at the battle of minden i believe the general was an only child for i have never heard him speak of any brother or sister nor indeed of any relative at all as i can remember on his own side though he often alludes to the connexions he made by his marriage i asked him how his father happened to be styled the comte de lafayette and he to be called the marquis he could not tell me his grandfather was the marquis de lafayette his father the comte and he again was termed the marquis i know very little about it said be beyond this i found myself a little marquis as i grew to know anything and boys trouble themselves very little about such matters and then i soon got tired of the name after i went to america i cannot explain all the foolish distinctions of the feudal times but i very well remember that when i was quite a boy i had the honour to go through the ceremony of appointing the curé of a very considerable town in auvergne of which i was the seigneur my conscience has been quite easy about the nomination however as my guardians must answer for the sin if there be any  i was at a small dinner given by the comte de ségur just before we went to lagrange and at which general lafayette and m alexander de lameth were also guests the three had served in america all of them having been colonels while little more than boys in the course of the conversation m de lameth jokingly observed that the americans paid the greater deference to general lafayette because he was a marquis for a long time there had been but one marquis in england lord rockingham and the colonist appreciating all other marquises by this standard had at once thought they would do no less than make the marquis de lafayette a general as for myself though i was the senior colonel and as i understood him to say his superior in personal rank i passed for nobody because i was only a chevalier this sally was laughed at at the time though there is something very unsettled in the use of those arbitrary personal distinctions on which the french formerly laid so much stress i shall not attempt to explain them i contented myself by whispering to m de lameth that we certainly knew very little of such matters in america but i questioned if we were ever so ignorant as to suppose there was only one marquis in france on the contrary we are little too apt to fancy every frenchman a marquis  there was formerly a regular parish church attached to the chateau which is still standing it is very small and is within a short distance of the gateway the congregation was composed solely of the inhabitants of the chateau and the people of the farm the church contains epitaphs and inscriptions in memory of three of the daubussons whose hearts were buried here viz leon comte de lafeuillade a lieutenantgeneral gabriel marquis de montargis and paul daubussons a knight of malta all of whom were killed young in battle  the general has about three hundred and fifty acres in cultivation and more than two in wood pasture and meadow the place is in very excellent condition and seems to be well attended to i have galloped all over it on a little filly belonging to one of the young gentlemen and have found beauty and utility as nicely blended as is often to be met with even in england the true country of fermes ornées though the name is imported  the third day of our visit we all drove three or four leagues across the country to see an old ruin of a royal castle called vivier this name implies a pond and sure enough we found the remains of the buildings in the midst of two or three pools of water this has been a considerable house the ruins being still quite extensive and rather pretty it was originally the property of a great noble but the kings of france were in possession of it as early as the year 1300 charles v had a great affection for vivier and very materially increased its establishment his son charles vi who was at times deranged was often confined here and it was after his reign and by means of the long wars that ravaged france that the place came to be finally abandoned as a royal abode indeed it is not easy to see why a king should ever have chosen this spot at all for his residence unless it might be for the purpose of hunting for even now it is in a retired tame and far from pleasant part of the country  there are the ruins of a fine chapel and of two towers of considerable interest beside extensive fragments of more vulgar buildings one of these towers being very high and very slender is a striking object but from its form and position it was one of those narrow wells that were attached to larger towers and which contained nothing but the stairs they are commonly to be seen in the ruins of edifices built in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in france and what is worthy of remark in several instances notwithstanding their slender forms i have met with them standing although their principals have nearly disappeared i can only account for it by supposing that their use and delicacy of form have required more than ordinary care in the construction  the ruins of vivier belong to m parquin a distinguished lawyer of paris this gentleman has a small countryhouse near by and general lafayette took us all to see him we found him at home and met quite as a matter of course with a polite reception m parquin gave us much curious information about the ruin and took us to see some of the subterraneous passages that he has caused to be opened  it is thought that some of these artificial caverns were prisons and that others were intended merely as places for depositing stores the one we entered was of beautiful masonry vaulted with the nicest art and seemed to communicate with the ruins although the outlet was in the open field and some distance from the walls it might have been intended for the double purpose of a storehouse and an outlet for it is rare to meet with a palace or a castle that has out more or less of these private means of entrance and retreat the tuileries is said to abound with them and i have been shown the line of an underground passage between that palace and one of the public hotels which must be fully a quarter of a mile in length  dulaure gives an extract from a report of the state of the chateau of vivier made about the year 1700 with a view to know whether its conditions were such as to entitle the place to preserve certain of its privileges in this document the castle is described as standing in the centre of a marsh surrounded by forest and as so remote from all civilization as to be nearly forgotten this it will be remembered is the account of a royal abode that stands within thirty miles of paris  in the very heart of the french capital are the remains of an extensive palace of one of the roman emperors and yet it may be questioned if one in a thousand of those who live within a mile of the spot have the least idea of the origin of the buildings i have inquired about it in its immediate neighbourhood and it was with considerable difficulty i could discover any one who even knew that there was such a ruin at all in the street the great number of similar objects and the habit of seeing them daily has some such effect on one as the movement of a crowd in a public thoroughfare where images pass so incessantly before the eye as to leave no impression of their peculiarities were a solitary bison to scamper through the rue st honoré the worthy parisians would transmit an account of his exploits to their childrens children while the wayfarer on the prairies takes little heed of the flight of a herd  as we went to lagrange we stopped at a tavern opposite to which was the iron gate of a small chateau i asked the girl who was preparing our goûter to whom the house belonged i am sorry i cannot tell you sir she answered and then seeing suspicion in my face she promptly addedfor do you see sir i have only been here six weeks figure to yourself an american girl set down opposite an iron gate in the country and how long do you imagine she would be ignorant of the owners name if the blood of those pious inquisitors the puritans were in her veins she would know more not only of the gate but of its owner his wife his children his means his hopes wishes intentions and thoughts than he ever knew himself or would be likely to know but if this prominent love of meddling must of necessity in its very nature lead to what is worse than contented ignorance gossiping error and a wrong estimate of our fellowcreatures it has at least the advantage of keeping a people from falling asleep over their everyday facts there is no question that the vulgar and lowbred propensity of conjecturing meddling combining with their unavoidable companion inventing exist to a vice among a portion of our people but on the other hand it is extremely inconvenient when one is travelling and wishes to know the points of the compass as has happened to myself if he should ask a fullgrown woman whereabouts the sun rises in that neighbourhood he is repulsed with the answer thatmonsieur ought to know that better than a poor gardenwoman like me  we returned to paris after a pleasant visit of three days at lagrange during which we had delightful weather and altogether a most agreeable time the habits of the family are very regular and simple but the intercourse has the freedom and independence of a countryhouse we were all in the circular drawingroom a little before ten breakfast being served between ten and eleven the table was french the morning repast consisting of light dishes of meat compotes fruits and sometimes soupe au lait one of the simplest and best things for such a meal than can be imagined as a compliment to us americans we had fish fried and broiled but i rather think this was an innovation wine to drink with water as a matter of course was on the table the whole ended with a cup of café au lait the morning then passed as each one saw fit the young men went shooting the ladies drove out or read or had a little music while the general and myself were either walking about the farm or were conversing in the library we dined at six as at paris and tea was made in the drawingroom about nine  i was glad to hear from general lafayette that the reports of americans making demands on his purse like so many other silly rumours that are circulated merely because some one has fancied such a thing might be so are untrue on the contrary he assures me that applications of this nature are very seldom made and most of those that have been made have proved to come from englishmen who have thought they might swindle him in this form i have had at least a dozen such applications myself but i take it nothing is easier in general than to distinguish between an american and a native of great britain it was agreed between us that in future all applications of this nature should be sent to me for investigation30  footnote 30 under this arrangement two or three years later an applicant was sent for examination under very peculiar circumstances the man represented himself to be a shopkeeper of baltimore who had come to england with his wife and child to purchase goods he had been robbed of all he had according to his account of the matter about a thousand pounds in sovereigns and was reduced to want in a strange country after trying all other means in vain he bethought him of coming to paris to apply to general lafayette for succour he had just money enough to do this having left his wife in liverpool he appeared with an english passport looked like an englishman and had even caught some of the low english idioms such as i am agreeable for it is agreeable to me or i agree to do so etc etc the writer was exceedingly puzzled to decide as to this mans nationality at length in describing his journey to paris he said they took my passport from me when we got to the lines this settled the matter as no one but an american would call a frontier the lines he proved in the end to be an american and a great rogue     letter xxi  insecurity of the bourbonsdistrust of americansliterary visitor the templarspresents and invitationsa spyamerican virtue inconsistencysocial freedom in americafrench mannerists national distinctionsa lively reaction   to r cooper esq cooperstown  we all went to bed a night or two since as usual and awoke to learn that there had been a fight in the capital one of the countless underplots had got so near the surface that it threw up smoke it is said that about fifty were killed and wounded chiefly on the part of the populace  the insecurity of the bourbons is little understood in america it is little understood even by those americans who pass a few months in the country and in virtue of frequenting the cafés and visiting the theatres fancy they know the people louis xviii was more than once on the point of flying again between the year 1815 and his death for since the removal of the allied troops there is really no force for a monarch to depend on more especially in and around the capital the army being quite as likely to take sides against them as for them  the government has determined on exhibiting vigour and there was a great show of troops the night succeeding the combat curious to see the effect of all this two or three of us got into a carriage and drove through the streets about nine oclock we found some two or three thousand men on the boulevards and the rue st denis in particular which had been the scene of the late disorder was watched with jealous caution in all there might have been four or five thousand men under arms they were merely in readiness leaving a free passage for carriages though in some of the narrow streets we found the bayonets pretty near our faces  an american being supposed ex officio as it were to be a wellwisher to the popular cause there is perhaps a slight disposition to look at us with distrust the opinion of our travellers generally favouring liberty is in my judgment singularly erroneous the feelings of a majority being on the whole just the other way for at least the first year or two of their european experience though i think it is to be noticed by the end of that time that they begin to lose sight of the personal interests which at home have made them anything but philosophers on such subjects and to see and appreciate the immense advantages of freedom over exclusion although the predominance of the former may not always favour their own particular views such at least has been the result of my own observations and so far from considering a fresh arrival from home as being likely to be an accession to our little circle of liberal principles i have generally deemed all such individuals as being more likely to join the side of the aristocrats or the exclusionists in politics this is not the moment to enter into an examination of the causes that have led to so singular a contradiction between opinions and facts though i think the circumstance is not to be denied for it is now my intention to give you an account of the manner in which matters are managed here rather than enter into long investigations of the state of society at home  not long after my arrival in france a visit was announced from a person who was entirely unknown to me but who called himself a littérateur the first interview passed off as such interviews usually do and circumstances not requiring any return on my part it was soon forgotten within a fortnight however i received visit the second when the conversation took a political turn my guest freely abusing the bourbons the aristocrats and the present state of things in france i did little more than listen when the way was thus opened i was asked if i admired sir walter scott and particularly what i thought of ivanhoe or rather if i did not think it an indifferent book a little surprised at such a question i told my littérateur that ivanhoe appeared to me to be very unequal the first half being incomparably the best but that as a whole i thought it stood quite at the head of the particular sort of romances to which it belonged the antiquary and guy mannering for instance were both much nearer perfection and on the whole i thought both better books but ivanhoe especially its commencement was a noble poem but did i not condemn the want of historical truth in its pictures i did not consider ivanhoe as intended to be history it was a work of the imagination in which all the fidelity that was requisite was enough to be probable and natural and that requisite i thought it possessed in an eminent degree it is true antiquarians accused the author of having committed some anachronisms by confounding the usages of different centuries which was perhaps a greater fault in such a work than to confound mere individual characters but of this i did not pretend to judge not being the least of an antiquary myself did i not think he had done gross injustice to the noble and useful order of the templars on this point i could say no more than on the preceding having but a very superficial knowledge of the templars though i thought the probabilities seemed to be perfectly well respected nothing could seem to be more true than scotts pictures my guest then went into a long vindication of the templars stating scott had done them gross injustice and concluding with an exaggerated compliment in which it was attempted to persuade me that i was the man to vindicate the truth and to do justice to at subject that was so peculiarly connected with liberal principles i disclaimed the ability to undertake such a task at all confessed that i did not wish to disturb the images which sir walter scott had left had i the ability and declared i did not see the connexion between his accusation admitting it to be true and liberal principles  my visitor soon after went away and i saw no more of him for a week when he came again on this occasion he commenced by relating several piquant anecdotes of the bourbons and their friends gradually and ingeniously leading the conversation again round to his favourite templars after pushing me for half an hour on this point always insisting on my being the man to vindicate the order and harping on its connexion with liberty he took advantage of one of my oftenrepeated protestations of ignorance of the whole matter suddenly to say well then monsieur go and see for yourself and you will soon be satisfied that my account of the order is true go and see what the templars there are no longer any they exist still where here in paris this is new to me i do not understand it the templars exist they possess documents to prove how much scott has misrepresented them andbut you will remember that the actual government has so much jealousy of everything it does not control that secrecy is necessaryand to be frank with you m  i am commissioned by the grand master to invite you to be present at a secret meeting this very week  of course i immediately conjectured that some of the political agitators of the day had assumed this taking guise in order to combine their means and carry out their plans31 the proposition was gotten rid of by my stating in terms that could not be misunderstood that i was a traveller and did not wish to meddle with anything that required secrecy in a foreign government that i certainly had my own political notions and if pushed should not hesitate to avow them anywhere that the proper place for a writer to declare his sentiments was in his books unless under circumstances which authorized him to act that i did not conceive foreigners were justifiable in going beyond this that i never had meddled with the affairs of foreign countries and that i never would and that the fact of this societys being secret was sufficient to deter me from visiting it with this answer my guest departed and he never came again  footnote 31 since the revolution of 1830 these templars have made public but abortive efforts to bring themselves into notice by instituting some ceremonies in which they appeared openly in their robes  now the first impression was as i have told you and i supposed my visitor although a man of fifty was one of those who innocently lent himself to these silly exaggerations either as a dupe or to dupe others i saw reason however to change this opinion  at the time these visits occurred i scarcely knew any one in paris and was living in absolute retirementbeing as you know already quite without letters about ten days after i saw the last of my littérateur i got a letter from a high functionary of the government sending me a set of valuable medals the following day these were succeeded by his card and an invitation to dinner soon after another person notoriously connected with court intrigues sought me out and overwhelmed me with civilities in a conversation that shortly after occurred between us this person gave a pretty direct intimation that by pushing a little a certain decoration that is usually conferred on literary men was to be had if it were desired i got rid of all these things in the straightforward manner that is the best for upsetting intrigues and having really nothing to conceal i was shortly permitted to take my own course  i have now little doubt that the littérateur was a spy sent either to sound me on some points connected with lafayette and the republicans or possibly to lead me into some difficulty though i admit that this is no more than conjecture i give you the facts which at the time struck me as at least odd and you may draw your own conclusions this however is but one of a dozen adventures more or less similar that have occurred and i think it well to mention it by way of giving you an insight into what sometimes happens here32  footnote 32 a conversation which took place after the revolution of 1830 with one of the parties named leaves little doubt as to the truth of the original conjecture  my rule has been whenever i am pushed on the subject of politics to deal honestly and sincerely with all with whom i am brought in contact and in no manner to leave the impression that i think the popular form of government an unavoidable evil to which america is obliged to submit i do not shut my eyes to the defects of our own system or to the bad consequences that flow from it and from it alone but the more i see of other countries the more i am persuaded that under circumstances which admit but of a choice of evils we are greatly the gainers by having adopted it although i do not believe every other nation is precisely fitted to imitate us i think it is their misfortune they are not so if the inhabitants of other countries do not like to hear such opinions they should avoid the subject with americans  it is very much the custom here whenever the example of america is quoted in favour of the practicability of republican institutions to attribute our success to the fact of societys being so simple and the people so virtuous i presume i speak within bounds when i say that i have heard the latter argument urged a hundred times during the last eighteen months one lady in particular who is exceedingly clever but who has a dread of all republics on account of having lost a near friend during the reign of terror was especially in the practice of resorting to this argument whenever in our frequent playful discussions of the subject i have succeeded in disturbing her inferences by citing american facts mais monsieur lamérique est si jeune et vous avez les vertus que nous manquons etc etc has always been thought a sufficient answer now i happen to be one of those who do not entertain such extravagant notions of the exclusive and peculiar virtues of our own country nor have i been so much struck with the profound respect of the europeans in general for those very qualities that nevertheless are always quoted as the reason of the success of what is called the american experiment quite the contrary i have found myself called on more than once to repel accusations against our morality of a very serious nature accusations that we do not deserve and my impression certainly is that the american people so far as they are at all the subjects of observation enjoy anything but a good name in europe struck by this flagrant contradiction i determined to practise on my female friend a little a plan that was successfully carried out as follows  avoiding all allusion to politics so as to throw her completely off her guard i took care to introduce such subjects as should provoke comparisons on other points between france and america or rather between the latter and europe generally as our discussions had a tinge of philosophy neither being very bigoted and both preserving perfect good humour the plot succeeded admirably after a little time i took occasion to fortify one of my arguments by a slight allusion to the peculiar virtues of the american people she was too wellbred to controvert this sort of reasoning at first until pushing the point little by little she was so far provoked as to exclaim you lay great stress on the exclusive virtues of your countrymen monsieur but i have yet to learn that they are so much better than the rest of the world i beg a thousand pardons madame if i have been led into an indiscretion on this delicate subject but you must ascribe my error to your own eloquence which contrary to my previous convictions had persuaded me into the belief that we have some peculiar unction of this nature that is unknown in europe i now begin to see the mistake and to understand que nous autres américains are to be considered virtuous only where there is question of the practicability of maintaining republican form of government and as great rogues on all other occasions madame de  was wise enough and goodtempered enough to laugh at the artifice and the allusion to nous autres vertueux has got to be a mot dordre with us the truth is that the question of politics is exclusively one of personal advantages with a vast majority of the people of europe one set selfishly struggling to maintain their present superiority while the other is as selfishly and in some respects as blindly striving to overturn all that is established in order to be benefited by the scramble that will follow and religion justice philosophy and practical good are almost equally remote from the motives of both parties  from reflecting on such subjects i have been led into a consideration of the influence of political institutions on the more ordinary relations of society if the conclusions are generally in favour of popular rights and what is called freedom there can be little question that there are one or two weak spots on our side of the question that it were better did they not exist let us for the humour of the thing look a little into these points  it is a common remark of all foreigners that there is less social freedom in america than in most other countries of christendom by social freedom i do not mean as relates to the mere forms of society for in these we are loose rather than rigid but that one is less a master of his own acts his own mode of living his own time being more rigidly amenable to public opinion on all these points than elsewhere the fact i believe out of all question is true at least it appears to be true so far as my knowledge of our own and of other countries extends admitting then the fact to be so it is worth while to throw away a moment in inquiring into the consequent good and evil of such a state of things as well as in looking for the causes it is always a great assistant in our study of others to have some tolerable notions of ourselves  the control of public opinion has beyond question a salutary influence on the moral exterior of a country the great indifference which the french and indeed the higher classes of most european countries manifest to the manner of living of the members of their different circles so long as certain appearances are respected may do no affirmative good to society though at the same time it does less positive harm than you may be disposed to imagine but this is not the point to which i now allude europeans maintain that in things innocent in themselves but which are closely connected with the independence of action and tastes of men the american is less his own master than the inhabitant of this part of the world and this is the fact i for one feel it necessary to concede to them there can be no doubt that society meddles much more with the private affairs of individuals and affairs too over which it properly has no control in america than in europe i will illustrate what i mean by an example  about twenty years since there lived in one of our shiretowns a family which in its different branches had numerous female descendants then all children a member of this family one day went to a respectable clergyman his friend and told him that he and his connexions had so many female children whom it was time to think of educating that they had hit upon the plan of engaging some suitable instructress with the intention of educating their girls all together both for economys sake and for convenience as well as that such near connexions might be brought up in a way to strengthen the family tie the clergyman warmly remonstrated against the scheme assuring his friend that the community would not bear it and that it would infallibly make enemies this was the feeling of a very sensible man and of an experienced divine and i was myself the person making the application this is religiously true and i have often thought of the circumstance since equally with astonishment and horror  there are doubtless many parts of america even where such an interference with the private arrangement of a family would not be dreamt of but there is a large portion of the country in which the feeling described by my clerical friend does prevail most observers would refer all this to democracy but i do not the interference would not proceed from the humblest classes of society at all but from those nearer ones own level it would proceed from a determination to bring all within the jurisdiction of a common opinion or to be revenged on delinquents by envy hatred and all uncharitableness there is no disposition in america to let one live as he or she may happen to please to live the public choosing though always in its proper circle to interfere and say how you must live it is folly to call this by terms as sounding as republicanism or democracy which inculcate the doctrine of as much personal freedom as at all comports with the public good he is indeed a most sneaking democrat who finds it necessary to consult a neighbourhood before he can indulge his innocent habits and tastes it is sheer meddling and no casuistry can fitly give it any other name  a portion of this troublesome quality is owing beyond question to our provincial habits which are always the most exacting but i think a large portion perhaps i ought to say the largest is inherited from those pious but exaggerated religionists who first peopled the country these sectaries extended the discipline of the church to all the concerns of life nothing was too minute to escape their cognizance and a parish sat in judgment on the affairs of all who belonged to it one may easily live so long in the condition of society that such an origin has entailed on us as to be quite unconscious of its peculiarities but i think they can hardly escape one who has lived much beyond its influence  here perhaps the fault is to be found in the opposite extreme though there are so many virtues consequent on independence of thought and independence of habits that i am not sure the good does not equal the evil there is no canting and very little hypocrisy in mere matters of habits in france and this at once is abridging two of our own most besetting vices still the french can hardly be called a very original people convention ties them down mercilessly in a great many things they are less under the influence of mere fashion in their intercourse it is true than some of their neighbours reason and taste exercising more influence over such matters in france than almost anywhere else but they are mannerists in the fine arts in their literature and in all their feelings if one can use such an expression the gross exaggerations of the romantic school that is just now attracting so much attention are merely an effort to liberate themselves but after allowing for the extreme ignorance of the substratum of society which in france although it forms so large a portion of the whole should no more be taken into the account in speaking of the national qualities than the slaves of carolina should be included in an estimate of the character of the carolinians there is notwithstanding this mannerism a personal independence here that certainly does not exist with us the american goes and comes when he pleases and no one asks for a passport he has his political rights talks of his liberty swaggers of his advantages and yet does less as he pleases even in innocent things than the frenchman his neighbours form a police and a most troublesome and impertinent one it sometimes proves to be it is also unjust for having no legal means of arriving at facts it half the time condemns on conjecture  the truth is our institutions are the result of facts and accidents and being necessarily an imitative people there are often gross inconsistencies between our professions and our practice whereas the french have had to struggle through their apprenticeship in political rights by the force of discussions and appeals to reason and theory is still too important to be entirely overlooked perhaps no people understand the true private characters of their public men so little as the americans or any people so well as the french i have never known a distinguished american in whom it did not appear to me that his popular character was a false one or a distinguished frenchman whom the public did not appear to estimate very nearly as he deserved to be even napoleon necessary as he is to the national pride and dazzling as is all military renown seems to me to be much more justly appreciated at paris than anywhere else the practice of meddling can lead to no other result they who wish to stand particularly fair before the public resort to deception and i have heard a man of considerable notoriety in america confess that he was so much afraid of popular comments that he always acted as if an enemy were looking over his shoulder with us no one scruples to believe that he knows all about a public man even to the nicest traits of his character all talk of him as none should talk but those who are in his intimacy and what between hypocrisy on his partan hypocrisy to which he is in some measure driven by the officious interference with his most private interestsand exaggerations and inventions that ingenious tyrant public opinion comes as near the truth as a fortuneteller who is venturing his prediction in behalf of a stranger33  footnote 33 i can give no better illustration of the state of dependence to which men are reduced in america by this spirit of meddling than by the following anecdote a friend was about to build a new townhouse and letting me know the situation he asked my advice as to the mode of construction the inconveniences of an ordinary american townhouse were pointed out to himits unfitness for the general state of society the climate the other domestic arrangements and its ugliness all were admitted and the plan proposed in place of the old style of building was liked but still my friend hesitated about adopting it it will be a genteeler and a betterlooking house than the other agreed it will be really more convenient i think so too it will be cheaper of that there is no question then why not adopt it to own the truth i dare not build differently from my neighbour  in france the right of the citizen to discuss all public matters is not only allowed but felt in america it is not felt though it is allowed a homage must be paid to the public by assuming the disguise of acting as a public agent in america whereas in france individuals address their countrymen daily under their own signatures the impersonality of we and the character of public journalists is almost indispensable with us to impunity although the mask can deceive no one the journalists notoriously making their prints subservient to their private passions and private interests and being impersonal only in the use of the imperial pronoun the representative too in america is privileged to teach in virtue of his collective character by the very men who hold the extreme and untenable doctrine of instruction it is the fashion to say in america that the people will rule it would be nearer the truth however to say the people will seem to rule  i think that these distinctions are facts and they certainly lead to odd reflections we are so peculiarly situated as a nation that one is not to venture on conclusions too hastily a great deal is to be imputed to our provincial habits much to the circumstance of the disproportion between surface and population which by scattering the wellbred and intelligent a class at all times relatively small serves greatly to lessen their influence in imparting tone to society something to the inquisitorial habits of our pious forefathers who appear to have thought that the charities were nought and in the very teeth of revelation that heaven was to be stormed by impertinences while a good deal is to be conceded to the nature of a popular government whose essential spirit is to create a predominant opinion before which right or wrong all must bow until its cycle shall be completed thus it is that we are always more or less under one of two false influences the blow or its rebound action that is seldom quite right or reaction that is always wrong sinning heedlessly or repeating to fanaticism the surest process in the world of riding on to fortune in america is to get seated astride a lively reaction which is rather more likely to carry with it a unanimous sentiment than even the error to which it owes its birth  as much of this weakness as is inseparable from humanity exists here but it exists under so many modifying circumstances as in this particular to render france as unlike america as well may be liberty is not always pure philosophy nor strict justice and yet as a whole it is favourable to both these are the spots on the political sun to the eye which seeks only the radiance and warmth of the orb they are lost but he who studies it with calmness and impartiality sees them too plainly to be in any doubt of their existence     letter xxii  animal magnetismsomnambulesmagnetised patientsmy own examinationa predictionventriloquismforce of the imagination   to james e de kay md  although we have not been without our metaphysical hallucinations in america i do not remember to have heard that animal magnetism was ever in vogue among us a people who are not very quick to feel the poetry of sentiment may well be supposed exempt from the delusions of a doctrine which comprehends the very poetry of physics still as the subject is not without interest and as chance has put me in the way of personally inquiring into this fanciful system i intend in this letter to give you an account of what i have both heard and seen  i shall premise by saying that i rank animal magnetism among the arts rather than among the sciences of its theory i have no very clear notion nor do i believe that i am at all peculiar in my ignorance but until we can say what is that other magnetism to which the world is indisputably so much indebted for its knowledge and comforts i do not know that we are to repudiate this merely because we do not understand it magnetism is an unseen and inexplicable influence and that is metallic while this is animal voilà tout on the whole it may be fairly mooted which most controls the world the animal or the metallic influence  to deal gravely with a subject that at least baffles our comprehension there are certainly very extraordinary things related of animal magnetism and apparently on pretty good testimony take for instance a single fact m jules cloquet is one of the cleverest practitioners of paris and is in extensive business this gentleman publicly makes the following statement i write it from memory but have heard it and read it so often that i do not think my account will contain any essential error  a woman who was subject to the magnetic influence or who was what is commonly called a somnambule had a cancer in the breast m  one of the principal magnetisers of paris and from whom among others i have had an account of the whole affair was engaged to magnetise this woman while m cloquet operated on the diseased part the patient was put asleep or rather into the magnetic trance for it can scarcely be called sleep and the cancer was extracted without the womans manifesting the least terror or the slightest sense of pain to the truth of the substance of this account m cloquet who does not pretend to explain the reason nor profess to belong in any way to the school simply testifies he says that he had such a patient and that she was operated on virtually as i have told you such a statement coming from so high a source induced the academy which is certainly not altogether composed of magnetisers but many of whose members are quite animal enough to comprehend the matter to refer the subject to a special committee which committee i believe was comprised of very clever men the substance of their report was pretty much what might have been anticipated they said that the subject was inexplicable and that animal magnetism could not be brought within the limits of any known laws of nature they might have said the same thing of the comets in both cases we have facts with a few established consequences but are totally without elementary causes  animal magnetism is clearly one of three things it is what it pretends to be an unexplained and as yet incomprehensible physical influence it is delusion or it is absolute fraud  a young countryman of ours having made the acquaintance of m c professionally and being full of the subject i have so far listened to his entreaties as to inquire personally into the facts a step i might not have otherwise been induced to take  i shall now proceed to the history of my own experience in this inexplicable mystery we found m c buried in the heart of paris in one of those vast old hotels which give to this town the air of generations of houses commencing with the quaint and noble of the sixteenth century and ending with the more fashionable pavilion of our own times his cabinet looked upon a small garden a pleasant transition from the animal within to the vegetable without but one meets with gardens with their verdure and shrubbery and trees in the most unexpected manner in this crowded town  m c received us politely and we found with him one of his somnambules but as she had just come out of a trance we were told she could not be put asleep again that morning our first visit therefore went no farther than some discourse on the subject of animal magnetism and a little practical byplay that shall be related in its place  m c did not attempt ascending to first principles in his explanations animal magnetism was animal magnetismit was a fact and not a theory its effects were not to be doubted they depended on testimony of sufficient validity to dispose of any mere question of authenticity all that he attempted was hypothesis which he invited us to controvert he might as well have desired me to demonstrate that the sun is not a carbuncle on the modus operandi and the powers of his art the doctor was more explicit there were a great many gradations in quality in his somnambules some being better and some worse and there was also a good deal of difference in the intensity of the magnetisers it appears to be settled that the best somnambules are females and the best magnetisers males though the law is not absolute i was flattered with being by nature a firstrate magnetiser and the doctor had not the smallest doubt of his ability to put me to sleep and ability so far as his theory went i thought it was likely enough he might possess though i greatly questioned his physical means  i suppose it is primâ facie evidence of credulity to take the trouble to inquire into the subject at all at any rate it was quite evident i was set down as a good subject from the moment of my appearance even the somnambule testified to this though she would not then consent to be put into a trance in order to give her opinion its mystical sanction  the powers of a really good somnambule are certainly of a very respectable class if a lock of hair be cut from the head of an invalid and sent a hundred leagues from the provinces such a somnambule properly magnetised becomes gifted with the faculty to discover the seat of the disease however latent and by practice she may even prescribe the remedy though this is usually done by a physician like m c who is regularly graduated the somnambule is properly only versed in pathology any other skill she may discover being either a consequence of this knowledge or the effects of observation and experience the powers of a somnambule extend equally to the morale as well as to the physique in this respect a phrenologist is a pure quack in comparison with a lady in a trance the latter has no dependence on bumps and organs but she looks right through you at a glance and pronounces ex cathedrâ whether you are a rogue or an honest man a welldisposed or an evildisposed child of adam in this particular it is an invaluable science and it is a thousand pities all young women were not magnetised before they pronounce the fatal vows as not a few of them would probably wake up and cheat the parson of his fee our sex is difficult to be put asleep and are so obstinate that i doubt if they would be satisfied with a shadowy glimpse of the temper and dispositions of their mistresses  you may possibly think i am trifling with you and that i invent as i write on the contrary i have not related one half of the miraculous powers which being magnetised imparts to the thoroughly good somnambule as they were related to me by m c and vouched for by four or five of his patients who were present as well as by my own companion a firm believer in the doctrine m c added that somnambules improve by practice as well as magnetisers and that he has such command over one of his somnambules that he can put her to sleep by a simple effort of the will although she may be in her own apartment in an adjoining street he related the story of m cloquet and the cancer with great unction and asked me what i thought of that upon my word i did not very well know what i did think of it unless it was to think it very queer it appeared to me to be altogether extraordinary especially as i knew m cloquet to be a man of talents and believe him to be honest  by this time i was nearly magnetised with secondhand facts and i became a little urgent for one or two that were visible to my own sense i was promised more testimony and a sight of the process of magnetising some water that a patient was to drink this patient was present the very type of credulity he listened to everything that fell from m c with a gusto and a faith that might have worked miracles truly had it been of the right sort now and then turning his goodhumoured marveleating eyes on me as much as to say what do you think of that now my companion told me in english he was a man of good estate and of proved philanthropy who had no more doubt of the efficacy of animal magnetism than i had of my being in the room he had brought with him two bottles of water and these m c magnetised by pointing his fingers at their orifices rubbing their sides and ringing his hands about them as if washing them in order to disengage the subtle fluid that was to impart to them their healing properties for the patient drank no other water  presently a young man came in of a good countenance and certainly of a very respectable exterior as the somnambule had left us and this person could not consult her which was his avowed intention in coming m c proposed to let me see his own power as a magnetiser in an experiment on this patient the young man consenting the parties were soon prepared m c began by telling me that he would by a transfusion of his will into the body of the patient compel him to sit still although his own desire should be to rise in order to achieve this he placed himself before the young man and threw off the fluid from his fingers ends which he kept in a cluster by constant forward gestures of the arms sometimes he held the fingers pointed at some particular part of the body the heart in preference though the brain would have been more poetical the young man certainly did not rise neither did i nor any one else in the room as this experiment appeared so satisfactory to everybody else i was almost ashamed to distrust it easy as it really seemed to sit still with a man flourishing his fingers before ones eyes  i proposed that the doctor should see if he could pin me down in this invisible fashion but this he frankly admitted he did not think he could do so soon though he foresaw i would become a firm believer in the existence of animal magnetism ere long and a public supporter of its wonders in time he did not doubt his power to work the same miracle on me he then varied the experiment by making the young man raise his arm contrary to his wishes the same process was repealed all the fluid being directed at the arm which after a severe trial was slowly raised until it pointed forward like a fingerboard after this he was made to stand up in spite of himself this was the hardest affair of all the doctor throwing off the fluid in handfuls the magnetised refusing for some time to budge an inch at length he suddenly stood up and seemed to draw his breath like one who finally yields after a strong trial of his physical force  nothing certainly is easier than for a young man to sit still and to stand up pretending that he strives internally to resist the desire to do either still if you ask me if i think this was simple collusion i hardly know what to answer it is the easiest solution and yet it did not strike me as being the true one i never saw less of the appearance of deception than in the air of this young man his face deportment and acts being those of a person in sober earnest he made no professions was extremely modest and really seemed anxious not to have the experiments tried to my question if he resisted the will of m c he answered as much as he could and said that when he rose he did it because he could not help himself i confess myself disposed to believe in his sincerity and good faith  i had somewhat of a reputation when a boy of effecting my objects by pure dint of teasing many is the shilling i have abstracted in this way from my mothers purse who constantly affirmed that it was sore against her will now it seems to me that m c may very easily have acquired so much command over a credulous youth as to cause him to do things of this nature as he may fancy against his own will signs are the substitutes of words which of themselves are purely conventional and in his case the flourishing of the fingers are merely so many continued solicitations to get up when the confirmation of a theory that is already received and which is doubly attractive by its mysticisms depends in some measure on the result the experiment becomes still less likely to fail it is stripping one of all pretensions to be a physiognomist to believe that this young man was not honest and i prefer getting over the difficulty in this way as to the operator himself he might or might not be the dupe of his own powers if the former i think it would on the whole render him the more likely to succeed with his subject  after a visit or two i was considered sufficiently advanced to be scientifically examined one of the very best of the somnambules was employed on the occasion and everything being in readiness she was put to sleep there was a faithshaking brevity in this process which to say the least if not fraudulent was illjudged the doctor merely pointed his fingers at her once or twice looking her intently in the eye and the woman gaped this success was followed up by a flourish or two of the hand and the woman slept or was magnetised now this was hardly sufficient even for my theory of the influence of the imagination one could have wished the somnambule had not been so drowsy but there she was with her eyes shut giving an occasional hearty gape and the doctor declared her perfectly lit for service she retained her seat however moved her body laughed talked and in all other respects seemed to be precisely the woman she was before he pointed his fingers at her at first i felt a disposition to manifest that more parade was indispensable to humbugging me who am not the pope you will remember but reflection said the wisest way was to affect a little faith as the surest means of securing more experiments moreover i am not certain on the whole that the simplicity of the operation is not in favour of the sincerity of the parties for were deception deliberately planned it would be apt to call in the aid of more mummery and this particularly in a case in which there was probably a stronger desire than usual to make a convert  i gave the somnambule my hand and the examination was commenced forthwith i was first physically inspected and the report was highly favourable to the condition of the animal i had the satisfaction of hearing from this high authority that the whole machinery of the mere material man was in perfect order everything working well and in its proper place this was a little contrary to my own experience it is true but as i had no means of seeing the interior clockwork of my own frame like the somnambule had i ventured to raise a doubt it would have been overturned by the evidence of one who had ocular proofs of what she said and should beyond question have incurred the ridicule of being accounted a malade imaginaire  modesty must prevent my recording all that this obliging somnambule testified to on the subject of my morale her account of the matter was highly satisfactory and i must have been made of stone not to credit her and her mysticisms m c looked at me again and again with an air of triumph as much as to say what do you think of all that noware you not really the noble honest virtuous disinterested brave creature she has described you to be i can assure you it required no little selfdenial to abstain from becoming a convert to the whole system as it is very unusual to find a man with a good head who has not a secret inclination to believe in phrenology so does he who is thus purified by the scrutiny of animal magnetism feel disposed to credit its mysterious influence certainly i might have gaped in my turn and commenced the moral and physical dissection of the somnambule whose hand i held and no one could have given me the lie for nothing is easier than to speak ex cathedrâ when one has a monopoly of knowledge  encouraged by this flattering account of my own condition i begged hard for some more indisputable evidence of the truth of the theory i carried a stopwatch and as i had taken an opportunity to push the stop on entering the room i was particularly desirous that the somnambule should tell me the time indicated by its hands a common test of their powers i had been told but to this m c objected referring everything of this tangible nature to future occasions in fine i could get nothing during three or four visits but pretty positive assertions expressions of wonder that i should affect to doubt what had been so often and so triumphantly proved to others accounts physical and moral like the one of which i had been the subject myself and which did not admit of either confirmation or refutation and oftenrepeated declarations that the time was not distant when in my own unworthy person i was to become one of the most powerful magnetisers of the age all this did very well to amuse but very little towards convincing and i was finally promised that at my next visit the somnambule would be prepared to show her powers in a way that would not admit of cavil  i went to the appointed meeting with a good deal of curiosity to learn the issue and a resolution not to be easily duped when i presented myself i believe it was the fourth visit m c gave me a sealed paper that was not to be opened for several weeks and which he said contained the prediction of an event that was to occur to myself between the present time and the day set for the opening of the letter and which the somnambule had been enabled to foresee in consequence of the interest she took in me and mine with this sealed revelation then i was obliged to depart to await the allotted hour  m c had promised to be present at the opening of the seal but he did not appear i dealt fairly by him and the cover was first formally removed on the evening of the day endorsed on its back as the one when it would be permitted the somnambule had foretold that in the intervening time one of my children would be seriously ill that i should magnetise it and the child would recover nothing of the sort had occurred no one of the family had been ill i had not attempted to magnetise any one or even dreamed of it and of course the whole prediction was a complete failure  to do m c justice when he heard the result he manifested surprise rather than any less confident feeling i was closely questioned first as to whether either of the family had not been ill and secondly whether i had not felt a secret desire to magnetise any one of them to all these interrogatories truth compelled me to give unqualified negatives i had hardly thought of the subject during the whole time as this interview took place at my own house politeness compelled me to pass the matter off as lightly as possible there happened to be several ladies present however the evening m c called and thinking the occasion a good one for him to try his powers on some one besides his regular somnambules i invited him to magnetise any one of the party who might be disposed to submit to the process to this he made no difficulty choosing an english female friend as the subject of the experiment the lady in question raised no objection and the doctor commenced with great zeal and with every appearance of faith in his own powers no effect however was produced on this lady or on one or two more of the party all of whom obstinately refused even to gape m c gave the matter up and soon after took his leave and thus closed my personal connexion with animal magnetism  if you ask me for the conclusions i have drawn from these facts i shall be obliged to tell you that i am in doubt how far the parties concerned deceived others and how far they deceived themselves it is difficult to discredit entirely all the testimony that has been adduced in behalf of this power and one is consequently obliged to refer all the established facts to the influence of the imagination then testimony itself is but a precarious thing different eyes seeing the same objects in different lights  let us take ventriloquism as a parallel case to that of animal magnetism ventriloquism is neither more nor less than imitation and yet aided by the imagination perhaps a majority of those who know anything about it are inclined to believe there is really such a faculty as that which is vulgarly attributed to ventriloquism the whole art of the ventriloquist consists in making such sounds as would be produced by a person or thing that should be actually in the circumstances that he wishes to represent let there be for instance five or six sitting around a table in a room with a single door a ventriloquist among them wishes to mislead his companions by making them believe that another is applying for admission all he has to do is to make a sound similar to that which a person on the outside would make in applying for admission open the door and let me in uttered in such a manner would deceive any one who was not prepared for the experiment simply because men do not ordinarily make such sounds when sitting near each other because the words themselves would draw the attention to the door and because the sounds would be suited to the fictitious application if there were two doors the person first moving his head towards one of them would probably give a direction to the imaginations of all the others unless indeed the ventriloquist himself by his words or his own movements as is usually the case should assume the initiative every ventriloquist takes especial care to direct the imagination of his listener to the desired point either by what he says by some gesture or by some movement such undeniably is the fact in regard to ventriloquism for we know enough of the philosophy of sound to be certain it can he nothing else one of the best ventriloquists of this age after affecting to resist this explanation of his mystery candidly admitted to me on finding that i stuck to the principles of reason that all his art consisted of no more than a power to control the imagination by imitation supported occasionally by acting and yet i once saw this man literally turn a whole family out of doors in a storm by an exercise of his art on that occasion so complete was the delusion that the good people of the house actually fancied sounds which came from the ventriloquist came from a point considerably beyond the place where they stood and on the side opposite to that occupied by the speaker although they stood at the top of a flight of steps and he stood at the bottom all this time the sounds appeared to me to come from the place whence by the laws of sound except in cases of reverberation and of the influence of the imagination they only could appear to come or in other words from the mouth of the ventriloquist himself now if the imagination can effect so much even in crowded assemblies composed of people of all degrees of credulity intelligence and strength of mind and when all are prepared in part at least for the delusion what may it not be expected to produce on minds peculiarly suited to yield to its influence and this too when the prodigy takes the captivating form of mysticism and miracles  in the case of the patient of m cloquet we are reduced to the alternatives of denying the testimony of believing that recourse was had to drugs of referring all to the force of the imagination or of admitting the truth of the doctrine of animal magnetism the character of m cloquet and the motiveless folly of such a course compel us to reject the first the second can hardly be believed as the patient had not the appearance of being drugged and the possession of such a secret would be almost as valuable as the art in question itself the doctrine of animal magnetism we cannot receive on account of the want of uniformity and exactitude in the experiments and i think we are fairly driven to take refuge in the force of the imagination before doing this however we ought to make considerable allowances for exaggerations colouring and the different manner in which men are apt to regard the same thing my young american friend who did believe in animal magnetism viewed several of the facts i have related with eyes more favourable than mine although even he was compelled to allow that m c had much greater success with himself than with your humble servant     letter xxiii   preparations for departuremy consulateleave parispicardycressymontreuilgate of calaisport of calaismagical words   to r cooper esq cooperstown  we entered france in july 1826 and having remained in and about the french capital until february 1828 we thought it time to change the scene paris is effectually the centre of europe and a residence in it is the best training an american can have previously to visiting the other parts of that quarter of the world its civilisation usages and facilities take the edge off our provincial admiration remove prejudices and prepare the mind to receive new impressions with more discrimination and tact i would advise all our travellers to make this their first stage and then to visit the north of europe before crossing the alps or the pyrenees most people however hurry into the south with a view to obtain the best as soon as possible but it is with this as in most of our enjoyments a too eager indulgence defeats its own aim  we had decided to visit london where the season or winter would soon commence the necessary arrangements were made and we sent round our cards of ppc and obtained passports on the very day we were to quit paris an american friend wrote me a note to say that a young connexion of his was desirous of going to london and begged a place for her in my carriage it is i believe a peculiar and a respectable trait in the national character that we so seldom hesitate about asking or acceding to favours of this sort whenever woman is concerned our own sex yield and usually without murmuring at all events it was so with w who cheerfully gave up his seat in the carriage to miss  in order to take one in the coupé of the diligence the notice was so short and the hour so late that there was no time to get a passport for him and as he was included in mine i was compelled to run the risk of sending him to the frontiers without one i was a consul at the timea titular one as to duties but in reality as much of a consul as if i had ever visited my consulate34 the only official paper i possessed in connexion with the office the commission and exequatur excepted was a letter from the préfet of the rhône acknowledging the receipt of the latter as this was strictly a french document i gave it to w as proof of my identity accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons why he was without a passport begging the authorities at need to let him pass as far as the frontier where i should be in season to prove his character this statement i signed as consul instructing w to show it if applied to for a passport and if the gendarmes disavowed me to show the letter by way of proving who i was the expedient was clumsy enough but it was the best that offered  footnote 34 there being so strong a propensity to cavil at american facts lest this book might fall into european hands it may be well to explain a little the consulate of the writer was given to him solely to avoid the appearance of going over to the enemy during his residence abroad the situation conferred neither honour nor profit there being no salary and in his case not fees enough to meet the expense of the office opened by a deputy the writer suspects he was much too true to the character and principles of his native country to be voluntarily selected by its government as the object of its honours or rewards and it is certain he never solicited either there are favours it would seem that are reserved in america for those who most serve the interests of her enemies a day of retribution will come  this arrangement settled we got into the carriage and took our leave of paris before quitting the town however i drove round to the rue danjou to take my leave of general lafayette this illustrious man had been seriously ill for some weeks and i had many doubts of my ever seeing him again he did not conceive himself to be in any danger however but spoke of his speedy recovery as a matter of course and made an engagement with me for the ensuing summer i bade him adieu with a melancholy apprehension that i should never see him again  we drove through the gates of paris amid the dreariness of a winters evening you are to understand that everybody quits london and paris just as night sets in i cannot tell you whether this is caprice or whether it is a usage that has arisen from a wish to have the day in town and a desire to relieve the monotony of roads so often travelled by sleep but so it is we did not fall into the fashion simply because it is a fashion but the days are so short in february in these high latitudes that we could not make our preparations earlier  i have little agreeable to say concerning the first forty miles of the journey it rained and the roads were as usual slippery with mud and full of holes the old pavés are beginning to give way however and we actually got a bit of terre within six posts of paris this may be considered a triumph of modern civilisation for whatever may be said and sung in favour of appian ways and roman magnificence a more cruel invention for travellers and carriagewheels than these pavés was never invented a real paris winters day is the most uncomfortable of all weather if you walk no device of leather will prevent the moisture from penetrating to your heart if you ride it is but an affair of mud and gras de paris we enjoyed all this until nine at night by which time we had got enough of it and in beauvais instead of giving the order à la poste the postilion was told to go to an inn a warm supper and good beds put us all in goodhumour again  in putting into the mouth of falstaff the words shall i not take mine ease in mine inn shakspeare may have meant no more than the drowsy indolence of a glutton but they recur to me with peculiar satisfaction whenever i get unbooted and with a full stomach before the warm fire of an hotel after a fatiguing and chilling days work if any man doubt whether providence has not dealt justly by all of us in rendering our enjoyments dependent on comparative rather than on positive benefits let him travel through a dreary day and take his comfort at night in a house where everything is far below his usual habits and learn to appreciate the truth the sweetest sleep i have ever had has been caught on deck in the middle watch under a wet peejacket and with a coil of rope for a pillow  our next days work carried us as far as abbeville in picardy here we had a capital supper of game in a room that set us all shivering with good honest cold the beds as usual were excellent the country throughout all this part of france is tame and monotonous with wide reaches of grainlands that are now brown and dreary here and there a wood and the usual villages of dirty stonehouses we passed a few hamlets however that were more than commonly rustic and picturesque and in which the dwellings seemed to be of mud and were thatched as they were mostly very irregular in form the street winding through them quite prettily they would have been good in their way had there been any of the simple expedients of taste to relieve their poverty but the french peasants of this province appear to think of little else but their wants there was occasionally a venerable and generous old vine clinging about the door however to raise some faint impressions of happiness  we passed through or near the field of cressy by the aid of the books we fancied we could trace the positions of the two armies but it was little more than very vague conjecture there was a mead a breadth of field well adapted to cavalry and a wood the river is a mere brook and could have offered but little protection or resistance to the passage of any species of troops i saw no village and we may not have been within a mile of the real field after all quite likely no one knows where it is it is very natural that the precise sites of great events should be lost though our own history is so fresh and full that to us it is apt to appear extraordinary in a conversation with a gentleman of the stanley family lately i asked him if lathamhouse so celebrated for its siege in the civil wars was still in the possession of its ancient proprietors i was told it no longer existed and that until quite recently its positive site was a disputed point and one which had only been settled by the discovery of a hole in a rock in which shot had been cast during the siege and which hole was known to have formerly been in a court it is no wonder that doubts exist as to the identity of homer or the position of troy  we have anglicised the word cressy which the french term crécy or to give it a true picard orthography créci most of the names that have this termination are said to be derived from this province many of them have become english and have undergone several changes in the spelling tracy or tracey de courcy or de courcey montmorency and lacy or lacey were once traci courci montmorenci and laci 35 the french get over the disgrace of their ancient defeats very ingeniously by asserting that the english armies of old were principally composed of norman soldiers and that the chivalrous nobility which performed such wonders were of purely norman blood the latter was probably more true than the former  footnote 35 the celebrated sir william draper was once present when the subject turned on the descent of families and the changes that names underwent now my own is a proof of what i say he continued with the intention to put an end to a discourse that was getting to savour of family pride my family being directly derived from king pepin how do you make that out sir william by selfevident orthographical testimony as you may seepepin pipkin napkin diaper draper  as we drew nearer to the coast the country became more varied montreuil and samer are both fortified and one of these places standing on an abrupt rocky eminence is quite picturesque and quaint but we did not stop to look at anything very minutely pushing forward as fast as three horses could draw us for the end of our journey a league or two from boulogne we were met by a halfdozen mounted runners from the different inns each inviting us to give our custom to his particular employer these fellows reminded me of the wheatrunners on the hill at albany though they were as much more clamorous and earnest as a noisy protestationmaking frenchman is more obtrusive than a shrewd quiet calculating yankee we did not stop in boulogne to try how true were the voluble representations of these gentry but changing horses at the post went our way the town seemed full of english and we gazed about us with some curiosity at a place that has become so celebrated by the great demonstration of napoleon there is a high monument standing at no great distance from the town to commemorate one of his military parades the port is small and crowded like most of the harbours on both sides of the channel  we had rain and chills and darkness for the three or four posts that succeeded the country grew more and more tame until after crossing an extensive plain of moist meadowland we passed through the gate of calais i know no place that will give you a more accurate notion of this celebrated port than powles hook it is however necessary to enlarge the scale greatly for calais is a town of some size and the hommock on which it stands and the low land by which it is environed are much more considerable in extent than the spot just named  we drove to the inn that sterne has immortalised or one at least that bears the same name and found english comfort united with french cookery and french taste after all i do not know why i may not say french comforts too for in many respects they surpass their island neighbours even in this feature of domestic comfort it is a comfort to have a napkin even when eating a muffin to see ones self entire in a mirror instead of edging the form into it or out of it sideways to drink good coffee to eat good côtelettes and to be able to wear the same linen for a day without having it soiled the bible says comfort me with flagons or apples i really forget whichand if either of these is to be taken as authority a côtelette may surely be admitted into the carte de conforts  we found calais a clear town and pressing a certain medium aspect that was as much english as french the position is strong though i was not much struck with the strength of the works england has no motive to wish to possess it now that conquest on the continent is neither expedient nor possible the port is good for nothing in a warlike sense except to protect a privateer or two though the use of steam will probably make it of more importance in any future war than it has been for the last two centuries  we found w safely arrived at one of the frontier towns he had been asked for his passport and in his fright he gave the letter of the préfet of the rhône instead of the explanation i had so cleverly devised this letter commenced with the words monsieur le consul in large letters and occupying according to french etiquette nearly half of the first page the gendarme a vieux moustache held his lantern up to read it and seeing this ominous title it would seem that napoleon and marengo and all the glories of the consulate arose in his imagination he got no further than those three words which he pronounced aloud and then folding the letter he returned it with a profound bow asking no further questions as the diligence drove on w heard him say apparemment vous avez un homme trèsconsidérable làdedans monsieur le conducteur so much for our fears for passports and for gendarmes  we went to bed with the intention of embarking for england in the morning  the end
