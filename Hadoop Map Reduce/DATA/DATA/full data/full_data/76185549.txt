cultivationrabbitwarrens on the   downsbarrows obliterated by the plough and by rabbits   wiltshire looks large on the map of england a great green county yet it never appears to be a favourite one to those who go on rambles in the land at all events i am unable to bring to mind an instance of a lover of wiltshire who was not a native or a resident or had not been to marlborough and loved the country on account of early associations nor can i regard myself as an exception since owing to a certain kind of adaptiveness in me a sense of being at home wherever grass grows i am in a way a native too again listen to any halfdozen of your friends discussing the places they have visited or intend visiting comparing notes about the counties towns churches castles sceneryall that draws them and satisfies their nature and the chances are that they will not even mention wiltshire they all know it in a way they have seen salisbury cathedral and stonehenge which everybody must go to look at once in his life and they have also viewed the country from the windows of a railroad carriage as they passed through on their flight to bath and to wales with its mountains and to the west country which many of us love best of allsomerset devon and cornwall for there is nothing striking in wiltshire at all events to those who love nature first nor mountains nor sea nor anything to compare with the places they are hastening to west or north the downs yes the downs are there full in sight of your window in their flowing forms resembling vast pale green waves wave beyond wave in fluctuation fixed a fine country to walk on in fine weather for all those who regard the mere exercise of walking as sufficient pleasure but to those who wish for something more these downs may be neglected since if downs are wanted there is the higher nobler sussex range within an hour of london there are others on whom the naked aspect of the downs has a repelling effect like gilpin they love not an undecorated earth and false and ridiculous as gilpins taste may seem to me and to all those who love the chalk which spoils everything as gilpin said he certainly expresses a feeling common to those who are unaccustomed to the emptiness and silence of these great spaces  as to walking on the downs one remembers that the fine days are not so many even in the season when they are looked forthey have certainly been few during this wet and discomfortable one of 1909 it is indeed only on the chalk hills that i ever feel disposed to quarrel with this english climate for all weathers are good to those who love the open air and have their special attractions what a pleasure it is to be out in rough weather in october when the equinoctial gales are on the wind euroclydon to listen to its roaring in the bending trees to watch the dead leaves flying the pestilencestricken multitudes yellow and black and red whirled away in flight on flight before the volleying blast and to hear and see and feel the tempests of rain the big silvergrey drops that smite you like hail and what pleasure too in the still grey november weather the time of suspense and melancholy before winter a strange quietude like a sense of apprehension in nature and so on through the revolving year in all places in all weathers there is pleasure in the open air except on these chalk hills because of their bleak nakedness there the wind and driving rain are not for but against you and may overcome you with misery one feels their loneliness monotony and desolation on many days sometimes even when it is not wet and i here recall an amusing encounter with a birdscarer during one of these dreary spells  it was in march bitterly cold with an east wind which had been blowing many days and overhead the sky was of a hard steely grey i was cycling along the valley of the ebble and finally leaving it pushed up a long steep slope and set off over the high plain by a dusty road with the wind hard against me a more desolate scene than the one before me it would be hard to imagine for the land was all ploughed and stretched away before me an endless succession of vast grey fields divided by wire fences on all that space there was but one living thing in sight a human form a boy far away on the left side standing in the middle of a big field with something which looked like a gun in his hand immediately after i saw him he too appeared to have caught sight of me for turning he set off running as fast as he could over the ploughed ground towards the road as if intending to speak to me the distance he would have to run was about a quarter of a mile and i doubted that he would be there in time to catch me but he ran fast and the wind was against me and he arrived at the road just as i got to that point there by the side of the fence he stood panting from his race his handsome face glowing with colour a boy about twelve or thirteen with a fine strong figure remarkably well dressed for a birdscarer for that was what he was and he carried a queer heavylooking old gun i got off my wheel and waited for him to speak but he was silent and continued regarding me with the smiling countenance of one well pleased with himself well i said but there was no answer he only kept on smiling  what did you want i demanded impatiently  i didnt want anything  but you started running here as fast as you could the moment you caught sight of me  yes i did  well what did you do it forwhat was your object in running here  just to see you pass he answered  it was a little ridiculous and vexed me at first but by and by when i left him after some more conversation i felt rather pleased for it was a new and somewhat flattering experience to have any person run a long distance over a ploughed field burdened with a heavy gun just to see me pass  but it was not strange in the circumstances his hours in that grey windy desolation must have seemed like days and it was a break in the monotony a little joyful excitement in getting to the road in time to see a passerby more closely and for a few moments gave him a sense of human companionship i began even to feel a little sorry for him alone there in his high dreary world but presently thought he was better off and better employed than most of his fellows poring over miserable books in school and i wished we had a more rational system of education for the agricultural districts one which would not keep the children shut up in a room during all the best hours of the day when to be out of doors seeing hearing and doing would fit them so much better for the lifework before them squeers method was a wiser one we think less of it than of the delightful caricature which makes squeers a joy for ever as mr lang has said of pecksniff but dickens was a londoner and incapable of looking at this or any other question from any other than the londoners standpoint can you have a better system for the children of all england than this one which will turn out the most perfect drapers assistant in oxford street or to go higher the most efficient mr guppy in a solicitors office it is true that we have natures unconscious intelligence against us that by and by when at the age of fourteen the boy is finally released she will set to work to undo the wrong by discharging from his mind its accumulations of useless knowledge as soon as he begins the work of life but what a waste of time and energy and money one can only hope that the slow intellect of the country will wake to this question some day that the countryman will say to the townsman go on making your laws and systems of education for your own children who will live as you do indoors while i shall devise a different one for mine one which will give them hard muscles and teach them to raise the mutton and pork and cultivate the potatoes and cabbages on which we all feed  to return to the downs their very emptiness and desolation which frightens the stranger from them only serves to make them more fascinating to those who are intimate with and have learned to love them that dreary aspect brings to mind the other one when on waking with the early sunlight in the room you look out on a blue sky cloudless or with white clouds it may be fancy or the effect of contrast but it has always seemed to me that just as the air is purer and fresher on these chalk heights than on the earth below and as the water is of a more crystal purity and the sky perhaps bluer so do all colours and all sounds have a purity and vividness and intensity beyond that of other places i see it in the yellows of hawkweed rockrose and birdsfoottrefoil in the innumerable specks of brilliant colourblue and white and roseof milkwort and squinancywort and in the large flowers of the dwarf thistle glowing purple in its green setting and i hear it in every birdsound in the trivial songs of yellowhammer and cornbunting and of dunnock and wren and whitethroat  the pleasure of walking on the downs is not however a subject which concerns me now it is one i have written about in a former work nature in downland descriptive of the south downs the theme of the present work is the life human and other of the south wiltshire downs or of salisbury plain it is the part of wiltshire which has most attracted me most persons would say that the marlborough downs are greater more like the great sussex range as it appears from the weald but chance brought me farther south and the character and life of the village people when i came to know them made this appear the best place to be in  the plain itself is not a precisely denned area and may be made to include as much or little as will suit the writers purpose if you want a continuous plain with no dividing valley cutting through it you must place it between the avon and wylye rivers a distance about fifteen miles broad and as many long with the village of tilshead in its centure or if you dont mind the valleys you can say it extends from downton and tollard royal south of salisbury to the pewsey vale in the north and from the hampshire border on the east side to dorset and somerset on the west about twentyfive to thirty miles each way my own range is over this larger salisbury plain which includes the river ebble or ebele with its numerous interesting villages from odstock and combe bisset near salisbury and the chalks to pretty alvediston near the dorset line and all those in the nadder valley and westward to white sheet hill above mere you can picture this high chalk country as an open hand the left hand with salisbury in the hollow of the palm placed nearest the wrist and the five valleys which cut through it as the five spread fingers from the bourne the little finger succeeded by avon wylye and nadder to the ebble which comes in lower down as the thumb and has its junction with the main stream below salisbury  a very large portion of this high country is now in a transitional state that was once a sheepwalk and is now a training ground for the army where the sheep are taken away the turf loses the smooth elastic character which makes it better to walk on than the most perfect lawn the sheep fed closely and everything that grew on the downgrasses clovers and numerous small creeping herbshad acquired the habit of growing and flowering close to the ground every species and each individual plant striving with the unconscious intelligence that is in all growing things to hide its leaves and pushing sprays under the others to escape the nibbling teeth by keeping closer to the surface there are grasses and some herbs the plantain among them which keep down very close but must throw up a tall stem to flower and seed look at the plantain when its flowering time comes each particular plant growing with its leaves so close down on the surface as to be safe from the busy searching mouths then all at once throwing up tall straight stems to flower and ripen its seeds quickly watch a flock at this time and you will see a sheep walking about rapidly plucking the flowering spikes cutting them from the stalk with a sharp snap taking them off at the rate of a dozen or so in twenty seconds but the sheep cannot be all over the downs at the same time and the time is short myriads of plants throwing up their stems at once so that many escape and it has besides a deep perennial root so that the plant keeps its own life though it may be unable to sow any seeds for many seasons so with other species which must send up a tall flower stem and by and by the flowering over and the seeds ripened or lost the dead scattered stems remain like long hairs growing out of a close fur the turf remains unchanged but take the sheep away and it is like the removal of a pressure or a danger the plant recovers liberty and confidence and casts off the old habit it springs and presses up to get the better of its fellowsto get all the dew and rain and sunshine that it canand the result is a rough surface  another effect of the military occupation is the destruction of the wild life of the plain but that is a matter i have written about in my last book afoot in england in a chapter on stonehenge and need not dwell on here to the lover of salisbury plain as it was the sight of military camps with white tents or zinc houses and of bodies of men in khaki marching and drilling and the sound of guns now informs him that he is in a district which has lost its attraction where nature has been dispossessed  meanwhile there is a corresponding change going on in the human life of the district let anyone describe it as he thinks best as an improvement or a deterioration it is a great change nevertheless which in my case and probably that of many others is as disagreeable to contemplate as that which we are beginning to see in the down which was once a sheepwalk and is so no longer on this account i have ceased to frequent that portion of the plain where the war office is in possession of the land and to keep to the southern side in my rambles out of sight and hearing of the whitetented camps and mimic warfare here is salisbury plain as it has been these thousand years past or ever since sheep were pastured here more than in any other district in england and that may well date even more than ten centuries back  undoubtedly changes have taken place even here some very great chiefly during the last or from the late eighteenth century changes both in the land and the animal life wild and domestic of the losses in wild bird life there will be something to say in another chapter they relate chiefly to the extermination of the finest species the big bird especially the soaring bird which is now gone out of all this wide wiltshire sky as a naturalist i must also lament the loss of the old wiltshire breed of sheep although so long gone once it was the only breed known in wilts and extended over the entire county it was a big animal the largest of the finewoolled sheep in england but for looks it certainly compared badly with modern downland breeds and possessed it was said all the points which the breeder or improver was against thus its head was big and clumsy with a round nose its legs were long and thick its belly without wool and both sexes were horned horns even in a ram are an abomination to the modern sheepfarmer in southern england finally it was hard to fatten on the other hand it was a sheep which had been from of old on the bare open downs and was modified to suit the conditions the scanty feed the bleak bare country and the long distances it had to travel to and from the pasture ground it was a strong healthy intelligent animal in appearance and character like the old original breed of sheep on the pampas of south america which i knew as a boy a coarsewoolled sheep with naked belly tall and hardy a greatly modified variety of the sheep introduced by the spanish colonist three centuries ago at all events the old wiltshire sheep had its merits and when the southdown breed was introduced during the late eighteenth century the farmer viewed it with disfavour they liked their old native animal and did not want to lose it but it had to go in time just as in later times the southdown had to go when the hampshire down took its placethe breed which is now universal in south wilts at all events  a solitary flock of the purebred old wiltshire sheep existed in the county as late as 1840 but the breed has now so entirely disappeared from the country that you find many shepherds who have never even heard of it not many days ago i met with a curious instance of this ignorance of the past i was talking to a shepherd a fine intelligent fellow keenly interested in the subjects of sheep and sheepdogs on the high down above the village of broad chalk on the ebble and he told me that his dog was of mixed breed but on its mothers side came from a welsh sheepdog that his father had always had the welsh dog once common in wiltshire and he wondered why it had gone out as it was so good an animal this led me to say something about the old sheep having gone out too and as he had never heard of the old breed i described the animal to him  what i told him he said explained something which had been a puzzle to him for some years there was a deep hollow in the down near the spot where we were standing and at the bottom he said there was an old well which had been used in former times to water the sheep but masses of earth had fallen down from the sides and in that condition it had remained for no one knew how longperhaps fifty perhaps a hundred years some years ago it came into his masters head to have this old well cleaned out and this was done with a good deal of labour the sides having first been boarded over to make it safe for the workmen below at the bottom of the well a vast store of rams horns was discovered and brought out and it was a mystery to the fanner and the men how so large a number of sheeps horns had been got together for rams are few and do not die often and here there were hundreds of horns he understood it now for if all the sheep ewes as well as rams were horned in the old breed a collection like this might easily have been made  the greatest change of the last hundred years is no doubt that which the plough has wrought in the aspect of the downs there is a certain pleasure to the eye in the wide fields of golden corn especially of wheat in july and august but a ploughed down is a down made ugly and it strikes one as a mistake even from a purely economic point of view that this old rich turf the slow product of centuries should be ruined for ever as sheeppasture when so great an extent of uncultivated land exists elsewhere especially the heavy clays of the midlands better suited for corn the effect of breaking up the turf on the high downs is often disastrous the thin soil which was preserved by the close hard turf is blown or washed away and the soil becomes poorer year by year in spite of dressing until it is hardly worth cultivating clover may be grown on it but it continues to deteriorate or the tenant or landlord may turn it into a rabbitwarren the most fatal policy of all how hideous they arethose great stretches of downland enclosed in big wire fences and rabbit netting with little but wiry weeds moss and lichen growing on them the earth dug up everywhere by the disorderly little beasts for a while there is a profitit will serve me my time the owner saysbut the end is utter barrenness  one must lament too the destruction of the ancient earthworks especially of the barrows which is going on all over the downs most rapidly where the land is broken up by the plough one wonders if the everincreasing curiosity of our day with regard to the history of the human race in the land continues to grow what our descendants of the next half of the century to go no farther will say of us and our incredible carelessness in the matter so small a matter to us but one which will perhaps be immensely important to them it is perhaps better for our peace that we do not know it would not be pleasant to have our childrens and childrens childrens contemptuous expressions sounding in our prophetic ears perhaps we have no right to complain of the obliteration of these memorials of antiquity by the plough the living are more than the dead and in this case it may be said that we are only following the artemisian example in consuming in our daily bread minute portions of the ashes of our old relations albeit untearfully with a cheerful countenance still one cannot but experience a shock on seeing the plough driven through an ancient smooth turf curiously marked with barrows lynchetts and other mysterious mounds and depressions where sheep have been pastured for a thousand years without obscuring these chance hieroglyphs scored by men on the surface of the hills  it is not however only on the cultivated ground that the destruction is going on the rabbit too is an active agent in demolishing the barrows and other earthworks he burrows into the mound and throws out bushels of chalk and clay which is soon washed down by the rains he tunnels it through and through and sometimes makes it his village then one day the farmer or keeper who is not an archaeologist comes along and puts his ferrets into the holes and one of them after drinking his fill of blood falls asleep by the side of his victim and the keeper sets to work with pick and shovel to dig him out and demolishes half the barrow to recover his vile little beast     chapter ii  salisbury as i see it    the salisbury of the villagerthe cathedral from the meadowswalks to   wilton and old sarumthe spire and a rainbowcharm of old sarumthe   devastationsalisbury from old sarumlelands descriptionsalisbury   and the village mindmarketdaythe infirmarythe cathedralthe   lesson of a childs desirein the streets againan apollo of the downs   to the dwellers on the plain salisbury itself is an exceedingly important placethe most important in the world for if they have seen a greaterlondon let us sayit has left but a confused a phantasmagoric image on the mind an impression of endless thoroughfares and of innumerable people all apparently in a desperate hurry to do something yet doing nothing a labyrinth of streets and wilderness of houses swarming with beings who have no definite object and no more to do with realities than so many lunatics and are unconfined because they are so numerous that all the asylums in the world could not contain them but of salisbury they have a very clear image inexpressibly rich as it is in sights in wonders full of peoplehundreds of people in the streets and marketplacethey can take it all in and know its meaning every man and woman of all classes in all that concourse is there for some definite purpose which they can guess and understand and the busy street and market and red houses and soaring spire are all one and part and parcel too of their own lives in their own distant little village by the avon or wylye or anywhere on the plain and that soaring spire which rising so high above the red town first catches the eye the one object which gives unity and distinction to the whole picture is not more distinct in the mind than the entire salisbury with its manifold interests and activities  there is nothing in the architecture of england more beautiful than that same spire i have seen it many times far and near from all points of view and am never in or near the place but i go to some spot where i look at and enjoy the sight but i will speak here of the two best points of view  the nearest which is the artists favourite point is from the meadows there from the waterside you have the cathedral not too far away nor too near for a picture whether on canvas or in the mind standing amidst its great old trees with nothing but the moist green meadows and the river between one evening during the late summer of this wettest season when the rain was beginning to cease i went out this way for my stroll the pleasantest if not the only walk there is in salisbury it is true there are two others one to wilton by its long shady avenue the other to old sarum but these are now motorroads and until the loathed hooting and dusting engines are thrust away into roads of their own there is little pleasure in them for the man on foot the rain ceased but the sky was still stormy with a great blackness beyond the cathedral and still other black clouds coming up from the west behind me then the sun near its setting broke out sending a flame of orange colour through the dark masses around it and at the same time flinging a magnificent rainbow on that black cloud against which the immense spire stood wet with rain and flushed with light so that it looked like a spire built of a stone impregnated with silver never had nature so glorified mans work it was indeed a marvellous thing to see an effect so rare that in all the years i had known salisbury and the many times i had taken that stroll in all weathers it was my first experience of such a thing how lucky then was constable to have seen it when he set himself to paint his famous picture and how brave he was and even wise to have attempted such a subject one which i am informed by artists with the brush only a madman would undertake however great a genius he might be it was impossible we know even to a constable but we admire his failure nevertheless even as we admire turners many failures but when we go back to nature we are only too glad to forget all about the picture  the view from the meadows will not in the future i fear seem so interesting to me i shall miss the rainbow and shall never see again except in that treasured image the great spire as constable saw and tried to paint it in like manner though for a different reason my future visits to old sarum will no longer give me the same pleasure experienced on former occasions  old sarum stands over the avon a mile and a half from salisbury a round chalk hill about 300 feet high in its round shape and isolation resembling a stupendous tumulus in which the giants of antiquity were buried its steeply sloping green sides ringed about with vast concentric earthworks and ditches the work of the old people as they say on the plain when referring to the ancient britons but how ancient whether invading celts or aboriginesthe true britons who possessed the land from neolithic timeseven the anthropologists the wise men of today are unable to tell us later it was a roman station one of the most important and in after ages a great norman castle and cathedral city until early in the thirteenth century when the old church was pulled down and a new and better one to last for ever was built in the green plain by many running waters church and people gone the castle fell into ruin though some believe it existed down to the fifteenth century but from that time onwards the site has been a place of historical memories and a wilderness nature had made it a sweet and beautiful spot the earth over the old buried ruins was covered with an elastic turf jewelled with the bright little flowers of the chalk the ramparts and ditches being all overgrown with a dense thicket of thorn holly elder bramble and ash tangled up with ivy briony and travellersjoy once only during the last five or six centuries some slight excavations were made when in 1834 as the result of an excessively dry summer the lines of the cathedral foundations were discernible on the surface but it will no longer be the place it was the society of antiquaries having received permission from the dean and chapter of salisbury to work their sweet will on the site that ancient beautiful carcass which had long made their mouths water on which they have now fallen like a pack of hungry hyenas to tear off the old hide of green turf and burrow down to open to the light or drag out the deep stony framework the beautiful surrounding thickets too must go they tell me since you cannot turn the hill inside out without destroying the trees and bushes that crown it what person who has known it and has often sought that spot for the sake of its ancient associations and of the sweet solace they have found in the solitude or for the noble view of the sacred city from its summit will not deplore this fatal amiability of the authorities this weak desire to please every one and inability to say no to such a proposal  but let me now return to the object which brings me to this spot it was not to lament the loss of the beautiful which cannot be preserved in our ageeven this best one of all which salisbury possessed cannot be preservedbut to look at salisbury from this point of view it is not as from the meadows a view of the cathedral only but of the whole town amidst its circle of vast green downs it has a beautiful aspect from that point a redbrick and redtiled town set low on that circumscribed space whose soft brilliant green is in lovely contrast with the paler hue of the downs beyond the perennial moist green of its watermeadows for many swift clear currents flow around and through salisbury and doubtless in former days there were many more channels in the town itself lelands description is worth quoting there be many fair streates in the cite saresbyri and especially the high streate and castle streate al the streates in a maner in new saresbyri hath little streamlettes and arms derivyd out of avon that runneth through them the site of the very town of saresbyri and much ground thereabout is playne and low and as a pan or receyvor of most part of the waters of wiltshire  on this scene this red town with the great spire set down among watermeadows encircled by paler green chalk hills i look from the top of the inner and highest rampart or earthwork or going a little distance down sit at ease on the turf to gaze at it by the hour nor could a sweeter restingplace be found especially at the time of ripe elderberries when the thickets are purple with their clusters and the starlings come in flocks to feed on them and feeding keep up a perpetual low musical jangle about me  it is not however of new saresbyri as seen by the tourist with a mind full of history archaeology and the aesthetic delight in cathedrals that i desire to write but of salisbury as it appears to the dweller on the plain for salisbury is the capital of the plain the head and heart of all those villages too many to count scattered far and wide over the surrounding country it is the villagers own peculiar city and even as the spot it stands upon is the pan or receyvor of most part of the waters of wiltshire so is it the receyvor of all he accomplishes in his laborious life and thitherward flow all his thoughts and ambitions perhaps it is not so difficult for me as it would be for most persons who are not natives to identify myself with him and see it as he sees it that greater place we have been in that mighty monstrous london is ever present to the mind and is like a mist before the sight when we look at other places but for me there is no such mist no image so immense and persistent as to cover and obscure all others and no such mental habit as that of regarding people as a mere crowd a mass a monstrous organism in and on which each individual is but a cell a scale this feeling troubles and confuses my mind when i am in london where we live too thick but quitting it i am absolutely free it has not entered my soul and coloured me with its colour or shut me out from those who have never known it even of the simplest dwellers on the soil who to our sophisticated minds may seem like beings of another species this is my happinessto feel in all places that i am one with them to say for instance that i am going to salisbury tomorrow and catch the gleam in the childrens eye and watch them furtively watching me whisper to one another that there will be something for them too on the morrow to set out betimes and overtake the early carriers carts on the road each with its little cargo of packages and women with baskets and an old man or two to recognize acquaintances among those who sit in front and as i go on overtaking and passing carriers and the halfgipsy little general dealer in his dirty ramshackle little cart drawn by a rough fasttrotting pony all of us intent on business and pleasure bound for salisburythe great market and emporium and place of all delights for all the great plain i remember that on my very last expedition when i had come twelve miles in the rain and was standing at a street corner wet to the skin waiting for my carrier a man in a hurry said to me i say just keep an eye on my cart for a minute or two while i run round to see somebody ive got some fowls in it and if you see anyone come poking round just ask them what they wantyou cant trust every one ill be back in a minute and he was gone and i was very pleased to watch his cart and fowls till he came back  business is business and must be attended to in fair or foul weather but for business with pleasure we prefer it fine on marketday the one great and chief pleasure in which all participate is just to be there to be in the crowda joyful occasion which gives a festive look to every face the mere sight of it exhilarates like wine the numbersthe people and the animals the carriers carts drawn up in rows on rowscarriers from a hundred little villages on the bourne the avon the wylye the nadder the ebble and from all over the plain each bringing its little contingent hundreds and hundreds more coming by train you see them pouring down fisherton street in a continuous procession all hurrying marketwards and what a lively scene the market presents now full of cattle and sheep and pigs and crowds of people standing round the shouting auctioneers and horses too the beribboned hacks and ponderous draught horses with manes and tails decorated with golden straw thundering over the stone pavement as they are trotted up and down and what a profusion of fruit and vegetables fish and meat and all kinds of provisions on the stalls where women with baskets on their arms are jostling and bargaining the corn exchange is like a huge beehive humming with the noise of talk full of brownfaced farmers in their riding and driving clothes and leggings standing in knots or thrusting their hands into sacks of oats and barley you would think that all the farmers from all the plain were congregated there there is a joyful contagion in it all even the depressed young lover the forlornest of beings repairs his wasted spirits and takes heart again why if ive seen a girl with a pretty face today ive seen a hundredand more and she thinks they be so few she can treat me like that and barely give me a pleasant word in a month let her come to salisbury and see how many there be  and so with every one in that vast assemblagevast to the dweller in the plain each one is present as it were in two places since each has in his or her heart the constant image of homethe little peaceful village in the remote valley of father and mother and neighbours and children in school just now or at play or home to dinnerhome cares and concerns and the business in salisbury the selling and buying friends and relations to visit or to meet in the marketplace andhow oftenthe sick one to be seen at the infirmary this home of the injured and ailing which is in the mind of so many of the people gathered together is indeed the cord that draws and binds the city and the village closest together and makes the two like one  that great comely building of warm red brick in fisherton street set well back so that you can see it as a whole behind its cedar and beechtreeshow familiar it is to the villagers in numberless humble homes in hundreds of villages of the plain and all over the surrounding country the infirmary is a name of the deepest meaning and a place of many gad and tender and beautiful associations i heard it spoken of in a manner which surprised me at first for i know some of the london poor and am accustomed to their attitude towards the metropolitan hospitals the londoner uses them very freely they have come to be as necessary to him as the grocers shop and the publichouse but for all the benefits he receives from them he has no faintest sense of gratitude and it is my experience that if you speak to him of this he is roused to anger and demands what are they for so far is he from having any thankful thoughts for all that has been given him for nothing and done for him and for his if he has anything to say at all on the matter it is to find fault with the hospitals and cast blame on them for not having healed him more quickly or thoroughly  this country town hospital and infirmary is differently regarded by the villagers of the plain it is curious to find how many among them are personally acquainted with it perhaps it is not easy for anyone even in this most healthy district to get through life without sickness and all are liable to accidents the injured or afflicted youth taken straight from his rough hard life and poor cottage wonders at the place he finds himself inthe wide clean airy room and white easy bed the care and skill of the doctors the tender nursing by women and comforts and luxuries all without payment but given as it seems to him out of pure divine love and compassionall this comes to him as something strange almost incredible he suffers much perhaps but can bear pain stoically and forget it when it is past but the loving kindness he has experienced is remembered  that is one of the very great things salisbury has for the villagers and there are many more which may not be spoken of since we do not want to lose sight of the wood on account of the trees only one must be mentioned for a special reason and that is the cathedral the villager is extremely familiar with it as he sees it from the market and the street and from a distance from all the roads which lead him to salisbury seeing it he sees everything beneath itall the familiar places and objects all the streetshigh and castle and crane streets and many others including endless street which reminds one of sydney smiths last flicker of fun before that candle went out and the white hart and the angel and old george and the humbler goat and green man and shoulder of mutton with many besides and the great red building with its cedartree and the knot of men and boys standing on the bridge gazing down on the trout in the swift river below and the marketplace and its busy crowdsall the familiar sights and scenes that come under the spire like a flock of sheep on a burning day in summer grouped about a great tree growing in the pastureland but he is not familiar with the interior of the great fane it fails to draw him doubtless because he has no time in his busy practical life for the cultivation of the aesthetic faculties there is a crust over that part of his mind but it need not always and ever be so the crust is not on the mind of the child  before a stall in the marketplace a child is standing with her mothera commonplacelooking little girl of about twelve blueeyed lighthaired with thin arms and legs dressed poorly enough for her holiday the mother stoutish in her best but muchworn black gown and a brown straw outofshape hat decorated with bits of ribbon and a few soiled and frayed artificial flowers probably she is the wife of a labourer who works hard to keep himself and family on fourteen shillings a week and she too shows in her hard hands and sunburnt face with little wrinkles appearing that she is a hard worker but she is very jolly for she is in salisbury on marketday in fine weather with several shillings in her pursea shilling for the fares and perhaps eightpence for refreshments and the rest to be expended in necessaries for the house and now to increase the pleasure of the day she has unexpectedly run against a friend there they stand the two friends basket on arm right in the midst of the jostling crowd talking in their loud tinny voices at a tremendous rate while the girl with a halfeager halflistless expression stands by with her hand on her mothers dress and every time there is a seconds pause in the eager talk she gives a little tug at the gown and ejaculates mother the woman impatiently shakes off the hand and says sharply what now marty cant ee let me say just a word without bothering and on the talk runs again then another tug and mother and then you promised mother and by and by mother you said youd take me to the cathedral next time  having heard so much i wanted to hear more and addressing the woman i asked her why her child wanted to go she answered me with a goodhumoured laugh tis all because she heard em talking about it last winter and shed never been and i says to her never you mind marty ill take you there the next time i go to salisbury  and shes never forgot it said the other woman  not shemarty aint one to forget  and you been four times mother put in the girl  have i now well tis too late nowhalfpast two and we must bet goat at four  oh mother you promised  well then come along you worriting child and lets have it over or youll give me no peace and away they went and i would have followed to know the result if it had been in my power to look into that young brain and see the thoughts and feelings there as the crystalgazer sees things in a crystal in a vague way with some very early memories to help me i can imagine itthe shock of pleased wonder at the sight of that immense interior that farextending nave with pillars that stand like the tall trunks of pines and beeches and at the end the light screen which allows the eye to travel on through the rich choir to see with fresh wonder and delight high up and far off that glory of coloured glass as of a window halfopen to an unimaginable place beyonda heavenly cathedral to which all this is but a dim porch or passage  we do not properly appreciate the educational value of such early experiences and i use that dismal word not because it is perfectly right or for want of a better one but because it is in everybodys mouth and understood by all for all i know to the contrary village schools may be bundled in and out of the cathedral from time to time but that is not the right way seeing that the childs mind is not the crowdofchildrens mind but i can imagine that when we have a wiser better system of education in the villages in which books will not be everything and to be shut up six or seven hours every day to prevent the children from learning the things that matter mosti can imagine at such a time that the schoolmaster or mistress will say to the village woman i hear you are going to salisbury tomorrow or next tuesday and i want you to take janie or little dan or peter and leave him for an hour to play about on the cathedral green and watch the daws flying round the spire and take a peep inside while you are doing your marketing  back from the cathedral once more from the infirmary and from shops and refreshmenthouses out in the sun among the busy people let us delay a little longer for the sake of our last scene  it was past noon on a hot brilliant day in august and that splendid weather had brought in more people than i had ever before seen congregated in salisbury and never had the people seemed so talkative and merry and full of life as on that day i was standing at a busy spot by a row of carriers carts drawn up at the side of the pavement just where there are three publichouses close together when i caught sight of a young man of about twentytwo or twentythree a shepherd in a grey suit and thick ironshod old boots and brown leggings with a soft felt hat thrust jauntily on the back of his head coming along towards me with that halfslouching halfswinging gait peculiar to the men of the downs especially when they are in the town on pleasure bent decidedly he was there on pleasure and had been indulging in a glass or two of beer perhaps three and was very happy trolling out a song in a pleasant musical voice as he swung along taking no notice of the people stopping and turning round to stare after him or of those of his own party who were following and trying to keep up with him calling to him all the time to stop to wait to go slow and give them a chance there were seven following him a stout middleaged woman then a greyhaired old woman and two girls and last a youngish married woman with a small boy by the hand and the stout woman with a red laughing face cried out oh dave do stop cant ee where be going so fast mandont ee see we cant keep up with ee but he would not stop nor listen it was his day out his great day in salisbury a very rare occasion and he was very happy then she would turn back to the others and cry tisnt no use he wont bide for usdid ee ever see such a boy and laughing and perspiring she would start on after him again  now this incident would have been too trivial to relate had it not been for the appearance of the man himselfhis powerful and perfect physique and marvellously handsome facesuch a face as the old greek sculptors have left to the world to be universally regarded and admired for all time as the most perfect i do not think that this was my feeling only i imagine that the others in that street who were standing still and staring after him had something of the same sense of surprise and admiration he excited in me just then it happened that there was a great commotion outside one of the publichouses where a considerable party of gipsies in their little carts had drawn up and were all engaged in a violent confused altercation probably they or one of them had just disposed of a couple of stolen ducks or a sheepskin or a few rabbits and they were quarrelling over the division of the spoil at all events they were violently excited scowling at each other and one or two in a dancing rage and had collected a crowd of amused lookerson but when the young man came singing by they all turned to stare at him  as he came on i placed myself directly in his path and stared straight into his eyesgrey eyes and very beautiful but he refused to see me he stared through me like an animal when you try to catch its eyes and went by still trolling out his song with all the others streaming after him     chapter iii  winterbourne bishop    a favourite villageisolated situationappearance of the   villagehedgefruitthe winterbournehuman interestthe home   feelingman in harmony with naturehuman bones thrown out by a   rabbita spot unspoiled and unchanged   of the few widely separated villages hidden away among the lonely downs in the large blank spaces between the rivers the one i love best is winterbourne bishop yet of the entire numberi know them all intimatelyi daresay it would be pronounced by most persons the least attractive it has less shade from trees in summer and is more exposed in winter to the bleak winds of this high country from whichever quarter they may blow placed high itself on a wide unwooded valley or depression with the low sloping downs at some distance away the village is about as cold a place to pass a winter in as one could find in this district and it may be added the most inconvenient to live in at any time the nearest town or the easiest to get to being salisbury twelve miles distant by a hilly road the only means of getting to that great centre of life which the inhabitants possess is by the carriers cart which makes the weary fourhours journey once a week on marketday naturally not many of them see that place of delights oftener than once a year and some but once in five or more years  then as to the village itself when you have got down into its one long rather winding street or road this has a green bank five or six feet high on either side on which stand the cottages mostly facing the road real houses there are nonebuildings worthy of being called houses in these great daysunless the three small farmhouses are considered better than cottages and the rather meanlooking rectorythe rector poor man is very poor just in the middle part where the church stands in its green churchyard the shadiest spot in the village a few of the cottages are close together almost touching then farther apart twenty yards or so then farther still forty or fifty yards they are small old cottages a few have seventeenthcentury dates cut on stone tablets on their fronts but the undated ones look equally old some thatched others tiled but none particularly attractive certainly they are without the added charm of a green draperycreeper or ivy rose clematis and honeysuckle and they are also mostly without the cottagegarden flowers unprofitably gay like the blossoming furze but dear to the soul the flowers we find in so many of the villages along the rivers especially in those of the wylye valley to be described in a later chapter  the trees i have said are few though the churchyard is shady where you can refresh yourself beneath its ancient beeches and its one widebranching yew or sit on a tomb in the sun when you wish for warmth and brightness the trees growing by or near the street are mostly ash or beech with a pine or two old but not large and there are small or dwarf yew holly and thorntrees very little fruit is grown two or three to half a dozen apple and damsontrees are called an orchard and one is sorry for the children but in late summer and autumn they get their fruit from the hedges these run up towards the downs on either side of the village at right angles with its street long unkept hedges beautiful with scarlet haws and travellersjoy rich in bramble and elder berries and purple sloes and nutsa thousand times more nuts than the little dormice require for their own modest wants  finally to go back to its disadvantages the village is waterless at all events in summer when water is most wanted water is such a blessing and joy in a villagea joy for ever when it flows throughout the year as at nether stowey and winsford and bourtononthewater to mention but three of all those happy villages in the land which are known to most of us what man on coming to such places and watching the rushing sparkling foaming torrent by day and listening to its splashing gurgling sounds by night does not resolve that he will live in no village that has not a perennial stream in it this unblessed high and dry village has nothing but the winter bourne which gives it its name a sort of surname common to a score or two of villages in wiltshire dorset somerset and hants here the bed of the stream lies by the bank on one side of the village street and when the autumn and early winter rains have fallen abundantly the hidden reservoirs within the chalk hills are filled to overflowing then the water finds its way out and fills the dry old channel and sometimes turns the whole street into a rushing river to the immense joy of the village children they are like ducks hatched and reared at some upland farm where there was not even a muddy pool to dibble in for a season the wet one the village women have water at their own doors and can go out and dip pails in it as often as they want when spring comes it is still flowing merrily trying to make you believe that it is going to flow for ever beautiful green waterloving plants and grasses spring up and flourish along the roadside and you may see comfrey and water forgetmenot in flower pools too have been formed in some deep hollow places they are fringed with tall grasses whitened over with bloom of watercrowfoot and poa grass grows up from the bottom to spread its green tresses over the surface better still by and by a couple of stray moorhens make their appearance in the poolstrange birds coloured glossy olivebrown slashed with white with splendid scarlet and yellow beaks if by some strange chance a shining blue kingfisher were to appear it could not create a greater excitement so much attention do they receive that the poor strangers have no peace of their lives it is a happy time for the children and a good time for the busy housewife who has all the water she wants for cooking and washing and cleaningshe may now dash as many pailfuls over her brick floors as she likes then the clear swift current begins to diminish and scarcely have you had time to notice the change than it is altogether gone the women must go back to the well and let the bucket down and laboriously turn and turn the handle of the windlass till it mounts to the top again the pretty moist green herbage the graceful grasses quickly wither away dust and straws and rubbish from the road lie in the dry channel and by and by it is filled with a summer growth of dock and loveless nettles which no child may touch with impunity  no i cannot think that any person for whom it had no association no secret interest would after looking at this village with its driedup winterbourne care to make his home in it and no person i imagine wants to see it for it has no special attraction and is away from any road at a distance from everywhere i knew a great many villages in salisbury plain and was always adding to their number but there was no intention of visiting this one perhaps there is not a village on the plain or anywhere in wiltshire for that matter which sees fewer strangers then i fell in with the old shepherd whose life will be related in the succeeding chapters and who away from his native place had no story about his past life and the lives of those he had knownno thought in his mind i might almost say which was not connected with the village of winterbourne bishop and many of his anecdotes and reflections proved so interesting that i fell into the habit of putting them down in my notebook until in the end the place itself where he had followed his homely trade so long seeing and feeling so much drew me to it i knew there was nothing to see in it that it was without the usual attractions that there was in fact nothing but the human interest but that was enough so i came to it to satisfy an idle curiosityjust to see how it would accord with the mental picture produced by his description of it i came i may say prepared to like the place for the sole but sufficient reason that it had been his home had it not been for this feeling he had produced in me i should not i imagine have cared to stay long in it as it was i did stay then came again and found that it was growing on me i wondered why for the mere interest in the old shepherds life memories did not seem enough to account for this deepening attachment it began to seem to me that i liked it more and more because of its very barrennessthe entire absence of all the features which make a place attractive noble scenery woods and waters deer parks and old houses tudor elizabethan jacobean stately and beautiful full of art treasures ancient monuments and historical associations there were none of these things there was nothing here but that wide vacant expanse very thinly populated with humble rural folkfarmers shepherds labourersliving in very humble houses england is so full of riches in ancient monuments and grand and interesting and lovely buildings and objects and scenes that it is perhaps too rich for we may get into the habit of looking for such things expecting them at every turn every mile of the way  i found it a relief at winterbourne bishop to be in a country which had nothing to draw a man out of a town a wide empty land with nothing on it to look at but a furzebush or when i had gained the summit of the down and to get a little higher still stood on the top of one of its many barrows a sight of the distant village its low grey or reddishbrown cottages half hidden among its few trees the square stone tower of its little church looking at a distance no taller than a milestone that emptiness seemed good for both mind and body i could spend long hours idly sauntering or sitting or lying on the turf thinking of nothing or only of one thingthat it was a relief to have no thought about anything  but no something was secretly saying to me all the time that it was more than what i have said which continued to draw me to this vacant placemore than the mere relief experienced on coming back to nature and solitude and the freedom of a wide earth and sky i was not fully conscious of what the something more was until after repeated visits on each occasion it was a pleasure to leave salisbury behind and set out on that long hilly road and the feeling would keep with me all the journey even in bad weather sultry or cold or with the wind hard against me blowing the white chalk dust into my eyes from the time i left the turnpike to go the last two and a half to three miles by the sideroad i would gaze eagerly ahead for a sight of my destination long before it could possibly be seen until on gaining the summit of a low intervening down the wished scene would be disclosedthe valelike wide depression with its line of trees bluegreen in the distance flecks of red and grey colour of the houses among themand at that sight there would come a sense of elation like that of coming home  this in fact was the secret this empty place was in its aspect despite the difference in configuration between down and undulating plain more like the home of my early years than any other place known to me in the country i can note many differences but they do not deprive me of this home feeling it is the likenesses that hold me the spirit of the place one which is not a desert with the deserts melancholy or sense of desolation but inhabited although thinly and by humbleminded men whose work and dwellings are unobtrusive the final effect of this wide green space with signs of human life and labour on it and sight of animalssheep and cattleat various distances is that we are not aliens here intruders or invaders on the earth living in it but apart perhaps hating and spoiling it but with the other animals are children of nature like them living and seeking our subsistence under her sky familiar with her sun and wind and rain  if some ostentatious person had come to this strangely quiet spot and raised a staring big house the sight of it in the landscape would have made it impossible to have such a feeling as i have describedthis sense of mans harmony and oneness with nature from how much of england has this expression which nature has for the spirit which is so much more to us than beauty of scenery been blotted out this quiet spot in wiltshire has been inhabited from of old how far back in time the barrows raised by an ancient barbarous people are there to tell us and to show us how long it is possible for the race of men in all stages of culture to exist on the earth without spoiling it  one afternoon when walking on bishop down i noticed at a distance of a hundred yards or more that a rabbit had started making a burrow in a new place and had thrown out a vast quantity of earth going to the spot to see what kind of chalk or soil he was digging so deeply in i found that he had thrown out a human thighbone and a rib or two they were of a reddishwhite colour and had been embedded in a hard mixture of chalk and red earth the following day i went again and there were more bones and every day after that the number increased until it seemed to me that he had brought out the entire skeleton minus the skull which i had been curious to see then the bones disappeared the man who looked after the game had seen them and recognizing that they were human remains had judiciously taken them away to destroy or stow them away in some safe place for if the village constable had discovered them or heard of their presence he would perhaps have made a fuss and even thought it necessary to communicate with the coroner of the district such things occasionally happen even in wiltshire where the chalk hills are full of the bones of dead men and a solemn crowners quest is held on the remains of a saxon or dane or an ancient briton when some important persona sir richard colt hoare for example who dug up 379 barrows in wiltshire or a general pitt rivers throws out human remains nobody minds but if an unauthorized rabbit kicks out a lot of bones the matter should be inquired into  but the man whose bones had been thus thrown out into the sunlight after lying so long at that spot which commanded a view of the distant little village looking so small in that immense green spacewho and what was he and how long ago did he live on the earthat winterbourne bishop let us say there were two barrows in that part of the down but quite a stonesthrow away from the spot where the rabbit was working so that he may not have been one of the people of that period still it is probable that he was buried a very long time ago centuries back perhaps a thousand years perhaps longer and by chance there was a slope there which prevented the water from percolating and the soil in which he had been deposited under that closeknit turf which looked as if it had never been disturbed was one in which bones might keep uncrumbled for ever  the thought that occurred to me at the time was that if the man himself had come back to life after so long a period to stand once more on that down surveying the scene he would have noticed little change in it certainly nothing of a startling description the village itself looking so small at that distance in the centre of the vast depression would probably not be strange to him it was doubtless there as far back as history goes and probably still farther back in time for at that point just where the winterbourne gushes out from the low hills is the spot man would naturally select to make his home and he would see no mansion or big building no puff of white steam and sight of a long black train creeping over the earth nor any other strange thing it would appear to him even as he knew it before he fell asleepthe same familiar scene with furze and bramble and bracken on the slope the wide expanse with sheep and cattle grazing in the distance and the dark green of trees in the hollows and fold on fold of the low down beyond stretching away to the dim farthest horizon     chapter iv  a shepherd of the downs    caleb bawcombean old shepherds love of his homefifty years   shepherdingbawcombes singular appearancea tale of a titlarkcaleb   bawcombes fatherfather and sona grateful sportsman and isaac   bawcombes pensiondeath following death in old married couplesin a   village churchyarda farmlabourers gravestone and his story   it is now several years since i first met caleb bawcombe a shepherd of the south wiltshire downs but already old and infirm and past work i met him at a distance from his native village and it was only after i had known him a long time and had spent many afternoons and evenings in his company listening to his anecdotes of his shepherding days that i went to see his own old home for myselfthe village of winterbourne bishop already described to find it a place after my own heart but as i have said if i had never known caleb and heard so much from him about his own life and the lives of many of his fellowvillagers i should probably never have seen this village  one of his memories was of an old shepherd named john whose acquaintance he made when a very young manjohn being at that time seventyeight years oldon the winterbourne bishop farm where he had served for an unbroken period of close on sixty years though so aged he was still head shepherd and he continued to hold that place seven years longeruntil his master who had taken over old john with the place finally gave up the farm and farming at the same time he too was getting past work and wished to spend his declining years in his native village in an adjoining parish where he owned some house and cottage property and now what was to become of the old shepherd since the new tenant had brought his own men with himand he moreover considered that john at eightyfive was too old to tend a flock on the hills even of tegs his old master anxious to help him tried to get him some employment in the village where he wished to stay and failing in this he at last offered him a cottage rent free in the village where he was going to live himself and in addition twelve shillings a week for the rest of his life it was in those days an exceedingly generous offer but john refused it master he said i be going to stay in my own native village and if i cant make a living the parishll have to keep i but keep or not keep here i be and here i be going to stay where i were borned  from this position the stubborn old man refused to be moved and there at winterbourne bishop his master had to leave him although not without having first made him a sufficient provision  the way in which my old friend caleb bawcombe told the story plainly revealed his own feeling in the matter he understood and had the keenest sympathy with old john dead now over half a century or rather let us say resting very peacefully in that green spot under the old grey tower of winterbourne bishop church where as a small boy he had played among the old gravestones as far back in time as the middle of the eighteenth century but old john had long survived wife and children and having no one but himself to think of was at liberty to end his days where he pleased not so with caleb for although his undying passion for home and his love of the shepherds calling were as great as johns he was not so free and he was compelled at last to leave his native downs which he may never see again to settle for the remainder of his days in another part of the country  early in life he caught a chill through long exposure to wet and cold in winter this brought on rheumatic fever and a malady of the thigh which finally affected the whole limb and made him lame for life thus handicapped he had continued as shepherd for close on fifty years during which time his sons and daughters had grown up married and gone away mostly to a considerable distance leaving their aged parents alone once more then the wife who was a strong woman and of an enterprising temper found an opening for herself at a distance from home where she could start a little business caleb indignantly refused to give up shepherding in his place to take part in so unheardof an adventure but after a year or more of life in his lonely hut among the hills and cold empty cottage in the village he at length tore himself away from that beloved spot and set forth on the longest journey of his lifeabout fortyfive milesto join her and help in the work of her new home here a few years later i found him aged seventytwo but owing to his increasing infirmities looking considerably more when he considered that his father a shepherd before him on those same wiltshire downs lived to eightysix and his mother to eightyfour and that both were vigorous and led active lives almost to the end he thought it strange that his own work should be so soon done for in heart and mind he was still young he did not want to rest yet  since that first meeting nine years have passed and as he is actually better in health today than he was then there is good reason to hope that his staying power will equal that of his father  i was at first struck with the singularity of calebs appearance and later by the expression of his eyes a very tall bigboned lean roundshouldered man he was uncouth almost to the verge of grotesqueness and walked painfully with the aid of a stick dragging his shrunken and shortened bad leg his head was long and narrow and his high forehead long nose long chin and long coarse grey whiskers worn like a beard on his throat produced a goatlike effect this was heightened by the ears and eyes the big ears stood out from his head and owing to a peculiar bend or curl in the membrane at the top they looked at certain angles almost pointed the hazel eyes were wonderfully clear but that quality was less remarkable than the unhuman intelligence in themfawnlike eyes that gazed steadily at you as one may gaze through the window open back and front of a house at the landscape beyond this peculiarity was a little disconcerting at first when after making his acquaintance out of doors i went in uninvited and sat down with him at his own fireside the busy old wife talked of this and that and hinted as politely as she knew how that i was in her way to her practical peasant mind there was no sense in my being there he be a stranger to we and we be strangers to he caleb was silent and his clear eyes showed neither annoyance nor pleasure but only their native wild alertness but the caste feeling is always less strong in the hill shepherd than in other men who are on the land in some cases it will vanish at a touch and it was so in this one a canary in a cage hanging in the kitchen served to introduce the subject of birds captive and birds free i said that i liked the little yellow bird and was not vexed to see him in a cage since he was cageborn but i considered that those who caught wild birds and kept them prisoners did not properly understand things this happened to be calebs view he had a curiously tender feeling about the little wild birds and one amusing incident of his boyhood which he remembered came out during our talk he was out on the down one summer day in charge of his fathers flock when two boys of the village on a ramble in the hills came and sat down on the turf by his side one of them had a titlark or meadow pipit which he had just caught in his hand and there was a hot argument as to which of the two was the lawful owner of the poor little captive the facts were as follows one of the boys having found the nest became possessed with the desire to get the bird his companion at once offered to catch it for him and together they withdrew to a distance and sat down and waited until the bird returned to sit on the eggs then the young birdcatcher returned to the spot and creeping quietly up to within five or six feet of the nest threw his hat so that it fell over the sitting titlark but after having thus secured it he refused to give it up the dispute waxed hotter as they sat there and at last when it got to the point of threats of cuffs on the ear and slaps on the face they agreed to fight it out the victor to have the titlark the bird was then put under a hat for safety on the smooth turf a few feet away and the boys proceeded to take off their jackets and roll up their shirtsleeves after which they faced one another and were just about to begin when caleb thrusting out his crook turned the hat over and away flew the titlark  the boys deprived of their bird and of an excuse for a fight would gladly have discharged their fury on caleb but they durst not seeing that his dog was lying at his side they could only threaten and abuse him call him bad names and finally put on their coats and walk off  that pretty little tale of a titlark was but the first of a long succession of memories of his early years with half a century of shepherding life on the downs which came out during our talks on many autumn and winter evenings as we sat by his kitchen fire the earlier of these memories were always the best to me because they took one back sixty years or more to a time when there was more wildness in the earth than now and a nobler wild animal life even more interesting were some of the memories of his father isaac bawcombe whose time went back to the early years of the nineteenth century caleb cherished an admiration and reverence for his fathers memory which were almost a worship and he loved to describe him as he appeared in his old age when upwards of eighty he was erect and tall standing six feet two in height well proportioned with a cleanshaved florid face clear dark eyes and silverwhite hair and at this later period of his life he always wore the dress of an old order of pensioners to which he had been admitteda soft broad white felt hat thick boots and brown leather leggings and a long grey cloth overcoat with red collar and brass buttons  according to caleb he must have been an exceedingly fine specimen of a man both physically and morally born in 1800 he began following a flock as a boy and continued as shepherd on the same farm until he was sixty never rising to more than seven shillings a week and nothing found since he lived in the cottage where he was born and which he inherited from his father that a man of his fine powers a headshepherd on a large hillfarm should have had no better pay than that down to the year 1860 after nearly half a century of work in one place seems almost incredible even his sons as they grew up to mans estate advised him to ask for an increase but he would not seven shillings a week he had always had and that small sum with something his wife earned by making highly finished smockfrocks had been sufficient to keep them all in a decent way and his sons were now all earning their own living but caleb got married and resolved to leave the old farm at bishop to take a better place at a distance from home at warminster which had been offered him he would there have a cottage to live in nine shillings a week and a sack of barley for his dog at that time the shepherd had to keep his own dogno small expense to him when his wages were no more than six to eight shillings a week but caleb was his fathers favourite son and the old man could not endure the thought of losing sight of him and at last finding that he could not persuade him not to leave the old home he became angry and told him that if he went away to warminster for the sake of the higher wages and barley for the dog he would disown him this was a serious matter to caleb in spite of the fact that a shepherd has no money to leave to his children when he passes away he went nevertheless for though he loved and reverenced his father he had a young wife who pulled the other way and he was absent for years and when he returned the old mans heart had softened so that he was glad to welcome him back to the old home  meanwhile at that humble cottage at winterbourne bishop great things had happened old isaac was no longer shepherding on the downs but living very comfortably in his own cottage in the village the change came about in this way  the downland shepherds caleb said were as a rule clever poachers and it is really not surprising when one considers the temptation to a man with a wife and several hungry children besides himself and a dog to feed out of about seven shillings a week but old bawcombe was an exception he would take no game furred or feathered nor if he could prevent it allow another to take anything from the land fed by his flock caleb and his brothers when as boys and youths they began their shepherding sometimes caught a rabbit or their dog caught and killed one without their encouragement but however the thing came into their hands they could not take it home on account of their father now it happened that an elderly gentleman who had the shooting was a keen sportsman and that in several successive years he found a wonderful difference in the amount of game at one spot among the hills and in all the rest of his hill property the only explanation the keeper could give was that isaac bawcombe tended his flock on that down where rabbits hares and partridges were so plentiful one autumn day the gentleman was shooting over that down and seeing a big man in a smockfrock standing motionless crook in hand regarding him he called out to his keeper who was with him who is that big man and was told that it was shepherd bawcombe the old gentleman pulled some money out of his pocket and said give him this halfcrown and thank him for the good sport ive had today but after the coin had been given the giver still remained standing there thinking perhaps that he had not yet sufficiently rewarded the man and at last before turning away he shouted bawcombe thats not all youll get something more by and by  isaac had not long to wait for the something more and it turned out not to be the hare or brace of birds he had half expected it happened that the sportsman was one of the trustees of an ancient charity which provided for six of the most deserving old men of the parish of bishop now one of the six had recently died and on this gentlemans recommendation bawcombe had been elected to fill the vacant place the letter from salisbury informing him of his election and commanding his presence in that city filled him with astonishment for though he was sixty years old and the father of three sons now out in the world he could not yet regard himself as an old man for he had never known a days illness nor an ache and was famed in all that neighbourhood for his great physical strength and endurance and now with his own cottage to live in eight shillings a week and his pensioners garments with certain other benefits and a shilling a day besides which his old master paid him for some services at the farmhouse in the village isaac found himself very well off indeed and he enjoyed his prosperous state for twentysix years then in 1886 his old wife fell ill and died and no sooner was she in her grave than he too began to droop and soon before the year was out he followed her because as the neighbours said they had always been a loving pair and one could not bide without the other  this chapter has already had its proper ending and there was no intention of adding to it but now for a special reason which i trust the reader will pardon when he hears it i must go on to say something about that strange phenomenon of death succeeding death in old married couples one dying for no other reason than that the other has died for it is our instinct to hold fast to life and the older a man gets if he be sane the more he becomes like a newborn child in the impulse to grip tightly a strange and a rare thing among people generally the people we know it is nevertheless quite common among persons of the labouring class in the rural districts i have sometimes marvelled at the number of such cases to be met with in the villages but when one comes to think about it one ceases to wonder that it should be so for the labourer on the land goes on from boyhood to the end of life in the same everlasting round the changes from task to task according to the seasons being no greater than in the case of the animals that alter their actions and habits to suit the varying conditions of the year march and august and december and every month will bring about the changes in the atmosphere and earth and vegetation and in the animals which have been from of old which he knows how to meet and the old familiar task lambingtime shearingtime root and seed crops hoeing haymaking harvesting it is a life of the extremest simplicity without all those interests outside the home and the daily task the innumerable distractions common to all persons in other classes and to the workmen in towns as well incidentally it may be said that it is also the healthiest that speaking generally the agricultural labourer is the healthiest and sanest man in the land if not also the happiest as some believe  it is this life of simple unchanging actions and of habits that are like instincts of hard labour in sun and wind and rain from day to day with its weekly break and rest and of but few comforts and no luxuries which serves to bind man and wife so closely and the longer their life goes on together the closer and more unbreakable the union grows they are growing old old friends and companions have died or left them their children have married and gone away and have their own families and affairs so that the old folks at home are little remembered and to all others they have become of little consequence in the world but they do not know it for they are together cherishing the same memories speaking of the same old familiar things and their lost friends and companions their absent perhaps estranged children are with them still in mind as in the old days the past is with them more than the present to give an undying interest to life for they share it and it is only when one goes when the old wife gets the tea ready and goes mechanically to the door to gaze out knowing that her tired man will come in no more to take his customary place and listen to all the things she has stored up in her mind during the day to tell him and when the tired labourer comes in at dusk to find no old wife waiting to give him his tea and talk to him while he refreshes himself he all at once realizes his position he finds himself cut off from the entire world from all of his kind where are they all the enduring sympathy of that one soul that was with him till now had kept him in touch with life had made it seem unchanged and unchangeable and with that soul has vanished the old sweet illusion as well as all ties all common human affection he is desolate indeed alone in a desert world and it is not strange that in many and many a case even in that of a man still strong untouched by disease and good for another decade or two the loss the awful solitude has proved too much for him  such cases i have said are common but they are not recorded though it is possible with labour to pick them out in the church registers but in the churchyards you do not find them since the farmlabourer has only a green mound to mark the spot where he lies nevertheless he is sometimes honoured with a gravestone and last august i came by chance on one on which was recorded a case like that of isaac bawcombe and his lifemate  the churchyard is in one of the prettiest and most secluded villages in the downland country described in this book the church is ancient and beautiful and interesting in many ways and the churchyard too is one of the most interesting i know a beautiful green treeshaded spot with an extraordinary number of tombs and gravestones many of them dated in the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries inscribed with names of families which have long died out  i went on that afternoon to pass an hour in the churchyard and finding an old man in labourers clothes resting on a tomb i sat down and entered into conversation with him he was seventynine he told me and past work and he had three shillings a week from the parish but he was very deaf and it fatigued me to talk to him and seeing the church open i went in on previous visits i had had a good deal of trouble to get the key and to find it open now was a pleasant surprise an old woman was there dusting the seats and by and by while i was talking with her the old labourer came stumping in with his ponderous ironshod boots and without taking off his old rusty hat and began shouting at the churchcleaner about a pair of trousers he had given her to mend which he wanted badly leaving them to their arguing i went out and began studying the inscriptions on the stones so hard to make out in some instances the old man followed and went his way then the churchcleaner came out to where i was standing a tiresome old man she said hes that deaf he has to shout to hear himself speak then youve got to shout backand all about his old trousers  i suppose he wants them i returned and you promised to do them so he has some reason for going at you about it  oh no he hasnt she replied the girl brought them for me to mend and i said leave them and ill do them when ive timehow did i know he wanted them in a hurry a troublesome old man  by and by taking a pair of spectacles out of her pocket she put them on and going down on her knees she began industriously picking the old brown dead moss out of the lettering on one side of the tomb id like to know what it says on this stone she said  well you can read it for yourself now youve got your glasses on  i cant read you see im oldseventysix years and when i were little we were very poor and i couldnt get no schooling ive got these glasses to do my sewing and only put them on to get this stuff out sos you could read it id like to hear you read it  i began to get interested in the old dame who talked to me so freely she was small and weaklooking and appeared very thin in her limp old faded gown she had a meek patient expression on her face and her voice too like her face expressed weariness and resignation  but if you have always lived here you must know what is said on this stone  no i dont nobody never read it to me and i couldnt read it because i wasnt taught to read but id like to hear you read it  it was a long inscription to a person named ash gentleman of this parish who departed this life over a century ago and was a man of a noble and generous disposition good as a husband a father a friend and charitable to the poor under all were some lines of verse scarcely legible in spite of the trouble she had taken to remove the old moss from the letters  she listened with profound interest then said i never heard all that before i didnt know the name though ive known this stone since i was a child i used to climb on to it then can you read me another  i read her another and several more then came to one which she said she knewevery word of it for this was the grave of the sweetest kindest woman that ever lived oh how good this dear woman had been to her in her young married life moren fifty years ago if that dear lady had only lived it would not have been so hard for her when her trouble come  and what was your trouble  it was the loss of my poor man he was such a good man a thatcher and he fell from a rick and injured his spine and he died poor fellow and left me with our five little children then having told me her own tragedy to my surprise she brightened up and begged me to read other inscriptions to her  i went on reading and presently she said no thats wrong there wasnt ever a lampard in this parish that i know  you dont know there certainly was a lampard or it would not be stated here cut in deep letters on this stone  no there wasnt a lampard ive never known such a name and ive lived here all my life  but there were people living here before you came on the scene he died a long time ago this lampardin 1714 it says and you are only seventysix you tell me that is to say you were born in 1835 and that would be one hundred and twentyone years after he died  thats a long time it must be very old this stone and the church too ive heard say it was once a roman catholic church is that true  why of course its trueall the old churches were and we were all of that faith until a king of england had a quarrel with the pope and determined he would be pope himself as well as king in his own country so he turned all the priests and monks out and took their property and churches and had his own men put in that was henry viii  ive heard something about that king and his wives but about lampard it do seem strange ive never heard that name before  not strange at all it was a common name in this part of wiltshire in former days you find it in dozens of churchyards but youll find very few lampards living in the villages why i could tell you a dozen or twenty surnames some queer funny names that were common in these parts not more than a century ago which seem to have quite died out  i should like to hear some of them if youll tell me  let me think a moment there was thorr pizzie gee every pottle kiddle toomer shergold and  here she interrupted to say that she knew three of the names i had mentioned then pointing to a small upright gravestone about twenty feet away she added and theres one  very well i said but dont keep putting me outive got more names in my mind to tell you maidment marchmont velvin burpitt winzur rideout cullurne  of these she only knew onerideout  then i went over to the stone she had pointed to and read the inscription to john toomer and his wife rebecca she died first in march 1877 aged 72 he in july the same year aged 75  you knew them i suppose  yes they belonged here both of them  tell me about them  theres nothing to tell he was only a labourer and worked on the same farm all his life  who put a stone over themtheir children  no theyre all poor and live away i think it was a lady who lived here shed been good to them and she came and stood here when they put old john in the ground  but i want to hear more  theres no more ive said he was a labourer and after she died he died  yes go on  how can i go on theres no more i knew them so well they lived in the little thatched cottage over there where the millards live now  did they fall ill at the same time  oh no he was as well as could be still at work till she died then he went on in a strange way he would come in of an evening and call his wife mother mother where are you youd hear him call mother be you upstairs mother aint you coming down for a bit of bread and cheese before you go to bed and then in a little while he just died  and you said there was nothing to tell  no there wasnt anything he was just one of us a labourer on the farm  i then gave her something and to my surprise after taking it she made me an elaborate curtsy it rather upset me for i had thought we had got on very well together and were quite free and easy in our talk very much on a level but she was not done with me yet she followed to the gate and holding out her open hand with that small gift in it she said in a pathetic voice did you think sir i was expecting this i had no such thought and didnt want it  and i had no thought of saying or writing a word about her but since that day she has haunted meshe and her old john toomer and it has just now occurred to me that by putting her in my book i may be able to get her out of my mind     chapter v  early memories    a child shepherdisaac and his childrenshepherding in boyhoodtwo   notable sheepdogsjack the adderkillersitting on an adderrough   and the droversthe salisbury coacha sheepdog suckling a lamb   calebs shepherding began in childhood at all events he had his first experience of it at that time many an old shepherd whose father was shepherd before him has told me that he began to go with the flock very early in life when he was no more than ten to twelve years of age caleb remembered being put in charge of his fathers flock at the tender age of six it was a new and wonderful experience and made so vivid and lasting an impression on his mind that now when he is past eighty he speaks of it very feelingly as of something which happened yesterday  it was harvesting time and isaac who was a good reaper was wanted in the field but he could find no one not even a boy to take charge of his flock in the meantime and so to be able to reap and keep an eye on the flock at the same time he brought his sheep down to the part of the down adjoining the field it was on his liberty or that part of the down where he was entitled to have his flock he then took his very small boy caleb and placing him with the sheep told him they were now in his charge that he was not to lose sight of them and at the same time not to run about among the furzebushes for fear of treading on an adder by and by the sheep began straying off among the furzebushes and no sooner would they disappear from sight than he imagined they were lost for ever or would be unless he quickly found them and to find them he had to run about among the bushes with the terror of adders in his mind and the two troubles together kept him crying with misery all the time then at intervals isaac would leave his reaping and come to see how he was getting on and the tears would vanish from his eyes and he would feel very brave again and to his fathers question he would reply that he was getting on very well  finally his father came and took him to the field to his great relief but he did not carry him in his arms he strode along at his usual pace and let the little fellow run after him stumbling and falling and picking himself up again and running on and by and by one of the women in the field cried out be you not ashamed isaac to go that pace and not bide for the little child i do blieve hes no moren seven yearpoor mite  no moren six answered isaac proudly with a laugh  but though not soft or tender with his children he was very fond of them and when he came home early in the evening he would get them round him and talk to them and sing old songs and ballads he had learnt in his young yearsdown in the village the days of queen elizabeth the blacksmith the gown of green the dawning of the day and many others which caleb in the end got by heart and used to sing too when he was grown up  caleb was about nine when he began to help regularly with the flock that was in the summertime when the flock was put every day on the down and when isaacs services were required for the haymaking and later for harvesting and other work his best memories of this period relate to his mother and to two sheepdogs jack at first and afterwards rough both animals of original character jack was a great favourite of his master who considered him a tarrable good dog he was rather shorthaired like the old welsh sheepdog once common in wiltshire but entirely black instead of the usual colourblue with a sprinkling of black spots this dog had an intense hatred of adders and never failed to kill every one he discovered at the same time he knew that they were dangerous enemies to tackle and on catching sight of one his hair would instantly bristle up and he would stand as if paralysed for some moments glaring at it and gnashing his teeth then springing like a cat upon it he would seize it in his mouth only to hurl it from him to a distance this action he would repeat until the adder was dead and isaac would then put it under a furzebush to take it home and hang it on a certain gate the farmer too like the dog hated adders and paid his shepherd sixpence for every one his dog killed  one day caleb with one of his brothers was out with the flock amusing themselves in their usual way on the turf with nine morrismen and the shepherds puzzle when all at once their mother appeared unexpectedly on the scene it was her custom when the boys were sent out with the flock to make expeditions to the down just to see what they were up to and hiding her approach by keeping to a hedgeside or by means of the furzebushes she would sometimes come upon them with disconcerting suddenness on this occasion just where the boys had been playing there was a low stout furzebush so dense and flattopped that one could use it as a seat and his mother taking off and folding her shawl placed it on the bush and sat down on it to rest herself after her long walk i can see her now said caleb sitting on that furzebush in her smock and leggings with a big hat like a mans on her headfor thats how she dressed but in a few moments she jumped up crying out that she felt a snake under her and snatched off the shawl and there sure enough out of the middle of the flat bushtop appeared the head of an adder flicking out its tongue the dog too saw it dashed at the bush forcing his muzzle and head into the middle of it seized the serpent by its body and plucked it out and threw it from him only to follow it up and kill it in the usual way  rough was a large shaggy greyblue bobtail bitch with a white collar she was a clever good allround dog but had originally been trained for the road and one of the shepherds stories about her relates of her intelligence in her own special linethe driving of sheep  one day he and his smaller brother were in charge of the flock on the down and were on the side where it dips down to the turnpikeroad about a mile and a half from the village where a large flock driven by two men and two dogs came by they were going to the britford sheepfair and were behind time isaac had started at daylight that morning with sheep for the same fair and that was the reason of the boys being with the flock as the flock on the down was feeding quietly the boys determined to go to the road to watch the sheep and men pass and arriving at the roadside they saw that the dogs were too tired to work and the men were getting on with great difficulty one of them looking intently at rough asked if she would work oh yes shell work said the boy proudly and calling rough he pointed to the flock moving very slowly along the road and over the turf on either side of it rough knew what was wanted she had been looking on and had taken the situation in with her professional eye away she dashed and running up and down first on one side then on the other quickly put the whole flock numbering 800 into the road and gave them a good start  why she be a road dog exclaimed the drover delightedly shes better for me on the road than for you on the down ill buy her of you  no i mustnt sell her said caleb  look here boy said the other ill give ee a sovran and this young dog an hell be a good one with a little more training  no i mustnt said caleb distressed at the others persistence  well will you come a little way on the road with us asked the drover  this the boys agreed to and went on for about a quarter of a mile when all at once the salisbury coach appeared on the road coming to meet them this new trouble was pointed out to rough and at once when her little master had given the order she dashed barking into the midst of the mass of sheep and drove them furiously to the side from end to end of the extended flock making a clear passage for the coach which was not delayed a minute and no sooner was the coach gone than the sheep were put back into the road  then the drover pulled out his sovereign once more and tried to make the boy take it  i mustnt he repeated almost in tears what would father say  say he wont say nothing hell think youve done well  but caleb thought that perhaps his father would say something and when he remembered certain whippings he had experienced in the past he had an uncomfortable sensation about his back no i mustnt was all he could say and then the drovers with a laugh went on with their sheep  when isaac came home and the adventure was told to him he laughed and said that he meant to sell rough some day he used to say this occasionally to tease his wife because of the dogs intense devotion to her and she being without a sense of humour and half thinking that he meant it would get up out of her seat and solemnly declare that if he ever sold rough she would never again go out to the down to see what the boys were up to  one day she visited the boys when they had the flock near the turnpike and seating herself on the turf a few yards from the road got out her work and began sewing presently they spied a big singularlooking man coming at a swinging pace along the road he was in shirtsleeves barefooted and wore a straw hat without a rim rough eyed the strange beings approach with suspicion and going to her mistress placed herself at her side the man came up and sat down at a distance of three or four yards from the group and rough looking dangerous started up and put her forepaws on her mistresss lap and began uttering a low growl  will that dog bite missus said the man  maybe he will said she i wont answer for he if you come any nearer  the two boys had been occupied cutting a faggot from a furzebush with a billhook and now held a whispered consultation as to what they would do if the man tried to hurt mother and agreed that as soon as rough had got her teeth in his leg they would attack him about the head with the billhook they were not required to go into action the stranger could not long endure roughs savage aspect and very soon he got up and resumed his travels  the shepherd remembered another curious incident in roughs career at one time when she had a litter of pups at home she was yet compelled to be a great part of the day with the flock of ewes as they could not do without her the boys just then were bringing up a motherless lamb by hand and they would put it with the sheep and to feed it during the day were obliged to catch a ewe with milk the lamb trotted at calebs heels like a dog and one day when it was hungry and crying to be fed when rough happened to be sitting on her haunches close by it occurred to him that roughs milk might serve as well as a sheeps the lamb was put to her and took very kindly to its canine fostermother wriggling its tail and pushing vigorously with its nose rough submitted patiently to the trial and the result was that the lamb adopted the sheepdog as its mother and sucked her milk several times every day to the great admiration of all who witnessed it     chapter vi  shepherd isaac bawcombe    a noble shepherda fighting village blacksmithold joe the colliera   story of his strengthdonkeys poisoned by yewthe shepherd without his   sheephow the shepherd killed a deer   to me the most interesting of calebs old memories were those relating to his father partly on account of the mans fine character and partly because they went so far back beginning in the early years of the last century  altogether he must have been a very fine specimen of a man both physically and morally in calebs mind he was undoubtedly the first among men morally but there were two other men supposed to be his equals in bodily strength one a native of the village the other a periodical visitor the first was jarvis the blacksmith a man of an immense chest and big arms one of isaacs greatest friends and very goodtempered except when in his cups for he did occasionally get drunk and then he quarrelled with anyone and every one  one afternoon he had made himself quite tipsy at the inn and when going home swaying about and walking all over the road he all at once caught sight of the big shepherd coming soberly on behind no sooner did he see him than it occurred to his wild and muddled mind that he had a quarrel with this very man shepherd isaac a quarrel of so pressing a nature that there was nothing to do but to fight it out there and then he planted himself before the shepherd and challenged him to fight isaac smiled and said nothing  ill fight thee about this he repeated and began tugging at his coat and after getting it off again made up to isaac who still smiled and said no word then he pulled his waistcoat off and finally his shirt and with nothing but his boots and breeches on once more squared up to isaac and threw himself into his best fighting attitude  i doant want to fight thee said isaac at length but i be thinking twould be best to take thee home and suddenly dashing in he seized jarvis round the waist with one arm grasped him round the legs with the other and flung the big man across his shoulder and carried him off struggling and shouting to his cottage there at the door pale and distressed stood the poor wife waiting for her lord when isaac arrived and going straight in dropped the smith down on his own floor and with the remark here be your man walked off to his cottage and his tea  the other powerful man was old joe the collier who flourished and was known in every village in the salisbury plain district during the first thirtyfive years of the last century i first heard of this once famous man from caleb whose boyish imagination had been affected by his gigantic figure mighty voice and his wandering life over all that wide world of salisbury plain afterwards when i became acquainted with a good many old men aged from 75 to 90 and upwards i found that old joes memory is still green in a good many villages of the district from the upper waters of the avon to the borders of dorset but it is only these ancients who knew him that keep it green by and by when they are gone old joe and his neddies will be remembered no more  in those daysdown to about 1840 it was customary to burn peat in the cottages the first cost of which was about four and sixpence the wagonloadas much as i should require to keep me warm for a month in winter but the cost of its conveyance to the villages of the plain was about five to six shillings per load as it came from a considerable distance mostly from the new forest how the labourers at that time when they were paid seven or eight shillings a week could afford to buy fuel at such prices to bake their rye bread and keep the frost out of their bones is a marvel to us isaac was a good deal better off than most of the villagers in this respect as his masterfor he never had but oneallowed him the use of a wagon and the drivers services for the conveyance of one load of peat each year the wagonload of peat and another of faggots lasted him the year with the furze obtained from his liberty on the down coal at that time was only used by the blacksmiths in the villages and was conveyed in sacks on ponies or donkeys and of those who were engaged in this business the best known was old joe he appeared periodically in the villages with his eight donkeys or neddies as he called them with jingling bells on their headstalls and their burdens of two sacks of small coal on each in stature he was a giant of about six feet three very broadchested and invariably wore a broadbrimmed hat a slatecoloured smockfrock and blue worsted stockings to his knees he walked behind the donkeys a very long staff in his hand shouting at them from time to time and occasionally swinging his long staff and bringing it down on the back of a donkey who was not keeping up the pace in this way he wandered from village to village from end to end of the plain getting rid of his small coal and loading his animals with scrap iron which the blacksmiths would keep for him and as he continued his rounds for nearly forty years he was a familiar figure to every inhabitant throughout the district  there are some stories still told of his great strength one of which is worth giving he was a man of iron constitution and gave himself a hard life and he was hard on his neddies but he had to feed them well and this he often contrived to do at some one elses expense one night at a village on the wylye it was discovered that he had put his eight donkeys in a meadow in which the grass was just ripe for mowing the enraged farmer took them to the village pound and locked them up but in the morning the donkeys and joe with them had vanished and the whole village wondered how he had done it the stone wall of the pound was four feet and a half high and the iron gate was locked yet he had lifted the donkeys up and put them over and had loaded them and gone before anyone was up  once joe met with a very great misfortune he arrived late at a village and finding there was good feed in the churchyard and that everybody was in bed he put his donkeys in and stretched himself out among the gravestones to sleep he had no nerves and no imagination and was tired and slept very soundly until it was light and time to put his neddies out before any person came by and discovered that he had been making free with the rectors grass glancing round he could see no donkeys and only when he stood up he found they had not made their escape but were there all about him lying among the gravestones stone dead every one he had forgotten that a churchyard was a dangerous place to put hungry animals in they had browsed on the luxuriant yew that grew there and this was the result  in time he recovered from his loss and replaced his dead neddies with others and continued for many years longer on his rounds  to return to isaac bawcombe he was born we have seen in 1800 and began following a flock as a boy and continued as shepherd on the same farm for a period of fiftyfive years the care of sheep was the one allabsorbing occupation of his life and how much it was to him appears in this anecdote of his state of mind when he was deprived of it for a time the flock was sold and isaac was left without sheep and with little to do except to wait from michaelmas to candlemas when there would be sheep again at the farm it was a long time to isaac and he found his enforced holiday so tedious that he made himself a nuisance to his wife in the house forty times a day he would throw off his hat and sit down resolved to be happy at his own fireside but after a few minutes the desire to be up and doing would return and up he would get and out he would go again one dark cloudy evening a man from the farm put his head in at the door isaac he said there be sheep for ee upt the farmtwo hunderd ewes and a hunderd more to come in dree days master he sent i to say you be wanted and away the man went  isaac jumped up and hurried forth without taking his crook from the corner and actually without putting on his hat his wife called out after him and getting no response sent the boy with his hat to overtake him but the little fellow soon returned with the hathe could not overtake his father  he was away three or four hours at the farm then returned his hair very wet his face beaming and sat down with a great sigh of pleasure two hunderd ewes he said and a hunderd more to comewhat dyou think of that  well isaac said she i hope theell be happy now and let i alone  after all that had been told to me about the elder bawcombes life and character it came somewhat as a shock to learn that at one period during his early manhood he had indulged in one form of poachinga sport which had a marvellous fascination for the people of england in former times but was pretty well extinguished during the first quarter of the last century deer he had taken and the whole tale of the deerstealing which was a common offence in that part of wiltshire down to about 1834 sounds strange at the present day  large herds of deer were kept at that time at an estate a few miles from winterbourne bishop and it often happened that many of the animals broke bounds and roamed singly and in small bands over the hills when deer were observed in the open certain of the villagers would settle on some plan of action watchers would be sent out not only to keep an eye on the deer but on the keepers too much depended on the state of the weather and the moon as some light was necessary then when the conditions were favourable and the keepers had been watched to their cottages the gang would go out for a nights hunting but it was a dangerous sport as the keepers also knew that deer were out of bounds and they would form some counterplan and one peculiarly nasty plan they had was to go out about three or four oclock in the morning and secrete themselves somewhere close to the village to intercept the poachers on their return  bawcombe who never in his life associated with the village idlers and frequenters of the alehouse had no connexion with these men his expeditions were made alone on some dark unpromising night when the regular poachers were in bed and asleep he would steal away after bedtime or would go out ostensibly to look after the sheep and if fortunate would return in the small hours with a deer on his back then helped by his mother with whom he lived for this was when he was a young unmarried man about 1820 he would quickly skin and cut up the carcass stow the meat away in some secret place and bury the head hide and offal deep in the earth and when morning came it would find isaac out following his flock as usual with no trace of guilt or fatigue in his rosy cheeks and clear honest eyes  this was a very astonishing story to hear from caleb but to suspect him of inventing or of exaggerating was impossible to anyone who knew him and we have seen that isaac bawcombe was an exceptional manphysically a kind of alexander selkirk of the wiltshire downs and he moreover had a dog to help himone as superior in speed and strength to the ordinary sheepdog as he himself was to the rack of his fellowmen it was only after much questioning on my part that caleb brought himself to tell me of these ancient adventures and finally to give a detailed account of how his father came to take his first deer it was in the depth of winterbitterly cold with a strong north wind blowing on the snowcovered downswhen one evening isaac caught sight of two deer out on his sheepwalk in that part of wiltshire there is a famous monument of antiquity a vast moundlike wall with a deep depression or fosse running at its side now it happened that on the highest part of the down where the wall or mound was most exposed to the blast the snow had been blown clean off the top and the deer were feeding here on the short turf keeping to the ridge so that outlined against the sky they had become visible to isaac at a great distance  he saw and pondered these deer just now while out of bounds were no mans property and it would be no sin to kill and eat oneif he could catch itand it was a season of bitter want for many many days he had eaten his barley bread and on some days barleyflour dumplings and had been content with this poor fare but now the sight of these animals made him crave for meat with an intolerable craving and he determined to do something to satisfy it  he went home and had his poor supper and when it was dark set forth again with his dog he found the deer still feeding on the mound stealing softly along among the furzebushes he got the black line of the mound against the starry sky and by and by as he moved along the black figures of the deer with their heads down came into view he then doubled back and proceeding some distance got down into the fosse and stole forward to them again under the wall his idea was that on taking alarm they would immediately make for the forest which was their home and would probably pass near him they did not hear him until he was within sixty yards and then bounded down from the wall over the dyke and away but in almost opposite directionsone alone making for the forest and on this one the dog was set out he shot like an arrow from the bow and after him ran isaac as he had never runned afore in all his life for a short space deer and dog in hot pursuit were visible on the snow then the darkness swallowed them up as they rushed down the slope but in less than half a minute a sound came back to isaac flying too down the inclinethe long wailing cry of a deer in distress the dog had seized his quarry by one of the front legs a little above the hoof and held it fast and they were struggling on the snow when isaac came up and flung himself upon his victim then thrust his knife through its windpipe to stop its noise having killed it he threw it on his back and went home not by the turnpike nor by any road or path but over fields and through copses until he got to the back of his mothers cottage there was no door on that side but there was a window and when he had rapped at it and his mother opened it without speaking a word he thrust the dead deer through then made his way round to the front  that was how he killed his first deer how the others were taken i do not know i wish i did since this one exploit of a wiltshire shepherd has more interest for me than i find in fifty narratives of elephants slaughtered wholesale with explosive bullets written for the delight and astonishment of the reading public by our most glorious nimrods     chapter vii  the deerstealers    deerstealing on salisbury plainthe headkeeper harbuttstrange   story of a babyfound as a surnamejohn barter the village   carpenterhow the keeper was fooleda poaching attack plannedthe   fightheadkeeper and carpenterthe carpenter hides his sonthe   arrestbarters sons forsake the village   there were other memories of deertaking handed down to caleb by his parents and the one best worth preserving relates to the headkeeper of the preserves or chase and to a great fight in which he was engaged with two brothers of the girl who was afterwards to be isaacs wife  here it may be necessary to explain that formerly the owner of cranbourne chase at that time lord rivers claimed the deer and the right to preserve and hunt deer over a considerable extent of country outside of his own lands on the wiltshire side these rights extended from cranbourne chase over the south wiltshire downs to salisbury and the whole territory about thirty miles broad was divided into beats or walks six or eight in number each beat provided with a keepers lodge this state of things continued to the year 1834 when the chase was disfranchised by act of parliament  the incident i am going to relate occurred about 1815 or perhaps two or three years later the border of one of the deer walks was at a spot known as three downs place two miles and a half from winterbourne bishop here in a hollow of the downs there was an extensive wood and just within the wood a large stone house said to be centuries old but long pulled down called rollston house in which the headkeeper lived with two underkeepers he had a wife but no children and was a middleaged thickset very dark man powerful and vigilant a tarrable hater and persecutor of poachers feared and hated by them in turn and his name was harbutt  it happened that one morning when he had unbarred the front door to go out he found a great difficulty in opening it caused by a heavy object having been fastened to the doorhandle it proved to be a basket or box in which a wellnourished nicelooking boy baby was sleeping well wrapped up and covered with a cloth on the cloth a scrap of paper was pinned with the following lines written on it    take me in and treat me well   for in this house my father dwell   harbutt read the lines and didnt even smile at the grammar on the contrary he appeared very much upset and was still standing holding the paper staring stupidly at it when his wife came on the scene what be this she exclaimed and looked first at the paper then at him then at the rosy child fast asleep in its cradle and instantly with a great cry she fell on it and snatched it up in her arms and holding it clasped to her bosom began lavishing caresses and endearing expressions on it tears of rapture in her eyes not one word of inquiry or bitter jealous reproachall that part of her was swallowed up and annihilated in the joy of a woman who had been denied a child of her own to love and nourish and worship and now one had come to her and it mattered little how two or three days later the infant was baptized at the village church with the quaint name of moses found  caleb was a little surprised at my thinking it a laughable name it was to his mind a singularly appropriate one he assured me it was not the only case he knew of in which the surname found had been bestowed on a child of unknown parentage and he told me the story of one of the founds who had gone to salisbury as a boy and worked and saved and eventually become quite a prosperous and important person there was really nothing funny in it  the story of moses found had been told him by his old mother she he remarked significantly had good cause to remember it she was herself a native of the village born two or three years later than the mysterious moses her father john barter by name was a carpenter and lived in an old thatched house which still exists and is very familiar to me he had five sons then after an interval of some years a daughter was born who in due time was to be isaacs wife when she was a little girl her brothers were all grown up or on the verge of manhood and moses too was a young manthe spit of his father people said meaning the headkeeperand he was now one of harbutts underkeepers  about this time some of the more ardent spirits in the village not satisfied with an occasional hunt when a deer broke out and roamed over the downs took to poaching them in the woods one night a hunt having been arranged one of the most daring of the men secreted himself close to the keepers house and having watched the keepers go in and the lights put out he actually succeeded in fastening up the doors from the outside with screws and pieces of wood without creating an alarm he then met his confederates at an agreed spot and the hunting began during which one deer was chased to the house and actually pulled down and killed on the lawn  meanwhile the inmates were in a state of great excitement the underkeepers feared that a force it would be dangerous to oppose had taken possession of the woods while harbutt raved and roared like a maddened wild beast in a cage and put forth all his strength to pull the doors open finally he smashed a window and leaped out gun in hand and calling the others to follow rushed into the wood but he was too late the hunt was over and the poachers had made good their escape taking the carcasses of two or three deer they had succeeded in killing  the keeper was not to be fooled in the same way a second time and before very long he had his revenge a fresh raid was planned and on this occasion two of the five brothers were in it and there were four more the blacksmith of winterbourne bishop their best man two famous shearers father and son from a neighbouring village and a young farm labourer  they knew very well that with the headkeeper in his present frame of mind it was a risky affair and they made a solemn compact that if caught they would stand by one another to the end and caught they were and on this occasion the keepers were four  at the very beginning the blacksmith their ablest man and virtual leader was knocked down senseless with a blow on his head with the butt end of a gun immediately on seeing this the two famous shearers took to their heels and the young labourer followed their example the brothers were left but refused to be taken although harbutt roared at them in his bulls voice that he would shoot them unless they surrendered they made light of his threats and fought against the four and eventually were separated by and by the younger of the two was driven into a brambly thicket where his opponents imagined that it would be impossible for him to escape but he was a youth of indomitable spirit strong and agile as a wild cat and returning blow for blow he succeeded in tearing himself from them then after a running fight through the darkest part of the wood for a distance of two or three hundred yards they at length lost him or gave him up and went back to assist harbutt and moses against the other man left to himself he got out of the wood and made his way back to the village it was long past midnight when he turned up at his fathers cottage a pitiable object covered with mud and blood hatless his clothes torn to shreds his face and whole body covered with bruises and bleeding wounds  the old man was in a great state of distress about his other son and early in the morning went to examine the ground where the fight had been it was only too easily found the sod was trampled down and branches broken as though a score of men had been engaged then he found his eldest sons cap and a little farther away a sleeve of his coat shreds and rags were numerous on the bramble bushes and by and by he came on a pool of blood theyve kill n he cried in despair theyve killed my poor boy and straight to rollston house he went to inquire and was met by harbutt himself who came out limping one boot on the other foot bound up with rags one arm in a sling and a cloth tied round his head he was told that his son was alive and safe indoors and that he would be taken to salisbury later in the day his clothes be all torn to pieces added the keeper you can just go home at once and git him others before the constable comes to take him  youve tored them to pieces yourself and you can git him others retorted the old man in a rage  very well said the keeper but bide a momentive something more to say to you when your son comes out of jail in a year or so you tell him from me that if hell just step up this way ill give him five shillings and as much beer as he likes to drink i never seed a better fighter  it was a great compliment to his son but the old men was troubled in his mind what dost mean keeper by a year or so he asked  when i said that returned the other with a grin i was just thinking what twould be he deserves to git  and youd agot your deserts by god cried the angry father if that boy of mine hadnt abeen left alone to fight ye  harbutt regarded him with a smile of gratified malice  you can go home now he said if youd see your son youll findn in salisbury jail maybe youll be wanting new locks on your doors you can git they in salisbury tooyouve no blacksmith in your village now no your boy werent alone and you know that damned well  i know naught about that he returned and started to walk home with a heavy heart until now he had been clinging to the hope that the other son had not been identified in the dark wood and now what could he do to save one of the two from hateful imprisonment the boy was not in a fit condition to make his escape he could hardly get across the room and could not sit or lie down without groaning he could only try to hide him in the cottage and pray that they would not discover him the cottage was in the middle of the village and had but little ground to it but there was a small boardedup cavity or cell at one end of an attic and it might be possible to save him by putting him in there here then in a bed placed for him on the floor his bruised son was obliged to lie in the close dark hole for some days  one day about a week later when he was recovering from his hurts he crawled out of his box and climbed down the narrow stairs to the ground floor to see the light and breathe a better air for a short time and while down he was tempted to take a peep at the street through the small latticed window but he quickly withdrew his head and by and by said to his father im feared moses has seen me just now when i was at the window he came by and looked up and seed me with my head all tied up and im feared he knew twas i  after that they could only wait in fear and trembling and on the next day quite early there came a loud rap at the door and on its being opened by the old man the constable and two keepers appeared standing before him  ive come to take your son said the constable  the old man stepped back without a word and took down his gun from its place on the wall then spoke it youve got a searchwarrant you may come in if you havent got n ill blow the brains out of the first man that puts a foot inside my door  they hesitated a few moments then silently withdrew after consulting together the constable went off to the nearest magistrate leaving the two keepers to keep watch on the house moses found was one of them later in the day the constable returned armed with a warrant and was thereupon admitted with the result that the poor youth was soon discovered in his hidingplace and carried off and that was the last he saw of his home his young sister crying bitterly and his old father white and trembling with grief and impotent rage  a month or two later the two brothers were tried and sentenced each to six months imprisonment they never came home on their release they went to woolwich where men were wanted and the pay was good and by and by the accounts they sent home induced first one then the other brother to go and join them and the poor old father who had been very proud of his five sons was left alone with his young daughterisaacs destined wife     chapter viii  shepherds and poaching    general remarks on poachingfarmer shepherd and doga sheepdog   that would not hunttaking a partridge from a hawkold gaarge and   young gaargepartridgepoachingthe shepherd robbed of his   rabbitswisdom of shepherd gathergoodharetrapping on the   downharetaking with a crook   when caleb was at length free from his fathers tutelage and as an undershepherd practically independent he did not follow isaacs strict example with regard to wild animals good for the pot which came by chance in his way he even allowed himself to go a little out of his way on occasion to get them  we know that about this matter the law of the land does not square with the moral law as it is written in the heart of the peasant a wounded partridge or other bird which he finds in his walks abroad or which comes by chance to him is his by a natural right and he will take and eat or dispose of it without scruple with rabbits he is very freehe doesnt wait to find a distressed one with a stoat on its trackstoats are not sufficiently abundant and a hare too may be picked up at any moment only in this case he must be very sure that no one is looking knowing the law and being perhaps a respectable religious person he is anxious to abstain from all appearance of evil this taking a hare or rabbit or wounded partridge is in his mind a very different thing from systematic poaching but he is aware that to the classes above him it is not sothe law has made them one it is a hard arbitrary unnatural law made by and for them his betters and outwardly he must conform to it thus you will find the best of men among the shepherds and labourers freely helping themselves to any wild creature that falls in their way yet sharing the gamepreservers hatred of the real poacher the village poacher as a rule is an idle dissolute fellow and the sober industrious righteous shepherd or ploughman or carter does not like to be put on a level with such a person but there is no escape from the hard and fast rule in such things and however open and truthful he may be in everything else in this one matter he is obliged to practise a certain amount of deception here is a case to serve as an illustration i have only just heard it after putting together the material i had collected for this chapter in conversation with an old shepherd friend of mine  he is a fine old man who has followed a flock these fifty years and will i have no doubt carry his crook for yet another ten not only is he a good shepherd in the sense in which caleb uses that phrase with a more intimate knowledge of sheep and all the ailments they are subject to than i have found in any other but he is also a truly religious man one that walks with god he told me this story of a sheepdog he owned when headshepherd on a large farm on the dorsetshire border with a master whose chief delight in life was in coursing hares they abounded on his land and he naturally wanted the men employed on the farm to regard them as sacred animals one day he came out to the shepherd to complain that some one had seen his dog hunting a hare  the shepherd indignantly asked who had said such a thing  never mind about that said the farmer is it true  it is a lie said the shepherd my dog never hunts a hare or anything else tis my belief the one that said that has got a dog himself that hunts the hares and he wants to put the blame on some one else  may be so said the farmer unconvinced  just then a hare made its appearance coming across the field directly towards them and either because they never moved or it did not smell them it came on and on stopping at intervals to sit for a minute or so on its haunches then on again until it was within forty yards of where they were standing the farmer watched it approach and at the same time kept an eye on the dog sitting at their feet and watching the hare too very steadily now shepherd said the farmer dont you say one word to the dog and ill see for myself not a word did he say and the hare came and sat for some seconds near them then limped away out of sight and the dog made not the slightest movement thats all right said the farmer well pleased i know now twas a lie i heard about your dog ive seen for myself and ill just keep a sharp eye on the man that told me  my comment on this story was that the farmer had displayed an almost incredible ignorance of a sheepdogand a shepherd how would it have been if you had said catch him bob or whatever his name was i asked  he looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and replied i do blieve hed ha got n but hed never move till i told n  it comes to this the shepherd refuses to believe that by taking a hare he is robbing any man of his property and if he is obliged to tell a lie to save himself from the consequences he does not consider that it is a lie  when he understood that i was on his side in this question he told me about a good sheepdog he once possessed which he had to get rid of because he would not take a hare  a dog when broken is made to distinguish between the things he must and must not do he is feelingly persuaded by kind words and caresses in one case and hard words and hard blows in the other he learns that if he hunts hares and rabbits it will be very bad for him and in due time after some suffering he is able to overcome this strongest instinct of a dog he acquires an artificial conscience then when his education is finished he must be made to understand that it is not quite finished after allthat he must partially unlearn one of the saddest of the lessons instilled in him he must hunt a hare or rabbit when told by his master to do so it is a compact between man and dog thus they have got a law which the dog has sworn to obey but the man who made it is above the law and can when he thinks proper command his servant to break it the dog as a rule takes it all in very readily and often allows himself more liberty than his master gives him the most highly accomplished animal is one that like my shepherds dog in the former instance will not stir till he is told in the other case the poor brute could not rise to the position it was too complex for him and when ordered to catch a rabbit he could only put his tail between his legs and look in a puzzled way at his master why do you tell me to do a thing for which i shall be thrashed  it was only after caleb had known me some time when we were fast friends that he talked with perfect freedom of these things and told me of his own small illicit takings without excuse or explanation  one day he saw a sparrowhawk dash down upon a running partridge and struggle with it on the ground it was in a grass field divided from the one he was walking in by a large unkept hedge without a gap in it to let him through presently the hawk rose up with the partridge still violently struggling in its talons and flew over the hedge to calebs side but was no sooner over than it came down again and the struggle went on once more on the ground on caleb running to the spot the hawk flew off leaving his prey behind he had grasped it in its sides driving his sharp claws well in and the partridge though unable to fly was still alive the shepherd killed it and put it in his pocket and enjoyed it very much when he came to eat it  from this case a most innocent form of poaching he went on to relate how he had once been able to deprive a cunning poacher and bad man a human sparrowhawk of his quarry  there were two persons in the village father and son he very heartily detested known respectively as old gaarge and young gaarge inveterate poachers both they were worse than the real reprobate who haunted the publichouse and did no work and was not ashamed of his evil ways for these two were hypocrites and were outwardly sober righteous men who kept themselves a little apart from their neighbours and were very severe in their condemnation of other peoples faults  one sunday morning caleb was on his way to his ewes folded at a distance from the village walking by a hedgerow at the foot of the down when he heard a shot fired some way ahead and after a minute or two a second shot this greatly excited his curiosity and caused him to keep a sharp lookout in the direction the sounds had come from and by and by he caught sight of a man walking towards him it was old gaarge in his long smockfrock proceeding in a leisurely way towards the village but catching sight of the shepherd he turned aside through a gap in the hedge and went off in another direction to avoid meeting him no doubt thought caleb he has got his gun in two pieces hidden under his smock he went on until he came to a small field of oats which had grown badly and had only been half reaped and here he discovered that old gaarge had been lying in hiding to shoot at the partridges that came to feed he had been screened from the sight of the birds by a couple of hurdles and some straw and there were feathers of the birds he had shot scattered about he had finished his sunday mornings sport and was going back a little too late on this occasion as it turned out  caleb went on to his flock but before getting to it his dog discovered a dead partridge in the hedge it had flown that far and then dropped and there was fresh blood on its feathers he put it in his pocket and carried it about most of the day while with his sheep on the down late in the afternoon he spied two magpies pecking at something out in the middle of a field and went to see what they had found it was a second partridge which old gaarge had shot in the morning and had lost the bird having flown to some distance before dropping the magpies had probably found it already dead as it was cold they had begun tearing the skin at the neck and had opened it down to the breastbone caleb took this bird too and by and by sitting down to examine it he thought he would try to mend the torn skin with the needle and thread he always carried inside his cap he succeeded in stitching it neatly up and putting back the feathers in their place the rent was quite concealed that evening he took the two birds to a man in the village who made a livelihood by collecting bones rags and things of that kind the man took the birds in his hand held them up felt their weight examined them carefully and pronounced them to be two good fat birds and agreed to pay two shillings for them  such a man may be found in most villages he calls himself a general dealer and keeps a trap and ponyin some cases he keeps the alehouseand is a useful member of the small rural communitya sort of human carrioncrow  the two shillings were very welcome but more than the money was the pleasing thought that he had got the bird shot by the hypocritical old poacher for his own profit caleb had good cause to hate him he caleb was one of the shepherds who had his masters permission to take rabbits on the land and having found his snares broken on many occasions he came to the conclusion that they were visited in the night time by some very cunning person who kept a watch on his movements one evening he set five snares in a turnip field and went just before daylight next morning in a dense fog to visit them every one was broken he had just started on his way back feeling angry and much puzzled at such a thing when the fog all at once passed away and revealed the figures of two men walking hurriedly off over the down they were at a considerable distance but the light was now strong enough to enable him to identify old gaarge and young gaarge in a few moments they vanished over the brow caleb was mad at being deprived of his rabbits in this mean way but pleased at the same time in having discovered who the culprits were but what to do about it he did not know  on the following day he was with his flock on the down and found himself near another shepherd also with his sheep one he knew very well a quiet but knowing old man named joseph gathergood he was known to be a skilful rabbitcatcher and caleb thought he would go over to him and tell him about how he was being tricked by the two gaarges and ask him what to do in the matter  the old man was very friendly and at once told him what to do dont you set no more snares by the hedges and in the turmots he said set them out on the open down where no one would go after rabbits and theyll not find the snares and this was how it had to be done first he was to scrape the ground with the heel of his boot until the fresh earth could be seen through the broken turf then he was to sprinkle a little rabbit scent on the scraped spot and plant his snare the scent and smell of the fresh earth combined would draw the rabbits to the spot they would go there to scratch and would inevitably get caught if the snare was properly placed  caleb tried this plan with one snare and on the following morning found that he had a rabbit he set it again that evening then again until he had caught five rabbits on five consecutive nights all with the same snare that convinced him that he had been taught a valuable lesson and that old gathergood was a very wise man about rabbits and he was very happy to think that he had got the better of his two sneaking enemies  but shepherd gathergood was just as wise about hares and as in the other case he took them out on the down in the most open places his success was due to his knowledge of the hares taste for blackthorn twigs he would take a good strong blackthorn stem or shoot with twigs on it and stick it firmly down in the middle of a large grass field or on the open down and place the steel trap tied to the stick at a distance of a foot or so from it the trap concealed under grass or moss and dead leaves the smell of the blackthorn would draw the hare to the spot and he would move round and round nibbling the twigs until caught  caleb never tried this plan but was convinced that gathergood was right about it  he told me of another shepherd who was clever at taking hares in another way and who was often chaffed by his acquaintances on account of the extraordinary length of his shepherds crook it was like a lance or pole being twice the usual length but he had a use for it this shepherd used to make hares forms on the downs in all suitable places forming them so cunningly that no one seeing them by chance would have believed they were the work of human hands the hares certainly made use of them when out with his flock he would visit these forms walking quietly past them at a distance of twenty to thirty feet his dog following at his heels on catching sight of a hare crouching in a form he would drop a word and the dog would instantly stand still and remain fixed and motionless while the shepherd went on but in a circle so as gradually to approach the form meanwhile the hare would keep his eyes fixed on the dog paying no attention to the man until by and by the long staff would be swung round and a blow descend on the poor silly head from the opposite side and if the blow was not powerful enough to stun or disable the hare the dog would have it before it got many yards from the cosy nest prepared for its destruction     chapter ix  the shepherd on foxes    a foxtrapping shepherdgamekeepers and foxesfox and stoata   gamekeeper off his guardpheasants and foxescaleb kills a foxa   foxhunting sheepdogtwo varieties of foxesrabbits playing with   little foxeshow to expel foxesa playful spirit in the   foxfoxhunting a danger to sheep   caleb related that his friend shepherd gathergood was a great foxkiller and as with hares he took them in a way of his own he said that the fox will always go to a heap of ashes in any open place and his plan was to place a steel trap concealed among the ashes made fast to a stick about three feet high firmly planted in the middle of the heap with a piece of strongsmelling cheese tied to the top the two attractions of an ashheap and the smell of strong cheese was more than any fox could resist when he caught a fox he killed and buried it on the down and said nothing to nobody about it he killed them to protect himself from their depredations foxes like old gaarge and his son in calebs case went round at night to rob him of the rabbits he took in his snares  caleb never blamed him for this on the contrary he greatly admired him for his courage seeing that if it had been found out he would have been a marked man it was perhaps intelligence or cunning rather than courage he did not believe that he would be found out and he never was he told caleb of these things because he was sure of his man those who were interested in the hunt never suspected him and as to gamekeepers they hardly counted he was helping them no one hates a fox more than they do the farmer gets compensation for damage and the henwife is paid for her stolen chickens by the hunt the keeper is required to look after the game and at the same time to spare his chief enemy the fox indeed the keepers state of mind with regard to foxes has always been a source of amusement to me and by long practice i am able to talk to him on that delicate subject in a way to make him uncomfortable and selfcontradictory there are various quite innocent questions which the student of wild life may put to a keeper about foxes which have a disturbing effect on his brain how to expel foxes from a covert for example and here is another is it true that the fox listens for the distressed cries of a rabbit pursued by a stoat and that he will deprive the stoat of his captive perhaps yes no i dont think so because one hunts by night the other by day he will answer but you see that the question troubles him one keeper off his guard promptly answered ive no doubt of it i can always bring a fox to me by imitating the cry of a rabbit hunted by a stoat but he did not say what his object was in attracting the fox  i say that the keeper was off his guard in this instance because the fiction that foxes were preserved on the estate was kept up though as a fact they were systematically destroyed by the keepers as the pheasantbreeding craze appears to increase rather than diminish notwithstanding the disastrous effect it has had in alienating the people from their lords and masters the conflict of interest between foxhunter and pheasantbreeder will tend to become more and more acute and the probable end will be that foxhunting will have to go a melancholy outlook to those who love the country and old country sports and who do not regard pheasantshooting as now followed as sport at all it is a delusion of the landlords that the country people think most highly of the great pheasantpreserver who has two or three big shoots in a season during which vast numbers of birds are slaughteredevery bird costing a guinea as the saying is it brings money into the country he or his apologist tells you and provides employment for the village poor in october and november when there is little doing he does not know the truth of the matter a certain number of the poorer people of the village are employed as beaters for the big shoots at a shilling a day or so and occasionally a labourer going to or from his work finds a pheasants nest and informs the keeper and receives some slight reward if he keeps his eyes open and shows himself anxious at all times to serve the keeper he will sometimes get a rabbit for his sunday dinner  this is not a sufficient return for the freedom to walk on the land and in woods which the villager possessed formerly even in his worst days of his oppression a liberty which has now been taken from him the keeper is there now to prevent him he was there before and from of old but the pheasant was not yet a sacred bird and it didnt matter that a man walked on the turf or picked up a few fallen sticks in a wood the keeper is there to tell him to keep to the road and sometimes to ask him even when he is on the road what is he looking over the hedge for he slinks obediently away he is only a poor labourer with his living to get and he cannot afford to offend the man who stands between him and the lord and the lords tenant and he is inarticulate but the insolence and injustice rankle in his heart for he is not altogether a helot in soul and the result is that the seditionmongers the socialists the furious denouncers of all landlords who are now quartering the country and whose vans i meet in the remotest villages are listened to and their wordswild and whirling words they may beare sinking into the hearts of the agricultural labourers of the new generation  to return to foxes and gamekeepers there are other estates where the fiction of foxpreserving is kept up no longer where it is notorious that the landlord is devoted exclusively to the gun and to pheasantbreeding on one of the big estates i am familiar with in wiltshire the keepers openly say they will not suffer a fox and every villager knows it and will give information of a fox to the keepers and looks to be rewarded with a rabbit all this is undoubtedly known to the lord of the manor his servants are only carrying out his own wishes although he still subscribes to the hunt and occasionally attends the meet the entire hunt may unite in cursing him but they must do so below their breath it would have a disastrous effect to spread it abroad that he is a persecutor of foxes  caleb disliked foxes too but not to the extent of killing them he did once actually kill one when a young undershepherd but it was accident rather than intention  one day he found a small gap in a hedge which had been made or was being used by a hare and thinking to take it he set a trap at the spot tying it securely to a root and covering it over with dead leaves on going to the place the next morning he could see nothing until his feet were on the very edge of the ditch when with startling suddenness a big dog fox sprang up at him with a savage snarl it was caught by a hindleg and had been lying concealed among the dead leaves close under the bank caleb angered at finding a fox when he had looked for a hare and at the attack the creature had made on him dealt it a blow on the head with his heavy stickjust one blow given on the impulse of the moment but it killed the fox he felt very bad at what he had done and began to think of consequences he took it from the trap and hid it away under the dead leaves beneath the hedge some yards from the gap and then went to his work during the day one of the farm hands went out to speak to him he was a small quiet old man a discreet friend and caleb confided to him what he had done leave it to me said his old friend and went back to the farm in the afternoon caleb was standing on the top of the down looking towards the village when he spied at a great distance the old man coming out to the hills and by and by he could make out that he had a sack on his back and a spade in his hand when halfway up the side of the hill he put his burden down and set to work digging a deep pit into this he put the dead fox and threw in and trod down the earth then carefully put back the turf in its place then his task done shouldered the spade and departed caleb felt greatly relieved for now the fox was buried out on the downs and no one would ever know that he had wickedly killed it  subsequently he had other foxes caught in traps set for hares but was always able to release them about one he had the following story the dog he had at that time named monk hated foxes as jack hated adders and would hunt them savagely whenever he got a chance one morning caleb visited a trap he had set in a gap in a hedge and found a fox in it the fox jumped up snarling and displaying his teeth ready to fight for dear life and it was hard to restrain monk from flying at him so excited was he that only when his master threatened him with his crook did he draw back and sitting on his haunches left him to deal with the difficult business in his own way the difficulty was to open the steel trap without putting himself in the way of a bite from those tarrable sharp teeth after a good deal of manoeuvring he managed to set the butt end of his crook on the handle of the gin and forcing it down until the iron teeth relaxed their grip the fox pulled his foot out and darting away along the hedge side vanished into the adjoining copse away went monk after him in spite of his masters angry commands to him to come back and fox and dog disappeared almost together among the trees sounds of yelping and of crashing through the undergrowth came back fainter and fainter and then there was silence caleb waited at the spot full twenty minutes before the disobedient dog came back looking very pleased he had probably succeeded in overtaking and killing his enemy  about that same monk a sad story will have to be told in another chapter  when speaking of foxes caleb always maintained that in his part of the country there were two sorts one small and very red the larger one of a lighter colour with some grey in it and it is possible that the hill foxes differed somewhat in size and colour from those of the lower country he related that one year two vixens littered at one spot a deep bottom among the downs so near together that when the cubs were big enough to come out they mixed and played in company the vixens happened to be of the different sorts and the difference in colour appeared in the little ones as well  caleb was so taken with the pretty sight of all these little foxes neighbours and playmates that he went evening after evening to sit for an hour or longer watching them one thing he witnessed which will perhaps be disbelieved by those who have not closely observed animals for themselves and who still hold to the fable that all wild creatures are born with an inherited and instinctive knowledge and dread of their enemies rabbits swarmed at that spot and he observed that when the old foxes were not about the young halfgrown rabbits would freely mix and play with the little foxes he was so surprised at this never having heard of such a thing that he told his master of it and the farmer went with him on a moonlight night and the two sat for a long time together and saw rabbits and foxes playing pursuing one another round and round the rabbits when pursued often turning very suddenly and jumping clean over their pursuer  the rabbits at this place belonged to the tenant and the farmer after enjoying the sight of the little ones playing together determined to get rid of the foxes in the usual way by exploding a small quantity of gunpowder in the burrows four old foxes with nine cubs were too many for him to have the powder was duly burned and the very next day the foxes had vanished  in berkshire i once met with that rare being an intelligent gamekeeper who took an interest in wild animals and knew from observation a great deal about their habits during an aftersupper talk kept up till past midnight we discussed the subject of strange erratic actions in animals which in some cases appear contrary to their own natures he gave an instance of such behaviour in a fox that had its earth at a spot on the border of a wood where rabbits were abundant one evening he was at this spot standing among the trees and watching a number of rabbits feeding and gambolling on the green turf when the fox came trotting by and the rabbits paid no attention suddenly he stopped and made a dart at a rabbit the rabbit ran from him a distance of twenty to thirty yards then suddenly turning round went for the fox and chased it back some distance after which the fox again chased the rabbit and so they went on turn and turn about half a dozen times it was evident he said that the fox had no wish to catch and kill a rabbit that it was nothing but play on his part and that the rabbits responded in the same spirit knowing that there was nothing to fear  another instance of this playful spirit of the fox with an enemy which i heard recently is of a gentleman who was out with his dog a foxterrier for an evening walk in some woods near his house on his way back he discovered on coming out of the woods that a fox was following him at a distance of about forty yards when he stood still the fox sat down and watched the dog the dog appeared indifferent to its presence until his master ordered him to go for the fox whereupon he charged him and drove him back to the edge of the wood but at that point the fox turned and chased the dog right back to its master then once more sat down and appeared very much at his ease again the dog was encouraged to go for him and hunted him again back to the wood and was then in turn chased back to its master after several repetitions of this performance the gentleman went home the fox still following and on going in closed the gate behind him leaving the fox outside sitting in the road as if waiting for him to come out again to have some more fun  this incident serves to remind me of an experience i had one evening in kings copse an immense wood of oak and pine in the new forest near exbury it was growing dark when i heard on or close to the ground some twenty to thirty yards before me a low wailing cry resembling the hungercry of the young longeared owl i began cautiously advancing trying to see it but as i advanced the cry receded as if the bird was flitting from me now just after i had begun following the sound a fox uttered his sudden startlingly loud scream about forty yards away on my right hand and the next moment a second fox screamed on my left and from that time i was accompanied or shadowed by the two foxes always keeping abreast of me always at the same distance one screaming and the other replying about every halfminute the distressful birdsound ceased and i turned and went off in another direction to get out of the wood on the side nearest the place where i was staying the foxes keeping with me until i was out  what moved them to act in such a way is a mystery but it was perhaps play to them  another curious instance of foxes playing was related to me by a gentleman at the little village of inkpen near the beacon in berkshire he told me that when it happened a good many years ago he sent an account of it to the field his gamekeeper took him one day to see a strange thing to a spot in the woods where a fox had a litter of four cubs near a long smooth green slope a little distance from the edge of the slope three round swedes were lying on the turf how do you think these swedes came here said the keeper and then proceeded to say that the old fox must have brought them there from the field a long distance away for her cubs to play with he had watched them of an evening and wanted his master to come and see too accordingly they went in the evening and hiding themselves among the bushes near waited till the young foxes came out and began rolling the swedes about and jumping at and tumbling over them by and by one rolled down the slope and the young foxes went after it all the way down and then when they had worried it sufficiently they returned to the top and played with another swede until that was rolled down then with the third one in the same way every morning the keeper said the swedes were found back on top of the ground and he had no doubt that they were taken up by the old fox again and left there for her cubs to play with  caleb was not so eager after rabbits as shepherd gathergood but he disliked the fox for another reason he considered that the hunted fox was a great danger to sheep when the ewes were heavy with lambs and when the chase brought the animal near if not right into the flock he had one dreadful memory of a hunted fox trying to lose itself in his flock of heavysided ewes and the hounds following it and driving the poor sheep mad with terror the result was that a large number of lambs were cast before their time and many others were poor sickly things many of the sheep also suffered in health he had no extra money from the lambs that year he received but a shilling half a crown is often paid now for every lamb above the number of ewes and as a rule received from three to six pounds a year from this source     chapter x  bird life on the downs    great bustardstone curlewbig hawksformer

or a place name bustard inn no longer an inn is well known to the many thousands who now go to the mimic wars on salisbury plain and there is a trappist monastery in a village on the southernmost border of the county which was once called and is still known to old men as bustard farm all that caleb bawcombe knew of this grandest bird is what his father had told him and isaac knew of it only from hearsay although it was still met with in south wilts when he was a young man  the stone curlew our little bustard with the long wings big yellow eyes and wild voice still frequents the uncultivated downs unhappily in diminishing numbers for the private collectors desire to possess britishtaken birds eggs does not diminish i doubt if more than one clutch in ten escapes the searching eyes of the poor shepherds and labourers who are hired to supply the cabinets one pair haunted a flinty spot at winterbourne bishop until a year or two ago at other points a few miles away i watched other pairs during the summer of 1909 but in every instance their eggs were taken  the larger hawks and the raven which bred in all the woods and forests of wiltshire have of course been extirpated by the gamekeepers the biggest forest in the county now affords no refuge to any hawk above the size of a kestrel savernake is extensive enough one would imagine for condors to hide in but it is not so a few years ago a buzzard made its appearance therejust a common buzzard and the entire surrounding population went mad with excitement about it and every man who possessed a gun flew to the forest to join in the hunt until the wretched bird after being blazed at for two or three days was brought down i heard of another case at fonthill abbey nobody could say what this wandering hawk wasit was very big blue above with a white breast barred with blacka tarrable fiercelooking bird with fierce yellow eyes all the gamekeepers and several other men with guns were in hot pursuit of it for several days until some one fatally wounded it but it could not be found where it was supposed to have fallen a fortnight later its carcass was discovered by an old shepherd who told me the story it was not in a fit state to be preserved but he described it to me and i have no doubt that it was a goshawk  the raven survived longer and the shepherd bawcombe talks about its abundance when he was a boy seventy or more years ago his way of accounting for its numbers at that time and its subsequent somewhat rapid disappearance greatly interested me  we have seen his account of deerstealing by the villagers in those brave old starvation days when lord rivers owned the deer and hunting rights over a large part of wiltshire extending from cranborne chase to salisbury and when even so righteous a man as isaac bawcombe was tempted by hunger to take an occasional deer discovered out of bounds at that time caleb said a good many dogs used for hunting the deer were kept a few miles from winterbourne bishop and were fed by the keepers in a very primitive manner old wornout horses were bought and slaughtered for the dogs a horse would be killed and stripped of his hide somewhere away in the woods and left for the hounds to batten on its flesh tearing at and fighting over it like so many jackals when only partially consumed the carcass would become putrid then another horse would be killed and skinned at another spot perhaps a mile away and the pack would start feeding afresh there the result of so much carrion lying about was that ravens were attracted in numbers to the place and were so numerous as to be seen in scores together later when the deerhunting sport declined in the neighbourhood and dogs were no longer fed on carrion the birds decreased year by year and when caleb was a boy of nine or ten their former great abundance was but a memory but he remembers that they were still fairly common and he had much to say about the old belief that the raven smells death and when seen hovering over a flock uttering its croak it is a sure sign that a sheep is in a bad way and will shortly die  one of his recollections of the bird may be given here it was one of those things seen in boyhood which had very deeply impressed him one fine day he was on the down with an elder brother when they heard the familiar croak and spied three birds at a distance engaged in a fight in the air two of the birds were in pursuit of the third and rose alternately to rush upon and strike at their victim from above they were coming down from a considerable height and at last were directly over the boys not more than forty or fifty feet from the ground and the youngsters were amazed at their fury the loud rushing sound of their wings as of a torrent and of their deep hoarse croaks and savage barking cries then they began to rise again the hunted bird trying to keep above his enemies they in their turn striving to rise higher still so as to rush down upon him from overhead and in this way they towered higher and higher their barking cries coming fainter and fainter back to earth until the boys not to lose sight of them cast themselves down flat on their backs and continuing to gaze up saw them at last no bigger than three leetle blackbirds then they vanished but the boys still lying on their backs kept their eyes fixed on the same spot and by and by first one black speck reappeared then a second and they soon saw that two birds were swiftly coming down to earth they fell swiftly and silently and finally pitched upon the down not more than a couple of hundred yards from the boys the hunted bird had evidently succeeded in throwing them off and escaping probably it was one of their own young for the ravens habit is when their young are fully grown to hunt them out of the neighbourhood or when they cannot drive them off to kill them  there is no doubt that the carrion did attract ravens in numbers to this part of wiltshire but it is a fact that up to that dateabout 1830the bird had many wellknown old breedingplaces in the county the rev a c smith in his birds of wiltshire names twentythree breedingplaces no fewer than nine of them on salisbury plain but at the date of the publication of his work 1887 only three of all these nestingplaces were still in use south tidworth wilton park and compton park compton chamberlain doubtless there were other ancient breedingplaces which the author had not heard of one was at the great ridge wood overlooking the wylye valley where ravens bred down to about thirtyfive or forty years ago i have found many old men in that neighbourhood who remember the birds and they tell that the raven tree was a great oak which was cut down about sixty years ago after which the birds built their nest in another tree not far away a london friend of mine who was born in the neighbourhood of the great ridge wood remembers the ravens as one of the common sights of the place when he was a boy he tells of an unlucky farmer in those parts whose sheep fell sick and died in numbers year after year bringing him down to the brink of ruin and how his old headshepherd would say solemnly shaking his head tis not strangemaster he shot a raven  there was no ravens breedingplace very near winterbourne bishop caleb had never heared tell of a nestie but he had once seen the nest of another species which is supposed never to breed in this country he was a small boy at the time when one day an old shepherd of the place going out from the village saw caleb and calling to him said youre the boy that likes birds if youll come with me ill show ee what no man ever seed afore and caleb fired with curiosity followed him away to a distance from home out from the downs into the woods and to a place where he had never been where there were bracken and heath with birch and thorntrees scattered about on cautiously approaching a clump of birches they saw a big thrushlike bird fly out of a large nest about ten feet from the ground and settle on a tree close by where it was joined by its mate the old man pointed out that it was a felt or fieldfare a thrush nearly as big as the mistlethrush but different in colour and he said that it was a bird that came to england in flocks in winter from no man knows where far off in the north and always went away before breedingtime this was the only felt he had ever seen breeding in this country and he didnt believe that no man had ever seed such a thing before he would not climb the tree to see the eggs or even go very near it for fear of disturbing the birds  this man caleb said was a great one for birds he knew them all but seldom said anything about them he watched and found out a good deal about them just for his private pleasure  the characteristic species of this part of the down country comprising the parish of winterbourne bishop are the pewit magpie turtledove mistlethrush and starling the pewit is universal on the hills but will inevitably be driven away from all that portion of salisbury plain used for military purposes the mistlethrush becomes common in summer after its early breeding season is ended when the birds in small flocks resort to the downs where they continue until cold weather drives them away to the shelter of the wooded low country  in this neighbourhood there are thickets of thorn holly bramble and birch growing over hundreds of acres of down and here the hillmagpie as it is called has its chief breedingground and is so common that you can always get a sight of at least twenty birds in an afternoons walk here too is the metropolis of the turtledove and the low sound of its crooning is heard all day in summer the other most common sound being that of magpiestheir subdued conversational chatter and their solosinging the chant or call which a bird will go on repeating for a hundred times the wonder is how the doves succeed in such a place in hatching any couple of chalkwhite eggs placed on a small platform of sticks or of rearing any pair of young conspicuous in their blue skins and bright yellow down  the keepers tell me they get even with these killbirds later in the year when they take to roosting in the woods a mile away in the valley the birds are waited for at some point where they are accustomed to slip in at dark and one keeper told me that on one evening alone assisted by a friend he had succeeded in shooting thirty birds  on winterbourne bishop down and round the village the magpies are not persecuted probably because the gamekeepers the professional birdkillers have lost heart in this place it is a curious and rather pretty story there is no squire as we have seen the farmers have the rabbits and for game the shooting is let or to let by some one who claims to be lord of the manor who lives at a distance or abroad at all events he is not known personally to the people and all they know about the overlordship is that whereas in years gone by every villager had certain rights in the downto cut furze and keep a cow or pony or donkey or half a dozen sheep or goatsnow they have none but how and why and when these rights were lost nobody knows naturally there is no sympathy between the villagers and the keepers sent from a distance to protect the game so that the shooting may be let to some other stranger on the contrary they religiously destroy every nest they can find with the result that there are too few birds for anyone to take the shooting and it remains year after year unlet  this unsettled state of things is all to the advantage of the black and white bird with the ornamental tail and he flourishes accordingly and builds his big thorny nests in the roadside trees about the village  the one big bird on these downs as in so many other places in england is the rook and let us humbly thank the gods who own this green earth and all the creatures which inhabit it that they have in their goodness left us this one for it is something to have a rook although he is not a great bird compared with the great ones lostbustard and kite and raven and goshawk and many others his abundance on the cultivated downs is rather strange when one remembers the outcry made against him in some parts on account of his injurious habits but here it appears the sentiment in his favour is just as strong in the farmer or in a good many farmers as in the great landlord the biggest rookery i know on salisbury plain is at a farmhouse where the farmer owns the land himself and cultivates about nine hundred acres one would imagine that he would keep his rooks down in these days when a boy cannot be hired to scare the birds from the crops  one day near west knoyle i came upon a vast company of rooks busily engaged on a ploughed field where everything short of placing a birdscarer on the ground had been done to keep the birds off a score of rooks had been shot and suspended to long sticks planted about the field and there were three formidablelooking men of straw and rags with hats on their heads and wooden guns under their arms but the rooks were there all the same i counted seven at one spot prodding the earth close to the feet of one of the scarecrows i went into the field to see what they were doing and found that it was sown with vetches just beginning to come up and the birds were digging the seed up  three months later near the same spot on mere down i found these birds feasting on the corn when it had been long cut but could not be carried on account of the wet weather it was a large field of fifty to sixty acres and as i walked by it the birds came flying leisurely over my head to settle with loud cawings on the stocks it was a magnificent sightthe great blueblack birdforms on the golden wheat an animated group of three or four to half a dozen on every stock while others walked about the ground to pick up the scattered grain and others were flying over them for just then the sun was shining on the field and beyond it the sky was blue never had i witnessed birds so manifestly rejoicing at their good fortune with happy loud cawcaw or rather hawhaw what a harvest what abundance was there ever a more perfect august and september rain rain by night and in the morning then sun and wind to dry our feathers and make us glad but never enough to dry the corn to enable them to carry it and build it up in stacks where it would be so much harder to get at could anything be better  but the commonest bird the one which vastly outnumbers all the others i have named together is the starling it was caleb bawcombes favourite bird and i believe it is regarded with peculiar affection by all shepherds on the downs on account of its constant association with sheep in the pasture the dog the sheep and the crowd of starlingsthese are the lonely mans companions during his long days on the hills from april or may to november and what a wise bird he is and how well he knows his friends and his enemies there was nothing more beautiful to see caleb would say than the behaviour of a flock of starlings when a hawk was about if it was a kestrel they took little or no notice of it but if a sparrowhawk made its appearance instantly the crowd of birds could be seen flying at furious speed towards the nearest flock of sheep and down into the flock they would fall like a shower of stones and instantly disappear from sight there they would remain on the ground among the legs of the grazing sheep until the hawk had gone on his way and passed out of sight  the sparrowhawks victims are mostly made among the young birds that flock together in summer and live apart from the adults during the summer months after the breeding season is over  when i find a dead starling on the downs ranged over by sparrowhawks it is almost always a young birda brown thrush as it used to be called by the old naturalists you may know that the slayer was a sparrowhawk by the appearance of the bird its body untouched but the flesh picked neatly from the neck and the head gone that was swallowed whole after the beak had been cut off you will find the beak lying by the side of the body in summertime when birds are most abundant after the breeding season the sparrowhawk is a fastidious feeder     chapter xi  starlings and sheepbells    starlings singingnative and borrowed soundsimitations of   sheepbellsthe shepherd on sheepbellsthe bells for pleasure   not usea dog in charge of the flockshepherd calling his   sheeprichard warner of bathploughmen singing to their oxen   in cornwalla shepherds loud singing   the subject of starlings associating with sheep has served to remind me of something i have often thought when listening to their music it happens that i am writing this chapter in a small village on salisbury plain the time being midseptember 1909 and that just outside my door there is a group of old elderbushes laden just now with clusters of ripe berries on which the starlings come to feed filling the room all day with that neverending medley of sounds which is their song they sing in this way not only when they singthat is to say when they make a serious business of it standing motionless and ashiver on the tiles wings drooping and open beak pointing upwards but also when they are feasting on fruitsinging and talking and swallowing elderberries between whiles to wet their whistles if the weather is not too cold you will hear this music daily wet or dry all the year round we may say that of all singing birds they are most vocal yet have no set song i doubt if they have more than half a dozen to a dozen sounds or notes which are the same in every individual and their very own one of them is a clear soft musical whistle slightly inflected another a kissing sound usually repeated two or three times or oftener a somewhat percussive smack still another a sharp prolonged hissing or sibilant but at the same time metallic note compared by some one to the sound produced by milking a cow into a tin paila very good description there are other lesser notes a musical thrushlike chirp repeated slowly and sometimes rapidly till it runs to a bubbling sound also there is a horny sound which is perhaps produced by striking upon the edges of the lower mandible with those of the upper but it is quite unlike the loud hard noise made by the stork the poor stork being a dumb bird has made a sort of policemans rattle of his huge beak these sounds do not follow each other they come from time to time the intervals being filled up with others in such endless variety each bird producing its own notes that one can but suppose that they are imitations we know in fact that the starling is our greatest mimic and that he often succeeds in recognizable reproductions of single notes of phrases and occasionally of entire songs as for instance that of the blackbird but in listening to him we are conscious of his imitations even when at his best he amuses rather than delightshe is not like the mockingbird his common starling pipe cannot produce sounds of pure and beautiful quality like the blackbirds oboevoice to quote davidsons apt phrase he emits this song in a strangely subdued tone producing the effect of a blackbird heard singing at a considerable distance and so with innumerable other notes calls and songsthey are often to their originals what a mans voice heard on a telephone is to his natural voice he succeeds best as a rule in imitations of the coarser metallic sounds and as his medley abounds in a variety of little measured tinkling and clinking notes as of tappings on a metal plate it has struck me at times that these are probably borrowed from the sheepbells of which the bird hears so much in his feedinggrounds it is however not necessary to suppose that every starling gets these sounds directly from the bells the birds undoubtedly mimic one another as is the case with mockingbirds and the young might easily acquire this part of their song language from the old birds without visiting the flocks in the pastures  the sheepbell in its halfmuffled strokes as of a small hammer tapping on an iron or copper plate is one would imagine a sound well within the starlings range easily imitated therefore specially attractive to him  butto pass to another subjectwhat does the shepherd himself think or feel about it and why does he have bells on his sheep  he thinks a great deal of his bells he pipes not like the shepherd of fable or of the pastoral poets nor plays upon any musical instrument and seldom sings or even whistlesthat sorry substitute for song he loves music nevertheless and gets it in his sheepbells and he likes it in quantity how many bells have you got on your sheepit sounds as if you had a great many i asked of a shepherd the other day feeding his flock near old sarum and he replied just forty and i wish there were eighty twentyfive or thirty is a more usual number but only because of their cost for the shepherd has very little money for bells or anything else another told me that he had only thirty but he intended getting more the sound cheers him it is not exactly monotonous owing to the bells being of various sizes and also greatly varying in thickness so that they produce different tones from the sharp tinkletinkle of the smallest to the sonorous klonkklonk of the big copper bell then too they are differently agitated some quietly when the sheep are grazing with heads down others rapidly as the animal walks or trots on and there are little bursts or peals when a sheep shakes its head all together producing a kind of rude harmonya music which like that of bagpipes or of chiming churchbells heard from a distance is akin to natural music and accords with rural scenes  as to use there is little or none a shepherd will sometimes say when questioned on the subject that the bells tell him just where the flock is or in which direction they are travelling but he knows better the one who is not afraid to confess the simple truth of the matter to a stranger will tell you that he does not need the bells to tell him where the sheep are or in which direction they are grazing his eyes are good enough for that the bells are for his solace or pleasure alone it may be that the sheep like the tinkling tooit is his belief that they do like it a shepherd said to me a few days ago it is lonesome with the flock on the downs more so in cold wet weather when you perhaps dont see a person all dayon some days not even at a distance much less to speak to the bells keep us from feeling it too much we know what we have them for and the more we have the better we like it they are company to us  even in fair weather he seldom has anyone to speak to a visit from an idle man who will sit down and have a pipe and talk with him is a day to be long remembered and even to date events from twas the monthmay june or octoberwhen the stranger came out to the down and talked to i  one day in september when sauntering over mere down one of the most extensive and loneliestlooking sheepwalks in south wiltsa vast elevated plain or tableland a portion of which is known as white sheet hilli passed three flocks of sheep all with many bells and noticed that each flock produced a distinctly different sound or effect owing doubtless to a different number of big and little bells in each and it struck me that any shepherd on a dark night or if taken blindfolded over the downs would be able to identify his own flock by the sound at the last of the three flocks a curious thing occurred there was no shepherd with it or anywhere in sight but a dog was in charge i found him lying apparently asleep in a hollow by the side of a stick and an old sack i called to him but instead of jumping up and coming to me as he would have done if his master had been there he only raised his head looked at me then put his nose down on his paws again i am on dutyin sole chargeand you must not speak to me was what he said after walking a little distance on i spied the shepherd with a second dog at his heels coming over the down straight to the flock and i stayed to watch when still over a hundred yards from the hollow the dog flew ahead and the other jumping up ran to meet him and they stood together wagging their tails as if conversing when the shepherd had got up to them he stood and began uttering a curious call a somewhat musical cry in two notes and instantly the sheep now at a considerable distance stopped feeding and turned then all together began running towards him and when within thirty yards stood still massed together and all gazing at him he then uttered a different call and turning walked away the dogs keeping with him and the sheep closely following it was late in the day and he was going to fold them down at the foot of the slope in some fields half a mile away  as the scene i had witnessed appeared unusual i related it to the very next shepherd i talked with  oh there was nothing in that he said of course the dog was behind the flock  i said no the peculiar thing was that both dogs were with their master and the flock followed  well my sheep would do the same he returned that is theyll do it if they know theres something good for themsomething they like in the fold they are very knowing and other shepherds to whom i related the incident said pretty much the same but they apparently did not quite like to hear that any shepherd could control his sheep with his voice alone their way of receiving the story confirmed me in the belief that i had witnessed something unusual  before concluding this short chapter i will leave the subject of the wiltshire shepherd and his sheep to quote a remarkable passage about men singing to their cattle in cornwall from a work on that county by richard warner of bath once a wellknown and prolific writer of topographical and other books they are little known now i fancy but he was great in his day which lasted from about the middle of the eighteenth to about the middle of the nineteenth centuryat all events he died in 1857 aged ninetyfour but he was not great at first and finding when nearing middle age that he was not prospering he took to the church and had several livings some of them running concurrently as was the fashion in those dark days his topographical work included walks in wales in somerset in devon walks in many places usually taken in a stagecoach or on horseback containing nothing worth remembering except perhaps the one passage i have mentioned which is as follows  we had scarcely entered cornwall before our attention was agreeably arrested by a practice connected with the agriculture of the people which to us was entirely novel the farmers judiciously employ the fine oxen of the country in ploughing and other processes of husbandry to which the strength of this useful animal can be employedthe rev richard warner is tedious but let us be patient and see what followsto which the strength of this useful animal can be employed and while the hinds are thus driving their patient slaves along the furrows they continually cheer them with conversation denoting approbation and pleasure this encouragement is conveyed to them in a sort of chaunt of very agreeable modulation which floating through the air from different distances produces a striking effect both on the ear and imagination the notes are few and simple and when delivered by a clear melodious voice have something expressive of that tenderness and affection which man naturally entertains for the companions of his labours in a pastoral state of society when feeling more forcibly his dependence upon domesticated animals for support he gladly reciprocates with them kindness and protection for comfort and subsistence this wild melody was to me i confess peculiarly affecting it seemed to draw more closely the link of friendship between man and the humbler tribes of fellow mortals it solaced my heart with the appearance of humanity in a world of violence and in times of universal hostile rage and it gladdened my fancy with the contemplation of those days of heavenly harmony promised in the predictions of eternal truth when man freed at length from prejudice and passion shall seek his happiness in cultivating the mild the benevolent and the merciful sensibilities of his nature and when the animal world catching the virtues of its lord and master shall soften into gentleness and love when the wolf  and so on clause after clause with others to be added until the whole sentence becomes as long as a fishingrod but apart from the fiddlededee is the thing he states believable it is a charming picture and one would like to know more about that chaunt that wild melody the passage aroused my curiosity when in cornwall as it had appeared to me that in no part of england are the domestic animals so little considered by their masters the rspca is practically unknown there and when watching the doings of shepherds or drovers with their sheep the question has occurred to me what would my wiltshire shepherd friends say of such a scene if they had witnessed it there is nothing in print which i can find to confirm warners observations and if you inquire of very old men who have been all their lives on the soil they will tell you that there has never been such a custom in their time nor have they ever heard of it as existing formerly warners tour through cornwall is dated 1808  i take it that he described a scene he actually witnessed and that he jumped to the conclusion that it was a common custom for the ploughman to sing to his oxen it is not unusual to find a man anywhere singing to his oxen or horses or sheep if he has a voice and is fond of exercising it i remember that in a former booknature in downlandi described the sweet singing of a cowboy when tending his cows on a heath near trotton in west sussex and here in wiltshire it amused me to listen at a vast distance to the robust singing of a shepherd while following his flock on the great lonely downs above chitterne he was a sort of tamagno of the downs with a tremendous voice audible a mile away     chapter xii  the shepherd and the bible    danl burdon the treasureseekerthe shepherds feeling for the   bibleeffect of the pastoral lifethe shepherds story of isaacs   boyhoodthe village on the wylye   one of the shepherds early memories was of danl burdon a labourer on the farm where isaac bawcombe was headshepherd he retained a vivid recollection of this person who had a profound gravity and was the most silent man in the parish he was always thinking about hidden treasure and all his spare time was spent in seeking for it on a sunday morning or in the evening after working hours he would take a spade or pick and go away over the hills on his endless search after something he could not find he opened some of the largest barrows making trenches six to ten feet deep through them but found nothing to reward him one day he took caleb with him and they went to a part of the down where there were certain depressions in the turf of a circular form and six to seven feet in circumference burdon had observed these basinlike depressions and had thought it possible they marked the place where things of value had been buried in longpast ages to begin he cut the turf all round and carefully removed it then dug and found a thick layer of flints these removed he came upon a deposit of ashes and charred wood and that was all burdon without a word set to work to put it all back in its place againashes and wood and earth and flintsand having trod it firmly down he carefully replaced the turf then leaning on his spade gazed silently at the spot for a space of several minutes at last he spoke maybe caleb youve beared tell about what the bible says of burnt sacrifice well now i be of opinion that it were here they people the bible says about they come up here to sacrifice on white bustard down and these be the places where they made their fires  then he shouldered his spade and started home the boy following calebs comment was i didnt say nothing to un because i were only a leetel boy and he were a old man but i knowed better than that all the time because them people in the bible they was never in england at all so how could they sacrifice on white bustard down in wiltsheer  it was no idle boast on his part caleb and his brothers had been taught their letters when small and the bible was their one book which they read not only in the evenings at home but out on the downs during the day when they were with the flock his extreme familiarity with the whole scripture narrative was a marvel to me it was also strange considering how intelligent a man he was that his lifelong reading of that one book had made no change in his rude wiltsheer speech  apart from the feeling which old religious country people who know nothing about the higher criticism have for the bible taken literally as the word of god there is that in the old scriptures which appeals in a special way to the solitary man who feeds his flock on the downs i remember well in the days of my boyhood and youth when living in a purely pastoral country among a semicivilized and very simple people how understandable and eloquent many of the ancient stories were to me the life the outlook the rude customs and the vivid faith in the unseen were much the same in that different race in a fardistant age in a remote region of the earth and in the people i mixed with in my own home that country has been changed now it has been improved and civilized and brought up to the european standard i remember it when it was as it had existed for upwards of two centuries before it had caught the contagion the people i knew were the descendants of the spanish colonists of the seventeenth century who had taken kindly to the life of the plains and had easily shed the traditions and ways of thought of europe and of towns their philosophy of life their ideals their morality were the result of the conditions they existed in and wholly unlike ours and the conditions were like those of the ancient people of which the bible tells us their very phraseology was strongly reminiscent of that of the sacred writings and their character in the best specimens was like that of the men of the far past who lived nearer to god as we say and certainly nearer to nature than it is possible for us in this artificial state among these sometimes grand old men who were large landowners rich in flocks and herds these fine old dignified natives the substantial and leading men of the district who could not spell their own names there were those who reminded you of abraham and isaac and jacob and esau and joseph and his brethren and even of david the passionate psalmist with perhaps a guitar for a harp  no doubt the scripture lessons read in the thousand churches on every sunday of the year are practically meaningless to the hearers these old men with their sheep and goats and wives and their talk about god are altogether out of our ways of thought in fact as far from usas incredible or unimaginable we may sayas the neolithic men or the inhabitants of another planet they are of the order of mythical heroes and the giants of antiquity to read about them is an ancient custom but we do not listen  even to myself the memories of my young days came to be regarded as very little more than mere imaginations and i almost ceased to believe in them until after years of mixing with modern men mostly in towns i fell in with the downland shepherds and discovered that even here in densely populated and ultracivilized england something of the ancient spirit had survived in caleb and a dozen old men more or less like him i seemed to find myself among the people of the past and sometimes they were so much like some of the remembered old sober and slowminded herders of the plains that i could not help saying to myself why how this man reminds me of tio isidoro or of don pascual of the three poplar trees or of marcos who would always have three black sheep in a flock and just as they reminded me of these men i had actually known so did they bring back the older men of the bible historyabraham and jacob and the rest  the point here is that these old bible stories have a reality and significance for the shepherd of the down country which they have lost for modern minds that they recognize their own spiritual lineaments in these antique portraits and that all these strange events might have happened a few years ago and not far away  one day i said to caleb bawcombe that his knowledge of the bible especially of the old part was greater than that of the other shepherds i knew on the downs and i would like to hear why it was so this led to the telling of a fresh story about his fathers boyhood which he had heard in later years from his mother isaac was an only child and not the son of a shepherd his father was a rather worthless if not a wholly bad man he was idle and dissolute and being remarkably dexterous with his fists he was persuaded by certain sporting persons to make a business of fightingquite a common thing in those days he wanted nothing better and spent the greater part of the time in wandering about the country the money he made was spent away from home mostly in drink while his wife was left to keep herself and child in the best way she could at home or in the fields by and by a poor stranger came to the village in search of work and was engaged for very little pay by a small farmer for the stranger confessed that he was without experience of farm work of any description the cheapest lodging he could find was in the poor womans cottage and then isaacs mother who pitied him because he was so poor and a stranger alone in the world a very silent melancholy man formed the opinion that he had belonged to another rank in life his speech and hands and personal habits betrayed it undoubtedly he was a gentleman and then from something in his manner his voice and his words whenever he addressed her and his attention to religion she further concluded that he had been in the church that owing to some trouble or disaster he had abandoned his place in the world to live away from all who had known him as a labourer  one day he spoke to her about isaac he said he had been observing him and thought it a great pity that such a fine intelligent boy should be allowed to grow up without learning his letters she agreed that it was but what could she do the village school was kept by an old woman and though she taught the children very little it had to be paid for and she could not afford it he then offered to teach isaac himself and she gladly consented and from that day he taught isaac for a couple of hours every evening until the boy was able to read very well after which they read the bible through together the poor man explaining everything especially the historical parts so clearly and beautifully with such an intimate knowledge of the countries and peoples and customs of the remote east that it was all more interesting than a fairy tale finally he gave his copy of the bible to isaac and told him to carry it in his pocket every day when he went out on the downs and when he sat down to take it out and read in it for by this time isaac who was now ten years old had been engaged as a shepherdboy to his great happiness for to be a shepherd was his ambition  then one day the stranger rolled up his few belongings in a bundle and put them on a stick which he placed on his shoulder said goodbye and went away never to return taking his sad secret with him  isaac followed the strangers counsel and when he had sons of his own made them do as he had done from early boyhood caleb had never gone with his flock on the down without the book and had never passed a day without reading a portion  the incidents and observations gathered in many talks with the old shepherd which i have woven into the foregoing chapters relate mainly to the earlier part of his life up to the time when a married man and father of three small children he migrated to warminster there he was in to him a strange land far away from friends and home and the old familiar surroundings amid new scenes and new people but the few years he spent at that place had furnished him with many interesting memories some of which will be narrated in the following chapters  i have told in the account of winterbourne bishop how i first went to that village just to see his native place and later i visited doveton for no other reason than that he had lived there to find it one of the most charming of the numerous pretty villages in the vale i looked for the cottage in which he had lived and thought it as perfect a home as a quiet contemplative man who loved nature could have had a small thatched cottage very old looking perhaps inconvenient to live in but situated in the prettiest spot away from other houses near and within sight of the old church with old elms and beechtrees growing close to it and the land about it green meadow the clear river fringed with a luxuriant growth of sedges flag and reeds was less than a stonesthrow away  so much did i like the vale of the wylye when i grew to know it well that i wish to describe it fully in the chapter that follows     chapter xiii  vale of the wylye    warminstervale of the wylyecounting the villagesa lost   churchcharacter of the villagestytherington churchstory of the   doglord lovellmonuments in churchesmanorhousesknookthe   cottagesyellow stonecropcottage gardensmarigoldsgoldenrodwild   flowers of the watersideseeking for the characteristic expression   the prettilynamed wylye is a little river not above twenty miles in length from its rise to salisbury where after mixing with the nadder at wilton it joins the avon at or near its source stands warminster a small unimportant town with a noblersounding name than any other in wiltshire trowbridge devizes marlborough salisbury do not stir the mind in the same degree and as for chippenham melksham mere calne and corsham these all are of no more account than so many villages in comparison yet warminster has no associationsno place in our mental geography at all events one remembers nothing about it its name which after all may mean nothing more than the monastery on the wereone of the three streamlets which flow into the wylye at its sourceis its only glory it is not surprising that caleb bawcombe invariably speaks of his migration to and of the time he passed at warminster when as a fact he was not there at all but at doveton a little village on the wylye a few miles below the town with the great name  it is a green valleythe greenness strikes one sharply on account of the pale colour of the smooth high downs on either sidehalf a mile to a mile in width its crystal current showing like a bright serpent for a brief space in the green flat meadows then vanishing again among the trees so many are the great shade trees beeches and ashes and elms that from some points the valley has the appearance of a continuous wooda contiguity of shade and the wood hides the villages at some points so effectually that looking down from the hills you may not catch a glimpse of one and imagine it to be a valley where no man dwells as a rule you do see something of human occupancythe red or yellow roofs of two or three cottages a halfhidden grey church tower or column of blue smoke but to see the villages you must go down and look closely and even so you will find it difficult to count them all i have tried going up and down the valley several times walking or cycling and have never succeeded in getting the same number on two occasions there are certainly more then twenty without counting the hamlets and the right number is probably something between twentyfive and thirty but i do not want to find out by studying books and maps i prefer to let the matter remain unsettled so as to have the pleasure of counting or trying to count them again at some future time but i doubt that i shall ever succeed on one occasion i caught sight of a quaint pretty little church standing by itself in the middle of a green meadow where it looked very solitary with no houses in sight and not even a cow grazing near it the river was between me and the church so i went upstream a mile and a half to cross by the bridge then doubled back to look for the church and couldnt find it yet it was no illusory church i have seen it again on two occasions but again from the other side of the river and i must certainly go back some day in search of that lost church where there may be effigies brasses sad eloquent inscriptions and other memorials of ancient tragedies and great families now extinct in the land  this is perhaps one of the principal charms of the wylyethe sense of beautiful human things hidden from sight among the masses of foliage yet another lies in the character of the villages twentyfive or twentyeight of them in a space of twenty miles yet the impression left on the mind is that these small centres of population are really few and far between for not only are they small but of the old quiet now almost obsolete type of village so unobtrusive as to affect the mind soothingly like the sight of trees and flowery banks and grazing cattle the churches too as is fit are mostly small and ancient and beautiful halfhidden in their treeshaded churchyards rich in associations which go back to a time when history fades into myth and legend not all however are of this description a few are naked dreary little buildings and of these i will mention one which albeit ancient has no monuments and no burialground this is the church of tytherington a small rustic village which has for neighbours codford st peter one one side and sutton veny and norton bavant on the other to get into this church where there was nothing but naked walls to look at i had to procure the key from the clerk a nearly blind old man of eighty he told me that he was shoemaker but could no longer see to make or mend shoes that as a boy he was a weak sickly creature and his father a farm bailiff made him learn shoemaking because he was unfit to work out of doors i remember this church he said when there was only one service each quarter but strange to say he forgot to tell me the story of the dog what didnt he tell you about the dog exclaimed everybody there was really nothing else to tell  it happened about a hundred years ago that once after the quarterly service had been held a dog was missed a small terrier owned by the young wife of a farmer of tytherington named case she was fond of her dog and lamented its loss for a little while then forgot all about it but after three months when the key was once more put into the rusty lock and the door thrown open there was the dog a living skelington it was said dazed by the light of day but still able to walk it was supposed that he had kept himself alive by licking the moisture from the walls the walls they said were dripping with wet and covered with a thick growth of mould i went back to interrogate the ancient clerk and he said that the dog died shortly after its deliverance mrs case herself told him all about it she was an old woman then but was always willing to relate the sad story of her pet  that picture of the starving dog coming out a living skeleton from the wet mouldy church reminds us sharply of the changed times we live in and of the days when the church was still sleeping very peacefully not yet turning uneasily in its bed before opening its eyes and when a comfortable rector of codford thought it quite enough that the people of tytherington a mile away should have one service every three months  as a fact the tytherington dog interested me as much as the story of the last lord lovells selfincarceration in his own house in the neighbouring little village of upton lovell he took refuge there from his enemies who were seeking his life and concealed himself so effectually that he was never seen again centuries later when excavations were made on the site of the ruined mansion a secret chamber was discovered containing a human skeleton seated in a chair at a table on which were books and papers crumbling into dust  a volume might be filled with such strange and romantic happenings in the little villages of the wylye and for the natural man they have a lasting fascination but they invariably relate to great people of their daywarriors and statesmen and landowners of old and noble lineage the smallest and meanest you will find being clothiers or merchants who amassed large fortunes and built mansions for themselves and almshouses for the aged poor and when dead had memorials placed to them in the churches but of the humble cottagers the true people of the vale who were rooted in the soil and nourished and died like trees in the same placeof these no memory exists we only know that they lived and laboured that when they died three or four a year three or four hundred in a century they were buried in the little shady churchyard each with a green mound over him to mark the spot but in time these mouldering heaps subsided the bodies turned to dust and another and yet other generations were laid in the same place among the forgotten dead to be themselves in turn forgotten yet i would rather know the histories of these humble unremembered lives than of the great ones of the vale who have left us a memory  it may be for this reason that i was little interested in the manorhouses of the vale they are plentiful enough some gone to decay or put to various uses others still the homes of luxury beauty culture stately rooms rich fabrics pictures books and manuscripts gold and silver ware china and glass expensive curios suits of armour ivory and antlers tigerskins stuffed goshawks and peacocks feathers houses in some cases built centuries ago standing halfhidden in beautiful wooded grounds isolated from the village and even as they thus stand apart sacred from intrusion so the life that is in them does not mix with or form part of the true native life they are to the cottagers of today what the roman villas were to the native population of some eighteen centuries ago this will seem incredible to some to me an untrammelled person familiar in both hall and cottage the distance between them appears immense  a reader well acquainted with the valley will probably laugh to be told that the manorhouse which most interested me was that of knook a poor little village between heytesbury and upton lovell its ancient and towerless little church with rough grey walls is if possible even more desolatelooking than that of tytherington in my hunt for the key to open it i disturbed a quaint old man another octogenarian picturesque in a vast white beard who told me he was a thatcher or had been one before the evil days came when he could work no more and was compelled to seek parish relief you must go to the manorhouse for the key he told me a strange place in which to look for the key and it was stranger still to see the house close to the church and so like it that but for the small cross on the roof of the latter one could not have known which was the sacred building first a monks house it fell at the reformation to some greedy gentleman who made it his dwelling and doubtless in later times it was used as a farmhouse now a house most desolate dirty and neglected with cracks in the walls which threaten ruin standing in a wilderness of weeds tenanted by a poor workingman whose wages are twelve shillings a week and his wife and eight small children the rent is eighteenpence a weekprobably the lowestrented manorhouse in england though it is not very rare to find such places tenanted by labourers  but let us look at the true cottages there are i imagine few places in england where the humble homes of the people have so great a charm undoubtedly they are darker inside and not so convenient to live in as the modern boxshaped redbrick slateroofed cottages which have spread a wave of ugliness over the country but they do not offendthey please the eye they are smaller than the modernbuilt habitations they are weathered and coloured by sun and wind and rain and many lowly vegetable forms to a harmony with nature they appear related to the trees amid which they stand to the river and meadows to the sloping downs at the side and to the sky and clouds over all and most delightful feature they stand among and are wrapped in flowers as in a garmentrose and vine and creeper and clematis they are mostly thatched but some have tiled roofs their deep dark red clouded and stained with lichen and moss and these roofs too have their flowers in summer they are grown over with yellow stonecrop that bright cheerful flower that smiles down at you from the lowly roof above the door with such an inviting expression so delighted to see you no matter how poor and worthless a person you may be or what mischief you may have been at that  you begin to understand the significance of a strange vernacular name of this plantwelcomehomehusbandthoughneversodrunk  but its garden flowers clustering and nestling round it amid which its feet are setthey are to me the best of all flowers these are the flowers we know and remember for ever the old homely cottagegarden blooms so old that they have entered the soul the big house garden or gardeners garden with everything growing in it i hate but these i lovefragrant gillyflower and pink and clovesmelling carnation wallflower abundant periwinkle sweetwilliam larkspur loveinamist and loveliesbleeding oldwomansnightcap and kissmejohnatthegardengate some times called pansy and best of all and in greatest profusion that flower of flowers the marigold  how the townsman town born and bred regards this flower i do not know he is in spite of all the time i have spent in his company a comparative stranger to methe one living creature on the earth who does not greatly interest me some overpopulated planet in our system discovered a way to relieve itself by discharging its superfluous millions on our globea pale people with hurrying feet and eager restless minds who live apart in monstrous crowded camps like wood ants that go not out to forage for themselvessix millions of them crowded together in one camp alone i have lived in these colonies years and years never losing the sense of captivity of exile ever conscious of my burden taking no interest in the doings of that innumerable multitude its manifold interests its ideals and philosophy its arts and pleasures what then does it matter how they regard this common orangecoloured flower with a strong smell for me it has an atmosphere a sense or suggestion of something immeasurably remote and very beautifulan event a place a dream perhaps which has left no distinct image but only this feeling unlike all others imperishable and not to be described except by the one word marigold  but when my sight wanders away from the flower to others blooming with itto all those which i have named and to the taller ones so tall that they reach halfway up and some even quite up to the eaves of the lowly houses they stand againsthollyhocks and peonies and crystalline white lilies with powdery gold inside and the common sunfloweri begin to perceive that they all possess something of that same magical quality  these taller blooms remind me that the evening primrose long naturalized in our hearts is another common and very delightful cottagegarden flower also that here on the wylye there is yet another stranger from the same western world which is fast winning our affections this is the goldenrod grandly beautiful in its great yellow plumelike tufts but it is not quite right to call the tufts yellow they are green thickly powdered with the minute golden florets there is no flower in england like it and it is a happiness to know that it promises to establish itself with us as a wild flower  where the village lies low in the valley and the cottage is near the water there are wild blooms too which almost rival those of the garden in beautywater agrimony and comfrey with ivorywhite and dim purple blossoms purple and yellow loosestrife and gemlike water forgetmenot all these mixed with reeds and sedges and watergrasses forming a fringe or border to the potato or cabbage patch dividing it from the stream  but now i have exhausted the subject of the flowers and enumerated and dwelt upon the various other components of the scene it comes to me that i have not yet said the right thing and given the wylye its characteristic expression in considering the flowers we lose sight of the downs and so in occupying ourselves with the details we miss the general effect let me then once more before concluding this chapter try to capture the secret of this little river  there are other chalk streams in wiltshire and hampshire and dorsetswift crystal currents that play all summer long with the floating poa grass fast held in their pebbly beds flowing through smooth downs with small ancient churches in their green villages and pretty thatched cottages smothered in flowerswhich yet do not produce the same effect as the wylye not avon for all its beauty nor itchen nor test wherein then does the wylye bourne differ from these others and what is its special attraction it was only when i set myself to think about it to analyse the feeling in my own mind that i discovered the secretthat is in my own case for of its effect on others i cannot say anything what i discovered was that the various elements of interest all of which may be found in other chalkstream valleys are here concentrated or comprised in a limited space and seen together produce a combined effect on the mind it is the narrowness of the valley and the nearness of the high downs standing over it on either side with at some points the memorials of antiquity carved on their smooth surfaces the barrows and lynchetts or terraces and the vast green earthworks crowning their summit up here on the turf even with the lark singing his shrill music in the blue heavens you are with the prehistoric dead yourself for the time one of that innumerable unsubstantial multitude invisible in the sun so that the sheep travelling as they graze and the shepherd following them pass through their ranks without suspecting their presence and from that elevation you look down upon the life of todaythe visible life so brief in the individual which like the swift silver stream beneath yet flows on continuously from age to age and for ever and even as you look down you hear at that distance the bell of the little hidden church tower telling the hour of noon and quickly following a shout of freedom and joy from many shrill voices of children just released from school woke to life by those sounds and drawn down by them you may sit to rest or sun yourself on the stone table of a tomb overgrown on its sides with moss the twocenturyold inscription wellnigh obliterated in the little grassgrown flowery churchyard which serves as village green and playground in that small centre of life where the living and the dead exist in a neighbourly way together for it is not here as in towns where the dead are away and out of mind and the past cut off and if after basking too long in the sun in that treesheltered spot you go into the little church to cool yourself you will probably find in a dim corner not far from the altar a stone effigy of one of an older time a knight in armour perhaps a crusader with legs crossed lying on his back dimly seen in the dim light with perhaps a coloured sunbeam on his upturned face for this little church where the villagers worship is very old norman on saxon foundations and before they were ever laid there may have been a temple to some ancient god at that spot or a roman villa perhaps for older than saxon foundations are found in the vale and mosaic floors still beautiful after lying buried so long  all thisthe farremoved events and periods in timeare not in the conscious mind when we are in the vale or when we are looking down on it from above the mind is occupied with nothing but visible nature thus when i am sitting on the tomb listening to the various sounds of life about me attentive to the flowers and bees and butterflies to man or woman or child taking a short cut through the churchyard exchanging a few words with them or when i am by the water close by watching a little company of graylings their delicatelyshaded silvergrey scales distinctly seen as they lie in the crystal current watching for flies or when i listen to the perpetual musical talk and song combined of a family of greenfinches in the alders or willows my mind is engaged with these things but if one is familiar with the vale if one has looked with interest and been deeply impressed with the signs and memorials of past life and of antiquity everywhere present and forming part of the scene something of it and of all that it represents remains in the subconscious mind to give a significance and feeling to the scene which affects us here more than in most places and that i take it is the special charm of this little valley     chapter xiv  a sheepdogs life    watchhis visits to a dewponddavid and his dog

declinegrey hairs   in animalsa grey molelast days of watcha shepherd on old   sheepdogs   perhaps the most interesting of the many sheepdog histories the shepherd related was that of watch a dog he had at winterbourne bishop for three years before he migrated to warminster watch he said was more like a christian otherwise a reasonable being than any other dog he had owned he was exceedingly active and in hot weather suffered more from heat than most dogs now the only accessible water when they were out on the down was in the mistpond about a quarter of a mile from his liberty as he called that portion of the down on which he was entitled to pasture his sheep when watch could stand his sufferings no longer he would run to his master and sitting at his feet look up at his face and emit a low pleading whine  what be you wanting watcha drink or a swim the shepherd would say and watch cocking up his ears would repeat the whine  very well go to the pond bawcombe would say and off watch would rush never pausing until he got to the water and dashing in he would swim round and round lapping the water as he bathed  at the side of the pond there was a large round sarsenstone and invariably on coming out of his bath watch would jump upon it and with his four feet drawn up close together would turn round and round surveying the country from that elevation then jumping down he would return in all haste to his duties  another anecdote which relates to the winterbourne bishop period is a somewhat painful one and is partly about monk the sheepdog already described as a hunter of foxes and his tragic end caleb had worked him for a time but when he came into possession of watch he gave monk to his younger brother david who was undershepherd on the same farm  one morning caleb was with the ewes in a field when david who was in charge of the lambs two or three fields away came to him looking very strangevery much put out  what are you here forwhats wrong with ee demanded caleb  nothings wrong returned the other  wheres monk then asked caleb  dead said david  dead hows he dead  i killedn he wouldnt mind me and made me mad and i up with my stick and gave him one crack on the head and it killedn  you killed n exclaimed caleb an you come here an tell i nothings wrong is that a right way to speak of such a thing as that what be you thinking of and what be you going to do with the lambs  im just going back to themim going to do without a dog im going to put them in the rape and theyll be all right  what put them in the rape and no dog to help ee cried the other you are not doing things right but master mustnt pay for it take watch to help eei must do withoutn this morning  no ill not taken he said for he was angry because he had done an evil thing and he would have no one man or dog to help him ill do better without a dog he said and marched off  caleb cried after him if you wont have the dog dont let the lambs suffer but do as i tell ee dont you let em bide in the rape more n ten minutes then chase them out and let em stand twenty minutes to half an hour then let them in another ten minutes and out again for twenty minutes then let them go back and feed in it quietly for the danger ll be over if you dont do as i tell ee youll have many blown  david listened then without a word went his way but caleb was still much troubled in his mind how would he get that flock of hungry lambs out of the rape without a dog and presently he determined to send watch or try to send him to save the situation david had been gone half an hour when he called the dog and pointing in the direction he had taken he cried dave wants eego to dave  watch looked at him and listened then bounded away and after running full speed about fifty yards stopped to look back to make sure he was doing the right thing go to dave shouted caleb once more and away went watch again and arriving at a very high gate at the end of the field dashed at and tried two or three times to get over it first by jumping then by climbing and falling back each time but by and by he managed to force his way through the thick hedge and was gone from sight  when david came back that evening he was in a different mood and said that watch had saved him from a great misfortune he could never have got the lambs out by himself as they were mad for the rape for some days after this watch served two masters caleb would take him to his ewes and after a while would say godave wants ee and away watch would go to the other shepherd and flock  when bawcombe had taken up his new place at doveton his master mr ellerby watched him for a while with sharp eyes but he was soon convinced that he had not made a mistake in engaging a headshepherd twentyfive miles away without making the usual inquiries but merely on the strength of something heard casually in conversation about this man but while more than satisfied with the man he remained suspicious of the dog im afraid that dog of yours must hurt the sheep he would say and he even advised him to change him for one that worked in a quieter manner watch was too excitable too impetuoushe could not go after the sheep in that violent way and grab them as he did without injuring them with his teeth  he did never bite a sheep in his life bawcombe assured him and eventually he was able to convince his master that watch could make a great show of biting the sheep without doing them the least hurtthat it was actually against his nature to bite or injure anything  one day in the late summer when the corn had been cut but not carried bawcombe was with his flock on the edge of a newly reaped cornfield in a continuous heavy rain when he spied his master coming to him he was in a very light summer suit and straw hat and had no umbrella or other protection from the pouring rain what be wrong with master today said bawcombe hes tarrably upset to be out like this in such a rain in a straw hat and no coat  mr ellerby had by that time got into the habit when troubled in his mind of going out to his shepherd to have a long talk with him not a talk about his troublethat was some secret bitterness in his heartbut just about the sheep and other ordinary topics and the talk caleb said would seem to do him good but this habit he had got into was observed by others and the farmmen would say somethings wrong todaythe masters gone off to the headshepherd  when he came to where bawcombe was standing in a poor shelter by the side of a fence he at once started talking on indifferent subjects standing there quite unconcerned as if he didnt even know that it was raining though his thin clothes were wet through and the water coming through his straw hat was running in streaks down his face by and by he became interested in the dogs movements playing about in the rain among the stocks what has he got in his mouth he asked presently  come here watch the shepherd called and when watch came he bent down and took a corncrake from his mouth he had found the bird hiding in one of the stocks and had captured without injuring it  why its alivethe dog hasnt hurt it said the farmer taking it in his hands to examine it  watch never hurted any creature yet said bawcombe he caught things just for his own amusement but never injured themhe always let them go again he would hunt mice in the fields and when he captured one he would play with it like a cat tossing it from him then dashing after and recapturing it finally he would let it go he played with rabbits in the same way and if you took a rabbit from him and examined it you would find it quite uninjured  the farmer said it was wonderfulhe had never heard of a case like it before and talking of watch he succeeded in forgetting the trouble in his mind which had sent him out in the rain in his thin clothes and straw hat and he went away in a cheerful mood  caleb probably forgot to mention during this conversation with his master that in most cases when watch captured a rabbit he took it to his master and gave it into his hands as much as to say here is a very big sort of fieldmouse i have caught rather difficult to manageperhaps you can do something with it  the shepherd had many other stories about this curious disposition of his dog when he had been some months in his new place his brother david followed him to the wylye having obtained a place as shepherd on a farm adjoining mr ellerbys his cottage was a little out of the village and had some ground to it with a nice lawn or green patch david was fond of keeping animal petsbirds in cages and rabbits and guineapigs in hutches the last so tame that he would release them on the grass to see them play with one another when watch first saw these pets he was very much attracted and wanted to get to them and after a good deal of persuasion on the part of caleb david one day consented to take them out and put them on the grass in the dogs presence they were a little alarmed at first but in a surprisingly short time made the discovery that this particular dog was not their enemy but a playmate he rolled on the grass among them and chased them round and round and sometimes caught and pretended to worry them and they appeared to think it very good fun  watch said bawcombe in the fifteen years i had n never killed and never hurt a creature no not even a leetel mouse and when he caught anything twere only to play with it  watch comes into a story of an old woman employed at the farm at this period she had been in the warminster workhouse for a short time and had there heard that a daughter of a former mistress in another part of the county had long been married and was now the mistress of doveton farm close by old nance thereupon obtained her release and trudged to doveton and one very rough cold day presented herself at the farm to beg for something to do which would enable her to keep herself if there was nothing for her she must she said go back and end her days in the warminster workhouse mrs ellerby remembered and pitied her and going in to her husband begged him earnestly to find some place on the farm for the forlorn old creature he did not see what could be done for her they already had one old woman on their hands who mended sacks and did a few other trifling things but for another old woman there would be nothing to do then he went in and had a good long look at her revolving the matter in his mind anxious to please his wife and finally he asked her if she could scare the crows he could think of nothing else of course she could scare crowsit was the very thing for her well he said she could go and look after the swedes the rooks had just taken a liking to them and even if she was not very active perhaps she would be able to keep them off  old nance got up to go and begin her duties at once then the farmer looking at her clothes said he would give her something more to protect her from the weather on such a bleak day he got her an old felt hat a big old frieze overcoat and a pair of old leather leggings when she had put on these somewhat cumbrous things and had tied her hat firmly on with a strip of cloth and fastened the coat at the waist with a cord she was told to go to the headshepherd and ask him to direct her to the field where the rooks were troublesome then when she was setting out the farmer called her back and gave her an ancient rusty gun to scare the birds it isnt loaded he said with a grim smile i dont allow powder and shot but if youll point it at them theyll fly fast enough  thus arrayed and armed she set forth and caleb seeing her approach at a distance was amazed at her grotesque appearance and even more amazed still when she explained who and what she was and asked him to direct her to the field of swedes  some hours later the farmer came to him and asked him casually if he had seen an old galluscrow about  well replied the shepherd i seen an old woman in mans coat and things with an old gun and i did tell she where to bide  i think it will be rather cold for the old body in that field said the farmer id like you to get a couple of padded hurdles and put them up for a shelter for her  and in the shelter of the padded or thatched hurdles by the hedgeside old nance spent her days keeping guard over the turnips and afterwards something else was found for her to do and in the meanwhile she lodged in calebs cottage and became like one of the family she was fond of the children and of the dog and watch became so much attached to her that had it not been for his duties with the flock he would have attended her all day in the fields to help her with the crows  old nance had two possessions she greatly prizeda book and a pair of spectacles and it was her custom to spend the day sitting spectacles on nose and book in hand reading among the turnips her spectacles were so tarrable good that they suited all old eyes and when this was discovered they were in great request in the village and every person who wanted to do a bit of fine sewing or anything requiring young vision in old eyes would borrow them for the purpose one day the old woman returned full of trouble from the fieldsshe had lost her spectacles she must she thought have lent them to some one in the village on the previous evening and then forgotten all about it but no one had them and the mysterious loss of the spectacles was discussed and lamented by everybody a day or two later caleb came through the turnips on his way home the dog at his heels and when he got to his cottage watch came round and placed himself square before his master and deposited the lost spectacles at his feet he had found them in the turnipfield over a mile from home and though but a dog he remembered that he had seen them on peoples noses and in their hands and knew that they must therefore be valuablenot to himself but to that larger and more important kind of dog that goes about on its hind legs  there is always a sad chapter in the lifehistory of a dog it is the last one which tells of his decline and it is ever saddest in the case of the sheepdog because he has lived closer to man and has served him every day of his life with all his powers all his intelligence in the one useful and necessary work he is fitted for or which we have found for him to do the hunting and the pet or parasite dogsthe dogs for sport and pleasurethough one in species with him are not like beings of the same order they are like professional athletes and performers and smart or fashionable people compared to those who do the work of the worldwho feed us and clothe us we are accustomed to speak of dogs generally as the servants and the friends of man it is only of the sheepdog that this can be said with absolute truth not only is he the faithful servant of the solitary man who shepherds his flock but the dogs companionship is as much to him as that of a fellowbeing would be  before his long and strenuous life was finished watch originally jetblack without a spot became quite grey the greyness being most marked on the head which became at last almost white  it is undoubtedly the case that some animals like men turn grey with age and watch when fifteen was relatively as old as a man at sixtyfive or seventy but grey hairs do not invariably come with age even in our domestic animals which are more subject to this change than those in a state of nature but we are never so well able to judge of this in the case of wild animals as in most cases their lives end prematurely  the shepherd related a curious instance in a mole he once noticed moleheaps of a peculiar kind in a field of sainfoin and it looked to him as if this mole worked in a way of his own quite unlike the others the hills he threw up were a good distance apart and so large that you could fill a bushel measure with the mould from any one of them he noticed that this mole went on burrowing every day in the same manner every morning there were new chains or ranges of the huge mounds the runs were very deep as he found when setting a moletrapover two feet beneath the surface he set his trap filling the deep hole he had made with sods and on opening it next day he found his mole and was astonished at its great size he took no measurements but it was bigger he affirmed than he could have believed it possible for a mole to be and it was grey instead of black the grey hairs being so abundant on the head as to make it almost white as in the case of old watch he supposed that it was a very old mole that it was a more powerful digger than most of its kind and had perhaps escaped death so long on account of its strength and of its habit of feeding deeper in the earth than the others  to return to watch his hearing and eyesight failed as he grew older until he was practically blind and too deaf to hear any word given in the ordinary way but he continued strong as ever on his legs and his mind was not decayed nor was he in the least tired on the contrary he was always eager to work and as his blindness and deafness had made him sharper in other ways he was still able to make himself useful with the sheep whenever the hurdles were shifted to a fresh place and the sheep had to be kept in a corner of the enclosure until the new place was ready for them it was old watchs duty to keep them from breaking away he could not see nor hear but in some mysterious way he knew when they tried to get out even if it was but one possibly the slight vibration of the ground informed him of the movement and the direction as well he would make a dash and drive the sheep back then run up and down before the flock until all was quiet again but at last it became painful to witness his efforts especially when the sheep were very restless and incessantly trying to break away and watch finding them so hard to restrain would grow angry and rush at them with such fury that he would come violently against the hurdles at one side then getting up howling with pain he would dash to the other side when he would strike the hurdles there and cry out with pain once more  it could not be allowed to go on yet watch could not endure to be deprived of his work if left at home he would spend the time whining and moaning praying to be allowed to go to the flock until at last his master with a very heavy heart was compelled to have him put to death  this is indeed almost invariably the end of a sheepdog however zealous and faithful he may have been and however much valued and loved he must at last be put to death i related the story of this dog to a shepherd in the very district where watch had lived and served his master so wellone who had been headshepherd for upwards of forty years at imber court the principal farm at the small downland village of imber he told me that during all his shepherding years he had never owned a dog which had passed out of his hands to another every dog had been acquired as a pup and trained by himself and he had been very fond of his dogs but had always been compelled to have them shot in the end not because he would have found them too great a burden when they had become too old and their senses decayed but because it was painful to see them in their decline perpetually craving to be at their old work with the sheep incapable of doing it any longer yet miserable if kept from it     chapter xv  the ellerbys of doveton    the bawcombes at doveton farmcaleb finds favour with his mastermrs   ellerby and the shepherds wifethe passion of a childless wifethe   cursea story of the mobthe attack on the farma man transported   for lifethe hundred and ninth psalmthe end of the ellerbys   caleb and his wife invariably spoke of their time at doveton farm in a way which gave one the idea that they regarded it as the most important period of their lives it had deeply impressed them and doubtless it was a great change for them to leave their native village for the first time in their lives and go long miles from home among strangers to serve a new master above everything they felt leaving the old father who was angry with them and had gone to the length of disowning them for taking such a step but there was something besides all this which had served to give doveton an enduring place in their memories and after many talks with the old couple about their warminster days i formed the idea that it was more to them than any other place where they had lived because of a personal feeling they cherished for their master and mistress there  hitherto caleb had been in the service of men who were but a little way removed in thought and feeling from those they employed they were mostly small men born and bred in the parish some wholly selfmade with no interest or knowledge of anything outside their own affairs and almost as far removed as the labourers themselves from the ranks above the ellerbys were of another stamp or a different class if not a gentleman mr ellerby was very like one and was accustomed to associate with gentlemen he was a farmer descended from a long line of farmers but he owned his own land and was an educated and travelled man considered wealthy for a farmer at all events he was able to keep his carriage and riding and hunting horses in his stables and he was regarded as the best breeder of sheep in the district he lived in a good house which with its pictures and books and beautiful decorations and furniture appeared to their simple minds extremely luxurious this atmosphere was somewhat disconcerting to them at first for although he knew his own value priding himself on being a good shepherd caleb had up till now served with farmers who were in a sense on an equality with him and they understood him and he them but in a short time the feeling of strangeness vanished personally as a fellowman his master soon grew to be more to him than any farmer he had yet been with and he saw a good deal of his master mr ellerby cultivated his acquaintance and as we have seen got into the habit of seeking him out and talking to him even when he was at a distance out on the down with his flock and caleb could not but see that in this respect he was preferred above the other men employed on the farmthat he had found favour in his masters eyes  when he had told me that story about watch and the corncrake it stuck in my mind and on the first opportunity i went back to that subject to ask what it really was that made his master act in such an extraordinary mannerto go out on a pouring wet day in a summer suit and straw hat and walk a mile or two just to stand there in the rain talking to him about nothing in particular what secret trouble had hewas it that his affairs were in a bad way or was he quarrelling with his wife no nothing of the kind it was a long storythis secret trouble of the ellerbys and with his unconquerable reticence in regard to other peoples private affairs he would have passed it off with a few general remarks  but there was his old wife listening to us and womanlike eager to discuss such a subject she would not let it pass she would tell it and would not be silenced by him they were all dead and gonewhy should i not be told if i wanted to hear it and so with a word put in here and there by him when she talked and with a good many words interposed by her when he took up the tale they unfolded the story which was very long as they told it and must be given briefly here  it happened that when the bawcombes settled at doveton just as mr ellerby had taken to the shepherd making a friend of him so mrs ellerby took to the shepherds wife and fell into the habit of paying frequent visits to her in her cottage she was a very handsome woman of a somewhat stately presence dignified in manner and she wore her abundant hair in curls hanging on each side to her shouldersa fashion common at that time from the first she appeared to take a particular interest in the bawcombes and they could not but notice that she was more gracious and friendly towards them than to the others of their station on the farm the bawcombes had three children then aged six four and two years respectively all remarkably healthy with rosy cheeks and black eyes and they were merrytempered little things mrs ellerby appeared much taken with the children praised their mother for always keeping them so clean and nicely dressed and wondered how she could manage it on their small earnings the carter and his wife lived in a cottage close by and they too had three little children and next to the carters was the bailiffs cottage and he too was married and had children but mrs ellerby never went into their cottages and the shepherd and his wife concluded that it was because in both cases the children were rather puny sicklylooking little things and were never very clean the carters wife too was a slatternly woman one day when mrs ellerby came in to see mrs bawcombe the carters wife was just going out of the door and mrs ellerby appeared displeased and before leaving she said i hope mrs bawcombe you are not going to mix too freely with your neighbours or let your children go too much with them and fall into their ways they also observed that when she passed their neighbours children in the lane she spoke no word and appeared not to see them yet she was kind to them too and whenever she brought a big parcel of cakes fruit and sweets for the children which she often did she would tell the shepherds wife to divide it into three lots one for her own children and the others for those of her two neighbours it was clear to see that mrs ellerby had grown fond of her children especially of the eldest the little rosycheeked sixyearold boy sitting in the cottage she would call him to her side and would hold his hand while conversing with his mother she would also bare the childs arm just for the pleasure of rubbing it with her hand and clasping it round with her fingers and sometimes when caressing the child in this way she would turn her face aside to hide the tears that dropped from her eyes  she had no child of her ownthe one happiness which she and her husband desired above all things six times in their ten married years they had hoped and rejoiced although with fear and trembling that their prayer would be answered but in vainevery child born to them came lifeless into the world and so twould always be for sure said the villagers because of the curse  for it was a cause of wonder to the shepherd and his wife that this couple so strong and healthy so noblelooking so anxious to have children should have been so unfortunate and still the villagers repeated that it was the curse that was on them  this made the shepherd angry what be you saying about a curse that is on thema good man and a good woman he would exclaim and taking up his crook go out and leave them to their gossip he would not ask them what they meant he refused to listen when they tried to tell him but in the end he could not help knowing since the idea had become a fixed one in the minds of all the villagers and he could not keep it out look at them the gossipers would say as fine a couple as you ever saw and no child and look at his two brothers fine big strong wellsetup men both married to fine healthy women and never a child living to any of them and the sisters unmarried tis the curse and nothing else  the curse had been uttered against mr ellerbys father who was in his prime in the year 1831 at the time of the mob when the introduction of laboursaving machinery in agriculture sent the poor farmlabourers mad all over england wheat was at a high price at that time and the farmers were exceedingly prosperous but they paid no more than seven shillings a week to their miserable labourers and if they were halfstarved when there was work for all when the corn was reaped with sickles what would their condition be when reaping machines and other new implements of husbandry came into use they would not suffer it they would gather in bands everywhere and destroy the machinery and being united they would be irresistible and so it came about that there were risings or mobs all over the land  mr ellerby the most prosperous and enterprising farmer in the parish had been the first to introduce the new methods he did not believe that the people would rise against him for he well knew that he was regarded as a just and kind man and was even loved by his own labourers but even if it had not been so he would not have hesitated to carry out his resolution as he was a highspirited man but one day the villagers got together and came unexpectedly to his barns where they set to work to destroy his new thrashing machine when he was told he rushed out and went in hot haste to the scene and as he drew near some person in the crowd threw a heavy hammer at him which struck him on the head and brought him senseless to the ground  he was not seriously injured but when he recovered the work of destruction had been done and the men had gone back to their homes and no one could say who had led them and who had thrown the hammer but by and by the police discovered that the hammer was the property of a shoemaker in the village and he was arrested and charged with injuring with intent to murder tried with many others from other villages in the district at the salisbury assizes he was found guilty and sentenced to transportation for life yet the doveton shoemaker was known to every one as a quiet inoffensive young man and to the last he protested his innocence for although he had gone with the others to the farm he had not taken the hammer and was guiltless of having thrown it  two years after he had been sent away mr ellerby received a letter with an australian postmark on it but on opening it found nothing but a long denunciatory passage from the bible enclosed with no name or address mr ellerby was much disturbed in his mind and instead of burning the paper and holding his peace he kept it and spoke about it to this person and that and every one went to his bible to find out what message the poor shoemaker had sent for it had been discovered that it was the one hundred and ninth psalm or a great portion of it and this is what they read  let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out  let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth  because that he remembered not to show mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart  as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted not in blessing so let it be far from him  as he clothed himself with cursing like as with a garment so let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones  let it be unto him as a garment which covereth him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually  but do thou for me o god the lord for thy names sake for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me  i am come like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and down as the locust  my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of fatness  from that time the hundred and ninth psalm became familiar to the villagers and there were probably not many who did not get it by heart there was no doubt in their minds of the poor shoemakers innocence every one knew that he was incapable of hurting a fly the crowd had gone into his shop and swept him away with themall were in it and some person seeing the hammer had taken it to help in smashing the machinery and mr ellerby had known in his heart that he was innocent and if he had spoken a word for him in court he would have got the benefit of the doubt and been discharged but no he wanted to have his revenge on some one and he held his peace and allowed this poor fellow to be made the victim then when he died and his eldest son succeeded him at doveton farm and he and the other sons got married and there were no children or none born alive they went back to the psalm again and read and reread and quoted the words let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following let their name be blotted out undoubtedly the curse was on them  alas it was the curse was their belief in the curse and the dreadful effect of the knowledge of it on a womans mindall the result of mr ellerby the fathers fatal mistake in not having thrown the scrap of paper that came to him from the other side of the world into the fire all the unhappiness of the generation following came about in this way and the family came to an end for when the last of the ellerbys died at a great age there was not one person

pembrokean illusion of the   very agedsedanchairs in bathstickgathering by the   poorgamepreserving   the incident of the unhappy young man who was transported to australia or tasmania which came out in the shepherds history of the ellerby family put it in my mind to look up some of the very aged people of the downland villages whose memories could go back to the events of eighty years ago i found a few still lingering here who were able to recall that miserable and memorable year of 1830 and had witnessed the doings of the mobs one was a woman my old friend of fonthill bishop now aged ninetyfour who was in her teens when the poor labourers a thousand strong some say armed with cudgels hammers and axes visited her village and broke up the thrashing machines they found there  another person who remembered that time was an old but remarkably wellpreserved man of eightynine at hindon a village a couple of miles distant from fonthill bishop hindon is a delightful little village so rustic and pretty amidst its green swelling downs with great woods crowning the heights beyond that one can hardly credit the fact that it was formerly an important market and session town and a parliamentary borough returning two members also that it boasted among other greatnesses thirteen publichouses now it has two and not flourishing in these tea and mineralwater drinking days naturally it was an exceeedingly corrupt little borough where free beer for all was the order of the day for a period of four to six weeks before an election and where every householder with a vote looked to receive twenty guineas from the candidate of his choice it is still remembered that when a householder in those days was very hard up owing perhaps to his too frequent visits to the thirteen publichouses he would go to some substantial tradesman in the place and pledge his twenty guineas due at the next election in due time after the reform bill it was deprived of its glory and later when the southwestern railway built their line from salisbury to yeovil and left hindon some miles away making their station at tisbury it fell into decay dwindling to the small village it now is and its last state sober and purified is very much better than the old for although sober it is contented and even merry and exhibits such a sweet friendliness toward the stranger within its gates as to make him remember it with pleasure and gratitude  what a quiet little place hindon has become after its old noisy period the following little bird story will show for several weeks during the spring and summer of 1909 my home was at the lamb inn a famous postinghouse of the great old days and we had three pairs of birdsthrostle pied wagtail and flycatcherbreeding in the ivy covering the wall facing the village street just over my window i watched them when building incubating feeding their young and bringing their young off the villagers too were interested in the sight and sometimes a dozen or more men and boys would gather and stand for half an hour watching the birds flying in and out of their nests when feeding their young the last to come off were the flycatchers on 18th june it was on the morning of the day i left and one of the little things flitted into the room where i was having my breakfast i succeeded in capturing it before the cats found out and put it back on the ivy there were three young birds i had watched them from the time they hatched and when i returned a fortnight later there were the three still being fed by their parents in the trees and on the roof their favourite perchingplace being on the swinging sign of the lamb whenever an old bird darted at and captured a fly the three young would flutter round it like three butterflies to get the fly this continued until 18th july after which date i could not detect their feeding the young although the hungercall was occasionally heard  if the flycatcher takes a month to teach its young to catch their own flies it is not strange that it breeds but once in the year it is a delicate art the bird practises and takes long to learn but how different with the martin which dismisses its young in a few days and begins breeding again even to the third time  these three broods over my window were not the only ones in the place there were at least twenty other pairs in the garden and outhouses of the innsparrows thrushes blackbirds dunnocks wrens starlings and swallows yet the inn was in the very centre of the village and being an inn was the most frequented and noisiest spot  to return to my old friend of eightynine he was but a small boy attending the hindon school when the rioters appeared on the scene and he watched their entry from the schoolhouse window it was marketday and the market was stopped by the invaders and the agricultural machines brought for sale and exhibition were broken up the picture that remains in his mind is of a great excited crowd in which men and cattle and sheep were mixed together in the wide street which was the marketplace and of shouting and noise of smashing machinery and finally of the mob pouring forth over the down on its way to the next village he and other little boys following their march  the smuggling trade flourished greatly at that period and there were receivers and distributors of smuggled wine spirits and other commodities in every town and in very many villages throughout the county in spite of its distance from the seacoast one of his memories is of a blind man of the village or town as it was then who was used as an assistant in this business he had lost his sight in childhood one eye having been destroyed by a ferret which got into his cradle then when he was about six years old he was running across the room one day with a fork it his hand when he stumbled and falling on the floor had the other eye pierced by the prongs but in spite of his blindness he became a good worker and could make a fence reap trim hedges feed the animals and drive a horse as well as any man his father had a small farm and was a carrier as well a quiet sober industrious man who was never suspected by his neighbours of being a smuggler for he never left his house and work but from time to time he had little consignments of rum and brandy in casks received on a dark night and carefully stowed away in his manure heap and in a pit under the floor of his pigsty then the blind son would drive his old mother in the carriers cart to bath and call at a dozen or twenty private houses leaving parcels which had been already ordered and paid fora gallon of brandy at one two or four gallons of rum at another and so on until all was got rid of and on the following day they would return with goods to hindon this quiet little business went on satisfactorily for some years during which the officers of the excise had stared a thousand times with their eagles eyes at the quaint old woman in her poke bonnet and shawl driven by a blind man with a vacant face and had suspected nothing when a little mistake was made and a jar of brandy delivered at a wrong address the recipient was an honest gentleman and in his anxiety to find the rightful owner of the brandy made extensive inquiries in his neighbourhood and eventually the excisemen got wind of the affair and on the very next visit of the old woman and her son to bath they were captured after an examination before a magistrate the son was discharged on account of his blindness but the cart and horses as well as the smuggled spirits were confiscated and the poor blind man had to make his way on foot to hindon  another of his recollections is of a family named rawlings tenants of lower pertwood farm near hindon a lonely desolatelooking house hidden away in a deep hollow among the high downs the farmer rawlings of seventy or eighty years ago was a man of singular ideas and that he was permitted to put them in practice shows that severe as was the law in those days and dreadful the punishments inflicted on offenders there was a kind of liberty which does not exist nowthe liberty a man had of doing just what he thought proper in his own house this rawlings had a numerous family and some died at home and others lived to grow up and go out into the world under strange namesfaith hope and charity were three of his daughters and justice morality and fortitude three of his sons now for some reason rawlings objected to the burial of his dead in the churchyard of the nearest villagemonkton deverill and the story is that he quarrelled with the rector over the question of the church bell being tolled for the funeral he would have no bell tolled he swore and the rector would bury no one without the bell thereupon rawlings had the coffined corpse deposited on a table in an outhouse and the door made fast later there was another death then a third and all three were kept in the same place for several years and although it was known to the whole countryside no action was taken by the local authorities  my old informant says that he was often at the farm when he was a young man and he used to steal round to the dead house as it was called to peep through a crack in the door and see the three coffins resting on the table in the dim interior  eventually the dead disappeared a little while before the rawlings gave up the farm and it was supposed that the old farmer had buried them in the nighttime in one of the neighbouring chalkpits but the spot has never been discovered  one of the stories of the old wiltshire days i picked up was from an old woman aged eightyseven in the wilton workhouse she has a vivid recollection of a labourer named reed in odstock a village on the ebble near salisbury a stern silent man who was a marvel of strength and endurance the work in which he most delighted was precisely that which most labourers hated before threshing machines came in despite the action of the mobsthreshing out corn with the flail from earliest dawn till after dark he would sit or stand in a dim dusty barn monotonously pounding away without an interval to rest and without dinner and with no food but a piece of bread and a pinch of salt without the salt he would not eat the bread an hour after all others had ceased from work he would put on his coat and trudge home to his wife and family  the woman in the workhouse remembers that once when reed was a very old man past work he came to their cottage for something and while he stood waiting at the entrance a little boy ran in and asked his mother for a piece of bread and butter with sugar on it old reed glared at him and shaking his big stick exclaimed id give you sugar with this if you were my boy and so terrible did he look in his anger at the luxury of the times that the little boy burst out crying and ran away  what chiefly interested me about this old man was that he was a deerstealer of the days when that offence was common in the country it was not so great a crime as sheepstealing for which men were hanged taking a deer was punished with nothing worse than hard labour as a rule but reed was never caught he would labour his full time and steal away after dark over the downs to return in the small hours with a deer on his back it was not for his own consumption he wanted the money for which he sold it in salisbury and it is probable that he was in league with other poachers as it is hard to believe that he could capture the animals singlehanded  after his death it was found that old reed had left a hundred pounds to each of his two surviving daughters and it was a wonder to everybody how he had managed not only to bring up a family and keep himself out of the workhouse to the end of his long life but to leave so large a sum of money one can only suppose that he was a rigid economist and never had a weeks illness and that by abstaining from beer and tobacco he was able to save a couple of shillings each week out of his wages of seven or eight shillings this in forty years would make the two hundred pounds with something over  it is not a very rare thing to find a farmlabourer like old reed of odstock with not only a strong preference for a particular kind of work but a love of it as compelling as that of an artist for his art some friends of mine whom i went to visit over the border in dorset told me of an enthusiast of this description who had recently died in the village what a pity you did not come sooner they said alas it is nearly always so on first coming to stay at a village one is told that it has but just lost its oldest and most interesting inhabitanta relic of the olden time  this man had taken to the scythe as reed had to the flail and was never happy unless he had a field to mow he was a very tall old man so lean that he looked like a skeleton the bones covered with a skin as brown as old leather and he wore his thin grey hair and snowwhite beard very long he rode on a white donkey and was usually seen mounted galloping down the village street hatless his old brown bare feet and legs drawn up to keep them from the ground his scythe over his shoulder here comes old father time they would cry as they called him and run to the door to gaze with ever fresh delight at the wonderful old man as he rushed by kicking and shouting at his donkey to make him go faster he was always in a hurry hunting for work with furious zeal and when he got a field to mow so eager was he that he would not sleep at home even if it was close by but would lie down on the grass at the side of the field and start working at dawn between two and three oclock quite three hours before the world woke up to its daily toil  the name of reed the zealous thresher with the flail serves to remind me of yet another reed a woman who died a few years ago aged ninetyfour and whose name should be cherished in one of the downland villages she was a native of barford st martin on the nadder one of two villages the other being wishford on the wylye river the inhabitants of which have the right to go into groveley wood an immense forest on the wilton estate to obtain wood for burning each person being entitled to take home as much wood as he or she can carry the people of wishford take green wood but those of barford only dead they having bartered their right at a remote period to cut growing trees for a yearly sum of five pounds which the lord of the manor still pays to the village and in addition the right to take dead wood  it will be readily understood that this right possessed by the people of two villages both situated within a mile of the forest has been a perpetual source of annoyance to the noble owners in modern times since the strict preservation of game especially of pheasants has grown to be almost a religion to the landowners now it came to pass that about half a century or longer ago the pembroke of that time made the happy discovery as he imagined that there was nothing to show that the barford people had any right to the dead wood they had been graciously allowed to take it as was the case all over the country at that time and that was all at once he issued an edict prohibiting the taking of dead wood from the forest by the villagers and great as the loss was to them they acquiesced not a man of barford st martin dared to disobey the prohibition or raise his voice against it grace reed then determined to oppose the mighty earl and accompanied by four other women of the village boldly went to the wood and gathered their sticks and brought them home they were summoned before the magistrates and fined and on their refusal to pay were sent to prison but the very next day they were liberated and told that a mistake had been made that the matter had been inquired into and it had been found that the people of barford did really have the right they had exercised so long to take dead wood from the forest  as a result of the action of these women the right has not been challenged since and on my last visit to barford a few days before writing this chapter i saw three women coming down from the forest with as much dead wood as they could carry on their heads and backs but how near they came to losing their right it was a bold an unheardof thing which they did and if there had not been a poor cottage woman with the spirit to do it at the proper moment the right could never have been revived  grace reeds childrens children are living at barford now they say that to the very end of her long life she preserved a very clear memory of the people and events of the village in the old days early in the last century they say too that in recalling the far past the old people and scenes would present themselves so vividly to her mind that she would speak of them as of recent things and would say to some one fifty years younger than herself cant you remember it surely you havent forgotten it when twas the talk of the village  it is a common illusion of the very aged and i had an amusing instance of it in my old hindon friend when he gave me his first impressions of bath as he saw it about the year 1835 what astonished him most were the sedanchairs for he had never even heard of such a conveyance but here in this city of wonders you met them in every street then he added but youve been to bath and of course youve seen them and know all about it  about firewoodgathering by the poor in woods and forests my old friend of fonthill bishop says that the people of the villages adjacent to the fonthill and great ridge woods were allowed to take as much dead wood as they wanted from those places she was accustomed to go to the great ridge wood which was even wilder and more like a natural forest in those days than it is now it was fully two miles from her village a longish distance to carry a heavy load and it was her custom after getting the wood out to bind it firmly in a large barrelshaped bundle or faggot as in that way she could roll it down the smooth steep slopes of the down and so get her burden home without so much groaning and sweating the great wood was then full of hazeltrees and produced such an abundance of nuts that from midjuly to september people flocked to it for the nutting from all the country round coming even from bath and bristol to load their carts with nuts in sacks for the market later when the wood began to be more strictly preserved for sporting purposes the rabbits were allowed to increase excessively and during the hard winters they attacked the hazeltrees gnawing off the bark until this most useful and profitable wood the forest producedthe scrubby oaks having little valuewas wellnigh extirpated by and by pheasants as well as rabbits were strictly preserved and the firewoodgatherers were excluded altogether at present you find dead wood lying about all over the place abundantly as in any primitive forest where trees die of old age or disease or are blown down or broken off by the winds and are left to rot on the ground overgrown with ivy and brambles but of all this dead wood not a stick to boil a kettle may be taken by the neighbouring poor lest the pheasants should be disturbed or a rabbit be picked up  some more of the old dames recollections will be given in the next chapter showing what the condition of the people was in this district about the year 1830 when the poor farmlabourers were driven by hunger and misery to revolt against their mastersthe farmers who were everywhere breaking up the downs with the plough to sow more and still more corn who were growing very fat and paying higher and higher rents to their fat landlords while the wretched men that drove the plough had hardly enough to satisfy their hunger     chapter xvii  old wiltshire

a black caphow the revolting labourers were punisheda last   scene at salisbury court houseinquest on a murdered manpolicy of the   farmers   the story of her early life told by my old friend joan aged ninetyfour will serve to give some idea of the extreme poverty and hard suffering life of the agricultural labourers during the thirties of last century at a time when farmers were exceedingly prosperous and landlords drawing high rents  she was three years old when her mother died after the birth of a boy the last of eleven children there was a dames school in their little village of fonthill abbey but the poverty of the family would have made it impossible for joan to attend had it not been for an unselfish person residing there a mr king who was anxious that every child should be taught its letters he paid for little joans schooling from the age of four to eight and now in the evening of her life when she sits by the fire with her book she blesses the memory of the man dead these seventy or eighty years who made this solace possible for her  after the age of eight there could be no more school for now all the older children had gone out into the world to make their own poor living the boys to work on distant farms the girls to service or to be wives and joan was wanted at home to keep house for her father to do the washing mending cleaning cooking and to be mother to her little brother as well  her father was a ploughman at seven shillings a week but when joan was ten he met with a dreadful accident when ploughing with a couple of young or intractable oxen in trying to stop them he got entangled in the ropes and one of his legs badly broken by the plough as a result it was six months before he could leave his cottage the overseer of the parish a prosperous farmer who had a large farm a couple of miles away came to inquire into the matter and see what was to be done his decision was that the man would receive three shillings a week until able to start work again and as that would just serve to keep him the children must go out to work meanwhile one of the married daughters had come to look after her father in the cottage and that set the little ones free  the overseer said he would give them work on his farm and pay them a few pence apiece and give them their meals so to his farm they went returning each evening home that was her first place and from that time on she was a toiler indoors and out but mainly in the fields till she was past eightyfiveseventyfive years of hard workthen less and less as her wonderful strength diminished and her sons and daughters were getting grey until now at the age of ninetyfour she does very littlepractically nothing  in that first place she had a very hard master in the farmer and overseer he was known in all the neighbourhood as devil turner and even at that time when farmers had their men under their heel as it were he was noted for his savage tyrannical disposition also for a curious sardonic humour which displayed itself in the forms of punishment he inflicted on the workmen who had the illluck to offend him the man had to take the punishment however painful or disgraceful without a murmur or go and starve every morning thereafter joan and her little brother aged seven had to be up in time to get to the farm at five oclock in the morning and if it was raining or snowing or bitterly cold so much the worse for them but they had to be there for devil turners bad temper was harder to bear than bad weather joan was a girl of all work in and out of doors and in severe weather when there was nothing else for her to do she would be sent into the fields to gather flints the coldest of all tasks for her little hands  but what could your little brother a child of seven do in such a place i asked  she laughed when she told me of her little brothers very first day at the farm the farmer was for a devil considerate and gave him something very light for a beginning which was to scare the birds from the ricks and if they will come back you must catch them he said and left the little fellow to obey the difficult command as he could the birds that worried him most were the fowls for however often he hunted them away they would come back again eventually he found some string with which he made some little loops fastened to sticks and these he arranged on a spot of ground he had cleared scattering a few grains of corn on it to attract the birds by this means he succeeded in capturing three of the robbers and when the farmer came round at noon to see how he was getting on the little fellow showed him his captures these are not birds said the farmer they are fowls and dont you trouble yourself any more about them but keep your eye on the sparrows and little birds and rooks and jackdaws that come to pull the straws out  that was how he started then from the ricks to birdscaring in the fields and to other tasks suited to one of his age not without much suffering and many tears the worst experience was the punishment of standing motionless for long hours at a time on a chair placed out in the yard full in sight of the windows of the house so that he could be seen by the inmates the hardest the cruellest task that could be imposed on him would come as a relief after this joan suffered no punishment of that kind she was very anxious to please her master and worked hard but she was an intelligent and spirited child and as the sole result of her best efforts was that more and more work was put on her she revolted against such injustice and eventually tried beyond endurance she ran away home and refused to go back to the farm any more she found some work in the village for now her sister had to go back to her husband and joan had to take her place and look after her father and the house as well as earn something to supplement the three shillings a week they had to live on  after about nine months her father was up and out again and went back to the plough for just then a great deal of down was being broken up and brought under cultivation on account of the high price of wheat and good ploughmen were in request he was lame the injured limb being now considerably shorter than the other and when ploughing he could only manage to keep on his legs by walking with the longer one in the furrow and the other on the higher ground but after struggling on for some months in this way suffering much pain and his strength declining he met with a fresh accident and was laid up once more in his cottage and from that time until his death he did no more farm work joan and her little brother lived or slept at home and worked to keep themselves and him  now in this her own little story and in her account of the condition of the people at that time also in the histories of other old men and women whose memories go back as far as hers supplemented by a little reading in the newspapers of that day i can understand how it came about that these poor labourers poor spiritless slaves as they had been made by long years of extremest poverty and systematic oppression rose at last against their hard masters and smashed the agricultural machines and burnt ricks and broke into houses to destroy and plunder their contents it was a desperate a mad adventurethese gatherings of halfstarved yokels armed with sticks and axes and they were quickly put down and punished in a way that even william the bastard would not have considered as too lenient but oppression had made them mad the introduction of thrashing machines was but the last straw the culminating act of the hideous system followed by landlords and their tenantsthe former to get the highest possible rent for his land the other to get his labour at the lowest possible rate it was a compact between landlord and tenant aimed against the labourer it was not merely the fact that the wages of a strong man were only seven shillings a week at the outside a sum barely sufficient to keep him and his family from starvation and rags as a fact it was not enough and but for a little poaching and stealing he could not have lived but it was customary especially on the small farms to get rid of the men after the harvest and leave them to exist the best way they could during the bitter winter months thus every village as a rule had its dozen or twenty or more men thrown out each yeargood steady men with families dependent on them and besides these there were the aged and weaklings and the lads who had not yet got a place the misery of these outofwork labourers was extreme they would go to the woods and gather faggots of dead wood which they would try to sell in the villages but there were few who could afford to buy of them and at night they would skulk about the fields to rob a swede or two to satisfy the cravings of hunger  in some parishes the farmer overseers were allowed to give relief workout of the rates it goes without sayingto these unemployed men of the village who had been discharged in october or november and would be wanted again when the winter was over they would be put to flintgathering in the fields their wages being four shillings a week some of the very old people of winterbourne bishop when speaking of the principal food of the labourers at that time the barley bannock and its exceeding toughness gave me an amusing account of a game of balls invented by the flintgatherers just for the sake of a little fun during their long weary day in the fields especially in cold frosty weather the men would take their dinners with them consisting of a few barley balls or cakes in their coat pockets and at noon they would gather at one spot to enjoy their meal and seat themselves on the ground in a very wide circle the men about ten yards apart then each one would produce his bannocks and start throwing aiming at some other mans face there were hits and misses and great excitement and hilarity for twenty or thirty minutes after which the earth and gravel adhering to the balls would be wiped off and they would set themselves to the hard task of masticating and swallowing the heavy stuff  at sunset they would go home to a supper of more barley bannocks washed down with hot water flavoured with some aromatic herb or weed and then straight to bed to get warm for there was little firing  it was not strange that sheepstealing was one of the commonest offences against the law at that time in spite of the dreadful penalty hunger made the people reckless my old friend joan and other old persons have said to me that it appeared in those days that the men were strangely indifferent and did not seem to care whether they were hanged or not it is true they did not hang very many of themthe judge as a rule after putting on his black cap and ordering them to the gallows would send in a recommendation to mercy for most of them but the mercy of that time was like that of the wicked exceedingly cruel instead of swinging it was transportation for life or for fourteen and at the very least seven years those who have read clarkes terrible book for the term of his natural life know in a way what these poor wiltshire labourers who in most cases were never more heard of by their wives and children were sent to endure in australia and tasmania  and some were hanged my friend joan named some people she knows in the neighbourhood who are the grandchildren of a young man with a wife and family of small children who was hanged at salisbury she had a vivid recollection of this case because it had seemed so hard the man having been maddened by want when he took a sheep also because when he was hanged his poor young wife travelled to the place of slaughter to beg for his body and had it brought home and buried decently in the village churchyard  how great the temptation to steal sheep must have been anyone may know now by merely walking about among the fields in this part of the country to see how the sheep are folded and left by night unguarded often at long distances from the village in distant fields and on the downs even in the worst times it was never customary never thought necessary to guard the flock by night many cases could be given to show how easy it was to steal sheep one quite recent about twenty years ago is of a shepherd who was frequently sent with sheep to the fairs and who on his way to wilton fair with a flock one night turned aside to open a fold and let out nineteen sheep on arriving at the fair he took out the stolen sheep and sold them to a butcher of his acquaintance who sent them up to london but he had taken too many from one flock they were quickly missed and by some lucky chance it was found out and the shepherd arrested he was sentenced to eight months hard labour and it came out during the trial that this poor shepherd whose wages were fourteen shillings a week had a sum of l400 to his credit in a salisbury bank  another case which dates far back is that of a farmer named day who employed a shepherd or drover to take sheep to the fairs and markets and steal sheep for him on the way it is said that he went on at this game for years before it was discovered eventually master and man quarrelled and the drover gave information whereupon day was arrested and lodged in fisherton jail at salisbury later he was sent to take his trial at devizes on horseback accompanied by two constables at the druids head a publichouse on the way the three travellers alighted for refreshments and there day succeeded in giving them the slip and jumping on a fast horse standing ready saddled for him made his escape farmer day never returned to the plain and was never heard of again  there is an element of humour in some of the sheepstealing stories of the old days at one village where i often stayed i heard about a certain ebenezer garlick who was commonly called in allusion no doubt to his surname sweet vilets he was a sober hardworking man an example to most but there was this against him that he cherished a very close friendship with a poor disreputable drunken loafer nicknamed flittermouse who spent most of his time hanging about the old coaching inn at the place for the sake of tips sweet vilets was always giving coppers and sixpences to this man but one day they fell out when flittermouse begged for a shilling he must he said have a shilling he couldnt do with less and when the other refused he followed him demanding the money with abusive words to everybodys astonishment finally sweet vilets turned on him and told him to go to the devil flittermouse in a rage went straight to the constable and denounced his patron as a sheepstealer he flittermouse had been his servant and helper and on the very last occasion of stealing a sheep he had got rid of the skin and offal by throwing them down an old disused well at the top of the village street to the well the constable went with ropes and hooks and succeeded in fishing up the remains described and he thereupon arrested garlick and took him before a magistrate who committed him for trial flittermouse was the only witness for the prosecution and the judge in his summing up said that taking into consideration garlicks known character in the village as a sober diligent honest man it would be a little too much to hang him on the unsupported testimony of a creature like flittermouse who was half fool and half scoundrel the jury pleased and very much surprised at being directed to let a man off obediently returned a verdict of not guilty and sweet vilets returned from salisbury triumphant to be congratulated on his escape by all the villagers who however slyly winked and smiled at one another  of sheepstealing stories i will relate one morea case which never came into court and was never discovered it was related to me by a middleaged man a shepherd of warminster who had it from his father a shepherd of chitterne one of the lonely isolated villages on salisbury plain between the avon and the wylye his father had it from the person who committed the crime and was anxious to tell it to some one and knew that the shepherd was his true friend a silent safe man he was a farmlabourer named shergoldone of the south wiltshire surnames very common in the early part of last century which now appear to be dying outdescribed as a very big powerful man full of life and energy he had a wife and several young children to keep and the time was near midwinter shergold was out of work having been discharged from the farm at the end of the harvest it was an exceptionally cold season and there was no food and no firing in the house  one evening in late december a drover arrived at chitterne with a flock of sheep which he was driving to tilshead another downland village several miles away he was anxious to get to tilshead that night and wanted a man to help him shergold was on the spot and undertook to go with him for the sum of fourpence they set out when it was getting dark the sheep were put on the road the drover going before the flock and shergold following at the tail it was a cold cloudy night threatening snow and so dark that he could hardly distinguish the dim forms of even the hindmost sheep and by and by the temptation to steal one assailed him for how easy it would be for him to do it with his tremendous strength he could kill and hide a sheep very quickly without making any sound whatever to alarm the drover he was very far ahead shergold could judge the distance by the sound of his voice when he uttered a call or shout from time to time and by the barking of the dog as he flew up and down first on one side of the road then on the other to keep the flock well on it and he thought of what a sheep would be to him and to his hungry ones at home until the temptation was too strong and suddenly lifting his big heavy stick he brought it down with such force on the head of a sheep as to drop it with its skull crushed dead as a stone hastily picking it up he ran a few yards away and placed it among the furzebushes intending to take it home on his way back and then returned to the flock  they arrived at tilshead in the small hours and after receiving his fourpence he started for home walking rapidly and then running to be in time but when he got back to where the sheep was lying the dawn was coming and he knew that before he could get to chitterne with that heavy burden on his back people would be getting up in the village and he would perhaps be seen the only thing to do was to hide the sheep and return for it on the following night accordingly he carried it away a couple of hundred yards to a pit or small hollow in the down full of bramble and furzebushes and here he concealed it covering it with a mass of dead bracken and herbage and left it that afternoon the longthreatening snow began to fall and with snow on the ground he dared not go to recover his sheep since his footprints would betray him he must wait once more for the snow to melt but the snow fell all night and what must his feelings have been when he looked at it still falling in the morning and knew that he could have gone for the sheep with safety since all traces would have been quickly obliterated  once more there was nothing to do but wait patiently for the snow to cease falling and for the thaw but how intolerable it was for the weather continued bitterly cold for many days and the whole country was white during those hungry days even that poor comfort of sleeping or dozing away the time was denied him for the danger of discovery was ever present to his mind and shergold was not one of the callous men who had become indifferent to their fate it was his first crime and he loved his own life and his wife and children crying to him for food and the food for them was lying there on the down close by and he could not get it roast mutton boiled muttonmutton in a dozen delicious formsthe thought of it was as distressing as maddening as that of the peril he was in  it was a full fortnight before the wished thaw came then with fear and trembling he went for his sheep only to find that it had been pulled to pieces and the flesh devoured by dogs and foxes  from these memories of the old villagers i turn to the newspapers of the day to make a few citations  the law as it was did not distinguish between a case of the kind just related of the starving sorely tempted shergold and that of the systematic thief sheepstealing was a capital offence and the man must hang unless recommended to mercy and we know what was meant by mercy in those days that so barbarous a law existed within memory of people to be found living in most villages appears almost incredible to us but despite the recommendations to mercy usual in a large majority of cases the law of that time was not more horrible than the temper of the men who administered it there are good and bad among all and in all professions but there is also a black spot in most possibly in all hearts which may be developed to almost any extent and change the justest wisest most moral men into human devilsthe phrase invented by canon wilberforce in another connexion in reading the old reports and the expressions used by the judges in their summings up and sentences it is impossible not to believe that the awful power they possessed and its constant exercise had not only produced the inevitable hardening effect but had made them cruel in the true sense of the word their pleasure in passing dreadful sentences was very thinly disguised indeed by certain lofty conventional phrases as to the necessity of upholding the law morality and religion they were indeed as familiar with the name of the deity as any ranter in a conventicle and the enormity of the crime was an expression as constantly used in the case of the theft of a loaf of bread or of an old coat left hanging on a hedge by some illclad halfstarved wretch as in cases of burglary arson rape and murder  it is surprising to find how very few the real crimes were in those days despite the misery of the people that nearly all the crimes for which men were sentenced to the gallows and to transportation for life or for long terms were offences which would now be sufficiently punished by a few weeks or even a few days imprisonment thus in april 1825 i note that mr justice park commented on the heavy appearance of the calendar it was not so much the number 170 of the offenders that excited his concern as it was the nature of the crimes with which they were charged the worst crime in this instance was sheepstealing  again this same mr justice park at the spring assizes at salisbury 1827 said that though the calendar was a heavy one he was happy to find on looking at the depositions of the principal cases that they were not of a very serious character nevertheless he passed sentence of death on twentyeight persons among them being one for stealing half a crown  of the twentyeight all but three were eventually reprieved one of the fated three being a youth of nineteen who was charged with stealing a mare and pleaded guilty in spite of a warning from the judge not to do so this irritated the great man who had the power of life and death in his hand in passing sentence the judge expatiated on the prevalence of the crime of horsestealing and the necessity of making an example the enormity of reads crime rendered him a proper example and he would therefore hold out no hope of mercy towards him as to the plea of guilty he remarked that nowadays too many persons pleaded guilty deluded with the hope that it would be taken into consideration and they would escape the severer penalty he was determined to put a stop to that sort of thing if read had not pleaded guilty no doubt some extenuating circumstance would have come up during the trial and he would have saved his life  there if ever spoke the human devil in a black cap  i find another case of a sentence of transportation for life on a youth of eighteen named edward baker for stealing a pockethandkerchief had he pleaded guilty it might have been worse for him  at the salisbury spring assizes 1830 mr justice gazalee addressing the grand jury said that none of the crimes appeared to be marked with circumstances of great moral turpitude the prisoners numbered one hundred and thirty he passed sentences of death on twentynine life transportations on five fourteen years on five seven years on eleven and various terms of hard labour on the others  the severity of the magistrates at the quartersessions was equally revolting i notice in one case where the leading magistrate on the bench was a great local magnate an mp for salisbury etc a poor fellow with the unfortunate name of moses snook was charged with stealing a plank ten feet long the property of the aforesaid local magnate mp etc and sentenced to fourteen years transportation sentenced by the man who owned the plank worth perhaps a shilling or two  when such was the law of the land and the temper of those who administered itjudges and magistrates or landlordswhat must the misery of the people have been to cause them to rise in revolt against their masters they did nothing outrageous even in the height of their frenzy they smashed the thrashing machines burnt some ricks while the maddest of them broke into a few houses and destroyed their contents but they injured no man yet they knew what they were facingthe gallows or transportation to the penal settlements ready for their reception at the antipodes it is a pity that the history of this rising of the agricultural labourer the most patient and submissive of men has never been written nothing in fact has ever been said of it except from the point of view of landowners and farmers but there is ample material for a truer and a moving narrative not only in the brief reports in the papers of the time but also in the memories of many persons still living and of their children and childrens children preserved in many a cottage throughout the south of england  hopeless as the revolt was and quickly suppressed it had served to alarm the landlords and their tenants and taken in conjunction with other outbreaks notably at bristol it produced a sense of anxiety in the mind of the country generally the feeling found a somewhat amusing expression in the house of commons in a motion of mr perceval on 14th february 1831 this was to move an address to his majesty to appoint a day for a general fast throughout the united kingdom he said that the state of the country called for a measure like thisthat it was a state of political and religious disorganizationthat the elements of the constitution were being hourly loosenedthat in this land there was no attachment no control no humility of spirit no mutual confidence between the poor man and the rich the employer and the employed but fear and mistrust and aversion where in the time of our fathers there was nothing but brotherly love and rejoicing before the lord  the house was cynical and smilingly put the matter by but the anxiety was manifested plainly enough in the treatment meted out to the poor men who had been arrested and were tried before the special commissions sent down to salisbury winchester and other towns no doubt it was a pleasant time for the judges at salisbury thirtyfour poor fellows were sentenced to death thirtythree to be transported for life ten for fourteen years and so on  and here is one last little scene about which the reports in the newspapers of the time say nothing but which i have from one who witnessed and clearly remembers it a woman of ninetyfive whose whole life has been passed at a village within sound of the salisbury cathedral bells  it was when the trial was ended when those who were found guilty and had been sentenced were brought out of the courthouse to be taken back to prison and from all over the plain and from all parts of wiltshire their womenfolk had come to learn their fate and were gathered a pale anxious weeping crowd outside the gates the sentenced men came out looking eagerly at the people until they recognized their own and cried out to them to be of good cheer tis hanging for me one would say but therell perhaps be a recommendation to mercy so dont you fret till you know then another dont go on so old mother tis only for life im sent and yet another dont you cry old girl tis only fourteen years ive got and maybe ill live to see you all again and so on as they filed out past their weeping women on their way to fisherton jail to be taken thence to the transports in portsmouth and plymouth harbours waiting to convey their living freights to that hell on earth so far from home not criminals but good brave men were thesewiltshiremen of that strong enduring patient class who not only as labourers on the land but on many a hardfought field in many parts of the world from of old down to our war of a few years ago in africa have shown the stuff that was in them  but alas for the poor women who were leftfor the old mother who could never hope to see her boy again and for the wife and her children who waited and hoped against hope through long toiling years    and dreamed and started as they slept   for joy that he was come  but waking saw his face no more very few so far as i can make out not more than one in five or six ever returned  this it may be said was only what they might have expected the law being what it wasjust the ordinary thing the hideous part of the business was that as an effect of the alarm created in the minds of those who feared injury to their property and loss of power to oppress the poor labourers there was money in plenty subscribed to hire witnesses for the prosecution it was necessary to strike terror into the people the smell of bloodmoney brought out a number of scoundrels who for a few pounds were only too ready to swear away the life of any man and it was notorious that numbers of poor fellows were condemned in this way  one incident as to this point may be given in conclusion of this chapter about old unhappy things it relates not to one of those who were sentenced to the gallows or to transportation but to an inquest and the treatment of the dead  i have spoken in the last chapter of the mob that visited hindon fonthill and other villages they ended their round at pytt house near tisbury where they broke up the machinery on that occasion a body of yeomanry came on the scene but arrived only after the mob had accomplished its purpose of breaking up the thrashing machines when the troops appeared the rioters as they were called made off into the woods and escaped but before they fled one of them had met his death a number of persons from the farms and villages around had gathered at the spot and were looking on when one a farmer from the neighbouring village of chilmark snatched a gun from a gamekeepers hand and shot one of the rioters killing him dead on 27th january 1831 an inquest was held on the body and some one was found to swear that the man had been shot by one of the yeomanry although it was known to everybody that when the man was shot the troop had not yet arrived on the scene the man this witness stated had attacked or threatened one of the soldiers with his stick and had been shot this was sufficient for the coroner he instructed his jury to bring in a verdict of justifiable homicide which they obediently did this verdict the coroner then said entailed the same consequences as an act of felodese and he felt that he could not give a warrant for the burial of the deceased however painful the duty devolved on him in thus adding to the sorrows of the surviving relations the law appeared too clear to him to admit of an alternative  the coroner was just as eager as the judges to exhibit his zeal for the gentry who were being injured in their interests by these disturbances and though he could not hang anybody being only a coroner he could at any rate kick the one corpse brought before him doubtless the surviving relations for whose sorrows he had expressed sympathy carried the poor murdered man off by night to hide him somewhere in the earth  after the law had been thus vindicated and all the business done with even to the corpsekicking by the coroner the farmers were still anxious and began to show it by holding meetings and discussions on the condition of the labourers everybody said that the men had been very properly punished but at the same time it was admitted that they had some reason for their discontent that with bread so dear it was hardly possible for a man with a family to support himself on seven shillings a week and it was generally agreed to raise the wages one shilling but by and by when the anxiety had quite died out when it was found that the men were more submissive than they had ever been the lesson they had received having sunk deep into their minds they cut off the extra shilling and wages were what they had beenseven shillings a week for a hardworking seasoned labourer with a family to keep and from four to six shillings for young unmarried men and for women even for those who did as much work in the field as any man  but there were no more risings     chapter xviii  the shepherds return    yarnborough castle sheepfaircaleb leaves doveton and goes into   dorseta land of strange happeningshe is homesick and returns to   winterbourne bishopjoseph his brother leaves homehis meeting with   calebs old mastersettles in dorset and is joined by his sister   hannahthey marry and have childreni go to look for themjoseph   bawcombe in extreme old agehannah in decline   calebs shepherding period in doveton came to a somewhat sudden conclusion it was nearing the end of august and he was beginning to think about the sheep which would have to be taken to the castle sheepfair on 5th october and it appeared strange to him that his master had so far said nothing to him on the subject by castle he meant yarnborough castle the name of a vast prehistoric earthwork on one of the high downs between warminster and amesbury there is no village there and no house near it is nothing but an immense circular wall and trench inside of which the fair is held it was formerly one of the most important sheepfairs in the country but for the last two or three decades has been falling off and is now of little account when bawcombe was shepherd at doveton it was still great and when he first went there as mr ellerbys headshepherd he found himself regarded as a person of considerable importance at the castle before setting out with the sheep he asked for his masters instructions and was told that when he got to the ground he would be directed by the persons in charge to the proper place the ellerbys he said had exhibited and sold their sheep there for a period of eightyeight years without missing a year and always at the same spot every person visiting the fair on business knew just where to find the ellerbys sheep and he added with pride they expected them to be the best sheep at the castle  one day mr ellerby came to have a talk with his shepherd and in reply to a remark of the latter about the october sheepfair he said that he would have no sheep to send no sheep to send master exclaimed caleb in amazement then mr ellerby told him that he had taken a notion into his head that he wanted to go abroad with his wife for a time and that some person had just made him so good an offer for all his sheep that he was going to accept it so that for the first time in eightyeight years there would be no sheep from doveton farm at the castle fair when he came back he would buy again but if he could live away from the farm he would probably never come backhe would sell it  caleb went home with a heavy heart and told his wife it grieved her too because of her feeling for mrs ellerby but in a little while she set herself to comfort him why whats wrong about it she asked twill be more n three months before the years out and masterll pay for all the time sure and we can go home to bishop and bide a little without work and see if that father of yours has forgiven ee for going away to warminster  so they comforted themselves and were beginning to think with pleasure of home when mr ellerby informed his shepherd that a friend of his a good man though not a rich one was anxious to take him as headshepherd with good wages and a good cottage rent free the only drawback for the bawcombes was that it would take them still farther from home for the farm was in dorset although quite near the wiltshire border  eventually they accepted the offer and by the middle of september were once more settled down in what was to them a strange land how strange it must have seemed to caleb how far removed from home and all familiar things when even to this day more than forty years later he speaks of it as the ordinary modern man might speak of a years residence in uganda tierra del fuego or the andaman islands it was a foreign country and the ways of the people were strange to him and it was a land of very strange things one of the strangest was an old ruined church in the neighbourhood of the farm where he was shepherd it was roofless more than half fallen down and all the standing portion with the tower overgrown with old ivy the building itself stood in the centre of a huge round earthwork and trench with large barrows on the ground outside the circle concerning this church he had a wonderful story its decay and ruin had come about after the great bell in the tower had mysteriously disappeared stolen one stormy night it was believed by the devil himself the stolen bell it was discovered had been flung into a small river at a distance of some miles from the church and there in summertime when the water was low it could be distinctly seen lying half buried in the mud at the bottom but all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt pull it out the devil who pulled the other way was strongest eventually some wise person said that a team of white oxen would be able to pull it out and after much seeking the white oxen were obtained and thick ropes were tied to the sunken bell and the cattle were goaded and yelled at and tugged and strained until the bell came up and was finally drawn right up to the top of the steep clifflike bank of the stream then one of the teamsters shouted in triumph now weve got out the bell in spite of all the devils in hell and no sooner had he spoken the bold words than the ropes parted and back tumbled the bell to its old place at the bottom of the river where it remains to this day caleb had once met a man in those parts who assured him that he had seen the bell with his own eyes lying nearly buried in mud at the bottom of the stream  the legend is not in the history of dorset a much more prosaic account of the disappearance of the bell is there given in which the devil took no part unless he was at the back of the bad men who were concerned in the business but in this strange remote country outside of wiltsheer bawcombe was in a region where anything might have happened where the very soil and pasture were unlike that of his native country and the mud adhered to his boots in a most unaccountable way it was almost uncanny doubtless he was homesick for a month or two before the end of the year he asked his master to look out for another shepherd  this was a great disappointment to the farmer he had gone a distance from home to secure a good shepherd and had hoped to keep him permanently and now after a single year he was going to lose him what did the shepherd want he would do anything to please him and begged him to stay another year but no his mind was set on going back to his own native village and to his own people and so when his long year was ended he took his crook and set out over the hills and valleys followed by a cart containing his sticks and wife and children and at home with his old parents and his people he was happy once more in a short time he found a place as headshepherd with a cottage in the village and followed his flock on the old familiar down and everything again was as it had been from the beginning of life and as he desired it to be even to the end  his return resulted incidentally in other changes and migrations in the bawcombe family his elder brother joseph unmarried still although his senior by about eight years had not got on well at home he was a person of a peculiar disposition so silent with so fixed and unsmiling an expression that he gave the idea of a stolid thickskinned man but at bottom he was of a sensitive nature and feeling that his master did not treat him properly he gave up his place and was for a long time without one he was singularly attentive to all that fell from caleb about his wide wanderings and strange experiences especially in the distant dorset country and at length about a year after his brothers return he announced his intention of going away from his native place for good to seek his fortune in some distant place where his services would perhaps be better appreciated when asked where he intended going he answered that he was going to look for a place in that part of dorset where caleb had been shepherd for a year and had been so highly thought of  now joseph being a single man had no sticks all his possessions went into a bundle which he carried tied to his crook and with his sheepdog following at his heels he set forth early one morning on the most important adventure of his life then occurred an instance of what we call a coincidence but which the shepherd of the downs nursed in the old beliefs and traditions prefers to regard as an act of providence  about noon he was trudging along in the turnpike road when he was met by a farmer driving in a trap who pulled up to speak to him and asked him if he could say how far it was to winterbourne bishop joseph replied that it was about fourteen mileshe had left bishop that morning  then the farmer asked him if he knew a man there named caleb bawcombe and if he had a place as shepherd there as he was now on his way to look for him and to try and persuade him to go back to dorset where he had been his headshepherd for the space of a year  joseph said that caleb had a place as headshepherd on a farm at bishop that he was satisfied with it and was moreover one that preferred to bide in his native place  the farmer was disappointed and the other added maybe youve heard caleb speak of his elder brother josephi be he  what exclaimed the farmer youre calebs brother where be going thento a new place  ive got no place i be going to look for a place in dorsetsheer  tis strange to hear you say that exclaimed the farmer he was going he said to see caleb and if he would not or could not go back to dorset himself to ask him to recommend some man of the village to him for he was tired of the ways of the shepherds of his own part of the country and his heart was set on getting a man from calebs village where shepherds understood sheep and knew their work now look here shepherd he continued if youll engage yourself to me for a year ill go no farther but take you right back with me in the trap  the shepherd was very glad to accept the offer he devoutly believed that in making it the farmer was but acting in accordance with the will of a power that was mindful of man and kept watch on him even on his poor servant joseph who had left his home and people to be a stranger in a strange land  so well did servant and master agree that joseph never had occasion to look for another place when his master died an old man his son succeeded him as tenant of the farm and he continued with the son until he was past work before his first year was out his younger sister hannah came to live with him and keep house and eventually they both got married joseph to a young woman of the place and hannah to a small working farmer whose farm was about a mile from the village children were born to both and in time grew up josephs sons following their fathers vocation while hannahs were brought up to work on the farm and some of them too got married in time and had children of their own  these are the main incidents in the lives of joseph and hannah related to me at different times by their brother he had followed their fortunes from a distance sometimes getting a message or hearing of them incidentally but he did not see them joseph never returned to his native village and the visits of hannah to her old home had been few and had long ceased but he cherished a deep enduring affection for both he was always anxiously waiting and hoping for tidings of them for joseph was now a feeble old man living with one of his sons and hannah long a widow was in declining health but still kept the farm assisted by one of her sons and two unmarried daughters though he had not heard for a long time it never occurred to him to write nor did they ever write to him  then when i was staying at winterbourne bishop and had the intention of shortly paying a visit to caleb it occurred to me one day to go into dorset and look for these absent ones so as to be able to give him an account of their state it was not a long journey and arrived at the village i soon found a son of joseph a finelooking man who took me to his cottage where his wife led me into the old shepherds room i found him very aged in appearance with a grey face and sunken cheeks lying on his bed and breathing with difficulty but when i spoke to him of caleb a light of joy came into his eyes and he raised himself on his pillows and questioned me eagerly about his brothers state and family and begged me to assure caleb that he was still quite well although too feeble to get about much and that his children were taking good care of him  from the old brother i went on to seek the young sisterthere was a difference of more than twenty years in their respective agesand found her at dinner in the large old farmhouse kitchen at all events she was presiding the others present being her son their hired labourer the farm boy and two unmarried daughters she herself tasted no food i joined them at their meal and it gladdened and saddened me at the same time to be with this woman for she was calebs sister and was attractive in herself looking strangely young for her age with beautiful dark soft eyes and but few white threads in her abundant black hair the attraction was also in her voice and speech and manner but alas there was that in her face which was painful to witnessthe signs of long suffering of nights that bring no refreshment an expression in the eyes of one that is looking anxiously out into the dim distancea vast unbounded prospect but with clouds and darkness resting on it  it was not without a feeling of heaviness at the heart that i said goodbye to her nor was i surprised when less than a year later caleb received news of her death     chapter xix  the dark people of the village    how the materials for this book were obtainedthe hedgehoghuntera   gipsy

of the villageaccount of liddyhis shepherdinga happy life   with horsesdies of a broken hearthis daughter   i have sometimes laughed to myself when thinking how a large part of the material composing this book was collected it came to me in conversations at intervals during several years with the shepherd in his long life in his native village a good deal of it spent on the quiet down he had seen many things it was or would be interesting to hear the things which had interested him too at the time and had fallen into oblivion yet might be recovered i discovered that it was of little use to question him the one valuable recollection he possessed on any subject would as a rule not be available when wanted it would lie just beneath the surface so to speak and he would pass and repass over the ground without seeing it he would not know that it was there it would be like the acorn which a jay or squirrel has hidden and forgotten all about which he will nevertheless recover some day if by chance something occurs to remind him of it the only method was to talk about the things he knew and when by chance he was reminded of some old experience or some little observation or incident worth hearing to make a note of it then wait patiently for something else it was a very slow process but it is not unlike the one we practise always with regard to wild nature we are not in a hurry but are always watchful with eyes and ears and mind open to what may come it is a mental habit and when nothing comes we are not disappointedthe act of watching has been a sufficient pleasure and when something does come we take it joyfully as if it were a gifta valuable object picked up by chance in our walks  when i turned into the shepherds cottage if it was in winter and he was sitting by the fire i would sit and smoke with him and if we were in a talking mood i would tell him where i had been and what i had heard and seen on the heath in the woods in the village or anywhere on the chance of its reminding him of something worth hearing in his past life  one sunday morning in the late summer during one of my visits to him i was out walking in the woods and found a man of the village a farm labourer with his small boy hunting for hedgehogs he had caught and killed two which the boy was carrying he told me he was very fond of the flesh of hedgehogspigs he called them for short he said he would not exchange one for a rabbit he always spent his holidays pighunting he had no dog and didnt want one he found them himself and his method was to look for the kind of place in which they were accustomed to livea thick mass of bramble growing at the side of an old ditch as a rule he would force his way into it and moving round and round trample down the roots and loose earth and dead leaves with his heavy ironshod boots until he broke into the nest or cell of the spiny little beast hidden away under the bush  he was a short broadfaced man with a brown skin black hair and intensely black eyes talking with the shepherd that evening i told him of the encounter and remarked that the man was probably a gipsy in blood although a labourer living in the village and married to a woman with blue eyes who belonged to the place  this incident reminded him of a family named targett in his native village consisting of four brothers and a sister he knew them first when he was a boy himself but could not remember their parents it seemed as if they didnt have any he said the four brothers were very much alike short with broad faces black eyes and hair and brown skins they were good workers but somehow they were never treated by the farmers like the other men they were paid less wagesas much as two to four shillings a week less per manand made to do things that others would not do and generally imposed upon it was known to every employer of labour in the place that they could be imposed upon yet they were not fools and occasionally if their master went too far in bullying and abusing them and compelling them to work overtime every day they would have sudden violent outbursts of rage and go off without any pay at all what became of their sister he never knew but none of the four brothers ever married they lived together always and two died in the village the other two going to finish their lives in the workhouse  one of the curious things about these brothers was that they had a passion for eating hedgehogs they had it from boyhood and as boys used to go a distance from home and spend the day hunting in hedges and thickets when they captured a hedgehog they would make a small fire in some sheltered spot and roast it and while it was roasting one of them would go to the nearest cottage to beg for a pinch of salt which was generally given  these too i said must have been gipsies at all events on one side where there is a cross the gipsy strain is generally strongest although the children if brought up in the community often remain in it all their lives but they are never quite of it their love of wildness and of eating wild flesh remains in them and it is also probable that there is an instability of character a restlessness which the small farmers who usually employ such men know and trade on the gipsy who takes to farm work must not look for the same treatment as the bigframed whiteskinned man who is as strong enduring and unchangeable as a draught horse or ox and constant as the sun itself  the gipsy element is found in many if not most villages in the south of england i know one large scattered village where it appears predominantas dirty and disorderlylooking a place as can be imagined the ground round every cottage resembling a gipsy camp but worse owing to its greater litter of old rags and rubbish strewn about but the people like all gipsies are not so poor as they look and most of the cottagers keep a trap and pony with which they scour the country for many miles around in quest of bones rags and bottles and anything else they can buy for a few pence also anything they can pick up for nothing  this is almost the only kind of settled life which a man with a good deal of gipsy blood in him can tolerate it affords some scope for his chaffering and predatory instincts and satisfies the roving passion which is not so strong in those of mixed blood but it is too respectable or humdrum a life for the true undegenerate gipsy one wet evening in september last i was prowling in a copse near shrewton watching the birds when i encountered a young gipsy and recognized him as one of a gang of about a dozen i had met several days before near salisbury they were on their way they had told me to a village near shaftesbury where they hoped to remain a week or so  what are you doing here i asked my gipsy  he said he had been to idmiston he had been on his legs out in the rain and wet to the skin since morning he didnt mind that much as the wet didnt hurt him and he was not tired but he had eight miles to walk yet over the downs to a village on the wylye where his people were staying  i remarked that i had thought they were staying over shaftesbury way  he then looked sharply at me ah yes he said i remember we met you and had some talk a fortnight ago yes we went there but they wouldnt have us they soon ordered us off they advised us to settle down if we wanted to stay anywhere settle down id rather be dead  there spoke the true gipsy and they are mostly of that mind but what a mind it is for human beings in this climate it is in a year like this of 1909 when a long cold winter and a miserable spring with frosty nights lasting well into june was followed by a cold wet summer and a wet autumn that we can see properly what a mind and body is hishow infinitely more perfect the correspondence between organism and environment in his case than in ours who have made our own conditions who have not only houses to live in but a vast army of sanitary inspectors physicians and bacteriologists to safeguard us from that wicked stepmother who is anxious to get rid of us before our time in all this miserable year during which i have met and conversed with and visited many scores of gipsies i have not found one who was not in a cheerful frame of mind even when he was under a cloud with the police on his track nor one with a cold or complaining of an ache in his bones or of indigestion  the subject of gipsies catching cold connects itself just now in my mind with that of the gipsys sense of humour he has that sense and it makes him happy when he is reposing in the bosom of his family and can give it free vent but the instant you appear on the scene its gracious outward signs vanish like lightning and he is once more the sly subtle animal watching you furtively but with intensity when you have left him and he relaxes the humour will come back to him for it is a humour similar to that of some of the lower animals especially birds of the crow family and of primitive people only more highly developed and is concerned mainly with the delight of trickerywith getting the better of some one and the huge enjoyment resulting from the process  one morning between nine and ten oclock during the excessively cold spell near the end of november 1909 i paid a visit to some gipsies i knew at their camp the men had already gone off for the day but some of the women were therea young married woman two big girls and six or seven children it was a hard frost and their sleeping accommodation was just as in the summertimebundles of straw and old rugs placed in or against little halfopen canvas and rag shelters but they all appeared remarkably well and some of the children were standing on the hard frozen ground with bare feet they assured me that they were all well that they hadnt caught colds and didnt mind the cold i remarked that i had thought the severe frost might have proved too much for some of them in that high unsheltered spot in the downs and that if i had found one of the children down with a cold i should have given it a sixpence to comfort it oh cried the young married woman theres my poor six months old baby half dead of a cold hes very bad poor dear and im in great trouble about him  he is bad the darling cried one of the big girls ill soon show you how bad he is and with that she dived into a pile of straw and dragged out a huge fat sleeping baby holding it up in her arms she begged me to look at it to see how bad it was the fat baby slowly opened its drowsy eyes and blinked at the sun but uttered no sound for it was not a crying baby but was like a great fat retriever pup pulled out of its warm bed  how healthy they are is hardly known even to those who make a special study of these aliens who albeit aliens are yet more native than any englishman in the land it is not merely their indifference to wet and cold more wonderful still is their doglike capacity of assimilating food which to us would be deadly this is indeed not a nice or pretty subject and i will give but one instance to illustrate my point the reader with a squeamish stomach may skip the ensuing paragraph  an old shepherd of chitterne relates that a family or gang of gipsies used to turn up from time to time at the village he generally saw them at lambingtime when one of the heads of the party with whom he was friendly would come round to see what he had to give them on one occasion his gipsy friend appeared and after some conversation on general subjects asked him if he had anything in his way no nothing this time said the shepherd lambing was over two or three months ago and theres nothing leftno dead lamb i hung up a few cauls on a beam in the old shed thinking they would do for the dogs but forgot them and they went bad and then dried up  theyll do very well for us said his friend  no dont you take them cried the shepherd in alarm i tell you they went bad months ago and twould kill anyone to eat such stuff theyve dried up now and are dry and black as old skin  that doesnt matterwe know how to make them all right said the gipsy soaked with a little salt then boiled theyll do very well and off he carried them  in reading the reports of the assizes held at salisbury from the late eighteenth century down to about 1840 it surprised me to find how rarely a gipsy appeared in that long sad monotonous procession of criminals who passed before the man sitting with his black cap on his head and were sent to the gallows or to the penal settlements for stealing sheep and fowls and ducks or anything else yet the gipsies were abundant then as now living the same wild lawless life quartering the country and hanging round the villages to spy out everything stealable the man caught was almost invariably the poor slowminded heavyfooted agricultural labourer the light quickmoving cunning gipsy escaped in the salisbury journal for 1820 i find a communication on this subject in which the writer says that a common trick of the gipsies was to dig a deep pit at their camp in which to bury a stolen sheep and on this spot they would make their camp fire if the sheep was not missed or if no report of its loss was made to the police the thieves would soon be able to dig it up and enjoy it but if inquiries were made they would have to wait until the affair had blown over  it amused me to find from an incident related to me by a workman in a village where i was staying lately that this simple ancient device is still practised by the gipsies my informant said that on going out at about four oclock one morning during the late summer he was surprised at seeing two gipsies with a pony and cart at the spot where a party of them had been encamped a fortnight before he watched them himself unseen and saw that they were digging a pit on the spot where they had had their fire they took out several objects from the ground but he was too far away to make out what they were they put them in the cart and covered them over then filled up the pit trampled the earth well down and put the ashes and burnt sticks back in the same place after which they got into the cart and drove off  of course a man even a nomad must have some place to conceal his treasures or belongings in and the gipsy has no cellar nor attic nor secret cupboard and as for his van it is about the last place in which he would bestow anything of value or incriminating for though he is always on the move he is moving or sitting still always under a cloud the ground is therefore the safest place to hide things in especially in a country like the wiltshire downs though he may use rocks and hollow trees in other districts his habit is that of the jay and magpie and of the dog with a bone to put by till it is wanted possibly the rural police have not yet discovered this habit of the gipsy indeed the contrast in mind and locomotive powers between the gipsy and the village policeman has often amused me the former most like the thievish jay ever on mischief bent the other who has his eye on him is more like the portly cochinchina fowl of the farmyard or the muscovy duck or stately gobbler  to go back when the buried sheep had to be kept too long buried and was found gone bad when disinterred i fancy it made little difference to the diners one remembers thoreaus pleasure at the spectacle of a crowd of vultures feasting on the carrion of a dead horse the fine healthy appetite and boundless vigour of nature filled him with delight but it is not only some of the lower animalsdogs and vultures for instancewhich possess this power and immunity from the effects of poisons developed in putrid meat the greenlanders and african savages and many other peoples in various parts of the world have it as well  sometimes when sitting with gipsies at their wild hearth i have felt curious as to the contents of that black pot simmering over the fire no doubt it often contains strange meats but it would not have been etiquette to speak of such a matter it is like the pot on the fire of the venezuela savage into which he throws whatever he kills with his little poisoned arrows or fishes out of the river probably my only quarrel with them would be about the little fledgelings it angers me to see them beating the bushes in spring in search of small nesties and the callow young that are in them after all the gipsies could retort that my friends the jays and magpies are at the same business in april and may  it is just these habits of the gipsy which i have described shocking to the moralist and sanitarian and disgusting to the person of delicate stomach it may be which please me rather than the romance and poetry which the scholargipsy enthusiasts are fond of reading into him he is to me a wild untameable animal of curious habits and interests me as a naturalist accordingly it may be objected that being a naturalist occupied with the appearance of things i must inevitably miss the one thing which others find  in a talk i had with a gipsy a short time ago he said to me you know what the books say and we dont but we know other things that are not in the books and thats what we have its ours our own and you cant know it  it was well put but i was not perhaps so entirely ignorant as he imagined of the nature of that special knowledge or shall we say faculty which he claimed i take it to be cunningthe cunning of a wild animal with a mans brainand a small an infinitesimal dose of something else which eludes us but that something else is not of a spiritual nature the gipsy has no such thing in him the soul growths are rooted in the social instinct and are developed in those in whom that instinct is strong i think that if we analyse that dose of something else we will find that it is still the animals cunning a special a sublimated cunning the fine flower of his whole nature and that it has nothing mysterious in it he is a parasite but free and as well able to exist free as the fox or jackal but the parasitism pays him well and he has followed it so long in his intercourse with social man that it has come to be like an instinct or secret knowledge and is nothing more than a marvellously keen penetration which reveals to him the character and degree of credulity and other mental weaknesses of his subject  it is not so much the wind on the heath brother as the fascination of lawlessness which makes his life an everlasting joy to him to pit himself against gamekeeper farmer policeman and everybody else and defeat them all to flourish like the parasitic fly on the honey in the hive and escape the wrath of the bees  i must now return from this long digression to my conversation with the shepherd about the dark people of the village  there were i continued other blackeyed and blackhaired people in the villages who had no gipsy blood in their veins so far as i could make out there were dark people of three originally distinct and widely different races in the wiltshire downs there was a good deal of mixed blood no doubt and many dark persons could not be identified as belonging to any particular race nevertheless three distinct types could be traced among the dark people and i took them to be first the gipsy rather short of stature brownskinned with broad face and high cheekbones like the men we had just been speaking of secondly the men and women of white skins and good features who had rather broad faces and round heads and were physically and mentally just as good as the best blueeyed people these were probably the descendants of the dark broadfaced wilsetas who came over at the time when the country was being overrun with the english and other nations or tribes and who colonized in wiltshire and gave it their name the third type differed widely from both the others they were smallest in size and had narrow heads and long or oval faces and were very dark with brown skins they also differed mentally from the others being of a more lively disposition and hotter temper the characters which distinguish the ancient british or iberian race appeared to predominate in persons of this type  the shepherd said he didnt know much about all that but he remembered that they once had a man in the village who was like the last kind i had described he was a labourer named tark who had several sons and when they were grown up there was a last one born he had to be the last because his mother died when she gave him birth and that last one was like his father small very darkskinned with eyes like sloes and exceedingly lively and active  tark himself he said was the liveliest most amusing man he had ever known and the quickest to do things whatever it was he was asked to do but he was not industrious and not thrifty the tarks were always very poor he had a good ear for music and was a singer of the old songshe seemed to know them all one of his performances was with a pair of cymbals which he had made for himself out of some old metal plates and with these he used to play while dancing about clashing them in time striking them on his head his breast and legs in these dances with the cymbals he would whirl and leap about in an astonishing way standing sometimes on his hands then on his feet so that half the people in the village used to gather at his cottage to watch his antics on a summer evening  one afternoon he was coming down the village street and saw the blacksmith standing near his cottage looking up at a tall firtree which grew there on his ground what be looking at cried tark the blacksmith pointed to a branch the lowest branch of all but about forty feet from the ground and said a chaffinch had his nest in it about three feet from the trunk which his little son had set his heart on having he had promised to get it down for him but there was no long ladder and he didnt know how to get it  tark laughed and said that for half a gallon of beer he would go up legs first and take the nest and bring it down in one hand which he would not use in climbing and would come down as he went up head first  do it then said the blacksmith and ill stand the half gallon  tark ran to the tree and turning over and standing on his hands clasped the bole with his legs and then with his arms and went up to the branch when taking the nest and holding it in one hand he came down head first to the ground in safety  there were other anecdotes of his liveliness and agility then followed the story of the youngest son known as liddy i dont rightly know said caleb what the name was he was given when they christened n but he were always called liddy and nobody knowed any other name for him  liddys grownup brothers all left home when he was a small boy one enlisted and was sent to india and never returned the other two went to america so it was said he was twelve years old when his father died and he had to shift for himself but he was no worse off on that account as they had always been very poor owing to poor tarks love of beer before long he got employed by a small working farmer who kept a few cows and a pair of horses and used to buy wethers to fatten them and these the boy kept on the down  liddy was always a leetel chap and looked no more than nine when twelve so that he could do no heavy work but he was a very willing and active little fellow with a sweet temper and so lively and full of fun as to be a favourite with everybody in the village the men would laugh at his pranks especially when he came from the fields on the old plough horse and urged him to a gallop sitting with his face to the tail and they would say that he was like his father and would never be much good except to make people laugh but the women had a tender feeling for him because although motherless and very poor he yet contrived to be always clean and neat he took the greatest care of his poor clothes washing and mending them himself he also took an intense interest in his wethers and almost every day he would go to caleb tending his flock on the down to sit by him and ask a hundred questions about sheep and their management he looked on caleb as headshepherd on a goodsized farm as the most important and most fortunate person he knew and was very proud to have him as guide philosopher and friend  now it came to pass that once in a small lot of thirty or forty wethers which the farmer had bought at a sheepfair and brought home it was discovered that one was a ewea ewe that would perhaps at some future day have a lamb liddy was greatly excited at the discovery he went to caleb and told him about it almost crying at the thought that his master would get rid of it for what use would it be to him but what a loss it would be and at last plucking up courage he went to the farmer and begged and prayed to be allowed to keep the ewe and the farmer laughed at him but he was a little touched at the boys feeling and at last consented then liddy was the happiest boy in the village and whenever he got the chance he would go out to caleb on the down to talk about and give him news of the one beloved ewe and one day after about nineteen or twenty weeks caleb out with his flock heard shouts at a distance and turning to look saw liddy coming at great speed towards him shouting out some great news as he ran but what it was caleb could not make out even when the little fellow had come to him for his excitement made him incoherent the ewe had lambed and there were twinstwo strong healthy lambs most beautiful to see nothing so wonderful had ever happened in his life before and now he sought out his friend oftener than ever to talk of his beloved lambs and to receive the most minute directions about their care caleb who is not a laughing man could not help laughing a little when he recalled poor liddys enthusiasm but that beautiful shining chapter in the poor boys life could not last and when the lambs were grown they were sold and so were all the wethers then liddy not being wanted had to find something else to do  i was too much interested in this story to let the subject drop what had been liddys afterlife very uneventful there was in fact nothing in it nor in him except an intense love for all things especially animals and nothing happened to him until the end for he has been dead now these nine or ten years in his next place he was engaged first as carters boy and then undercarter and all his love was lavished on the horses they were more to him than sheep and he could love them without pain since they were not being prepared for the butcher with his abhorred knife liddys love and knowledge of horses became known outside of his own little circle and he was offered and joyfully accepted a place in the stables of a wealthy young gentleman farmer who kept a large establishment and was a hunting man from stableboy he was eventually promoted to groom occasionally he would reappear in his native place his home was but a few miles away and when out exercising a horse he appeared to find it a pleasure to trot down the old street where as a farmers boy he used to make the village laugh at his antics but he was very much changed from the poor boy who was often hatless and barefooted to the groom in his neat wellfitting black suit mounted on a showy horse  in this place he continued about thirty years and was married and had several children and was very happy and then came a great disaster his employer having met with heavy losses sold all his horses and got rid of his servants and liddy had to go this great change and above all his grief at the loss of his beloved horses was more than he could endure he became melancholy and spent his days in silent brooding and by and by to everybodys surprise liddy fell ill for he was in the prime of life and had always been singularly healthy then to astonish people still more he died what ailed himwhat killed him every one asked of the doctor and his answer was that he had no diseasethat nothing ailed him except a broken heart and that was what killed poor liddy  in conclusion i will relate a little incident which occurred several months later when i was again on a visit to my old friend the shepherd we were sitting together on a sunday evening when his old wife looked out and said lor here be mrs taylor with her children coming in to see us and mrs taylor soon appeared wheeling her baby in a perambulator with two little girls following she was a comely round rosy little woman with black hair black eyes and a singularly sweet expression and her three pretty little children were like her she stayed half an hour in pleasant chat then went her way down the road to her home who i asked was mrs taylor  bawcombe said that in a way she was a native of their old village of winterbourne bishop at least her father was she had married a man who had taken a farm near them and after having known her as a young girl they had been glad to have her again as a neighbour shes a daughter of that liddy i told ee about some time ago he said     chapter xx  some sheepdogs    breaking a sheepdogthe shepherd buys a puphis traininghe   refuses to workhe chases

hungersheepkilling dogsdogs   running wildanecdotesa russian sheepdogcaleb parts with tramp   to caleb the proper training of a dog was a matter of the very first importance a man he considered must have not only a fair amount of intelligence but also experience and an even temper and a little sympathy as well to sum up the animal in handits special aptitudes its limitations its disposition and that something in addition which he called a kink and would probably have described as its idiosyncrasy if he had known the word there was as much individual difference among dogs as there is in boys but if the breed was right and you went the right way about it you could hardly fail to get a good servant if a dog was not properly broken if its trainer had not made the most of it he was not a good shepherd he lacked the intelligenceunderstanding was his wordor else the knowledge or patience or persistence to do his part it was however possible for the best shepherd to make mistakes and one of the greatest to be made which was not uncommon was to embark on the long and laborious business of training an animal of mixed blooda sheepdog with a taint of terrier retriever or some other unsuitable breed in him in discussing this subject with other shepherds i generally found that those who were in perfect agreement with caleb on this point were men who were somewhat like him in character and who regarded their work with the sheep as so important that it must be done thoroughly in every detail and in the best way one of the best shepherds i know who is sixty years old and has been on the same downland sheepfarm all his life assures me that he has never had and never would have a dog which was trained by another but the shepherd of the ordinary kind says that he doesnt care much about the animals parentage or that he doesnt trouble to inquire into its pedigree he breaks the animal and finds that he does pretty well even when he has some strange blood in him finally that all dogs have faults and you must put up with them caleb would say of such a man that he was not a good shepherd one of his saddest memories was of a dog which he bought and broke without having made the necessary inquiries about its parentage  it happened that a shepherd of the village who had taken a place at a distant farm was anxious to dispose of a litter of pups before leaving and he asked caleb to have one caleb refused my dogs old i know he said but i dont want a pup now and i wont have n  a day or two later the man came back and said he had kept one of the best of the five for himhe had got rid of all the others you cant do better he persisted no said caleb what i said i say again i wont have n ive no money to buy a dog  never mind about money said the other youve got a bell i like the sound of give he to me and take the pup and so the exchange was made a copper bell for a nice black pup with a white collar its mother bawcombe knew was a good sheepdog but about the other parent he made no inquiries  on receiving the pup he was told that its name was tory and he did not change it it was always difficult he explained to find a name for a doga name that is to say which anyone would say was a proper name for a dog and not a foolish name one could think of a good many proper namesjack and watch and so onbut in each case one would remember some dog which had been called by that name and it seemed to belong to that particular wellremembered dog and to no other and so in the end because of this difficulty he allowed the name to remain  the dog had not cost him much to buy but as it was only a few weeks old he had to keep it at his own cost for fully six months before beginning the business of breaking it which would take from three to six months longer a dog cannot be put to work before he is quite half a year old unless he is exceptionally vigorous sheep are timid creatures but not unintelligent and they can distinguish between the seasoned old sheepdog whose furious onset and bite they fear and the raw young recruit as easily as the rook can distinguish between the man with a gun and the man of straw with a broomstick under his arm they will turn upon and attack the young dog and chase him away with his tail between his legs he will also work too furiously for his strength and then collapse with the result that he will make a cowardly sheepdog or as the shepherds say brokenhearted  another thing he must be made to work at first with an old sheepdog for though he has the impulse to fly about and do something he does not know what to do and does not understand his masters gestures and commands he must have an objectlesson he must see the motion and hear the word and mark how the old dog flies to this or that point and what he does the word of command or the gesture thus becomes associated in his mind with a particular action on his part but he must not be given too many objectlessons or he will lose more than he will gaina something which might almost be described as a sense of individual responsibility that is to say responsibility to the human master who delegates his power to him instead of taking his power directly from the man he takes it from the dog and this becomes a fixed habit so quickly that many shepherds say that if you give more than from three to six lessons of this kind to a young dog you will spoil him he will need the mastership of the other dog and will thereafter always be at a loss and work in an uncertain way  a timid or unwilling young dog is often coupled with the old dog two or three times but this method has its dangers too as it may be too much for the young dogs strength and give him that brokenheart from which he will never recover he will never be a good sheepdog  to return to tory in due time he was trained and proved quick to learn and willing to work so that before long he began to be useful and was much wanted with the sheep as the old dog was rapidly growing stiffer on his legs and harder of hearing  one day the lambs were put into a field which was half clover and half rape and it was necessary to keep them on the clover this the young dog could not or would not understand again and again he allowed the lambs to go to the rape which so angered caleb that he threw his crook at him tory turned and gave him a look then came very quietly and placed himself behind his master from that moment he refused to obey and bawcombe after exhausting all his arts of persuasion gave it up and did as well as he could without his assistance  that evening after foldingtime he by chance met a shepherd he was well acquainted with and told him of the trouble he was in over tory  you tie him up for a week said the shepherd and treat him well till he forgets all about it and hell be the same as he was before you offended him hes just like old tomhes got his fathers temper  whats that you say exclaimed bawcombe be you saying that torys old toms son id never have taken him if id known that toms not purebredhes got retrievers blood  well tis known and i could have told ee if theed asked me said the shepherd but you do just as i tell ee and itll be all right with the dog  tory was accordingly tied up at home and treated well and spoken kindly to and patted on the head so that there would be no unpleasantness between master and servant and if he was an intelligent animal he would know that the crook had been thrown not to hurt but merely to express disapproval of his naughtiness  then came a busy day for the shepherd when the lambs were trimmed before being taken to the wilton sheepfair there was bawcombe his boy the decrepit old dog and tory to do the work but when the time came to start tory refused to do anything  when sent to turn the lambs he walked off to a distance of about twenty yards sat down and looked at his master caleb hoped he would come round presently when he saw them all at work and so they did the best they could without him for a time but the old dog was stiffer and harder of hearing than ever and as they could not get on properly caleb went at intervals to tory and tried to coax him to give them his help and every time he was spoken to he would get up and come to his master then when ordered to do something he would walk off to the spot where he had chosen to be and calmly sit down once more and look at them caleb was becoming more and more incensed but he would not show it to the dog he still hoped against hope and then a curious thing happened a swallow came skimming along close to the earth and passed within a yard of tory when up jumped the dog and gave chase darting across the field with such speed that he kept very near the bird until it rose and passed over the hedge at the farther side the joyous chase over tory came back to his old place and sitting on his haunches began watching them again struggling with the lambs it was more than the shepherd could stand he went deliberately up to the dog and taking him by the straw collar still on his neck drew him quietly away to the hedgeside and bound him to a bush then getting a stout stick he came back and gave him one blow on the head so great was the blow that the dog made not the slightest sound he fell his body quivered a moment and his legs stretched outhe was quite dead bawcombe then plucked an armful of bracken and threw it over his body to cover it and going back to the hurdles sent the boy home then spreading his cloak at the hedgeside laid himself down on it and covered his head  an hour later the fanner appeared on the scene what are you doing here shepherd he demanded in surprise not trimming the lambs  bawcombe raising himself on his elbow replied that he was not trimming the lambsthat he would trim no lambs that day  oh but we must get on with the trimming cried the farmer  bawcombe returned that the dog had put him out and now the dog was deadhe had killed him in his anger and he would trim no more lambs that day he had said it and would keep to what he had said  then the farmer got angry and said that the dog had a very good nose and would have been useful to him to take rabbits  master said the other i got he when he were a pup and broke n to help me with the sheep and not to catch rabbits and now ive killed n and hell catch no rabbits  the farmer knew his man and swallowing his anger walked off without another word  later on in the day he was severely blamed by a shepherd friend who said that he could easily have sold the dog to one of the drovers who were always anxious to pick up a dog in their village and he would have had the money to repay him for his trouble to which bawcombe returned if he wouldnt work for i that broke n he wouldnt work for another but ill never again break a dog that isnt purebred  but though he justified himself he had suffered remorse for what he had done not only at the time when he covered the dead dog up with bracken and refused to work any more that day but the feeling had persisted all his life and he could not relate the incident without showing it very plainly he bitterly blamed himself for having taken the pup and for spending long months in training him without having first taken pains to inform himself that there was no bad blood in him and although the dog was perhaps unfit to live he had finally killed him in anger if it had not been for that sudden impetuous chase after a swallow he would have borne with him and considered afterwards what was to be done but that dash after the bird was more than he could stand for it looked as if tory had done it purposely in something of a mocking spirit to exhibit his wonderful activity and speed to his master sweating there at his task and make him see what he had lost in offending him  the shepherd gave another instance of a mistake he once made which caused him a good deal of pain it was the case of a dog named bob which he owned when a young man he was an exceptionally small dog but his quick intelligence made up for lack of strength and he was of a very lively disposition so that he was a good companion to a shepherd as well as a good servant  one summer day at noon caleb was going to his flock in the fields walking by a hedge when he noticed bob sniffing suspiciously at the roots of an old hollytree growing on the bank it was a low but very old tree with a thick trunk rotten and hollow inside the cavity being hidden with the brushwood growing up from the roots as he came abreast of the tree bob looked up and emitted a low whine that sound which says so much when used by a dog to his master and which his master does not always rightly understand at all events he did not do so in this case it was august and the shooting had begun and caleb jumped to the conclusion that a wounded bird had crept into the hollow tree to hide and so to bobs whine which expressed fear and asked what he was to do the shepherd answered get him bob dashed in but quickly recoiled whining in a piteous way and began rubbing his face on his legs bawcombe in alarm jumped down and peered into the hollow trunk and heard a slight rustling of dead leaves but saw nothing his dog had been bitten by an adder and he at once returned to the village bitterly blaming himself for the mistake he had made and greatly fearing that he would lose his dog arrived at the village his mother at once went off to the down to inform isaac of the trouble and ask him what they were to do caleb had to wait some time as none of the villagers who gathered round could suggest a remedy and in the meantime bob continued rubbing his cheek against his foreleg twitching and whining with pain and before long the face and head began to swell on one side the swelling extending to the nape and downwards to the throat presently isaac himself full of concern arrived on the scene having left his wife in charge of the flock and at the same time a man from a neighbouring village came riding by and joined the group the horseman got off and assisted caleb in holding the dog while isaac made a number of incisions with his knife in the swollen place and let out some blood after which they rubbed the wounds and all the swollen part with an oil used for the purpose the composition of this oil was a secret it was made by a man in one of the downland villages and sold at eighteenpence a small bottle isaac was a believer in its efficacy and always kept a bottle hidden away somewhere in his cottage  bob recovered in a few days but the hair fell out from all the part which had been swollen and he was a curiouslooking dog with half his face and head naked until he got his fresh coat when it grew again he was as good and active a dog as ever and lived to a good old age but one result of the poison he never got over his bark had changed from a sharp ringing sound to a low and hoarse one he always barked said the shepherd like a dog with a sore throat  to go back to the subject of training a dog once you make a beginning it must be carried through to a finish you take him at the age of six months and the education must be fairly complete when he is a year old he is then lively impressionable exceedingly adaptive his intelligence at that period is most like mans but it would be a mistake to think that it will continue sothat to what he learns now in this wonderful halfyear other things may be added by and by as opportunity arises at a year he has practically got to the end of his capacity to learn he has lost his humanlike receptivity but what he has been taught will remain with him for the rest of his life we can hardly say that he remembers it it is more like what is called inherited memory or lapsed intelligence  all this is very important to a shepherd and explains the reason an old headshepherd had for saying to me that he had never had and never would have a dog he had not trained himself no two men follow precisely the same method in training and a dog transferred from his trainer to another man is always a little at a loss method voice gestures personality are all different his new master must study him and in a way adapt himself to the dog the dog is still more at a loss when transferred from one kind of country to another where the sheep are worked in a different manner and one instance caleb gave me of this is worth relating it was i thought one of his best dog stories  his dogs as a rule were bought as pups occasionally he had had to get a dog already trained a painful necessity to a shepherd seeing that the pound or two it coststhe price of an ordinary animalis a big sum of money to him and once in his life he got an old trained sheepdog for nothing he was young then and acting as undershepherd in his native village when the report came one day that a great circus and menagerie which had been exhibiting in the west was on its way to salisbury and would be coming past the village about six oclock on the following morning the turnpike was a little over a mile away and thither caleb went with half a dozen other young men of the village at about five oclock to see the show pass and sat on a gate beside a wood to wait its coming in due time the long procession of horses and mounted men and women and gorgeous vans containing lions and tigers and other strange beasts came by affording them great admiration and delight when it had gone on and the last van had disappeared at the turning of the road they got down from the gate and were about to set out on their way back when a big shaggy sheepdog came out of the wood and running to the road began looking up and down in a bewildered way they had no doubt that he belonged to the circus and had turned aside to hunt a rabbit in the wood then thinking the animal would understand them they shouted to it and waved their arms in the direction the procession had gone but the dog became frightened and turning fled back into cover and they saw no more of it  two or three days later it was rumoured that a strange dog had been seen in the neighbourhood of winterbourne bishop in the fields and women and children going to or coming from outlying cottages and farms had encountered it sometimes appearing suddenly out of the furzebushes and staring wildly at them or they would meet him in some deep lane between hedges and after standing still a moment eyeing them he would turn and fly in terror from their strange faces shepherds began to be alarmed for the safety of their sheep and there was a good deal of excitement and talk about the strange dog two or three days later caleb encountered it he was returning from his flock at the side of a large grass field where four or five women were occupied cutting the thistles and the dog which he immediately recognized as the one he had seen at the turnpike was following one of the women about she was greatly alarmed and called to him come here caleb for goodness sake and drive this big dog away he do look so desprit im afeared of he  dont you be feared he shouted back he wont hurt ee hes starvingdont you see his bones sticking out hes asking to be fed then going a little nearer he called to her to take hold of the dog by the neck and keep him while he approached he feared that the dog on seeing him coming would rush away after a little while she called the dog but when he went to her she shrank away from him and called out no i darent touch hehell tear my hand off i never seed such a despritlooking beast  tis hunger repeated caleb and then very slowly and cautiously he approached the dog all the time eyeing him suspiciously ready to rush away on the slightest alarm and while approaching him he began to speak gently to him then coming to a stand stooped and patting his legs called the dog to him presently he came sinking his body lower as he advanced and at last crawling and when he arrived at the shepherds feet he turned himself over on his backthat eloquent action which a dog uses when humbling himself before and imploring mercy from one mightier than himself man or dog  caleb stooped and after patting the dog gripped him firmly by the neck and pulled him up while with his free hand he undid his leather belt to turn it into a dogs collar and leash then the end of the strap in his hand he said come and started home with the dog at his side arrived at the cottage he got a bucket and mixed as much meal as would make two good feeds the dog all the time watching him with his muscles twitching and the water running from his mouth the meal well mixed he emptied it out on the turf and what followed he said was an amazing thing to see the dog hurled himself down on the food and started devouring it as if the mass of meal had been some living savage creature he had captured and was frenziedly tearing to pieces he turned round and round floundering on the earth uttering strange noises like halfchoking growls and screams while gobbling down the meal then when he had devoured it all he began tearing up and swallowing the turf for the sake of the little wet meal still adhering to it  such rage of hunger caleb had never seen and it was painful to him to think of what the dog had endured during those days when it had been roaming foodless about the neighbourhood yet it was among sheep all the timescores of flocks left folded by night at a distance from the village one would have imagined that the old wolf and wilddog instinct would have come to life in such circumstances but the instinct was to all appearance dead  my belief is that the purebred sheepdog is indeed the last dog to revert to a state of nature and that when sheepkilling by night is traced to a sheepdog the animal has a bad strain in him of retriever or cur or rabbitdog as the shepherds call all terriers when i was a boy on the pampas sheepkilling dogs were common enough and they were always curs or the common dog of the country a smoothhaired animal about the size of a coachdog red or black or white i recall one instance of sheepkilling being traced to our own dogswe had about six or eight just then a native neighbour a few miles away caught them at it one morning they escaped him in spite of his good horse with lasso and bolas also but his sharp eyes saw them pretty well in the dim light and by and by he identified them and my father had to pay him for about thirty slain and badly injured sheep after which a gallows was erected and our guardians ignominiously hanged here we shoot dogs in some countries the old custom of hanging them which is perhaps less painful is still followed  to go back to our story from that time the stray dog was calebs obedient and affectionate slave always watching his face and every gesture and starting up at his slightest word in readiness to do his bidding when put with the flock he turned out to be a useful sheepdog but unfortunately he had not been trained on the wiltshire downs it was plain to see that the work was strange to him that he had been taught in a different school and could never forget the old and acquire a new method but as to what conditions he had been reared in or in what district or country no one could guess every one said that he was a sheepdog but unlike any sheepdog they had ever seen he was not wiltshire nor welsh nor sussex nor scotch and they could say no more whenever a shepherd saw him for the first time his attention was immediately attracted and he would stop to speak with caleb what sort of a dog do you call that he would say i never seed one just like n before  at length one day when passing by a new building which some workmen had been brought from a distance to erect in the village one of the men hailed caleb and said where did you get that dog mate  why do you ask me that said the shepherd  because i know where he come from hes a rooshian thats what he is ive seed many just like him in the crimea when i was there but i never seed one before in england  caleb was quite ready to believe it and was a little proud at having a sheepdog from that distant country he said that it also put something new into his mind he didnt know nothing about russia before that though he had been hearing so much of our great war there and of all the people that had been killed now he realized that russia was a great country a land where there were hills and valleys and villages where there were flocks and herds and shepherds and sheepdogs just as in the wiltshire downs he only wished that trampthat was the name he had given his dogcould have told him his history  tramp in spite of being strange to the downs and the downland sheepdogs work would probably have been kept by caleb to the end but for his ineradicable passion for hunting rabbits he did not neglect his duty but he would slip away too often and eventually when a man who wanted a good dog for rabbits one day offered caleb fifteen shillings for tramp he sold him and as he was taken away to a distance by his new master he never saw him again     chapter xxi  the shepherd as naturalist    general remarksgreat ridge

and domestic gathered in my talks with the old shepherd do not amount to much if this is all there is to show after a long life spent out of doors or all that is best worth preserving it is a somewhat scanty harvest they will say to me it appears a somewhat abundant one we field naturalists who set down what we see and hear in a notebook lest we forget it do not always bear in mind that it is exceedingly rare for those who are not naturalists whose senses and minds are occupied with other things to come upon a new and interesting fact in animal life or that these chance observations are quickly forgotten this was strongly borne in upon me lately while staying in the village of hindon in the neighbourhood of the great ridge wood which clothes the summit of the long high down overlooking the vale of the wylye it is an immense wood mostly of scrub or dwarf oak very dense in some parts in others thin with open barren patches and like a wild forest covering altogether twelve or fourteen square milesperhaps more there are no houses near and no people in it except a few gamekeepers i spent long days in it without meeting a human being it was a joy to me to find such a spot in england so wild and solitary and i was filled with pleasing anticipation of all the wild life i should see in such a place especially after an experience i had on my second day in it i was standing in an open glade when a cockpheasant uttered a cry of alarm and immediately afterwards startled by the cry perhaps a roedeer rushed out of the close thicket of oak and holly in which it had been hiding and ran past me at a very short distance giving me a good sight of this shyest of the large wild animals still left to us he looked very beautiful to me in that mousecoloured coat which makes him invisible in the deep shade in which he is accustomed to pass the daylight hours in hiding as he fled across the green open space in the brilliant may sunshine but he was only one a chance visitor a wanderer from wood to wood about the land and he had been seen once a month before my encounter with him and ever since then the keepers had been watching and waiting for him gun in hand to send a charge of shot into his side  that was the best and the only great thing i saw in the great ridge wood for the curse of the pheasant is on it as on all the woods and forests in wiltshire and all wild life considered injurious to the semidomestic bird from the sparrowhawk to the harrier and buzzard and goshawk and from the little mousing weasel to the badger and all the wild life that is only beautiful or which delights us because of its wildness from the squirrel to the roedeer must be included in the slaughter  one very long summer day spent in roaming about in this endless wood always on the watch had for sole result so far as anything out of the common goes the spectacle of a hare sitting on a stump the hare started up at a distance of over a hundred yards before me and rushed straight away at first then turned and ran on my left so as to get round to the side from which i had come i stood still and watched him as he moved swiftly over the ground seeing him not as a hare but as a dim brown object successively appearing vanishing and reappearing behind and between the brown treetrunks until he had traced half a circle and was then suddenly lost to sight thinking that he had come to a stand i put my binocular on the spot where he had vanished and saw him sitting on an old oak stump about thirty inches long it was a round mossy stump about eighteen inches in diameter standing in a bed of brown dead leaves with the rough brown trunks of other dwarf oaktrees on either side of it the animal was sitting motionless in profile its ears erect seeing me with one eye and was like a carved figure of a hare set on a pedestal and had a very striking appearance  as i had never seen such a thing before i thought it was worth mentioning to a keeper i called to see at his lodge on my way back in the evening it had been a blank day i told hima hare sitting on a stump being the only thing i could remember to tell him well he said youve seen something ive never seen in all the years ive been in these woods and yet when you come to think of it its just what one might expect a hare would do the wood is full of old stumps and it seems only natural a hare should jump on to one to get a better view of a man or animal at a distance among the trees but i never saw it  what then had he seen worth remembering during his long hours in the wood on that day or the day before or on any day during the last thirty years since he had been policing that wood i asked him he answered that he had seen many strange things but he was not now able to remember one to tell me he said further that the only things he remembered were those that related to his business of guarding and rearing the birds all other things he observed in animals however remarkable they might seem to him at the moment were things that didnt matter and were quickly forgotten  on the very next day i was out on the down with a gipsy and we got talking about wild animals he was a middleaged man and a very perfect specimen of his racenot one of the blueeyed and red or lighthaired bastard gipsies but dark as a red indian with eyes like a hawk and altogether a hawklike being lean wiry alert a perfectly wild man in a tame civilized land the lean mousecoloured lurcher that followed at his heels was perfect too in his wayman and dog appeared made for one another when this man spoke of his life spent in roaming about the country of his very perfect health and of his hatred of houses the very atmosphere of any indoor place producing a suffocating and sickening effect on him i envied him as i envy birds their wings and as i can never envy men who live in mansions his was the wild the real life and it seemed to me that there was no other worth living  you know said he in the course of our talk about wild animals we are very fond of hedgehogswe like them better than rabbits  well so do i was my remark i am not quite sure that i do but that is what i told him but now you talk of hedgehogs i said its funny to think that common as the animal is it has some queer habits i cant find anything about from gamekeepers and others ive talked to on the subject or from my own observation yet one would imagine that we know all there is to be known about the little beast youll find his history in a hundred booksperhaps in five hundred theres one book about our british animals so big youd hardly be able to lift its three volumes from the ground with all your strength in which its author has raked together everything known about the hedgehog but he doesnt give me the information i wantjust what i went to the book to find now heres what a friend of mine once saw hes not a naturalist nor a sportsman nor a gamekeeper and not a gipsy he doesnt observe animals or want to find out their ways he is a writer occupied day and night with his writing sitting among books yet he saw something which the naturalists and gamekeepers havent seen so far as i know he was going home one moonlight night by a footpath through the woods when he heard a very strange noise a little distance ahead a low whistling sound very sharp like the continuous twittering of a little bird with a voice like a bat or a shrew only softer more musical he went on very cautiously until he spied two hedgehogs standing on the path facing each other with their noses almost or quite touching he remained watching and listening to them for some moments then tried to go a little nearer and they ran away  now ive asked about a dozen gamekeepers if they ever saw such a thing and all said they hadnt they never heard hedgehogs make that twittering sound like a bird or a singing mouse they had only heard them scream like a rabbit when in a trap now what do you say about it  ive never seen anything like that said the gipsy i only know the hedgehog makes a little whistling sound when he first comes out at night i believe it is a sort of call they have  but no doubt i said youve seen other queer things in hedgehogs and in other little animals which i should like to hear  yes he had first and last seen a good many queer things both by day and night in woods and other places he replied and then continued but you see its like this we see something and say now thats a very curious thing and then we forget all about it you see we dont lay no store by such things we aint scholards and dont know nothing about whats said in books we see something and say thats something we never saw before and never heard tell of but maybe others have seen it and you can find it in the books so thats how tis but if i hadnt forgotten them i could have told you a lot of queer things  that was all he could say and few can say more caleb was one of the few who could and one wonders why it was so seeing that he was occupied with his own tasks in the fields and on the down where wild life is least abundant and varied and that his opportunities were so few compared with those of the gamekeeper it was i take it because he had sympathy for the creatures he observed that their actions had stamped themselves on his memory because he had seen them emotionally we have seen how well he remembered the many sheepdogs he had owned how vividly their various characters are portrayed in his account of them i have met with shepherds who had little to tell about the dogs they had possessed they had regarded their dogs as useful servants and nothing more as long as they lived and when dead they were forgotten but caleb had a feeling for his dogs which made it impossible for him to forget them or to recall them without that tenderness which accompanies the thought of vanished human friends in a lesser degree he had something of this feeling for all animals down even to the most minute and unconsidered i recall here one of his anecdotes of a very small creaturea shrew or overrunner as he called it  one day when out with his flock a sudden storm of rain caused him to seek for shelter in an old untrimmed hedge close by he crept into the ditch full of old dead leaves beneath the tangle of thorns and brambles and setting his back against the bank he thrust his legs out and as he did so was startled by an outburst of shrill little screams at his feet looking down he spied a shrew standing on the dead leaves close to his boot screaming with all its might its long thin snout pointed upwards and its mouth wide open and just above it two or three inches perhaps hovered a small brown butterfly there for a few moments it continued hovering while the shrew continued screaming then the butterfly flitted away and the shrew disappeared among the dead leaves  caleb laughed a rare thing with him when he narrated this little incident then remarked the overrunner was acrying cause he couldnt catch that leetel butterfly  the shepherds inference was wrong he did not knowfew dothat the shrew has the singular habit when surprised on the surface and in danger of remaining motionless and uttering shrill cries his foot set down close to it had set it screaming the small butterfly no doubt disturbed at the same moment was there by chance i recall here another little story he related of a birda longeared owl  one summer there was a great drought and the rooks unable to get their usual food from the hard sunbaked pasturelands attacked the roots and would have pretty well destroyed them if the farmer had not protected his swedes by driving in stakes and running cottonthread and twine from stake to stake all over the field this kept them off just as thread keeps the chaffinches from the seedbeds in small gardens and as it keeps the sparrows from the crocuses on lawn and ornamental grounds one day caleb caught sight of an oddlooking brownishgrey object out in the middle of the turnipfield and as he looked it rose up two or three feet into the air then dropped back again and this curious movement was repeated at intervals of two or three minutes until he went to see what the thing was it turned out to be a longeared owl with its foot accidentally caught by a slack thread which allowed the bird to rise a couple of feet into the air but every such attempt to escape ended in its being pulled back to the ground again it was so excessively lean so weightless in his hand when he took it up after disengaging its foot that he thought it must have been captive for the space of two or three days the wonder was that it had kept alive during those long midsummer days of intolerable heat out there in the middle of the burning field yet it was in very fine feather and beautiful to look at with its long black eartufts and round orangeyellow eyes which would never lose their fiery lustre until glazed in death calebs first thought on seeing it closely was that it would have been a prize to anyone who liked to have a handsome bird stuffed in a glass case then raising it over his head he allowed it to fly whereupon it flew off a distance of a dozen or fifteen yards and pitched among the turnips after which it ran a little space and rose again with labour but soon recovering strength it flew away over the field and finally disappeared in the deep shade of the copse beyond  in relating these things the voice the manner the expression in his eyes were more than the mere words and displayed the feeling which had caused these little incidents to endure so long in his memory  the gamekeeper cannot have this feeling he may come to his task with the liveliest interest in even with sympathy for the wild creatures amidst which he will spend his life but it is all soon lost his business in the woods is to kill and the reflex effect is to extinguish all interest in the living animalin its life and mind it would indeed be a wonderful thing if he could remember any singular action or appearance of an animal which he had witnessed before bringing his gun automatically to his shoulder     chapter xxii  the master of the village    moral effect of the

a village which has no squire or other magnificent and munificent person who dominates everybody and everything and if he chooses to do so plays providence in the community i may have no personal objection to himhe is sometimes almost if not quite human what i heartily dislike is the effect of his position that of a giant among pigmies on the lowly minds about him and the servility hypocrisy and parasitism which spring up and flourish in his wide shadow whether he likes these moral weeds or not as a rule he likes them since the poor devil has this in common with the rest of us that he likes to stand high in the general regard but how is he to know it unless he witnesses its outward beautiful signs every day and every hour on every countenance he looks upon better to my mind the severer conditions the poverty and unmerited sufferings which cannot be relieved with the greater manliness and selfdependence when the people are left to work out their own destiny on this account i was pleased to make the discovery on my first visit to calebs native village that there was no magnate or other big man and no gentleman except the parson who was not a rich man it was so to speak one of the orphaned villages left to fend for itself and fight its own way in a hard world and had nobody even to give the customary blankets and sack of coals to its old women nor was there any very big farmer in the place certainly no gentleman farmer they were mostly small men some of them hardly to be distinguished in speech and appearance from their hired labourers  in these small isolated communities it is common to find men who have succeeded in rising above the others and in establishing a sort of mastery over them they are not as a rule much more intelligent than the others who are never able to better themselves the main difference is that they are harder and more grasping and have more selfcontrol these qualities tell eventually and set a man a little apart a little higher than the others and he gets the taste of power which reacts on him like the first taste of blood on the big cat henceforward he has his ideal his definite goal which is to get the upper handto be on top he may be and generally is an exceedingly unpleasant fellow to have for a neighbourmean sordid greedy tyrannous even cruel and he may be generally hated and despised as well but along with these feelings there will be a kind of shamefaced respect and admiration for his courage in following his own line in defiance of what others think and feel it is after all with man as with the social animals he must have a masternot a policeman or magistrate or a vague faraway impersonal something called the authorities or the government but a head of the pack or herd a being like himself whom he knows and sees and hears and feels every day a real man dressed in old familiar clothes a fellowvillager who wolf or doglike has fought his way to the mastership  there was a person of this kind at winterbourne bishop who was often mentioned in calebs reminiscences for he had left a very strong impression on the shepherds mindas strong perhaps though in a disagreeable way as that of isaac his father and of mr ellerby of doveton for not only was he a man of great force of character but he was of eccentric habits and of a somewhat grotesque appearance the curious name of this person was elijah raven he was a native of the village and lived till extreme old age in it the last of his family in a small house inherited from his father situated about the centre of the village street it was a quaint old timbered house little bigger than a cottage with a thatched roof and behind it some outbuildings a small orchard and a field of a dozen or fifteen acres here he lived with one other person an old man who did the cooking and housework but after this man died he lived alone not only was he a bachelor but he would never allow any woman to come inside his house elijahs one idea was to get the advantage of othersto make himself master in the village beginning poor he worked in a small cautious peddling way at farming taking a field or meadow or strip of down here and there in the neighbourhood keeping a few sheep a few cows buying and selling and breeding horses the men he employed were those he could get at low wagespoor labourers who were without a place and wanted to fill up a vacant time or men like the targetts described in a former chapter who could be imposed upon also gipsies who flitted about the country working in a spasmodic way when in the mood for the farmers who could tolerate them and who were paid about half the wages of an ordinary labourer if a poor man had to find money quickly on account of illness or some other cause he could get it from elijah at oncenot borrowed since elijah neither lent nor gavebut he could sell him anything he possesseda horse or cow or sheepdog or a piece of furniture and if he had nothing to sell elijah would give him something to do and pay him something for it the great thing was that elijah had money which he was always willing to circulate at his unlamented death he left several thousands of pounds which went to a distant relation and a name which does not smell sweet but is still remembered not only at winterbourne bishop but at many other villages on salisbury plain  elijah was short of stature broadshouldered with an abnormally big head and large dark eyes they say that he never cut his hair in his life it was abundant and curly and grew to his shoulders and when he was old and his great mass of hair and beard became white it was said that he resembled a gigantic white owl mothers frightened their children into quiet by saying elijah will get you if you dont behave yourself he knew and resented this and though he never noticed a child he hated to have the little ones staring in a halfterrified way at him to seclude himself more from the villagers he planted holly and yew bushes before his house and eventually the entire building was hidden from sight by the dense evergreen thicket the trees were cut down after his death they were gone when i first visited the village and by chance found a lodging in the house and congratulated myself that i had got the quaintest old rambling rooms i had ever inhabited i did not know that i was in elijah ravens house although his name had long been familiar to me it only came out one day when i asked my landlady who was a native to tell me the history of the place she remembered how as a little girl full of mischief and greatly daring she had sometimes climbed over the low front wall to hide under the thick yew bushes and watch to catch a sight of the owlish old man at his door or window  for many years elijah had two feathered tenants a pair of white owlsthe birds he so much resembled they occupied a small garret at the end of his bedroom having access to it through a hole under the thatch they bred there in peace and on summer evenings one of the common sights of the village was elijahs owls flying from the house behind the evergreens and returning to it with mice in their talons at such seasons the threat to the unruly children would be varied to old elijahs owls will get you naturally the children grew up with the idea of the birds and the owlish old man associated in their minds  it was odd that the two very rooms which elijah had occupied during all those solitary years the others being given over to spiders and dust should have been assigned to me when i came to lodge in the house the first my sittingroom was so low that my hair touched the ceiling when i stood up my full height it had a brick floor and a wide old fireplace on one side though so lowceilinged it was very large and good to be in when i returned from a long ramble on the downs sometimes wet and cold to sit by a wood fire and warm myself at night when i climbed to my bedroom by means of the narrow crooked wormeaten staircase with two difficult and dangerous corners to get round i would lie awake staring at the small square patch of greyness in the black interior made by the latticed window and listening to the wind and rain outside would remember that the sordid owlish old man had slept there and stared nightly at that same grey patch in the dark for very many years if i thought that something of a man which remains here below to haunt the scene of its past life is more likely to exist and appear to mortal eyes in the case of a person of strong individuality then there is a chance that i may be visited this night by elijah raven his ghost but his owlish countenance never appeared between me and that patch of pale dim light nor did i ever feel a breath of cold unearthly air on me  elijah did not improve with time the years that made him longhaired whiter and more owllike also made him more penurious and grasping and anxious to get the better of every person about him there was scarcely a poor person in the villagenot a field labourer nor shepherd nor farmers boy nor any old woman he had employed who did not consider that they had suffered at his hands the very poorest could not escape if he got some one to work for fourpence a day he would find a reason to keep back a portion of the small sum due to him at the same time he wanted to be well thought of and at length an opportunity came to him to figure as one who did not live wholly for himself but rather as a person ready to go out of his way to help his neighbours  there had long existed a small benefit society or club in the village to which most of the farmhands in the parish belonged the members numbering about sixty or seventy subscriptions were paid quarterly but the rules were not strict and any member could take a week or a fortnight longer to pay when a member fell ill he received half the amount of his wages a week from the funds in hand and once a year they had a dinner the secretary was a labourer and in time he grew old and infirm and could not hold a pen in his rheumaticky fingers and a meeting was held to consider what was to be done in the matter it was not an easy one to settle there were few members capable of keeping the books who would undertake the duty as it was unpaid and no one among them well known and trusted by all the members it was then that elijah raven came to the rescue he attended the meeting which he was allowed to do owing to his being a person of importancethe only one of that description in the village and getting up on his legs he made the offer to act as secretary himself this came as a great surprise and the offer was at once and unanimously accepted all unpleasant feelings being forgotten and for the first time in his life elijah heard himself praised as a disinterested person one it was good to have in the village  things went on very well for a time and at the yearly dinner of the club a few months later elijah gave an account of his stewardship showing that the club had a surplus of two hundred pounds shortly after this trouble began elijah it was said was making use of his position as secretary for his own private interests and to pay off old scores against those he disliked when a man came with his quarterly subscription elijah would perhaps remember that this person had refused to work for him or that he had some quarrel with him and if the subscription was overdue he would refuse to take it he would tell the man that he was no longer a member and he also refused to give sick pay to any applicant whose last subscription was still due if he happened to be in elijahs black book by and by he came into collision with caleb one of the villagers against whom he cherished a special grudge and this small affair resulted in the dissolution of the club  at this time caleb was headshepherd at bartles cross a large farm above a mile and a half from the village one excessively hot day in august he had to dip the lambs it was very hard work to drive them from the farm over a high down to the stream a mile below the village where there was a dipping place and he was tired and hot and in a sweat when he began the work with his arms bared to the shoulders he took and plunged his first lamb into the tank when engaged in dipping he said he always kept his mouth closed tightly for fear of getting even a drop of the mixture in it but on this occasion it unfortunately happened that the man assisting him spoke to him and he was compelled to reply but had no sooner opened his mouth to speak than the lamb made a violent struggle in his arms and splashed the water over his face and into his mouth he got rid of it as quickly as he could but soon began to feel bad and before the work was over he had to sit down two or three times to rest however he struggled on to the finish then took the flock home and went to his cottage he could do no more the farmer came to see what the matter was and found him in a fever with face and throat greatly swollen you look bad he said you must be off to the doctor but it was five miles to the village where the doctor lived and bawcombe replied that he couldnt go im too badi couldnt go master if you offered me money for it he said  then the farmer mounted his horse and went himself and the doctor came no doubt he said youve got some of the poison into your system and took a chill at the same time the illness lasted six weeks and then the shepherd resumed work although still feeling very shaky by and by when the opportunity came he went to claim his sick paysix shillings a week for the six weeks his wages being then twelve shillings elijah flatly refused to pay him his subscription he said had been due for several weeks and he had consequently forfeited his right to anything in vain the shepherd explained that he could not pay when lying ill at home with no money in the house and receiving no pay from the farmer the old man remained obdurate and with a very heavy heart the shepherd came out and found three or four of the villagers waiting in the road outside to hear the result of the application  they too were men who had been turned away from the club by the arbitrary secretary caleb was telling them about his interview when elijah came out of the house and leaning over the front gate began to listen the shepherd then turned towards him and said in a loud voice mr elijah raven dont you think this is a tarrible hard case ive paid my subscription every quarter for thirty years and never had nothing from the fund except two weeks pay when i were bad some years ago now ive been bad six weeks and my master giv me nothing for that time and ive got the doctor to pay and nothing to live on what am i to do  elijah stared at him in silence for some time then spoke i told you in there i wouldnt pay you one penny of the money and ill hold to what i saidin there i said it indoors and i say again that indoors ill never pay youno not one penny piece but if i happen some day to meet you out of doors then ill pay you now go  and go he did very meekly his wrath going down as he trudged home for after all he would have his money by and by although the hard old man would punish him for past offences by making him wait for it  a week or so went by and then one day while passing through the village he saw elijah coming towards him and said to himself now ill be paid when the two men drew near together he cried out cheerfully good morning mr raven the other without a word and without a pause passed by on his way leaving the poor shepherd gazing crestfallen after him  after all he would not get his money the question was discussed in the cottages and by and by one of the villagers who was not so poor as most of them and went occasionally to salisbury said he would ask an attorneys advice about the matter he would pay for the advice out of his own pocket he wanted to know if elijah could lawfully do such things  to the mans astonishment the attorney said that as the club was not registered and the members had themselves made elijah their head he could do as he likedno action would lie against him but if it was true and it could be proved that he had spoken those words about paying the shepherd his money if he met him out of doors then he could be made to pay he also said he would take the case up and bring it into court if a sum of five pounds was guaranteed to cover expenses in case the decision went against them  poor caleb with twelve shillings a week to pay his debts and live on could guarantee nothing but by and by when the lawyers opinion had been discussed at great length at the inn and in all the cottages in the village it was found that several of bawcombes friends were willing to contribute something towards a guarantee fund and eventually the sum of five pounds was raised and handed over to the person who had seen the lawyer  his first step was to send for bawcombe who had to get a day off and journey in the carriers cart one marketday to salisbury the result was that action was taken and in due time the case came on elijah raven was in court with two or three of his friendssmall working farmers who had some interested motive in desiring to appear as his supporters he too had engaged a lawyer to conduct his case the judge said bawcombe who had never seen one before was a tarrible sternlooking old man in his wig the plaintiffs lawyer he did open the case and he did talk and talk a lot but elijahs counsel he did keep on interrupting him and they two argued and argued but the judge he never said no word only he looked blacker and more tarrible stern then when the talk did seem all over bawcombe ignorant of the forms got up and said i beg your lordships pardon but may i speak he didnt rightly remember afterwards what he called him but twere your lordship or your worship he was sure yes certainly you are here to speak said the judge and bawcombe then gave an account of his interview with elijah and of the conversation outside the house  then up rose elijah raven and in a loud voice exclaimed lord lord what a sad thing it is to have to sit here and listen to this mans lies  sit down sir thundered the judge sit down and hold your tongue or i shall have you removed  then elijahs lawyer jumped up and the judge told him hed better sit down too because he knowed who the liar was in this case a brutal case he said and that was the end and bawcombe got his six weeks sick pay and expenses and about three pounds besides being his share of the societys funds which elijah had been advised to distribute to the members  and that was the end of the winterbourne bishop club and from that time it has continued without one     chapter xxiii  isaacs

sister older and a brother and sister younger than himselfa symmetrical family i have already written incidentally of the elder brother and the youngest sister and in this chapter will complete the history of isaacs children by giving an account of the eldest sister and youngest brother  the brother was david the hottempered young shepherd who killed his dog monk and who afterwards followed his brother to warminster in spite of his temper and want of sense caleb was deeply attached to him and when as an old man his shepherding days were finished he followed his wife to their new home he grieved at being so far removed from his favourite brother for some time he managed to make the journey to visit him once a year not to his home near warminster but to wilton at the time of the great annual sheepfair held on 12th september from his cottage he would go by the carriers cart to the nearest town and thence by rail with one or two changes by salisbury to wilton  after i became acquainted with caleb he was ill and not likely to recover and for over two years could not get about during all this time he spoke often to me of his brother and wished he could see him i wondered why he did not write but he would not nor would the other these people of the older generation do not write to each other years are allowed to pass without tidings and they wonder and wish and talk of this and that absent member of the family trusting it is well with them but to write a letter never enters into their minds  at last caleb began to mend and determined to go again to wilton sheepfair to look for his beloved brother to warminster he could not go it was too far september the 12th saw him once more at the old meetingplace painfully making his slow way to that part of the ground where shepherd david bawcombe was accustomed to put his sheep but he was not there i be here too soon said caleb and sat himself patiently down to wait but hours passed and david did not appear so he got up and made his way about the fair in search of him but couldnt find n returning to the old spot he got into conversation with two young shepherds and told them he was waiting for his brother who always put his sheep in that part what be his name they asked and when he gave it they looked at one another and were silent then one of them said be you shepherd caleb bawcombe and when he had answered them the other said youll not see your brother at wilton today weve come from doveton and knew he youll not see your brother no more he be dead these two years  caleb thanked them for telling him and got up and went his way very quietly and got back that night to his cottage he was very tired said his wife he wouldnt eat and he wouldnt talk many days passed and he still sat in his corner and brooded until the wife was angry and said she never knowed a man make so great a trouble over losing a brother twas not like losing a wife or a son she said but he answered not a word and it was many weeks before that dreadful sadness began to wear off and he could talk cheerfully once more of his old life in the village  of the sister martha there is much more to say her life was an eventful one as lives go in this quiet downland country and she was moreover distinguished above the others of the family by her beauty and vivacity i only knew her when her age was over eighty in her native village where her life ended some time ago but even at that age there was something of her beauty left and a good deal of her charm she had a good figure still and was of a good height and had dark fine eyes clear dark unwrinkled skin a finely shaped face and her grey hair once black was very abundant her manner too was very engaging at the age of twentyfive she married a shepherd named thomas ierata surname i had not heard before and which made me wonder where were the ierats in wiltshire that in all my rambles among the downland villages i had never come across them not even in the churchyards nobody knewthere were no ierats except martha ierat the widow of winterbourne bishop and her sonnobody had ever heard of any other family of the name i began to doubt that there ever had been such a name until quite recently when on going over an old downland village church the rector took me out to show me a strange name on a tablet let into the wall of the building outside the name was ierat and the date the seventeenth century he had never seen the name excepting on that tablet who then was marthas husband it was a queer story which she would never have told me but i had it from her brother and his wife  a generation before that of martha at a farm in the village of bower chalk on the ebble there was a girl named ellen ierat employed as a dairymaid she was not a native of the village and if her parentage and place of birth were ever known they have long passed out of memory she was a goodlooking nicetempered girl and was much liked by her master and mistress so that after she had been about two years in their service it came as a great shock to find that she was in the family way the shock was all the greater when the fresh discovery was made one day that another unmarried woman in the house who was also a valued servant was in the same condition the two unhappy women had kept their secret from every one except from each other until it could be kept no longer and they consulted together and determined to confess it to their mistress and abide the consequences  who were the men was the first question asked there was only onerobert coombe the shepherd who lived at the farmhouse a slow silent almost inarticulate man with a round head and flaxen hair a bachelor of whom people were accustomed to say that he would never marry because no woman would have such a stolid dullwitted fellow for a husband but he was a good shepherd and had been many years on the farm and it was altogether a terrible business forthwith the farmer got out his horse and rode to the downs to have it out with the unconscionable wretch who had brought that shame and trouble on them he found him sitting on the turf eating his midday bread and bacon with a can of cold tea at his side and getting off his horse he went up to him and damned him for a scoundrel and abused him until he had no words left then told his shepherd that he must choose between the two women and marry at once so as to make an honest woman of one of the two poor fools either he must do that or quit the farm forthwith  coombe heard in silence and without a change in his countenance masticating his food the while and washing it down with an occasional draught from his can until he had finished his meal then taking his crook he got up and remarking that he would think of it went after his flock  the farmer rode back cursing him for a clod and in the evening coombe after folding his flock came in to give his decision and said he had thought of it and would take jane to wife she was a good deal older than ellen and not so goodlooking but she belonged to the village and her people were there and everybody knowed who jane was an she was an old servant an would be wanted on the farm ellen was a stranger among them and being only a dairymaid was of less account than the other one  so it was settled and on the following morning ellen the rejected was told to take up her traps and walk  what was she to do in her condition no longer to be concealed alone and friendless in the world she thought of mrs poole an elderly woman of winterbourne bishop whose children were grown up and away from home who when staying at bower chalk some months before had taken a great liking for ellen and when parting with her had kissed her and said my dear i lived among strangers too when i were a girl and had no one of my own and know what tis that was all but there was nobody else and she resolved to go to mrs poole and so laden with her few belongings she set out to walk the long miles over the downs to winterbourne bishop where she had never been it was far to walk in hot august weather when she went that sad journey and she rested at intervals in the hot shade of a furzebush haunted all day by the miserable fear that the woman she sought of whom she knew so little would probably harden her heart and close her door against her but the good woman took compassion on her and gave her shelter in her poor cottage and kept her till her child was born in spite of all the womens bitter tongues and in the village where she had found refuge she remained to the end of her life without a home of her own but always in a room or two with her boy in some poor persons cottage her life was hard but not unpeaceful and the old people all dead and gone now remembered ellen as a very quiet staid woman who worked hard for a living sometimes at the washtub but mostly in the fields haymaking and harvesting and at other times weeding or collecting flints or with a spud or sickle extirpating thistles in the pastureland she worked alone or with other poor women but with the men she had no friendships the sharpest womens eyes in the village could see no fault in her in this respect if it had not been so if she had talked pleasantly with them and smiled when addressed by them her life would have been made a burden to her she would have been often asked who her brats father was the dreadful experience of that day when she had been cast out and was alone in the world when burdened with her unborn child she had walked over the downs in the hot august weather in anguish of apprehension had sunk into her soul her very nature was changed and in a mans presence her blood seemed frozen and if spoken to she answered in monosyllables with her eyes on the earth this was noted with the result that all the village women were her good friends they never reminded her of her fall and when she died still young they grieved for her and befriended the little orphan boy she had left on their hands  he was then about eleven years old and was a stout little fellow with a round head and flaxen hair like his father but he was not so stolid and not like him in character at all events his old widow in speaking of him to me said that never in all his life did he do one unkind or unjust thing he came from a long line of shepherds and shepherding was perhaps almost instinctive in him from his earliest boyhood the tremulous bleating of the sheep and halfmuffled clink of the copper bells and the sharp bark of the sheepdog had a strange attraction for him he was always ready when a boy was wanted to take charge of a flock during a temporary absence of the shepherd and eventually when only about fifteen he was engaged as undershepherd and for the rest of his life shepherding was his trade  his marriage to martha bawcombe came as a surprise to the village for though no one had any fault to find with tommy ierat there was a slur on him and martha who was the finest girl in the place might it was thought have looked for some one better but martha had always liked tommy they were of the same age and had been playmates in their childhood growing up together their childish affection had turned to love and after they had waited some years and tommy had a cottage and seven shillings a week isaac and his wife gave their consent and they were married still they felt hurt at being discussed in this way by the villagers so that when ierat was offered a place as shepherd at a distance from home where his family history was not known he was glad to take it and his wife to go with him about a month after her child was born  the new place was in somerset thirtyfive to forty miles from their native village and ierat as shepherd at the manorhouse farm on a large estate would have better wages than he had ever had before and a nice cottage to live in martha was delighted with her new homethe cottage the entire village the great park and mansion close by all made it seem like paradise to her better than everything was the pleasant welcome she received from the villagers who looked in to make her acquaintance and seemed very much taken with her appearance and nice friendly manner they were all eager to tell her about the squire and his lady who were young and of how great an interest they took in their people and how much they did for them and how they were loved by everybody on the estate  it happens oddly enough that i became acquainted with this same man the squire over fifty years after the events i am relating when he was past eighty this acquaintance came about by means of a letter he wrote me in reference to the habits of a bird or some such small matter a way in which i have become acquainted with scoresperhaps i should say hundredsof persons in many parts of the country he was a very fine man the head of an old and distinguished county family an ideal squire and one of the few large landowners i have had the happiness to meet who was not devoted to that utterly selfish and degraded form of sport which consists in the annual rearing and subsequent slaughter of a host of pheasants  now when martha was entertaining half a dozen of her new neighbours who had come in to see her and exhibited her baby to them and then proceeded to suckle it they looked at one another and laughed and one said just you wait till the lady at the mansion sees eeshell soon want ee to nurse her little one  what did they mean they told her that the great lady was a mother too and had a little sickly baby and wanted a nurse for it but couldnt find a woman to please her  martha fired up at that did they imagine she asked that any great lady in the world with all her gold could tempt her to leave her own darling to nurse another womans she would not do such a thingshe would rather leave the place than submit to it but she didnt believe itthey had only said that to tease and frighten her  they laughed again looking admiringly at her as she stood before them with sparkling eyes flushed cheeks and fine full bust and only answered just you wait my dear till she sees ee  and very soon the lady did see her the people at the manor were strict in their religious observances and it had been impressed on martha that she had better attend at morning service on her first sunday and a girl was found by one of her neighbours to look after the baby in the meantime and so when sunday came she dressed herself in her best clothes and went to church with the others the service over the squire and his wife came out first and were standing in the path exchanging greetings with their friends then as the others came out with martha in the midst of the crowd the lady turned and fixed her eyes on her and suddenly stepping out from the group she stopped martha and said who are youi dont remember your face  no maam said martha blushing and curtsying i be the new shepherds wife at the manorhouse farmweve only been here a few days  the other then said she had heard of her and that she was nursing her child and she then told martha to go to the mansion that afternoon as she had something to say to her  the poor young mother went in fear and trembling trying to stiffen herself against the expected blandishments  then followed the fateful interview the lady was satisfied that she had got hold of the right person at lastthe one in the world who would be able to save her precious little one from to die the poor pining infant on whose frail little life so much depended she would feed it from her full healthy breasts and give it something of her own abounding splendid life marthas own baby would do very wellthere was nothing the matter with it and it would flourish on the bottle or anything else no matter what all she had to do was to go back to her cottage and make the necessary arrangements then come to stay at the mansion  martha refused and the other smiled then martha pleaded and cried and said she would never never leave her own child and as all that had no effect she was angry and it came into her mind that if the lady would get angry too she would be ordered out and all would be over but the lady wouldnt get angry for when martha stormed she grew more gentle and spoke tenderly and sweetly but would still have it her own way until the poor young mother could stand it no longer and so rushed away in a great state of agitation to tell her husband and ask him to help her against her enemy but tommy took the ladys side and his young wife hated him for it and was in despair and ready to snatch up her child and run away from them all when all at once a carriage appeared at the cottage and the great lady herself followed by a nurse with the sickly baby in her arms came in she had come she said very gently almost pleadingly to ask martha to feed her child once and martha was flattered and pleased at the request and took and fondled the infant in her arms then gave it suck at her beautiful breast and when she had fed the child acting very tenderly towards it like a mother her visitor suddenly burst into tears and taking martha in her arms she kissed her and pleaded with her again until she could resist no more and it was settled that she was to live at the mansion and come once every day to the village to feed her own child from the breast  marthas connexion with the people at the mansion did not end when she had safely reared the sickly child the lady had become attached to her and wanted to have her always although martha could not act again as wet nurse for she had no more children herself and by and by when her mistress lost her health after the birth of a third child and was ordered abroad she took martha with her and she passed a whole year with her on the continent residing in france and italy they came home again but as the lady continued to decline in health she travelled again still taking martha with her and they visited india and other distant countries including the holy land but travel and wealth and all that the greatest physicians in the world could do for her and the tender care of a husband who worshipped her availed not and she came home in the end to die and martha went back to her tommy and the boy to be separated no more while their lives lasted  the great house was shut up and remained so for years the squire was the last man in england to shirk his duties as landlord and to his people whom he loved and who loved him as few great landowners are loved in england but his grief was too great for even his great strength to bear up against and it was long feared by his friends that he would never recover from his loss but he was healed in time and ten years later married again and returned to his home to live there until nigh upon his ninetieth year long before this the ierats had returned to their native village when i last saw martha then in her eightysecond year she gave me the following account of her tommys end  he continued shepherding up to the age of seventyeight one sunday early in the afternoon when she was ill with an attack of influenza he came home and putting aside his crook said ive done work  its early she replied but maybe you got the boy to mind the sheep for you  i dont mean ive done work for the day he returned ive done for goodill not go with the flock no more  what be saying she cried in sudden alarm be you feeling badwhat be the matter  no im not bad he said im perfectly well but ive done work and more than that he would not say  she watched him anxiously but could see nothing wrong with him his appetite was good he smoked his pipe and was cheerful  three days later she noticed that he had some difficulty in pulling on a stocking when dressing in the morning and went to his assistance he laughed and said heres a funny thing you be ill and i be well and youve got to help me put on a stocking and he laughed again  after dinner that day he said he wanted a drink and would have a glass of beer there was no beer in the house and she asked him if he would have a cup of tea  oh yes thatll do very well he said and she made it for him  after drinking his cup of tea he got a footstool and placing it at her feet sat down on it and rested his head on her knees he remained a long time in this position so perfectly still that she at length bent over and felt and examined his face only to discover that he was dead  and that was the end of tommy ierat the son of ellen he died she said like a baby that has been fed and falls asleep on its mothers breast     chapter xxiv  living in the past    evening

dogbadger shepherds the fowlsa ghost   storya sundayevening talkparsons and ministersnoisy   religionthe shepherds love of his callingmark dick and the   giddy sheepconclusion   during our frequent evening talks often continued till a late hour it was borne in on caleb bawcombe that his anecdotes of wild creatures interested me more than anything else he had to tell but in spite of this or because he could not always bear it in mind the conversation almost invariably drifted back to the old subject of sheep of which he was never tired even in his sleep he does not forget them his dreams he says are always about sheep he is with the flock shifting the hurdles or following it out on the down a troubled dream when he is ill or uneasy in his sleep is invariably about some difficulty with the flock it gets out of his control and the dog cannot understand him or refuses to obey when everything depends on his instant action the subject was so much to him so important above all others that he would not spare the listener even the minutest details of the shepherds life and work his hints on the construction of sheepfolds would have filled a volume and if any farmer had purchased the book he would not have found the title a misleading one and that he had been defrauded of his money but with his singular fawnlike face and clear eyes on his listener it was impossible to fall asleep or even to let the attention wander and incidentally even in his driest discourse there were little bright touches which one would not willingly have missed  about hurdles he explained that it was common for the downland shepherds to repair the broken and wornout ones with the long woody stems of the bithywind from the hedges and when i asked what the plant was he described the wild clematis or travellersjoy but those names he did not knowto him the plant had always been known as bithywind or else devils guts it struck me that bithywind might have come by the transposition of two letters from withybind as if one should say flutterby for butterfly or flagondry for dragonfly withybind is one of the numerous vernacular names of the common convolvulus lilybind is another but what would old gerarde who invented the pretty name of travellersjoy for that ornament of the wayside hedges have said to such a name as devils guts  there was said caleb an old farmer in the parish of bishop who had a peculiar fondness for this plant and if a shepherd pulled any of it out of one of his hedges after leafingtime he would be very much put out he would shout at him just you leave my devils guts alone or ill not keep you on the farm and the shepherds in revenge gave him the unpleasant nickname of old devils guts by which he was known in that part of the country  as a rule talk about sheep or any subject connected with sheep would suggest something about sheepdogs individual dogs he had known or possessed and who always had their own character and peculiarities like human beings they were good and bad and indifferent a really bad dog was a rarity but a fairly good dog might have some trick or vice or weakness there was sally for example a stumptail bitch as good a dog with sheep as he ever possessed but you had to consider her feelings she would keenly resent any injustice from her master if he spoke too sharply to her or rebuked her unnecessarily for going a little out of her way just to smell at a rabbit burrow she would nurse her anger until an opportunity came of inflicting a bite on some erring sheep punishing her would have made matters worse the only way was to treat her as a reasonable being and never to speak to her as a doga mere slave  dyke was another dog he remembered well he belonged to old shepherd matthew titt who was headshepherd at a farm near warminster adjacent to the one where caleb worked old mat and his wife lived alone in their cottage out of the village all their children having long grown up and gone away to a distance from home and being so lonely by their two selves they loved their dog just as others love their relations but dyke deserved it for he was a very good dog one year mat was sent by his master with lambs to weyhill the little village near andover where a great sheepfair is held in october every year it was distant over thirty miles but mat though old was a strong man still and greatly trusted by his master from this journey he returned with a sad heart for he had lost dyke he had disappeared one night while they were at weyhill old mrs titt cried for him as she would have cried for a lost son and for many a long day they went about with heavy hearts  just a year had gone by when one night the old woman was roused from sleep by loud knocks on the windowpane of the livingroom below mat mat she cried shaking him vigorously wake upold dyke has come back to us what be you talking about growled the old shepherd lie down and go to sleepyouve been dreaming taint no dream tis dykei know his knock she cried and getting up she opened the window and put her head well out and there sure enough was dyke standing up against the wall and gazing up at her and knocking with his paw against the window below  then mat jumped up and going together downstairs they unbarred the door and embraced the dog with joy and the rest of the night was spent in feeding and caressing him and asking him a hundred questions which he could only answer by licking their hands and wagging his tail  it was supposed that he had been stolen at the fair probably by one of the wild little lawless men called general dealers who go flying about the country in a trap drawn by a fasttrotting pony that he had been thrown muffled up into the cart and carried many a mile away and sold to some shepherd and that he had lost his sense of direction but after serving a stranger a full year he had been taken with sheep to weyhill fair once more and once there he knew where he was and had remembered the road leading to his old home and master and making his escape had travelled the thirty long miles back to warminster  the account of dykes return reminded me of an equally good story of the recovery of a lost dog which i heard from a shepherd on the avon he had been lost over a year when one day the shepherd being out on the down with his flock stood watching two drovers travelling with a flock on the turnpike road below nearly a mile away and by and by hearing one of their dogs bark he knew at that distance that it was his dog i havent a doubt he said to himself and if i know his bark hell know my whistle with that he thrust two fingers in his mouth and blew his shrillest and longest whistle then waited the result presently he spied a dog still at a great distance coming swiftly towards him it was his own dog mad with joy at finding his old master  did ever two friends long sundered by unhappy chance recognize each others voices at such a distance and so come together once more  whether the drovers had seen him desert them or not they did not follow to recover him nor did the shepherd go to them to find out how they had got possession of him it was enough that he had got his dog back  no doubt in this case the dog had recognized his old home when taken by it but he was in another mans hands now and the habits and discipline of a life made it impossible for him to desert until that old familiar and imperative call reached his ears and he could not disobey  then to go on with calebs reminiscences there was badger owned by a farmer and worked for some years by calebthe very best stumptail he ever had to help him this dog differed from others in his vivacious temper and ceaseless activity when the sheep were feeding quietly and there was little or nothing to do for hours at a time he would not lie down and go to sleep like any other sheepdog but would spend his vacant time amusing of hisself on some smooth slope where he could roll over and over then run back and roll over again and again playing by himself just like a child or he would chase a butterfly or scamper about over the down hunting for large white flints which he would bring one by one and deposit them at his masters feet pretending they were something of value and greatly enjoying the game this dog caleb said would make him laugh every day with his games and capers  when badger got old his sight and hearing failed yet when he was very nearly blind and so deaf that he could not hear a word of command even when it was shouted out quite close to him he was still kept with the flock because he was so intelligent and willing but he was too old at last it was time for him to be put out of the way the farmer however who owned him would not consent to have him shot and so the wistful old dog was ordered to keep at home at the farmhouse still he refused to be superannuated and not allowed to go to the flock he took to shepherding the fowls in the morning he would drive them out to their run and keep them there in a flock going round and round them by the hour and furiously hunting back the poor hens that tried to steal off to lay their eggs in some secret place this could not be allowed and so poor old badger who would have been too miserable if tied up had to be shot after all  these were always his best storieshis recollections of sheepdogs for of all creatures sheep alone excepted he knew and loved them best yet for one whose life had been spent in that small isolated village and on the bare down about it his range was pretty wide and it even included one memory of a visitor from the other world let him tell it in his own words  many say they dont believe there be such things as ghosties they niver seed n an i dont say i believe or disbelieve what i hear tell i warnt there to see i only know what i seed myself but i dont say that it were a ghostie or that it wasnt one i was coming home late one night from the sheep twere close on leven oclock a very quiet night with moonsheen that made it amost like day near th end of the village i come to the steppingstones as we call n where there be a gate and the road an just by the road the four big white stones for people going from the village to the copse an the down on tother side to step over the water in winter twas a stream there but the water it dried in summer and now twere summertime and there wur no water when i git there i seed two women both on em tall with black gowns on an big bonnets they used to wear an they were standing face to face so close that the tops o their bonnets wur amost touching together who be these women out so late says i to myself why says i they be mrs durk from up in the village an mrs gaarge durk the keepers wife down by the copse then i thought i knowd how twas mrs gaarge shed a been to see mrs durk in the village and mrs durk she were coming out a leetel way with her so far as the steppingstones and they wur just having a last leetel talk before saying good night but mind i heard no talking when i passed n an id hardly got past n before i says why what a fool be i mrs durk she be dead a twelvemonth an i were in the churchyard and seed her buried myself whatever be i thinking of that made me stop and turn round to look at n agin an there they was just as i seed n at firstmrs durk who was dead a twelvemonth an mrs gaarge durk from the copse standing there with their bonnets amost touching together an i couldnt hear nothingno talking they were so still as two posties then something came over me like a tarrible coldness in the blood and down my back an i were afraid and turning i runned faster than i ever runned in my life an never stoppednot till i got to the cottage  it was not a bad ghost story but then such stories seldom are when coming from those who have actually seen or believe they have seen an immaterial being their principal charm is in their infinite variety you never find two real or true ghost stories quite alike and in this they differ from the weary inventions of the fictionist  but invariably the principal subject was sheep  i did always like sheep said caleb some did say to me that they couldnt abide shepherding because of the sunday work but i always said someone must do it they must have food in winter and water in summer and must be looked after and it cant be worse for me to do it  it was on a sunday afternoon and the distant sound of the church bells had set him talking on this subject he told me how once after a long interval he went to the sunday morning service in his native village and the vicar preached a sermon about true religion just going to church he said did not make men religious out there on the downs there were shepherds who seldom saw the inside of a church who were sober righteous men and walked with god every day of their lives caleb said that this seemed to touch his heart because he knowed it was true  when i asked him if he would not change the church for the chapel now he was ill and his vicar paid him no attention while the minister came often to see and talk to him as i had witnessed he shook his head and said that he would never change he then added we always say that the chapel ministers are good men some say they be better than the parsons but all ive knowedall them that have talked to mehave said bad things of the church and thats not true religion i say that the bible teaches different  caleb could not have had a very wide experience and most of us know dissenting ministers who are wholly free from the fault he pointed out but in the purely rural districts in the small villages where the small men are found it is certainly common to hear unpleasant things said of the parish priest by his nonconformist rival and should the parson have some wellknown fault or make a slip the other is apt to chuckle over it with a very manifest and most unchristian delight  the atmosphere on that sunday afternoon was very still and by and by through the open window floated a strain of music it was from the brass band of the salvationists who were marching through the next village about two miles away we listened then caleb remarked somehow i never cared to go with them army people many say theyve done a great good and i dont disbelieve it but there was too much what i callnoise if sir you can understand what i mean  i once heard the great dr parker speak the word imagination or as he pronounced it immadgeinashun with a volume of sound which filled a large building and made the quality he named seem the biggest thing in the universe that in my experience was his loftiest oratorical feat but i think the old shepherd rose to a greater height when after a long pause during which he filled his lungs with air he brought forth the tremendous word dragging it out gratingly so as to illustrate the sense in the prolonged harsh sound  to show him that i understood what he meant very well i explained the philosophy of the matter as follows he was a shepherd of the downs who had lived always in a quiet atmosphere a noiseless world and from lifelong custom had become a lover of quiet the salvation army was born in a very different world in east londonthe dusty busy crowded world of streets where men wake at dawn to sounds that are like the opening of hells gates and spend their long strenuous days and their lives in that atmosphere peopled with innumerable harsh noises until they too acquire the noisy habit and come at last to think that if they have anything to say to their fellows anything to sell or advise or recommend from the smallest thingfrom a mackerel or a cabbage or a pennorth of milk to a newspaper or a book or a picture or a religionthey must howl and yell it out at every passerby and the human voice not being sufficiently powerful they provide themselves with bells and gongs and cymbals and trumpets and drums to help them in attracting the attention of the public  he listened gravely to this outburst and said he didnt know exactly bout that but agreed that it was very quiet on the downs and that he loved their quiet fifty years he said ive been on the downs and fields day and night seven days a week and ive been told that its a poor way to spend a life working seven days for ten or twelve or at most thirteen shillings but i never seen it like that i liked it and i always did my best you see sir i took a pride in it i never left a place but i was asked to stay when i left it was because of something i didnt like i couldnt never abide cruelty to a dog or any beast and i couldnt abide bad language if my master swore at the sheep or the dog i wouldnt bide with heno not for a pound a week i liked my work and i liked knowing things about sheep not things in books for i never had no books but what i found out with my own sense if you can understand me  i remember when i were young a very old shepherd on the farm he had been more n forty years there and he was called mark dick he told me that when he were a young man he was once putting the sheep in the fold and there was one that was giddya young ewe she was always aturning round and round and round and when she got to the gate she wouldnt go in but kept on aturning and turning until at last he got angry and lifting his crook gave her a crack on the head and down she went and he thought hed killed her but in a little while up she jumps and trotted straight into the fold and from that time she were well next day he told his master and his master said with a laugh well now you know what to do when you gits a giddy sheep some time after that mark dick he had another giddy one and remembering what his master had said he swung his stick and gave her a big crack on the skull and down went the sheep dead hed killed it this time sure enough when he tells of this one his master said youve cured one and youve killed one now dont you try to cure no more he says  well some time after that i had a giddy one in my flock id been thinking of what mark dick had told me so i caught the ewe to see if i could find out anything i were always a tarrible one for examining sheep when they were ill i found this one had a swelling at the back of her head it were like a soft ball bigger n a walnut so i took my knife and opened it and out ran a lot of water quite clear and when i let her go she ran quite straight and got well after that i did cure other giddy sheep with my knife but i found out there were some i couldnt cure they had no swelling and was giddy because theyd got a maggot on the brain or some other trouble i couldnt find out  caleb could not have finished even this quiet sunday afternoon conversation in the course of which we had risen to lofty matters without a return to his old favourite subjects of sheep and his shepherding life on the downs he was long miles away from his beloved home now lying on his back a disabled man who would never again follow a flock on the hills nor listen to the sounds he loved best to hearthe multitudinous tremulous bleatings of the sheep the tinklings of numerous bells and crisp ringing bark of his dog but his heart was there still and the images of past scenes were more vivid in him than they can ever be in the minds of those who live in towns and read books i can see it now was a favourite expression of his when relating some incident in his past life whenever a sudden light a kind of smile came into his eyes i knew that it was at some ancient memory a touch of quaintness or humour in some farmer or shepherd he had known in the vanished timehis father perhaps or old john or mark dick or liddy or danl burdon the solemn seeker after buried treasure  after our long sunday talk we were silent for a time and then he uttered these impressive words i dont say that i want to have my life again because twould be sinful we must take what is sent but if twas offered to me and i was told to choose my work id say give me my wiltsheer downs again and let me be a shepherd there all my life long
