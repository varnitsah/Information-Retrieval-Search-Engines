independent story yet readers of riders of the purple sage will find in it an answer to a question often asked  i wish to say also this story has appeared serially in a different form in one of the monthly magazines under the title of the desert crucible             zane grey               june 1915      the rainbow trail     i red lake   shefford halted his tired horse and gazed with slowly realizing eyes  a leaguelong slope of sage rolled and billowed down to red lake a dry red basin denuded and glistening a hollow in the desert a lonely and desolate door to the vast wild and broken upland beyond  all day shefford had plodded onward with the clear horizonline a thing unattainable and for days before that he had ridden the wild bare flats and climbed the rocky desert benches the great colored reaches and steps had led endlessly onward and upward through dim and deceiving distance  a hundred miles of desert travel with its mistakes and lessons and intimations had not prepared him for what he now saw he beheld what seemed a world that knew only magnitude wonder and awe fixed his gaze and thought remained aloof then that dark and unknown northland flung a menace at him an irresistible call had drawn him to this seamed and peaked border of arizona this broken battlemented wilderness of utah upland and at first sight they frowned upon him as if to warn him not to search for what lay hidden beyond the ranges but shefford thrilled with both fear and exultation that was the country which had been described to him far across the red valley far beyond the ragged line of black mesa and yellow range lay the wild cañon with its haunting secret  red lake must be his rubicon either he must enter the unknown to seek to strive to find or turn back and fail and never know and be always haunted a friends strange story had prompted his singular journey a beautiful rainbow with its mystery and promise had decided him once in his life he had answered a wild call to the kingdom of adventure within him and once in his life he had been happy but here in the horizonwide face of that upflung and cloven desert he grew cold he faltered even while he felt more fatally drawn  as if impelled shefford started his horse down the sandy trail but he checked his former farreaching gaze it was the month of april and the waning sun lost heat and brightness long shadows crept down the slope ahead of him and the scant sage deepened its gray he watched the lizards shoot like brown streaks across the sand leaving their slender tracks he heard the rustle of packrats as they darted into their brushy homes the whir of a lowsailing hawk startled his horse  like ocean waves the slope rose and fell its hollows choked with sand its ridgetops showing scantier growth of sage and grass and weed the last ridge was a sanddune beautifully ribbed and scalloped and lined by the wind and from its knifesharp crest a thin wavering sheet of sand blew almost like smoke shefford wondered why the sand looked red at a distance for here it seemed almost white it rippled everywhere clean and glistening always leading down  suddenly shefford became aware of a house looming out of the bareness of the slope it dominated that long white incline grim lonely forbidding how strangely it harmonized with the surroundings the structure was octagonshaped built of uncut stone and resembled a fort there was no door on the sides exposed to sheffords gaze but small apertures twothirds the way up probably served as windows and portholes the roof appeared to be made of poles covered with red earth  like a huge cold rock on a wide plain this house stood there on the windy slope it was an outpost of the trader presbrey of whom shefford had heard at flagstaff and tuba no living thing appeared in the limit of sheffords vision he gazed shudderingly at the unwelcoming habitation at the dark eyelike windows at the sweep of barren slope merging into the vast red valley at the bold bleak bluffs could any one live here the nature of that sinister valley forbade a home there and the spirit of the place hovered in the silence and space shefford thought irresistibly of how his enemies would have consigned him to just such a hell he thought bitterly and mockingly of the narrow congregation that had proved him a failure in the ministry that had repudiated his ideas of religion and immortality and god that had driven him at the age of twentyfour from the calling forced upon him by his people as a boy he had yearned to make himself an artist his family had made him a clergyman fate had made him a failure a failure only so far in his life something urged him to addfor in the lonely days and silent nights of the desert he had experienced a strange birth of hope adventure had called him but it was a vague and spiritual hope a dream of promise a nameless attainment that fortified his wilder impulse  as he rode around a corner of the stone house his horse snorted and stopped a lean shaggy pony jumped at sight of him almost displacing a red longhaired blanket that covered an indian saddle quick thuds of hoofs in sand drew sheffords attention to a corral made of peeled poles and here he saw another pony  shefford heard subdued voices he dismounted and walked to an open door in the dark interior he dimly descried a high counter a stairway a pile of bags of flour blankets and silverornamented objects but the persons he had heard were not in that part of the house around another corner of the octagonshaped wall he found another open door and through it saw goatskins and a mound of dirty sheepwool black and brown and white it was light in this part of the building when he crossed the threshold he was astounded to see a man struggling with a girlan indian girl she was straining back from him panting and uttering low guttural sounds the mans face was corded and dark with passion this scene affected shefford strangely primitive emotions were new to him  before shefford could speak the girl broke loose and turned to flee she was an indian and this place was the uncivilized desert but shefford knew terror when he saw it like a dog the man rushed after her it was instinct that made shefford strike and his blow laid the man flat he lay stunned a moment then raised himself to a sitting posture his hand to his face and the gaze he fixed upon shefford seemed to combine astonishment and rage  i hope youre not presbrey said shefford slowly he felt awkward not sure of himself  the man appeared about to burst into speech but repressed it there was blood on his mouth and his hand hastily he scrambled to his feet shefford saw this mans amaze and rage change to shame he was tall and rather stout he had a smooth tanned face soft of outline with a weak chin his eyes were dark the look of him and his corduroys and his soft shoes gave shefford an impression that he was not a man who worked hard by contrast with the few other worn and rugged desert men shefford had met this stranger stood out strikingly he stooped to pick up a soft felt hat and jamming it on his head he hurried out shefford followed him and watched him from the door he went directly to the corral mounted the pony and rode out to turn down the slope toward the south when he reached the level of the basin where evidently the sand was hard he put the pony to a lope and gradually drew away  well ejaculated shefford he did not know what to make of this adventure presently he became aware that the indian girl was sitting on a roll of blankets near the wall with curious interest shefford studied her appearance she had long ravenblack hair tangled and disheveled and she wore a soiled white band of cord above her brow the color of her face struck him it was dark but not red nor bronzed it almost had a tinge of gold her profile was clearcut bold almost stern long black eyelashes hid her eyes she wore a tightfitting waist garment of material resembling velveteen it was ripped along her side exposing a skin still more richly gold than that of her face a string of silver ornaments and turquoiseandwhite beads encircled her neck and it moved gently up and down with the heaving of her full bosom her skirt was some gaudy print goods torn and stained and dusty she had little feet incased in brown moccasins fitting like gloves and buttoning over the ankles with silver coins  who was that man did he hurt you inquired shefford turning to gaze down the valley where a moving black object showed on the bare sand  no savvy replied the indian girl  wheres the trader presbrey asked shefford  she pointed straight down into the red valley  toh she said  in the center of the basin lay a small pool of water shining brightly in the sunset glow small objects moved around it so small that shefford thought he saw several dogs led by a child but it was the distance that deceived him there was a man down there watering his horses that reminded shefford of the duty owing to his own tired and thirsty beast whereupon he untied his pack took off the saddle and was about ready to start down when the indian girl grasped the bridle from his hand  me go she said  he saw her eyes then and they made her look different they were as black as her hair he was puzzled to decide whether or not he thought her handsome  thanks but ill go he replied and taking the bridle again he started down the slope at every step he sank into the deep soft sand down a little way he came upon a pile of tin cans they were everywhere buried half buried and lying loose and these gave evidence of how the trader lived presently shefford discovered that the indian girl was following him with her own pony looking upward at her against the light he thought her slender lithe picturesque at a distance he liked her  he plodded on at length glad to get out of the drifts of sand to the hard level floor of the valley this too was sand but dried and baked hard and red in color at some season of the year this immense flat must be covered with water how wide it was and empty shefford experienced again a feeling that had been novel to himand it was that he was loose free unanchored ready to veer with the wind from the foot of the slope the water hole had appeared to be a few hundred rods out in the valley but the small size of the figures made shefford doubt and he had to travel many times a few hundred rods before those figures began to grow then shefford made out that they were approaching him  thereafter they rapidly increased to normal proportions of man and beast when shefford met them he saw a powerful heavily built young man leading two ponies  youre mr presbrey the trader inquired shefford  yes im presbrey without the mister he replied  my names shefford im knocking about on the desert rode from beyond tuba today  glad to see you said presbrey he offered his hand he was a stalwart man clad in gray shirt overalls and boots a shock of tumbled light hair covered his massive head he was tanned but not darkly and there was red in his cheeks under his shaggy eyebrows were deep keen eyes his lips were hard and set as if occasion for smiles or words was rare and his big strong jaw seemed locked  wish more travelers came knocking around red lake he added reckon heres the jumpingoff place  its prettylonesome said shefford hesitating as if at a loss for words  then the indian girl came up presbrey addressed her in her own language which shefford did not understand she seemed shy and would not answer she stood with downcast face and eyes presbrey spoke again at which she pointed down the valley and then moved on with her pony toward the waterhole  presbreys keen eyes fixed on the receding black dot far down that oval expanse  that fellow leftrather abruptly said shefford constrainedly who was he  his names willetts hes a missionary he rode in today with this navajo girl he was taking her to blue cañon where he lives and teaches the indians ive met him only a few times you see not many white men ride in here hes the first white man ive seen in six months and youre the second both the same day red lakes getting popular its queer though his leaving he expected to stay all night theres no other place to stay blue cañon is fifty miles away  im sorry to sayno im not sorry eitherbut i must tell you i was the cause of mr willetts leaving replied shefford  how so inquired the other  then shefford related the incident following his arrival  perhaps my action was hasty he concluded apologetically i didnt think indeed im surprised at myself  presbrey made no comment and his face was as hard to read as one of the distant bluffs  but what did the man mean asked shefford conscious of a little heat im a stranger out here im ignorant of indianshow theyre controlled still im no fool if willetts didnt mean evil at least he was brutal  he was teaching her religion replied presbrey his tone held faint scorn and implied a joke but his face did not change in the slightest  without understanding just why shefford felt his conviction justified and his action approved then he was sensible of a slight shock of wonder and disgust  i ami was a minister of the gospel he said to presbrey what you hint seems impossible i cant believe it  i didnt hint replied presbrey bluntly and it was evident that he was a sincere but closemouthed man shefford so youre a preacher did you come out here to try to convert the indians  no i said i was a minister i am no longer im just aa wanderer  i see well the deserts no place for missionaries but its good for wanderers go water your horse and take him up to the corral youll find some hay for him ill get grub ready  shefford went on with his horse to the pool the water appeared thick green murky and there was a line of salty crust extending around the margin of the pool the thirsty horse splashed in and eagerly bent his head but he did not like the taste many times he refused to drink yet always lowered his nose again finally he drank though not his fill shefford saw the indian girl drink from her hand he scooped up a handful and found it too sour to swallow when he turned to retrace his steps she mounted her pony and followed him  a golden flare lit up the western sky and silhouetted dark and lonely against it stood the tradingpost upon his return shefford found the wind rising and it chilled him when he reached the slope thin gray sheets of sand were blowing low rising whipping falling sweeping along with soft silken rustle sometimes the gray veils hid his boots it was a long toilsome climb up that yielding dragging ascent and he had already been lame and tired by the time he had put his horse away twilight was everywhere except in the west the indian girl left her pony in the corral and came like a shadow toward the house  shefford had difficulty in finding the foot of the stairway he climbed to enter a large loft lighted by two lamps presbrey was there kneading biscuit dough in a pan  make yourself comfortable he said  the huge loft was the shape of a halfoctagon a door opened upon the valley side and here too there were windows how attractive the place was in comparison with the impressions gained from the outside the furnishings consisted of indian blankets on the floor two beds a desk and table several chairs and a couch a gunrack full of rifles innumerable silverornamented belts bridles and other indian articles upon the walls and in one corner a woodburning stove with teakettle steaming and a great cupboard with shelves packed full of canned foods  shefford leaned in the doorway and looked out beneath him on a roll of blankets sat the indian girl silent and motionless he wondered what was in her mind what she would do how the trader would treat her the slope now was a long slant of sheeted moving shadows of sand dusk had gathered in the valley the bluffs loomed beyond a pale star twinkled above shefford suddenly became aware of the intense nature of the stillness about him yet as he listened to this silence he heard an intermittent and immeasurably low moan a fitful mournful murmur assuredly it was only the wind nevertheless it made his blood run cold it was a different wind from that which had made music under the eaves of his illinois home this was a lonely haunting wind with desert hunger in it and more which he could not name shefford listened to this spiritbrooding sound while he watched night envelop the valley how black how thick the mantle yet it brought no comforting sense of closefolded protection of walls of soft sleep of a home instead there was the feeling of space of emptiness of an infinite hall down which a mournful wind swept streams of murmuring sand  well grubs about ready said presbrey  got any water asked shefford  sure there in the bucket its rainwater i have a tank here  sheffords sore and blistered face felt better after he had washed off the sand and alkali dust  better not wash your face often while youre in the desert bad plan went on presbrey noting how gingerly his visitor had gone about his ablutions well come and eat  shefford marked that if the trader did live a lonely life he fared well there was more on the table than twice two men could have eaten it was the first time in four days that shefford had sat at a table and he made up for lost opportunity  his hosts actions indicated pleasure yet the strange hard face never relaxed never changed when the meal was finished presbrey declined assistance had a generous thought of the indian girl who he said could have a place to eat and sleep downstairs and then with the skill and despatch of an accomplished housewife cleared the table after which work he filled a pipe and evidently prepared to listen  it took only one question for shefford to find that the trader was starved for news of the outside world and for an hour shefford fed that appetite even as he had been done by but when he had talked himself out there seemed indication of presbrey being more than a good listener  howd you come in he asked presently  by flagstaffacross the little coloradoand through moencopie  did you stop at moen ave  no what place is that  a missionary lives there did you stop at tuba  only long enough to drink and water my horse that was a wonderful spring for the desert  you said you were a wanderer do you want a job ill give you one  no thank you presbrey  i saw your pack thats no pack to travel with in this country your horse wont last either have you any money  yes plenty of money  well thats good not that a white man out here would ever take a dollar from you but you can buy from the indians as you go where are you making for anyhow  shefford hesitated debating in mind whether to tell his purpose or not his host did not press the question  i see just footloose and wandering around went on presbrey i can understand how the desert appeals to you preachers lead easy safe crowded bound lives theyre shut up in a church with a bible and good people when once in a lifetime they get loosethey break out  yes ive broken outbeyond all bounds replied shefford sadly he seemed retrospective for a moment unaware of the traders keen and sympathetic glance and then he caught himself i want to see some wild life do you know the country north of here  only what the navajos tell me and theyre not much to talk theres a trail goes north but ive never traveled it its a new trail every time an indian goes that way for here the sand blows and covers old tracks but few navajos ride in from the north my trade is mostly with indians up and down the valley  how about water and grass  weve had rain and snow theres sure to be water cant say about grass though the sheep and ponies from the north are always fat but say shefford if youll excuse me for advising youdont go north  why asked shefford and it was certain that he thrilled  its unknown country terribly broken as you can see from here and there are bad indians biding in the cañon ive never met a man who had been over the pass between here and kayenta the trips been made so there must be a trail but its a dangerous trip for any man let alone a tenderfoot youre not even packing a gun  whats this place kayenta asked shefford  its a spring kayenta means bottomless spring theres a little tradingpost the last and the wildest in northern arizona withers the trader who keeps it hauls his supplies in from colorado and new mexico hes never come down this way i never saw him know nothing of him except hearsay reckon hes a nervy and strong man to hold that post if you want to go there better go by way of keams cañon and then around the foot of black mesa itll be a long ridemaybe two hundred miles  how far straight north over the pass  cant say upward of seventyfive miles over rough trails if there are trails at all ive heard rumors of a fine tribe of navajos living in there rich in sheep and horses it may be true and it may not but i do know there are bad indians halfbreeds and outcasts hiding in there some of them have visited me here bad customers more than that youll be going close to the utah line and the mormons over there are unfriendly these days  why queried shefford again with that curious thrill  they are being persecuted by the government  shefford asked no more questions and his host vouchsafed no more information on that score the conversation lagged then shefford inquired about the indian girl and learned that she lived up the valley somewhere presbrey had never seen her before willetts came with her to red lake and this query brought out the fact that presbrey was comparatively new to red lake and vicinity shefford wondered why a lonely six months there had not made the trader old in experience probably the desert did not readily give up its secrets moreover this red lake house was only an occasionally used branch of presbreys main tradingpost which was situated at willow springs fifty miles westward over the mesa  im closing up here soon for a spell said presbrey and now his face lost its set hardness and seemed singularly changed it was a difference of light and softness wont be so lonesome over at willow springs im being married soon  thats fine replied shefford warmly he was glad for the sake of this lonely desert man what good a wife would bring into a traders life  presbreys naive admission however appeared to detach him from his present surroundings and with his massive head enveloped by a cloud of smoke he lived in dreams  shefford respected his hosts serene abstraction indeed he was grateful for silence not for many nights had the past impinged so closely upon the present the wound in his soul had not healed and to speak of himself made it bleed anew memory was too poignant the past was too close he wanted to forget until he had toiled into the heart of this forbidding wildernessuntil time had gone by and he dared to face his unquiet soul then he listened to the steadily rising roar of the wind how strange and hollow that wind was freighted with heavy sand and he heard it sweep sweep sweep by in gusts and then blow with dull steady blast against the walls the sound was provocative of thought this moan and rush of wind was no dreamthis presence of his in a nightenshrouded and sandbesieged house of the lonely desert was realitythis adventure was not one of fancy true indeed then must be the wild strange story that had led him hither he was going on to seek to strive to find somewhere northward in the broken fastnesses lay hidden a valley walled in from the world would they be there those lost fugitives whose story had thrilled him after twelve years would she be alive a child grown to womanhood in the solitude of a beautiful cañon incredible yet he believed his friends story and he indeed knew how strange and tragic life was he fancied he heard her voice on the sweeping wind she called to him haunted him he admitted the improbability of her existence but lost nothing of the persistent intangible hope that drove him he believed himself a man stricken in soul unworthy through doubt of god to minister to the people who had banished him perhaps a labor of hercules a mighty and perilous work of rescue the saving of this lost and imprisoned girl would help him in his trouble she might be his salvation who could tell always as a boy and as a man he had fared forth to find the treasure at the foot of the rainbow     ii the sagi   next morning the indian girl was gone and the tracks of her pony led north sheffords first thought was to wonder if he would overtake her on the trail and this surprised him with the proof of how unconsciously his resolve to go on had formed  presbrey made no further attempt to turn shefford back but he insisted on replenishing the pack and that shefford take weapons finally shefford was persuaded to accept a revolver the trader bade him goodby and stood in the door while shefford led his horse down the slope toward the waterhole perhaps the trader believed he was watching the departure of a man who would never return he was still standing at the door of the post when shefford halted at the pool  upon the level floor of the valley lay thin patches of snow which had fallen during the night the air was biting cold yet stimulated shefford while it stung him his horse drank rather slowly and disgustedly then shefford mounted and reluctantly turned his back upon the tradingpost  as he rode away from the pool he saw a large flock of sheep approaching they were very closely even densely packed in a solid slowmoving mass and coming with a precision almost like a march this fact surprised shefford for there was not an indian in sight presently he saw that a dog was leading the flock and a little later he discovered another dog in the rear of the sheep they were splendid longhaired dogs of a wildlooking shepherd breed he halted his horse to watch the procession pass by the flock covered fully an acre of ground and the sheep were black white and brown they passed him making a little pattering roar on the hardcaked sand the dogs were taking the sheep in to water  shefford went on and was drawing close to the other side of the basin where the flat red level was broken by rising dunes and ridges when he espied a bunch of ponies a shrill whistle told him that they had seen him they were wild shaggy with long manes and tails they stopped threw up their heads and watched him shefford certainly returned the attention there was no indian with them presently with a snort the leader which appeared to be a stallion trotted behind the others seemed to be driving them and went clear round the band to get in the lead again he was taking them in to water the same as the dogs had taken the sheep  these incidents were new and pleasing to shefford how ignorant he had been of life in the wilderness once more he received subtle intimations of what he might learn out in the open and it was with a less weighted heart that he faced the gateway between the huge yellow bluffs on his left and the slow rise of ground to the black mesa on his right he looked back in time to see the tradingpost bleak and lonely on the bare slope pass out of sight behind the bluffs shefford felt no fearhe really had little experience of physical fearbut it was certain that he gritted his teeth and welcomed whatever was to come to him he had lived a narrow insulated life with his mind on spiritual things his family and his congregation and his friendsexcept that one new friend whose story had enthralled himwere people of quiet religious habit the man deep down in him had never had a chance he breathed hard as he tried to imagine the world opening to him and almost dared to be glad for the doubt that had sent him adrift  the tracks of the indian girls pony were plain in the sand also there were other tracks not so plain and these shefford decided had been made by willetts and the girl the day before he climbed a ridge half soft sand and half hard and saw right before him rising in striking form two great yellow buttes like elephant legs he rode between them amazed at their height then before him stretched a slowly ascending valley walled on one side by the black mesa and on the other by low bluffs for miles a darkgreen growth of greasewood covered the valley and shefford could see where the green thinned and failed to give place to sand he trotted his horse and made good time on this stretch  the day contrasted greatly with any he had yet experienced gray clouds obscured the walls of rock a few miles to the west and shefford saw squalls of snow like huge veils dropping down and spreading out the wind cut with the keenness of a knife soon he was chilled to the bone a squall swooped and roared down upon him and the wind that bore the driving white pellets of snow almost like hail was so freezing bitter cold that the former wind seemed warm in comparison the squall passed as swiftly as it had come and it left shefford so benumbed he could not hold the bridle he tumbled off his horse and walked by and by the sun came out and soon warmed him and melted the thin layer of snow on the sand he was still on the trail of the indian girl but hers were now the only tracks he could see  all morning he gradually climbed with limited view until at last he mounted to a point where the country lay open to his sight on all sides except where the endless black mesa ranged on into the north a rugged yellow peak dominated the landscape to the fore but it was far away red and jagged country extended westward to a huge flattopped wall of gray rock lowering swift clouds swept across the sky like drooping mantles and darkened the sun shefford built a little fire out of dead greasewood sticks and with his blanket round his shoulders he hung over the blaze scorching his clothes and hands he had been cold before in his life but he had never before appreciated fire this desert blast pierced him the squall enveloped him thicker and colder and windier than the other but being better fortified he did not suffer so much it howled away hiding the mesa and leaving a white desert behind shefford walked on leading his horse until the exercise and the sun had once more warmed him  this last squall had rendered the indian girls trail difficult to follow the snow did not quickly melt and besides sheep tracks and the tracks of horses gave him trouble until at last he was compelled to admit that he could not follow her any longer a faint path or trail led north however and following that he soon forgot the girl every surmounted ridge held a surprise for him the desert seemed never to change in the vast whole that encompassed him yet near him it was always changing from red lake he had seen a peaked walled and canyoned country as rough as a stormy sea but when he rode into that country the sharp and broken features held to the distance  he was glad to get out of the sand long narrow flats gray with grass and dotted with patches of greasewood and lined by low bare ridges of yellow rock stretched away from him leading toward the yellow peak that seemed never to be gained upon  shefford had pictures in his mind pictures of stone walls and wild valleys and domed buttes all of which had been painted in colorful and vivid words by his friend venters he believed he would recognize the distinctive and remarkable landmarks venters had portrayed and he was certain that he had not yet come upon one of them this was his second lonely day of travel and he had grown more and more susceptible to the influence of horizon and the different prominent points he attributed a gradual change in his feelings to the loneliness and the increasing wildness between tuba and flagstaff he had met indians and an occasional prospector and teamster here he was alone and though he felt some strange gladness he could not help but see the difference  he rode on during the gray lowering chilly day and toward evening the clouds broke in the west and a setting sun shone through the rift burnishing the desert to red and gold sheffords instinctive but deadened love of the beautiful in nature stirred into life and the moment of its rebirth was a melancholy and sweet one too late for the artists work but not too late for his soul  for a place to make camp he halted near a low area of rock that lay like an island in a sea of grass there was an abundance of dead greasewood for a campfire and after searching over the rock he found little pools of melted snow in the depressions he took off the saddle and pack watered his horse and hobbling him as well as his inexperience permitted he turned him loose on the grass  then while he built a fire and prepared a meal the night came down upon him in the lee of the rock he was well sheltered from the wind but the air was bitter cold he gathered all the dead greasewood in the vicinity replenished the fire and rolled in his blanket back to the blaze the loneliness and the coyotes did not bother him this night he was too tired and cold he went to sleep at once and did not awaken until the fire died out then he rebuilt it and went to sleep again every halfhour all night long he repeated this and was glad indeed when the dawn broke  the day began with misfortune his horse was gone it had been stolen or had worked out of sight or had broken the hobbles and made off from a high stone ridge shefford searched the grassy flats and slopes all to no purpose then he tried to track the horse but this was equally futile he had expected disasters and the first one did not daunt him he tied most of his pack in the blanket threw the canteen across his shoulder and set forth sure at least of one thingthat he was a very much better traveler on foot than on horseback  walking did not afford him the leisure to study the surrounding country however from time to time when he surmounted a bench he scanned the different landmarks that had grown familiar it took hours of steady walking to reach and pass the yellow peak that had been a kind of goal he saw many sheep trails and horse tracks in the vicinity of this mountain and once he was sure he espied an indian watching him from a bold ridgetop  the day was bright and warm with air so clear it magnified objects he knew to be far away the ascent was gradual there were many narrow flats connected by steps and the grass grew thicker and longer at noon shefford halted under the first cedartree a lonely dwarfed shrub that seemed to have had a hard life from this point the rise of ground was more perceptible and straggling cedars led the eye on to a purple slope that merged into green of pinyon and pine could that purple be the sage venters had so feelingly described or was it merely the purple of deceiving distance whatever it might be it gave shefford a thrill and made him think of the strange shy and lovely woman venters had won out here in this purplesage country  he calculated that he had ridden thirty miles the day before and had already traveled ten miles today and therefore could hope to be in the pass before night shefford resumed his journey with too much energy and enthusiasm to think of being tired and he discovered presently that the straggling cedars and the slope beyond were much closer than he had judged them to be he reached the sage to find it gray instead of purple yet it was always purple a little way ahead and if he half shut his eyes it was purple near at hand he was surprised to find that he could not breathe freely or it seemed so and soon made the discovery that the sweet pungent penetrating fragrance of sage and cedar had this strange effect upon him this was an exceedingly dry and odorous forest where every open space between the clumps of cedars was choked with luxuriant sage the pinyons were higher up on the mesa and the pines still higher shefford appeared to lose himself there were no trails the black mesa on the right and the wall of stone on the left could not be seen but he pushed on with what was either singular confidence or rash impulse and he did not know whether that slope was long or short once at the summit he saw with surprise that it broke abruptly and the descent was very steep and short on that side through the trees he once more saw the black mesa rising to the dignity of a mountain and he had glimpses of another flat narrow valley this time with a red wall running parallel with the mesa he could not help but hurry down to get an unobstructed view his eagerness was rewarded by a splendid scene yet to his regret he could not force himself to believe it had any relation to the pictured scenes in his mind the valley was half a mile wide perhaps several miles long and it extended in a curve between the cedarsloped mesa and a looming wall of red stone there was not a bird or a beast in sight he found a welldefined trail but it had not been recently used he passed a low structure made of peeled logs and mud with a dark opening like a door it did not take him many minutes to learn that the valley was longer than he had calculated he walked swiftly and steadily in spite of the fact that the pack had become burdensome what lay beyond the jutting corner of the mesa had increasing fascination for him and acted as a spur at last he turned the corner only to be disappointed at sight of another cedar slope he had a glimpse of a single black shaft of rock rising far in the distance and it disappeared as his striding forward made the crest of the slope rise toward the sky  again his view became restricted and he lost the sense of a slow and gradual uplift of rock and an increase in the scale of proportion halfway up this ascent he was compelled to rest and again the sun was slanting low when he entered the cedar forest soon he was descending and he suddenly came into the open to face a scene that made his heart beat thick and fast  he saw lofty crags and cathedral spires and a wonderful cañon winding between huge beetling red walls he heard the murmur of flowing water the trail led down to the cañon floor which appeared to be level and green and cut by deep washes in red earth could this cañon be the mouth of deception pass it bore no resemblance to any place shefford had heard described yet somehow he felt rather than saw that it was the portal to the wild vastness he had traveled so far to enter  not till he had descended the trail and had dropped his pack did he realize how weary and footsore he was then he rested but his eyes roved to and fro and his mind was active what a wild and lonesome spot the low murmur of shallow water came up to him from a deep narrow cleft shadows were already making the cañon seem full of blue haze he saw a bare slope of stone out of which cedartrees were growing and as he looked about him he became aware of a singular and very perceptible change in the lights and shades the sun was setting the crags were goldtipped the shadows crept upward the sky seemed to darken swiftly then the gold changed to red slowly dulled and the grays and purples stood out shefford was entranced with the beautiful changing effects and watched till the walls turned black and the sky grew steely and a faint star peeped out then he set about the necessary camp tasks  dead cedars right at hand assured him a comfortable night with steady fire and when he had satisfied his hunger he arranged an easy seat before the blazing logs and gave his mind over to thought of his weird lonely environment  the murmur of running water mingled in harmonious accompaniment with the moan of the wind in the cedarswild sweet sounds that were balm to his wounded spirit they seemed a part of the silence rather than a break in it or a hindrance to the feeling of it but suddenly that silence did break to the rattle of a rock shefford listened thinking some wild animal was prowling around he felt no alarm presently he heard the sound again and again then he recognized the crack of unshod hoofs upon rock a horse was coming down the trail shefford rather resented the interruption though he still had no alarm he believed he was perfectly safe as a matter of fact he had never in his life been anything but safe and padded around with wool hence never having experienced peril he did not know what fear was  presently he saw a horse and rider come into dark prominence on the ridge just above his camp they were silhouetted against the starry sky the horseman stopped and he and his steed made a magnificent black statue somehow wild and strange in sheffords sight then he came on vanished in the darkness under the ridge presently to emerge into the circle of campfire light  he rode to within twenty feet of shefford and the fire the horse was dark wildlooking and seemed ready to run the rider appeared to be an indian and yet had something about him suggesting the cowboy at once shefford remembered what presbrey had said about halfbreeds a little shock inexplicable to shefford rippled over him  he greeted his visitor but received no answer shefford saw a dark squat figure bending forward in the saddle the man was tense all about him was dark except the glint of a rifle across the saddle the face under the sombrero was only a shadow shefford kicked the firelogs and a brighter blaze lightened the scene then he saw this stranger a little more clearly and made out an unusually large head broad dark face a sinister tightshut mouth and gleaming black eyes  those eyes were unmistakably hostile they roved searchingly over sheffords pack and then over his person shefford felt for the gun that presbrey had given him but it was gone he had left it back where he had lost his horse and had not thought of it since then a strange slowcoming cold agitation possessed shefford something gripped his throat  suddenly shefford was stricken at a menacing movement on the part of the horseman he had drawn a gun shefford saw it shine darkly in the firelight the indian meant to murder him shefford saw the grim dark face in a kind of horrible amaze he felt the meaning of that drawn weapon as he had never felt anything before in his life and he collapsed back into his seat with an icy sickening terror in a second he was dripping wet with cold sweat lightningswift thoughts flashed through his mind it had been one of his platitudes that he was not afraid of death yet here he was a shaking helpless coward what had he learned about either life or death would this dark savage plunge him into the unknown it was then that shefford realized his hollow philosophy and the bittersweetness of life he had a brain and a soul and between them he might have worked out his salvation but what were they to this ruthless nightwanderer this raw and horrible wildness of the desert  incapable of voluntary movement with tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth shefford watched the horseman and the halfpoised gun it was not yet leveled then it dawned upon shefford that the strangers head was turned a little his ear to the wind he was listening his horse was listening suddenly he straightened up wheeled his horse and trotted away into the darkness but he did not climb the ridge down which he had come  shefford heard the click of hoofs upon the stony trail other horses and riders were descending into the cañon they had been the cause of his deliverance and in the relaxation of feeling he almost fainted then he sat there slowly recovering slowly ceasing to tremble divining that this situation was somehow to change his attitude toward life  three horses two with riders moved in dark shapes across the skyline above the ridge disappeared as had sheffords first visitor and then rode into the light shefford saw two indiansa man and a woman then with surprise recognized the latter to be the indian girl he had met at red lake he was still more surprised to recognize in the third horse the one he had lost at the last camp shefford rose a little shaky on his legs to thank these indians for a double service the man slipped from his saddle and his moccasined feet thudded lightly he was tall lithe erect a singularly graceful figure and as he advanced shefford saw a dark face and sharp dark eyes the indian was bareheaded with his hair bound in a band he resembled the girl but appeared to have a finer face  how do he said in a voice low and distinct he extended his hand and shefford felt a grip of steel he returned the greeting then the indian gave shefford the bridle of the horse and made signs that appeared to indicate the horse had broken his hobbles and strayed shefford thanked him thereupon the indian unsaddled and led the horses away evidently to water them the girl remained behind shefford addressed her but she was shy and did not respond he then set about cooking a meal for his visitors and was busily engaged at this when the indian returned without the horses presently shefford resumed his seat by the fire and watched the two eat what he had prepared they certainly were hungry and soon had the pans and cups empty then the girl drew back a little into the shadow while the man sat with his legs crossed and his feet tucked under him  his dark face was smooth yet it seemed to have lines under the surface shefford was impressed he had never seen an indian who interested him as this one looked at superficially he appeared young wild silent locked in his primeval apathy just a healthy savage but looked at more attentively he appeared matured even old a strange sad brooding figure with a burden on his shoulders shefford found himself growing curious  what place asked shefford waving his hand toward the dark opening between the black cliffs  sagi replied the indian  that did not mean anything to shefford and he asked if the sagi was the pass but the indian shook his head  wife asked shefford pointing to the girl  the indian shook his head again bila he said  what you mean asked shefford what bila  sister replied the indian he spoke the word reluctantly as if the white mans language did not please him but the clearness and correct pronunciation surprised shefford  what namewhat call her he went on  glen naspa  what your name inquired shefford indicating the indian  nas ta bega answered the indian  navajo  the indian bowed with what seemed pride and stately dignity  my name john shefford come far way back toward rising sun come stay here long  nas ta begas dark eyes were fixed steadily upon shefford he reflected that he could not remember having felt so penetrating a gaze but neither the indians eyes nor face gave any clue to his thoughts  navajo no savvy jesus christ said the indian and his voice rolled out low and deep  shefford felt both amaze and pain the indian had taken him for a missionary  no me no missionary cried shefford and he flung up a passionately repudiating hand  a singular flash shot from the indians dark eyes it struck shefford even at this stinging moment when the past came back  tradebuy woolblanket queried nas ta bega  no replied shefford me want ridewalk far he waved his hand to indicate a wide sweep of territory me sick  nas ta bega laid a significant finger upon his lungs  no replied shefford me strong sick here and with motions of his hands he tried to show that his was a trouble of the heart  shefford received instant impression of this indians intelligent comprehension but he could not tell just what had given him the feeling nas ta bega rose then and walked away into the shadow shefford heard him working around the dead cedartree where he had probably gone to get firewood then shefford heard a splintering crash which was followed by a crunching bumping sound presently he was astounded to see the indian enter the lighted circle dragging the whole cedartree trunk first shefford would have doubted the ability of two men to drag that tree and here came nas ta bega managing it easily he laid the trunk on the fire and then proceeded to break off small branches to place them advantageously where the red coals kindled them into a blaze  the indians next move was to place his saddle which he evidently meant to use for a pillow then he spread a goatskin on the ground lay down upon it with his back to the fire and pulling a longhaired saddleblanket over his shoulders he relaxed and became motionless his sister glen naspa did likewise except that she stayed farther away from the fire and she had a larger blanket which covered her well it appeared to shefford that they went to sleep at once  shefford felt as tired as he had ever been but he did not think he could soon drop into slumber and in fact he did not want to  there was something in the companionship of these indians that he had not experienced before he still had a strange and weak feelingthe aftermath of that fear which had sickened him with its horrible icy grip nas ta begas arrival had frightened away that dark and silent prowler of the night and shefford was convinced the indian had saved his life the measure of his gratitude was a source of wonder to him had he cared so much for life yeshe had when face to face with death that was something to know it helped him and he gathered from his strange feeling that the romantic quest which had brought him into the wilderness might turn out to be an antidote for the morbid bitterness of heart  with new sensations had come new thoughts right then it was very pleasant to sit in the warmth and light of the roaring cedar fire there was a deepseated ache of fatigue in his bones what joy it was to rest he had felt the dry scorch of desert thirst and the pang of hunger how wonderful to learn the real meaning of water and food he had just finished the longest hardest days work of his life had that anything to do with a something almost like peace which seemed to hover near in the shadows trying to come to him he had befriended an indian girl and now her brother had paid back the service both the giving and receiving were somehow sweet to shefford they opened up hitherto vague channels of thought for years he had imagined he was serving people when he had never lifted a hand a blow given in the defense of an indian girl had somehow operated to make a change in john sheffords existence it had liberated a spirit in him moreover it had worked its influence outside his mind the indian girl and her brother had followed his trail to return his horse perhaps to guide him safely but unknowingly perhaps they had done infinitely more than that for him as sheffords eye wandered over the dark still figures of the sleepers he had a strange dreamy premonition or perhaps only a fancy that there was to be more come of this fortunate meeting  for the rest it was good to be there in the speaking silence to feel the heat on his outstretched palms and the cold wind on his cheek to see the black wall lifting its bold outline and the crags reaching for the white stars     iii kayenta   the stamping of horses awoke shefford he saw a towering crag rosy in the morning light like a huge red spear splitting the clear blue of sky he got up feeling cramped and sore yet with unfamiliar exhilaration the whipping air made him stretch his hands to the fire an odor of coffee and broiled meat mingled with the fragrance of wood smoke glen naspa was on her knees broiling a rabbit on a stick over the red coals nas ta bega was saddling the ponies the cañon appeared to be full of purple shadows under one side of dark cliffs and golden streaks of mist on the other where the sun struck high up on the walls  good morning said shefford  glen naspa shyly replied in navajo  how was nas ta begas greeting  in daylight the indian lost some of the dark somberness of face that had impressed shefford he had a noble head in poise like that of an eagle a bold cleancut profile and stern closeshut lips his eyes were the most striking and attractive feature about him they were coalblack and piercing the intent look out of them seemed to come from a keen and inquisitive mind  shefford ate breakfast with the indians and then helped with the few preparations for departure before they mounted nas ta bega pointed to horse tracks in the dust they were those that had been made by sheffords threatening visitor of the night before shefford explained by word and sign and succeeded at least in showing that he had been in danger nas ta bega followed the tracks a little way and presently returned  shadd he said with an ominous shake of his head shefford did not understand whether he meant the name of his visitor or something else but the menace connected with the word was clear enough  glen naspa mounted her pony and it was a graceful action that pleased shefford he climbed a little stiffly into his own saddle then nas ta bega got up and pointed northward  kayenta he inquired  shefford nodded and then they were off with glen naspa in the lead they did not climb the trail which they had descended but took one leading to the right along the base of the slope shefford saw down into the red wash that bisected the cañon floor it was a sheer wall of red clay or loam a hundred feet high and at the bottom ran a swift shallow stream of reddish water then for a time a high growth of greasewood hid the surroundings from sheffords sight presently the trail led out into the open and shefford saw that he was at the neck of a wonderful valley that gradually widened with great jagged red peaks on the left and the black mesa now a mountain running away to the right he turned to find that the opening of the sagi could no longer be seen and he was conscious of a strong desire to return and explore that cañon  soon glen naspa put her pony to a long easy swinging canter and her followers did likewise as they got outward into the valley shefford lost the sense of being overshadowed and crowded by the nearness of the huge walls and crags the trail appeared level underfoot but at a distance it was seen to climb shefford found where it disappeared over the foot of a slope that formed a graceful rising line up to the cedared flank of the mesa the valley floor widening away to the north remained level and green beyond rose the jagged range of red peaks all strangely cut and slanting these distant deceiving features of the country held sheffords gaze until the indian drew his attention to things near at hand then shefford saw flocks of sheep dotting the graygreen valley and bands of beautiful longmaned longtailed ponies  for several miles the scene did not change except that shefford imagined he came to see where the upland plain ended or at least broke its level he was right for presently the indian pointed and shefford went on to halt upon the edge of a steep slope leading down into a valley vast in its barren gray reaches  kayenta said nas ta bega  shefford at first saw nothing except the monotonous gray valley reaching far to the strange grotesque monuments of yellow cliff then close under the foot of the slope he espied two squat stone houses with red roofs and a corral with a pool of water shining in the sun  the trail leading down was steep and sandy but it was not long sheffords sweeping eyes appeared to take in everything at oncethe crude stone structures with their earthen roofs the piles of dirty wool the indians lolling around the tents and wagons and horses little lazy burros and dogs and scattered everywhere saddles blankets guns and packs  then a white man came out of the door he waved a hand and shouted dust and wool and flour were thick upon him he was muscular and weatherbeaten and appeared young in activity rather than face a gun swung at his hip and a row of brasstipped cartridges showed in his belt shefford looked into a face that he thought he had seen before until he realized the similarity was only the bronze and hard line and rugged cast common to desert men the gray searching eyes went right through him  glad to see you get down and come in just heard from an indian that you were coming im the trader withers he said to shefford his voice was welcoming and the grip of his hand made sheffords ache  shefford told his name and said he was as glad as he was lucky to arrive at kayenta  hello nas ta bega exclaimed withers his tone expressed a surprise his face did not show did this indian bring you in  withers shook hands with the navajo while shefford briefly related what he owed to him then withers looked at nas ta bega and spoke to him in the indian tongue  shadd said nas ta bega withers let out a dry little laugh and his strong hand tugged at his mustache  whos shadd asked shefford  hes a halfbreed utebad indian outlaw murderer hes in with a gang of outlaws who hide in the san juan country reckon youre lucky howd you come to be there in the sagi alone  i traveled from red lake presbrey the trader there advised against it but i came anyway  well witherss gray glance was kind if it did express the foolhardiness of sheffords act come into the house never mind the horse my wife will sure be glad to see you  withers led shefford by the first stone house which evidently was the tradingstore into the second the room shefford entered was large with logs smoldering in a huge open fireplace blankets covering every foot of floor space and indian baskets and silver ornaments everywhere and strange indian designs painted upon the whitewashed walls withers called his wife and made her acquainted with shefford she was a slight comely little woman with keen earnest dark eyes she seemed to be serious and quiet but she made shefford feel at home immediately he refused however to accept the room offered him saying that he me meant to sleep out under the open sky withers laughed at this and said he understood shefford remembering presbreys hunger for news of the outside world told this trader and his wife all he could think of and he was listened to with that close attention a traveler always gained in the remote places  sure am glad you rode in said withers for the fourth time now you make yourself at home stay herecome over to the storedo what you like ive got to work tonight well talk  shefford went out with his host the store was as interesting as presbreys though much smaller and more primitive it was full of everything and smelled strongly of sheep and goats there was a narrow aisle between sacks of flour and blankets on one side and a high counter on the other behind this counter withers stood to wait upon the buying indians they sold blankets and skins and bags of wool and in exchange took silver money then they lingered and with slow staid reluctance bought one thing and then anotherflour sugar canned goods coffee tobacco ammunition the counter was never without two or three indians leaning on their dark silverbraceleted arms but as they were slow to sell and buy and go so were others slow to come in their voices were soft and low and it seemed to shefford they were whispering he liked to hear them and to look at the banded heads the long twisted rolls of black hair tied with white cords the still dark faces and watchful eyes the silver earrings the slender shapely brown hands the lean and sinewy shapes the corduroys with a belt and gun and the small closefitting buckskin moccasins buttoned with coins these indians all appeared young and under the quiet slow demeanor there was fierce blood and fire  by and by two women came in evidently squaw and daughter the former was a huge stout indian with a face that was certainly pleasant if not jolly  she had the corners of a blanket tied under her chin and in the folds behind on her broad back was a naked indian baby round and black of head brownskinned with eyes as bright as beads when the youngster caught sight of shefford he made a startled dive into the sack of the blanket manifestly however curiosity got the better of fear for presently shefford caught a pair of wondering dark eyes peeping at him  theyre good spenders but slow said withers the navajos are careful and cautious thats why theyre rich this squaw yan as pa has flocks of sheep and more mustangs than she knows about  mustangs so thats what you call the ponies replied shefford  yep theyre mustangs and mostly wild as jackrabbits  shefford strolled outside and made the acquaintance of witherss helper a mormon named whisner he was a stockily built man past maturity and his sunblistered face and watery eyes told of the open desert he was engaged in weighing sacks of wool brought in by the indians near by stood a framework of poles from which an immense bag was suspended from the top of this bag protruded the head and shoulders of an indian who appeared to be stamping and packing wool with his feet he grinned at the curious shefford but shefford was more interested in the mormon so far as he knew whisner was the first man of that creed he had ever met and he could scarcely hide his eagerness venterss stories had been of a longpast generation of mormons fanatical ruthless and unchangeable shefford did not expect to meet mormons of this kind but any man of that religion would have interested him besides this whisner seemed to bring him closer to that wild secret cañon he had come west to find shefford was somewhat amazed and discomfited to have his polite and friendly overtures repulsed whisner might have been an indian he was cold incommunicative aloof and there was something about him that made the sensitive shefford feel his presence was resented  presently shefford strolled on to the corral which was full of shaggy mustangs they snorted and kicked at him he had a halfformed wish that he would never be called upon to ride one of those wild brutes and then he found himself thinking that he would ride one of them and after a while any of them shefford did not understand himself but he fought his natural instinctive reluctance to meet obstacles peril suffering  he traced the whitebordered little stream that made the pool in the corral and when he came to where it oozed out of the sand under the bluff he decided that was not the spring which had made kayenta famous presently down below the tradingpost he saw a trough from which burros were drinking here he found the spring a deep well of eddying water walled in by stones and the overflow made a shallow stream meandering away between its borders of alkali like a crust of salt shefford tasted the water it bit but it was good  shefford had no trouble in making friends with the lazy sleepyeyed burros they let him pull their long ears and rub their noses but the mustangs standing around were unapproachable they had wild eyes they raised long ears and looked vicious he let them alone  evidently this tradingpost was a great deal busier than red lake shefford counted a dozen indians lounging outside and there were others riding away big wagons told how the bags of wool were transported out of the wilds and how supplies were brought in a wide hardpacked road led off to the east and another not so clearly defined wound away to the north and indian trails streaked off in all directions  shefford discovered however when he had walked off a mile or so across the valley to lose sight of the post that the feeling of wildness and loneliness returned to him it was a wonderful country it held something for him besides the possible rescue of an imprisoned girl from a wild cañon              that night after supper when withers and shefford sat alone before the blazing logs in the huge fireplace the trader laid his hand on sheffords and said with directness and force  ive lived my life in the desert ive met many men and have been a friend to most youre no prospector or trader or missionary  no replied shefford  youve had trouble  yes  have you come in here to hide dont be afraid to tell me i wont give you away  i didnt come to hide  then no one is after you youve done no wrong  perhaps i wronged myself but no one else replied shefford steadily  i reckoned so well tell me or keep your secretits all one to me  shefford felt a desire to unburden himself this man was strong persuasive kindly he drew shefford  youre welcome in kayenta went on withers stay as long as you like i take no pay from a white man if you want work i have it aplenty  thank you that is good i need to work well talk of it later  but just yet i cant tell you why i came to kayenta what i want to do how long i shall stay my thoughts put in words would seem so like dreams maybe they are dreams perhaps im only chasing a phantomperhaps im only hunting the treasure at the foot of the rainbow  well this is the country for rainbows laughed withers in summer from june to august when it storms we have rainbows thatll make you think youre in another world the navajos have rainbow mountains rainbow canyons rainbow bridges of stone rainbow trails it sure is rainbow country  that deep and mystic chord in shefford thrilled here it was againsomething tangible at the bottom of his dream  withers did not wait for shefford to say any more and almost as if he read his visitors mind he began to talk about the wild country he called home  he had lived at kayenta for several yearshard and profitless years by reason of marauding outlaws he could not have lived there at all but for the protection of the indians his fatherinlaw had been friendly with the navajos and piutes for many years and his wife had been brought up among them she was held in peculiar reverence and affection by both tribes in that part of the country probably she knew more of the indians habits religion and life than any white person in the west both tribes were friendly and peaceable but there were bad indians halfbreeds and outlaws that made the tradingpost a venture withers had long considered precarious and he wanted to move and intended to some day his nearest neighbors in new mexico and colorado were a hundred miles distant and at some seasons the roads were impassable to the north however twenty miles or so was situated a mormon village named stonebridge it lay across the utah line withers did some business with this village but scarcely enough to warrant the risks he had to run during the last year he had lost several packtrains one of which he had never heard of after it left stonebridge  stonebridge exclaimed shefford and he trembled he had heard that name in his memory it had a place beside the name of another village shefford longed to speak of to this trader  yesstonebridge replied withers ever heard the name  i think so are there other villages inin that part of the country  a few but not close glaze is now only a waterhole bluff and monticello are far north across the san juan there used to be another villagebut that wouldnt interest you  maybe it would replied shefford quietly  but his hint was not taken by the trader withers suddenly showed a semblance of the aloofness shefford had observed in whisner  withers pardon an impertinencei am deeply serious are you a mormon  indeed im not replied the trader instantly  are you for the mormons or against them  neither i get along with them i know them i believe they are a misunderstood people  thats for them  no im only fairminded  shefford paused trying to curb his thrilling impulse but it was too strong  you said there used to be another village was the name of itcottonwoods  withers gave a start and faced round to stare at shefford in blank astonishment  say did you give me a straight story about yourself he queried sharply  so far as i went replied shefford  youre no spy on the lookout for sealed wives  absolutely not i dont even know what you mean by sealed wives  well its damn strange that youd know the name cottonwoods yes thats the name of the village i meantthe one that used to be its gone now all except a few stone walls  what became of it  torn down by mormons years ago they destroyed it and moved away ive heard indians talk about a grand spring that was there once its gone too its name waslet me see  amber spring interrupted shefford  by george youre right rejoined the trader again amazed shefford this beats me i havent heard that name for ten years i cant help seeing what a tenderfootstrangeryou are to the desert yet here you arespeaking of what you should know nothing of and theres more behind this  shefford rose unable to conceal his agitation  did you ever hear of a rider named venters  rider you mean a cowboy venters no i never heard that name  did you ever hear of a gunman named lassiter queried shefford with increasing emotion  no  did you ever hear of a mormon woman namedjane withersteen  no  shefford drew his breath sharply he had followed a gleamhe had caught a fleeting glimpse of it  did you ever hear of a childa girla womancalled fay larkin  withers rose slowly with a paling face  if youre a spy itll go hard with youthough im no mormon he said grimly  shefford lifted a shaking hand  i was a clergyman now im nothinga wandererleast of all a spy  withers leaned closer to see into the other mans eyes he looked long and then appeared satisfied  ive heard the name fay larkin he said slowly i reckon thats all ill say till you tell your story              shefford stood with his back to the fire and he turned the palms of his hands to catch the warmth he felt cold withers had affected him strangely what was the meaning of the traders somber gravity why was the very mention of mormons attended by something austere and secret  my name is john shefford i am twentyfour began shefford my family  here a knock on the door interrupted shefford  come in called withers  the door opened and like a shadow nas ta bega slipped in he said something in navajo to the trader  how he said to shefford and extended his hand he was stately but there was no mistaking his friendliness then he sat down before the fire doubled his legs under him after the indian fashion and with dark eyes on the blazing logs seemed to lose himself in meditation   he likes the fire explained withers whenever he comes to kayenta he always visits me like this dont mind him go on with your story  my family were plain people welltodo and very religious went on shefford when i was a boy we moved from the country to a town called beaumont illinois there was a college in beaumont and eventually i was sent to it to study for the ministry i wanted to be but never mind that by the time i was twentytwo i was ready for my career as a clergyman i preached for a year around at different places and then got a church in my home town of beaumont i became exceedingly good friends with a man named venters who had recently come to beaumont he was a singular man his wife was a strange beautiful woman very reserved and she had wonderful dark eyes they had money and were devoted to each other and perfectly happy they owned the finest horses ever seen in illinois and their particular enjoyment seemed to be riding they were always taking long rides it was something worth going far for to see mrs venters on a horse  it was through my own love of horses that i became friendly with venters he and his wife attended my church and as i got to see more of them gradually we grew intimate and it was not until i did get intimate with them that i realized that both seemed to be haunted by the past they were sometimes sad even in their happiness they drifted off into dreams they lived back in another world they seemed to be listening indeed they were a singularly interesting couple and i grew genuinely fond of them by and by they had a little girl whom they named jane the coming of the baby made a change in my friends they were happier and i observed that the haunting shadow did not so often return  venters had spoken of a journey west that he and his wife meant to take some time but after the baby came he never mentioned his wife in connection with the trip i gathered that he felt compelled to go to clear up a mystery or to find somethingi did not make out just what but eventually and it was about a year ago he told me his storythe strangest wildest and most tragic i ever heard i cant tell it all now it is enough to say that fifteen years before he had been a rider for a rich mormon woman named jane withersteen of this village cottonwoods she had adopted a beautiful gentile child named fay larkin her interest in gentiles earned the displeasure of her churchmen and as she was proud there came a breach venters and a gunman named lassiter became involved in her quarrel finally venters took to the cañon here in the wilds he found the strange girl he eventually married for a long time they lived in a wonderful hidden valley the entrance to which was guarded by a huge balancing rock venters got away with the girl but lassiter and jane withersteen and the child fay larkin were driven into the cañon they escaped to the valley where venters had lived lassiter rolled the balancing rock and crashing down the narrow trail it loosened the weathered walls and closed the narrow outlet for ever     iv new friends   shefford ended his narrative out of breath pale and dripping with sweat withers sat leaning forward with an expression of intense interest nas ta begas easy graceful pose had succeeded to one of strained rigidity he seemed a statue of bronze could a few intelligible words shefford wondered have created that strange listening posture  venters got out of utah of course as you know went on shefford he got out knowingas i feel i would have knownthat jane lassiter and little fay larkin were shut up walled up in surprise valley for years venters considered it would not have been safe for him to venture to rescue them he had no fears for their lives they could live in surprise valley but venters always intended to come back with bess and find the valley and his friends no wonder he and bess were haunted however when his wife had the baby that made a difference it meant he had to go alone and he was thinking seriously of starting whenwhen there were developments that made it desirable for me to leave beaumont venterss story haunted me as he had been haunted i dreamed of that wild valleyof little fay larkin grown to womanhoodsuch a woman as bess venters was and the longing to come was great and withershere i am  the trader reached out and gave shefford the grip of a man in whom emotion was powerful but deep and difficult to express  listen to this i wish i could help you life is a queer deal  shefford ive got to trust you over here in the wild cañon country theres a village of mormons sealed wives its in arizona perhaps twenty miles from here and near the utah line when the united states government began to persecute or prosecute the mormons for polygamy the mormons over here in stonebridge took their sealed wives and moved them out of utah just across the line they built houses established a village there im the only gentile who knows about it and i pack supplies every few weeks in to these women there are perhaps fifty women mostly youngsecond or third or fourth wives of mormonssealed wives and i want you to understand that sealed means sealed in all that religion or loyalty can get out of the word there are also some old women and old men in the village but they hardly count and theres a flock of the finest children you ever saw in your life  the idea of the mormons must have been to escape prosecution the law of the government is one wife for each manno more all over utah polygamists have been arrested the mormons are deeply concerned i believe they are a good lawabiding people but this law is a direct blow at their religion in my opinion they cant obey both and therefore they have not altogether given up plural wives perhaps they will some day i have no proof but i believe the mormons of stonebridge pay secret night visits to their sealed wives across the line in the lonely hidden village  now once over in stonebridge i overheard some mormons talking about a girl who was named fay larkin i never forgot the name later i heard the name in this sealedwife village but as i told you i never heard of lassiter or jane withersteen still if mormons had found them i would never have heard of it and deception passthat might be the sagi im not surprised at your rainbowchasing adventure its a great story this fay larkin ive heard of might be your fay larkini almost believe so shefford ill help you find out  yes yesi must know replied shefford oh i hope i pray we can find her butid rather she was deadif shes not still hidden in the valley  naturally youve dreamed yourself into rescuing this lost fay larkin but shefford youre old enough to know life doesnt work out as you want it to one way or another i fear youre in for a bitter disappointment  withers take me to the village  shefford youre liable to get in bad out here said the trader gravely  i couldnt be any more ruined than i am now replied shefford passionately  but theres risk in thisrisk such as you never had persisted withers  ill risk anything  reckon this is a funny deal for a sheeptrader to have on his hands continued withers shefford i like you ive a mind to see you through this its a damn strange story ill tell you whati will help you ill give you a job packing supplies in to the village i meant to turn that over to a mormon cowboyjoe lake the job shall be yours and ill go with you first trip heres my hand on it now shefford im more curious about you than i was before you told your story what ruined you as were to be partners you can tell me now ill keep your secret maybe i can do you good  shefford wanted to confess yet it was hard perhaps had he not been so agitated he would not have answered to impulse but this trader was a mana man of the deserthe would understand  i told you i was a clergyman said shefford in low voice i didnt want to be one but they made me one i did my best i failed i had doubts of religionof the bibleof god as my church believed in them as i grew older thought and study convinced me of the narrowness of religion as my congregation lived it i preached what i believed i alienated them they put me out took my calling from me disgraced me ruined me  so thats all exclaimed withers slowly you didnt believe in the god of the bible well ive been in the desert long enough to know there is a god but probably not the one your church worships  shefford go to the navajo for a faith  shefford had forgotten the presence of nas ta bega and perhaps withers had likewise at this juncture the indian rose to his full height and he folded his arms to stand with the somber pride of a chieftain while his dark inscrutable eyes were riveted upon shefford at that moment he seemed magnificent how infinitely more he seemed than just a common indian who had chanced to befriend a white man the difference was obscure to shefford but he felt that it was there in the navajos mind nas ta begas strange look was not to be interpreted presently he turned and passed from the room  by george cried withers suddenly and he pounded his knee with his fist id forgotten  what ejaculated shefford  why that indian understood every word we said he knows english hes educated well if this doesnt beat me let me tell you about nas ta bega  withers appeared to be recalling something half forgotten  years ago in fiftyseven i think kit carson with his soldiers chased the navajo tribes and rounded them up to be put on reservations but he failed to catch all the members of one tribe they escaped up into wild cañon like the sagi the descendants of these fugitives live there now and are the finest indians on earththe finest because unspoiled by the white man well as i got the story years after carsons roundup one of his soldiers guided some interested travelers in here when they left they took an indian boy with them to educate from what i know of navajos im inclined to think the boy was taken against his parents wish anyway he was taken that boy was nas ta bega the story goes that he was educated somewhere years afterward and perhaps not long before i came in here he returned to his people there have been missionaries and other interested fools who have given indians a white mans education in all the instances i know of these educated indians returned to their tribes repudiating the white mans knowledge habits life and religion i have heard that nas ta bega came back laid down the white mans clothes along with the education and never again showed that he had known either  you have just seen how strangely he acted its almost certain he heard our conversation well it doesnt matter he wont tell he can hardly be made to use an english word besides hes a noble red man if there ever was one he has been a friend in need to me if you stay long out here youll learn something from the indians nas ta bega has befriended you too it seems i thought he showed unusual interest in you  perhaps that was because i saved his sisterwell to be charitable from the rather rude advances of a white man said shefford and he proceeded to tell of the incident that occurred at red lake  willetts exclaimed withers with much the same expression that presbrey had used i never met him but i know about him heswell the indians dont like him much most of the missionaries are good mengood for the indians in a way but sometimes one drifts out here who is bad a bad missionary teaching religion to savages queer isnt it the queerest part is the white peoples blindnessthe blindness of those who send the missionaries well i dare say willetts isnt very good when presbrey said that was willettss way of teaching religion he meant just what he said if willetts drifts over here hell be risking much this you told me explains nas ta begas friendliness toward you and also his bringing his sister glen naspa to live with relatives up in the pass she had been living near red lake  do you mean nas ta bega wants to keep his sister far removed from willetts inquired shefford  i mean that replied withers and i hope hes not too late  later shefford went outdoors to walk and think there was no moon but the stars made light enough to cast his shadow on the ground the dark illimitable expanse of blue sky seemed to be glittering with numberless points of fire the air was cold and still a dreaming silence lay over the land shefford saw and felt all these things and their effect was continuous and remained with him and helped calm him he was conscious of a burden removed from his mind confession of his secret had been like tearing a thorn from his flesh but once done it afforded him relief and a singular realization that out here it did not matter much in a crowd of men all looking at him and judging him by their standards he had been made to suffer here if he were judged at all it would be by what he could do how he sustained himself and helped others  he walked far across the valley toward the low bluffs but they did not seem to get any closer and finally he stopped beside a stone and looked around at the strange horizon and up at the heavens he did not feel utterly aloof from them nor alone in a waste nor a useless atom amid incomprehensible forces something like a loosened mantle fell from about him dropping down at his feet and all at once he was conscious of freedom he did not understand in the least why abasement left him but it was so he had come a long way in bitterness in despair believing himself to be what men had called him the desert and the stars and the wind the silence of the night the loneliness of this vast country where there was room for a thousand citiesthese somehow vaguely yet surely bade him lift his head they withheld their secret but they made a promise the thing which he had been feeling every day and every night was a strange enveloping comfort and it was at this moment that shefford divining whence his help was to come embraced all that wild and speaking nature around and above him and surrendered himself utterly  i am young i am free i have my life to live he said ill be a man ill take what comes let me learn here  when he had spoken out settled once and for ever his attitude toward his future he seemed to be born again wonderfully alive to the influences around him ready to trust what yet remained a mystery  then his thoughts reverted to fay larkin could this girl be known to the mormons it was possible fay larkin was an unusual name deep into sheffords heart had sunk the story venters had told shefford found that he had unconsciously created a like romancehe had been loving a wild and strange and lonely girl like beautiful bess venters it was a shock to learn the truth but as it had been only a dream it could hardly be vital  shefford retraced his steps toward the post halfway back he espied a tall dark figure moving toward him and presently the shape and the step seemed familiar then he recognized nas ta bega soon they were face to face shefford felt that the indian had been trailing him over the sand and that this was to be a significant meeting remembering witherss revelation about the navajo shefford scarcely knew how to approach him now there was no difference to be made out in nas ta begas dark face and inscrutable eyes yet there was a difference to be felt in his presence but the indian did not speak and turned to walk by sheffords side shefford could not long be silent  nas ta bega were you looking for me he asked  you had no gun replied the indian  but for his very low voice his slow speaking of the words shefford would have thought him a white man for shefford there was indeed an instinct in this meeting and he turned to face the navajo  withers told me you had been educated that you came back to the desert that you never showed your training nas ta bega did you understand all i told withers  yes replied the indian  you wont betray me  i am a navajo  nas ta bega you trail meyou say i had no gun shefford wanted to ask this indian if he cared to be the white mans friend but the question was not easy to put and besides seemed unnecessary i am alone and strange in this wild country i must learn  nas ta bega will show you the trails and the waterholes and how to hide from shadd  for moneyfor silver you will do this inquired shefford  shefford felt that the indians silence was a rebuke he remembered witherss singular praise of this red man he realized he must change his idea of indians  nas ta bega i know nothing i feel like a child in the wilderness when i speak it is out of the mouths of those who have taught me i must find a new voice and a new life you heard my story to withers i am an outcast from my own people if you will be my friendbe so  the indian clasped sheffords hand and held it in a response that was more beautiful for its silence so they stood for a moment in the starlight  nas ta bega what did withers mean when he said go to the navajo for a faith asked shefford  he meant the desert is my mother will you go with nas ta bega into the cañon and the mountains  indeed i will  they unclasped hands and turned toward the tradingpost  nas ta bega have you spoken my tongue to any other white man since you returned to your home asked shefford  no  why do youwhy are you different for me  the indian maintained silence  is it because ofof glen naspa inquired shefford  nas ta bega stalked on still silent but shefford divined that although his service to glen naspa would never be forgotten still it was not wholly responsible for the indians subtle sympathy  bi nai the navajo will call his white friend bi naibrother said nas ta bega and he spoke haltingly not as if words were hard to find but strange to speak i was stolen from my mothers hogan and taken to california they kept me ten years in a mission at san bernardino and four years in a school they said my color and my hair were all that was left of the indian in me but they could not see my heart they took fourteen years of my life they wanted to make me a missionary among my own people but the white mans ways and his life and his god are not the indians they never can be  how strangely productive of thought for shefford to hear the indian talk what fatality in this meeting and friendship upon nas ta bega had been forced education training religion that had made him something more and something less than an indian it was something assimilated from the white man which made the indian unhappy and alien in his own homesomething meant to be good for him and his kind that had ruined him for shefford felt the passion and the tragedy of this navajo  bi nai the indian is dying nas ta begas low voice was deep and wonderful with its intensity of feeling the white man robbed the indian of lands and homes drove him into the deserts made him a gaunt and sleepless spiller of blood the blood is all spilled now for the indian is broken but the white man sells him rum and seduces his daughters he will not leave the indian in peace with his own god bi nai the indian is dying              that night shefford lay in his blankets out under the open sky and the stars the earth had never meant much to him and now it was a bed he had preached of the heavens but until now had never studied them an indian slept beside him and not until the gray of morning had blotted out the starlight did shefford close his eyes              with break of the next day came full varied and stirring incidents to shefford he was strong though unskilled at most kinds of outdoor tasks withers had work for ten men if they could have been found shefford dug and packed and lifted till he was so sore and tired that rest was a blessing  he never succeeded in getting on a friendly footing with the mormon whisner though he kept up his agreeable and kindly advances he listened to the traders wife as she told him about the indians and what he learned he did not forget and his wonder and respect increased in proportion to his knowledge  one day there rode into kayenta the mormon for whom withers had been waiting his name was joe lake he appeared young and slipped off his superb bay with a grace and activity that were astounding in one of his huge bulk he had a still smooth face with the color of red bronze and the expression of a cherub big soft dark eyes and a winning smile he was surprisingly different from whisner or any mormon character that shefford had naturally conceived his costume was that of the cowboy on active service and he packed a gun at his hip the handshake he gave shefford was an ordeal for that young man and left him with his whole right side momentarily benumbed  i sure am glad to meet you he said in a lazy mild voice and he was taking friendly stock of shefford when the bay mustang reached with vicious muzzle to bite at him lake gave a jerk on the bridle that almost brought the mustang to his knees he reared then snorted and came down to plant his forefeet wide apart and watched his master with defiant eyes this mustang was the finest horse shefford had ever seen he appeared quite large for his species was almost red in color had a racy and powerful build and a fine thoroughbred head with dark fiery eyes he did not look mean but he had spirit  navvy youve sure got bad manners said lake shaking the mustangs bridle he spoke as if he were chiding a refractory little boy didnt i break you bettern that whats this gentleman goin to think of you tryin to bite my ear off  lake had arrived about the middle of the forenoon and withers announced his intention of packing at once for the trip indians were sent out on the ranges to drive in burros and mustangs shefford had his thrilling expectancy somewhat chilled by what he considered must have been lakes reception of the traders plan lake seemed to oppose him and evidently it took vehemence and argument on witherss part to make the mormon tractable but withers won him over and then he called shefford to his side  you fellows got to be good friends he said youll have charge of my packtrains nas ta bega wants to go with you ill feel safer about my supplies and stock than ive ever been joe ill back this stranger for all im worth hes square and shefford joe lake is a mormon of the younger generation i want to start you right you can trust him as you trust me hes white clean through and hes the best horsewrangler in utah  it was lake who first offered his hand and shefford made haste to meet it with his own neither of them spoke shefford intuitively felt an alteration in lakes regard or at least a singular increase of interest lake had been told that shefford had been a clergyman was now a wanderer without any religion again it seemed to shefford that he owed a forming of friendship to this singular fact and it hurt him but strangely it came to him that he had taken a liking to a mormon  about one oclock the packtrain left kayenta nas ta bega led the way up the slope following him climbed half a dozen patient plodding heavily laden burros withers came next and he turned in his saddle to wave goodby to his wife joe lake appeared to be busy keeping a red mule and a wild gray mustang and a couple of restive blacks in the trail shefford brought up in the rear  his mount was a beautiful black mustang with three white feet a white spot on his nose and a mane that swept to his knees his names nackyal withers had said it means two bits or twentyfive cents he aint worth more to look at nackyal had pleased shefford very much indeed but once upon his back he grew dubious the mustang acted queer he actually looked back at shefford and it was a look of speculation and disdain shefford took exception to nackyals manner and to his reluctance to go and especially to a habit the mustang had of turning off the trail to the left shefford had managed some rather spirited horses back in illinois and though he was willing and eager to learn all over again he did not enjoy the prospect of lake and withers seeing this black mustang make a novice of him and he guessed that was just what nackyal intended to do however once up over the hill with kayenta out of sight nackyal trotted along fairly well needing only now and then to be pulled back from his strange swinging to the left off the trail  the packtrain traveled steadily and soon crossed the upland plain to descend into the valley again shefford saw the jagged red peaks with an emotion he could not name the cañon between them were purple in the shadows the great walls and slopes brightened to red and the tips were gold in the sun shefford forgot all about his mustang and the trail  suddenly with a pound of hoofs nackyal seemed to rise he leaped sidewise out of the trail came down stifflegged then shefford shot out of the saddle he landed so hard that he was stunned for an instant sitting up he saw the mustang bent down eyes and ears showing fight and his forefeet spread he appeared to be looking at something in the trail shefford got up and soon saw what had been the trouble a long crooked stick rather thick and black and yellow lay in the trail and any mustang looking for an excuse to jump might have mistaken it for a rattlesnake nackyal appeared disposed to be satisfied and gave shefford no trouble in mounting the incident increased sheffords dubiousness these arizona mustangs were unknown quantities  thereafter shefford had an eye for the trail rather than the scenery and this continued till the packtrain entered the mouth of the sagi then those wonderful lofty cliffs with their peaks and towers and spires loomed so close and so beautiful that he did not care if nackyal did throw him along here however the mustang behaved well and presently shefford decided that if it had been otherwise he would have walked the trail suddenly stood on end and led down into the deep wash where some days before he had seen the stream of reddish water this day there appeared to be less water and it was not so red nackyal sank deep as he took short and careful steps down the burros and other mustangs were drinking and nackyal followed suit the indian with a hand clutching his mustangs mane rode up a steep sandy slope on the other side that shefford would not have believed any horse could climb the burros plodded up and over the rim with withers calling to them joe lake swung his rope and cracked the flanks of the gray mare and the red mule and the way the two kicked was a revelation and a warning to shefford when his turn came to climb the trail he got off and walked an action that nackyal appeared fully to appreciate  from the head of this wash the trail wound away up the widening cañon through greasewood flats and over grassy levels and across sandy stretches the looming walls made the valley look narrow yet it must have been half a mile wide the slopes under the cliffs were dotted with huge stones and cedartrees there were deep indentations in the walls running back to form box cañon choked with green of cedar and spruce and pinyon these notches haunted shefford and he was ever on the lookout for more of them  withers came back to ride just in advance and began to talk  reckon this sagi cañon is your deception pass he said its sure a queer hole ive been lost more than once hunting mustangs in here ive an idea nas ta bega knows all this country he just pointed out a cliffdwelling to me see it there way up in that cave of the wall  shefford saw a steep rough slope leading up to a bulge of the cliff and finally he made out strange little houses with dark eyelike windows he wanted to climb up there withers called his attention to more caves with what he believed were the ruins of cliffdwellings and as they rode along the trader showed him remarkable formations of rock where the elements were slowly hollowing out a bridge they came presently to a region of intersecting cañon and here the breaking of the trail up and down the deep washes took withers back to his task with the burros and gave shefford more concern than he liked with nackyal the mustang grew unruly and was continually turning to the left sometimes he tried to climb the steep slope he had to be pulled hard away from the opening cañon on the left it seemed strange to shefford that the mustang never swerved to the right this habit of nackyals and the increasing caution needed on the trail took all of sheffords attention when he dismounted however he had a chance to look around and more and more he was amazed at the increasing proportions and wildness of the sagi  he came at length to a place where a fallen tree blocked the trail all of the rest of the packtrain had jumped the log but nackyal balked shefford dismounted pulled the bridle over the mustangs head and tried to lead him nackyal however refused to budge whereupon shefford got a stick and remounting he gave the balky mustang a cut across the flank then something violent happened shefford received a sudden propelling jolt and then he was rising into the air and then falling before he alighted he had a clear image of nackyal in the air above him bent double and seemingly possessed of devils then shefford hit the ground with no light thud he was thoroughly angry when he got dizzily upon his feet but he was not quick enough to catch the mustang nackyal leaped easily over the log and went on ahead dragging his bridle shefford hurried after him and the faster he went just by so much the cunning nackyal accelerated his gait as the packtrain was out of sight somewhere ahead shefford could not call to his companions to halt his mount so he gave up trying and walked on now with free and growing appreciation of his surroundings  the afternoon had waned the sun blazed low in the west in a notch of the cañon ramparts and one wall was darkening into purple shadow while the other shone through a golden haze it was a weird wild world to shefford and every few strides he caught his breath and tried to realize actuality was not a dream  nackyal kept about a hundred paces to the fore and ever and anon he looked back to see how his new master was progressing he varied these occasions by reaching down and nipping a tuft of grass evidently he was too intelligent to go on fast enough to be caught by withers also he kept continually looking up the slope to the left as if seeking a way to climb out of the valley in that direction shefford thought it was well the trail lay at the foot of a steep slope that ran up to unbroken bluffs  the sun set and the cañon lost its red and its gold and deepened its purple shefford calculated he had walked five miles and though he did not mind the effort he would rather have ridden nackyal into camp he mounted a cedar ridge crossed some sandy washes turned a corner of bold wall to enter a wide green level the mustangs were rolling and snorting he heard the bray of a burro a bright blaze of campfire greeted him and the dark figure of the indian approached to intercept and catch nackyal when he stalked into camp withers wore a beaming smile and joe lake who was on his knees making biscuit dough in a pan stopped proceedings and drawled  reckon nackyal bucked you off  bucked was that it well he separated himself from me in a new and somewhat painful mannerto me  sure i saw that in his eye replied lake and withers laughed with him  nackyal never was well broke he said but hes a good mustang nothing like joes navvy or that gray mare dynamite all this indian stock will buck on a man once in a while  ill take the bucking along with the rest said shefford both men liked his reply and the indian smiled for the first time  soon they all sat round a spread tarpaulin and ate like wolves after supper came the rest and talk before the campfire joe lake was droll he said the most serious things in a way to make shefford wonder if he was not joking withers talked about the cañon the indians the mustangs the scorpions running out of the heated sand and to shefford it was all like a fascinating book nas ta bega smoked in silence his brooding eyes upon the fire     v on the trail   shefford was awakened next morning by a sound he had never heard beforethe plunging of hobbled horses on soft turf it was clear daylight with a ruddy color in the sky and a tinge of red along the cañon rim he saw withers lake and the indian driving the mustangs toward camp  the burros appeared lazy yet willing but the mustangs and the mule withers called red and the gray mare dynamite were determined not to be driven into camp it was astonishing how much action they had how much ground they could cover with their forefeet hobbled together they were exceedingly skilful they lifted both forefeet at once and then plunged and they all went in different directions nas ta bega darted in here and there to head off escape  shefford pulled on his boots and went out to help he got too close to the gray mare and warned by a yell from withers he jumped back just in time to avoid her vicious heels then shefford turned his attention to nackyal and chased him all over the flat in a futile effort to catch him nas ta bega came to sheffords assistance and put a rope over nackyals head  dont ever get behind one of these mustangs said withers warningly as shefford came up you might be killed eat your bite now well soon be out of here  shefford had been late in awakening the others had breakfasted he found eating somewhat difficult in the excitement that ensued nas ta bega held ropes which were round the necks of red and dynamite the mule showed his cunning and always appeared to present his heels to withers who tried to approach him with a packsaddle the patience of the trader was a revelation to shefford and at length red was cornered by the three men the packsaddle was strapped on and then the packs red promptly bucked the packs off and the work had to be done over again then red dropped his long ears and seemed ready to be tractable  when shefford turned his attention to dynamite he decided that this was his first sight of a wild horse the gray mare had fiery eyes that rolled and showed the white she jumped straight up screamed pawed bit and then plunged down to shoot her hind hoofs into the air as high as her head had been she was amazingly agile and she seemed mad to kill something she dragged the indian about and when joe lake got a rope on her hind foot she dragged them both they lashed her with the ends of the lassoes which action only made her kick harder she plunged into camp drove shefford flying for his life knocked down two of the burros and played havoc with the unstrapped packs withers ran to the assistance of lake and the two of them hauled back with all their strength and weight they were both powerful and heavy men dynamite circled round and finally after kicking the campfire to bits fell down on her haunches in the hot embers lethersetthere panted withers and joe lake shouted burn up you durn coyote both men appeared delighted that she had brought upon herself just punishment dynamite sat in the remains of the fire long enough to get burnt and then she got up and meekly allowed withers to throw a tarpaulin and a roll of blankets over her and tie them fast  lake and withers were sweating freely when this job was finished  say is that a usual mornings task with the packanimals asked shefford  theyre all pretty decent today except dynamite replied withers shes got to be worked out  shefford felt both amusement and consternation the sun was just rising over the ramparts of the cañon and he had already seen more difficult and dangerous work accomplished than half a dozen men of his type could do in a whole day he liked the outlook of his new duty as witherss assistant but he felt helplessly inefficient still all he needed was experience he passed over what he anticipated would be pain and perilthe cost was of no moment  soon the packtrain was on the move with the indian leading this morning nackyal began his strange swinging off to the left precisely as he had done the day before it got to be annoying to shefford and he lost patience with the mustang and jerked him sharply round this however had no great effect upon nackyal  as the train headed straight up the cañon joe lake dropped back to ride beside shefford the mormon had been amiable and friendly  flock of deer up that draw he said pointing up a narrow side cañon  shefford gazed to see a halfdozen small brown longeared objects very like burros watching the packtrain pass  are they deer he asked delightedly  sure are replied joe sincerely get down and shoot one theres a rifle in your saddlesheath  shefford had already discovered that he had been armed this morning a matter which had caused him reflection these animals certainly looked like deer he had seen a few deer though not in their native wild haunts and he experienced the thrill of the hunter dismounting he drew the rifle out of the sheath and started toward the little cañon  hyar where you going with that gun yelled withers thats a bunch of burros joes up to his old tricks shefford look out for joe  rather sheepishly shefford returned to his mustang and sheathed the rifle and then took a long look at the animals up the draw they resembled deer but upon second glance they surely were burros  durn me now if i didnt think they sure were deer exclaimed joe he appeared absolutely sincere and innocent shefford hardly knew how to take this likable mormon but vowed he would be on his guard in the future  nas ta bega soon led the packtrain toward the left wall of the cañon and evidently intended to scale it shefford could not see any trail and the wall appeared steep and insurmountable but upon nearing the cliff he saw a narrow broken trail leading zigzag up over smooth rock weathered slope and through cracks  spread out and careful now yelled withers  the need of both advices soon became manifest to shefford the burros started stones rolling making danger for those below shefford dismounted and led nackyal and turned aside many a rolling rock the indian and the burros with the red mule leading climbed steadily but the mustangs had trouble joes spirited bay had to be coaxed to face the ascent nackyal balked at every difficult step and dynamite slipped on a flat slant of rock and slid down forty feet withers and lake with ropes hauled the mare out of the dangerous position shefford who brought up the rear saw all the action and it was exciting but his pleasure in the climb was spoiled by sight of blood and hair on the stones the ascent was crooked steep and long and when shefford reached the top of the wall he was glad to rest it made him gasp to look down and see what he had surmounted the cañon floor green and level lay a thousand feet below and the wild burros which had followed on the trail looked like rabbits  shefford mounted presently and rode out upon a wide smooth trail leading into a cedar forest there were bunches of gray sage in the open places the air was cool and crisp laden with a sweet fragrance he saw lake and withers bobbing along now on one side of the trail now on the other and they kept to a steady trot occasionally the indian and his brightred saddleblanket showed in an opening of the cedars  it was level country and there was nothing for shefford to see except cedar and sage an outcropping of red rock in places and the winding trail mockingbirds made melody everywhere shefford seemed full of a strange pleasure and the hours flew by nackyal still wanted to be everlastingly turning off the trail and moreover now he wanted to go faster he was eager restless dissatisfied  at noon the packtrain descended into a deep draw well covered with cedar and sage there was plenty of grass and shade but no water shefford was surprised to see that every pack was removed however the roll of blankets was left on dynamite  the men made a fire and began to cook a noonday meal shefford tired and warm sat in a shady spot and watched he had become all eyes he had almost forgotten fay larkin he had forgotten his trouble and the present seemed sweet and full presently his ears were filled by a pattering roar and looking up the draw he saw two streams of sheep and goats coming down soon an indian shepherd appeared riding a fine mustang a creamcolored colt bounded along behind and presently a shaggy dog came in sight the indian dismounted at the camp and his flock spread by in two white and black streams the dog went with them withers and joe shook hands with the indian whom joe called navvy and shefford lost no time in doing likewise then nas ta bega came in and he and the navajo talked when the meal was ready all of them sat down round the canvas the shepherd did not tie his horse  presently shefford noticed that nackyal had returned to camp and was acting strangely evidently he was attracted by the indians mustang or the creamcolored colt at any rate nackyal hung around tossed his head whinnied in a low nervous manner and looked strangely eager and wild shefford was at first amused then curious nackyal approached too close to the mother of the colt and she gave him a sounding kick in the ribs nackyal uttered a plaintive snort and backed away to stand crestfallen with all his eagerness and fire vanished  nas ta bega pointed to the mustang and said something in his own tongue then withers addressed the visiting indian and they exchanged some words whereupon the trader turned to shefford  i bought nackyal from this indian three years ago this mare is nackyals mother he was born over here to the south thats why he always swung left off the trail he wanted to go home just now he recognized his mother and she whaled away and gave him a whack for his pains shes got a colt now and probably didnt recognize nackyal but hes brokenhearted  the trader laughed and joe said you cant tell what these durn mustangs will do shefford felt sorry for nackyal and when it came time to saddle him again found him easier to handle than ever before nackyal stood with head down brokenspirited  shefford was the first to ride up out of the draw and once upon the top of the ridge he halted to gaze wideeyed and entranced a rolling endless plain sloped down beneath him and led him on to a distant roundtopped mountain to the right a red cañon opened its jagged jaws and away to the north rose a whorled and strange sea of curved ridges crags and domes  nas ta bega rode up then leading the packtrain  bi nai that is natsisan he said pointing to the mountain navajo mountain and there in the north are the cañon  shefford followed the indian down the trail and soon lost sight of that wide greenandred wilderness nas ta bega turned at an intersecting trail rode down into the cañon and climbed out on the other side shefford got a glimpse now and then of the black dome of the mountain but for the most part the distant points of the country were hidden they crossed many trails and went up and down the sides of many shallow cañon troops of wild mustangs whistled at them stood on ridgetops to watch and then dashed away with manes and tails flying  withers rode forward presently and halted the packtrain he had some conversation with nas ta bega whereupon the indian turned his horse and trotted back to disappear in the cedars  im some worried explained withers joe thinks he saw a bunch of horsemen trailing us my eyes are bad and i cant see far the indian will find out i took a roundabout way to reach the village because im always dodging shadd  this communication lent an added zest to the journey shefford could hardly believe the truth that his eyes and his ears brought to his consciousness he turned in behind withers and rode down the rough trail helping the mustang all in his power it occurred to him that nackyal had been entirely different since that meeting with his mother in the draw he turned no more off the trail he answered readily to the rein he did not look afar from every ridge shefford conceived a liking for the mustang  withers turned sidewise in his saddle and let his mustang pick the way  another time well go up round the base of the mountain where you can look down on the grandest scene in the world said he two hundred miles of windworn rock all smooth and bare without a single straight linecañon caves bridgesthe most wonderful country in the world even the indians havent explored it its haunted for them and they have strange gods the navajos will hunt on this side of the mountain but not on the other that north side is consecrated ground my wife has long been trying to get the navajos to tell her the secret of nonnezoshe nonnezoshe means rainbow bridge the indians worship it but as far as she can find out only a few have ever seen it i imagine itd be worth some trouble  maybe thats the bridge venters talked aboutthe one overarching the entrance to surprise valley said shefford  it might be replied the trader youve got a good chance of finding out nas ta bega is the man you stick to that indian  well we start down here into this cañon and we go down some i reckon in half an hour youll see sagolilies and indian paintbrush and vermilion cactus              about the middle of the afternoon the packtrain and its drivers arrived at the hidden mormon village nas ta bega had not returned from his scout back along the trail  sheffords sensibilities had all been overstrained but he had left in him enthusiasm and appreciation that made the situation of this village a fairyland it was a valley a cañon floor so long that he could not see the end and perhaps a quarter of a mile wide the air was hot still and sweetly odorous of unfamiliar flowers piñon and cedar trees surrounded the little log and stone houses and along the walls of the cañon stood sharppointed darkgreen sprucetrees these walls were singular of shape and color they were not imposing in height but they waved like the long undulating swell of a sea every foot of surface was perfectly smooth and the long curved lines of darker tinge that streaked the red followed the rounded line of the slope at the top far above yet overhanging were great yellow crags and peaks and between these still higher showed the pinefringed slope of navajo mountain with snow in the sheltered places and glistening streams like silver threads running down  all this shefford noticed as he entered the valley from round a corner of wall upon nearer view he saw and heard a host of children who looking up to see the intruders scattered like frightened quail long gray grass covered the ground and here and there wide smooth paths had been worn a swift and murmuring brook ran through the middle of the valley and its banks were bordered with flowers  withers led the way to one side near the wall where a clump of cedartrees and a dark swift spring boiling out of the rocks and banks of amber moss with purple blossoms made a beautiful camp site here the mustangs were unsaddled and turned loose without hobbles it was certainly unlikely that they would leave such a spot some of the burros were unpacked and the others withers drove off into the village  sures pretty nice said joe wiping his sweaty face ill never want to leave it suits me to lie on this moss take a drink of that spring  shefford complied with alacrity and found the water cool and sweet and he seemed to feel it all through him then he returned to the mossy bank he did not reply to joe in fact all his faculties were absorbed in watching and feeling and he lay there long after joe went off to the village the murmur of water the hum of bees the songs of strange birds the sweet warm air the dreamy summer somnolence of the valleyall these added drowsiness to sheffords weary lassitude and he fell asleep when he awoke nas ta bega was sitting near him and joe was busy near a campfire  hello nas ta bega said shefford was there any one trailing us  the navajo nodded  joe raised his head and with forceful brevity said shadd  shadd echoed shefford remembering the dark sinister face of his visitor that night in the sagi joe is it serioushis trailing us  well i dont know how durn serious it is but im scared to death replied lake he and his gang will hold us up somewhere on the way home  shefford regarded joe with both concern and doubt joes words were at variance with his looks  say pard can you shoot a rifle queried joe  yes im a fair shot at targets  the mormon nodded his head as if pleased thats good these outlaws are all poor shots with a rifle so m i but i can handle a sixshooter i reckon well make shadd sweat if he pushes us  withers returned driving the burros all of which had been unpacked down to the saddles two graybearded men accompanied him one of them appeared to be very old and venerable and walked with a stick the other had a sadlined face and kind mild blue eyes shefford observed that lake seemed unusually respectful withers introduced these mormons merely as smith and henninger they were very cordial and pleasant in their greetings to shefford presently another somewhat younger man joined the group a stalwart jovial fellow with ruddy face there was certainly no mistaking his kindly welcome as he shook sheffords hand his name was beal the three stood round the campfire for a while evidently glad of the presence of fellowmen and to hear news from the outside finally they went away taking joe with them withers took up the task of getting supper where joe had been made to leave it  shefford listen he said presently as he knelt before the fire i told them right out that youd been a gentile clergymanthat youd gone back on your religion it impressed them and youve been well received ill tell the same thing over at stonebridge youll get in right of course i dont expect theyll make a mormon of you but theyll try to meanwhile you can be square and friendly all the time youre trying to find your fay larkin tomorrow youll meet some of the women theyre good souls but like any women crazy for news think what it is to be shut up in here between these walls  withers im intensely interested replied shefford and excited too shall we stay here long  ill stay a couple of days then go to stonebridge with joe hell come back here and when you both feel like leaving and if nas ta bega thinks it safe youll take a trail over to some indian hogans and pack me out a load of skins and blankets my boy youve all the time there is and i wish you luck this isnt a bad place to loaf i always get sentimental over here maybe its the women some of them are pretty and one of themshefford they call her the sago lily her first name is mary im told dont know her last name shes lovely and ill bet you forget fay larkin in a flash onlybe careful you drop in here with rather peculiar credentials so to speakas my helper and as a man with no religion youll not only be fully trusted but youll be welcome to these lonely women so be careful remember its my secret belief they are sealed wives and are visited occasionally at night by their husbands i dont know this but i believe it and youre not supposed to dream of that  how many men in the village asked shefford  three you met them  have they wives asked shefford curiously  wives well i guess but only one each that i know of joe lake is the only unmarried mormon ive met  and no menstrangers cowboys outlawsever come to this village  except to indians it seems to be a secret so far replied the trader earnestly but it cant be kept secret ive said that time after time over in stonebridge with mormons its sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof  whatll happen when outsiders do learn and ride in here  therell be troublemaybe bloodshed mormon women are absolutely good but theyre human and want and need a little life and strange to say mormon men are pigheadedly jealous why if some of the cowboys i knew in durango would ride over here thered simply be hell but thats a long way and probably this village will be deserted before news of it ever reaches colorado theres more danger of shadd and his gang coming in shadds half piute he must know of this place and hes got some white outlaws in his gang come on grubs ready and im too hungry to talk  later when shadows began to gather in the valley and the lofty peaks above were gold in the sunset glow withers left camp to look after the straying mustangs and shefford strolled to and fro under the cedars the lights and shades in the sagi that first night had moved him to enthusiastic watchfulness but here they were so weird and beautiful that he was enraptured he actually saw great shafts of gold and shadows of purple streaming from the peaks down into the valley it was day on the heights and twilight in the valley the swiftly changing colors were like rainbows  while he strolled up and down several women came to the spring and filled their buckets they wore shawls or hoods and their garments were somber but nevertheless they appeared to have youth and comeliness they saw him looked at him curiously and then without speaking went back on the welltrodden path presently down the path appeared a womana girl in lighter garb it was almost white she was shapely and walked with free graceful step reminding him of the indian girl glen naspa this one wore a hood shaped like a huge sunbonnet and it concealed her face she carried a bucket when she reached the spring and went down the few stone steps shefford saw that she did not have on shoes as she braced herself to lift the bucket her bare foot clung to the mossy stone it was a strong sinewy beautiful foot instinct with youth he was curious enough he thought but the awakening artist in him made him more so she dragged at the full bucket and had difficulty in lifting it out of the hole shefford strode forward and took the buckethandle from her  wont you let me help you he said lifting the bucket indeedits very heavy  ohthank you she said without raising her head her voice seemed singularly young and sweet he had not heard a voice like it she moved down the path and he walked beside her he felt embarrassed yet more curious than ever he wanted to say something to turn and look at her but he kept on for a dozen paces without making up his mind  finally he said do you really carry this heavy bucket why it makes my arm ache  twice every daymorning and evening she replied im very strong  then he stole a look out of the corner of his eye and seeing that her face was hidden from him by the hood he turned to observe her at better advantage a long braid of hair hung down her back in the twilight it gleamed dull gold she came up to his shoulder the sleeve nearest him was rolled up to her elbow revealing a fine round arm her hand like her foot was brown strong and well shaped it was a hand that had been developed by labor she was fullbosomed yet slender and she walked with a free stride that made shefford admire and wonder  they passed several of the little stone and log houses and women greeted them as they went by and children peered shyly from the doors he kept trying to think of something to say and failing in that determined to have one good look under the hood before he left her  you walk lame she said solicitously let me carry the bucket nowplease my house is near  am i lame guess so a little he replied it was a hard ride for me but ill carry the bucket just the same  they went on under some pinyontrees down a path to a little house identical with the others except that it had a stone porch shefford smelled fragrant woodsmoke and saw a column curling from the low flat stone chimney then he set the bucket down on the porch thank you mr shefford she said you know my name he asked yes mr withers spoke to my nearest neighbor and she told me  oh i see and you  he did not go on and she did not reply when she stepped upon the porch and turned he was able to see under the hood the face there was in shadow and for that very reason he answered to ungovernable impulse and took a step closer to her dark grave sad eyes looked down at him and he felt as if he could never draw his own glance away he seemed not to see the rest of her face and yet felt that it was lovely then a downward movement of the hood hid from him the strange eyes and the shadowy loveliness  ii beg your pardon he said quickly drawing back im rude  withers told me about a girl he calledhe said looked like a sagolily thats no excuse to stare under your hood but ii was curious i wondered if  he hesitated realizing how foolish his talk was she stood a moment probably watching him but he could not be sure for her face was hidden  they call me that she said but my name is mary  marywhat he asked  just mary she said simply good night  he did not say good night and could not have told why she took up the bucket and went into the dark house shefford hurried away into the gathering darkness     vi in the hidden valley   shefford had hardly seen her face yet he was more interested in a woman than he had ever been before still he reflected as he returned to camp he had been under a long strain he was unduly excited by this new and adventurous life and these with the mystery of this village were perhaps accountable for a state of mind that could not last  he rolled in his blankets on the soft bed of moss and he saw the stars through the needlelike fringe of the pinyons it seemed impossible to fall asleep the two domed peaks split the sky and back of them looming dark and shadowy rose the mountain there was something cold austere and majestic in their lofty presence and they made him feel alone yet not alone he raised himself to see the quiet forms of withers and nas ta bega prone in the starlight and their slow deep breathing was that of tired men a bell on a mustang rang somewhere off in the valley and gave out a low strange reverberating echo from wall to wall when it ceased a silence set in that was deader than any silence he had ever felt but gradually he became aware of the low murmur of the brook for the rest there was no sound of wind no bark of dog or yelp of coyote no sound of voice in the village  he tried to sleep but instead thought of this girl who was called the sago lily he recalled everything incident to their meeting and the walk to her home her swift free step her graceful poise her shapely formthe long braid of hair dull gold in the twilight the beautiful bare foot and the strong round armthese he thought of and recalled vividly but of her face he had no idea except the shadowy haunting loveliness and that grew more and more difficult to remember the tone of her voice and what she had saidhow the one had thrilled him and the other mystified it was her voice that had most attracted him there was something in it besides musicwhat he could not tellsadness depth something like that in nas ta begas beauty springing from disuse but this seemed absurd why should he imagine her voice one that had not been used as freely as any other womans she was a mormon very likely almost surely she was a sealed wife his interest too was absurd and he tried to throw it off or imagine it one he might have felt in any other of these strange women of the hidden village  but sheffords intelligence and his good sense which became operative when he was fully roused and set the situation clearly before his eyes had no effect upon his deeper mystic and primitive feelings he saw the truth and he felt something that he could not name he would not be a fool but there was no harm in dreaming and unquestionably beyond all doubt the dream and the romance that had lured him to the wilderness were here hanging over him like the shadows of the great peaks his heart swelled with emotion when he thought of how the black and incessant despair of the past was gone so he embraced any attraction that made him forget and think and feel some instinct stronger than intelligence bade him drift              joes rolling voice awoke him next morning and he rose with a singular zest when or where in his life had he awakened in such a beautiful place almost he understood why venters and bess had been haunted by memories of surprise valley the morning was clear cool sweet the peaks were dim and soft in rosy cloud shafts of golden sunlight shot down into the purple shadows mockingbirds were singing his body was sore and tired from the unaccustomed travel but his heart was full happy his spirit wanted to run and he knew there was something out there waiting to meet it the indian and the trader and the mormon all meant more to him this morning he had grown a little overnight nas ta begas deep bi nai rang in his ears and the smiles of withers and joe were greetings he had friends he had work and there was rich strange and helpful life to live there was even a difference in the mustang nackyal he came readily he did not look wild he had a friendly eye and shefford liked him more  what is there to do asked shefford feeling equal to a hundred tasks  no work replied the trader with a laugh and he drew shefford aside im in no hurry i like it here and joe never wants to leave today you can meet the women make yourself popular ive already made you that these women are most all young and lonesome talk to them make them like you then some day you may be safe to ask questions last night i wanted to ask old mother smith if she ever heard the name fay larkin but i thought better of it if theres a girl here or at stonebridge of that name well learn it if theres mystery wed better go slow mormons are hell on secret and mystery and to pry into their affairs is to queer yourself my advice isjust be as nice as you can be and let things happen  fay larkin all in a night shefford had forgotten her why he pondered over the matter and then the old thrill the old desire came back  shefford what do you think nas ta bega said to me last night asked withers in lower voice  havent any idea replied shefford curiously  we were sitting beside the fire i saw you walking under the cedars you seemed thoughtful that keen indian watched you and he said to me in navajo bi nai has lost his god he has come far to find a wife nas ta bega is his brother he meant hell find both god and wife for you i dont know about that but i say take the indian as he thinks he isyour brother long before i knew nas ta bega well my wife used to tell me about him hes a sage and a poetthe very spirit of this desert hes worth cultivating for his own sake but moreremember if fay larkin is still shut in that valley the navajo will find her for you  i shall take nas ta bega as my brotherand be proud replied shefford  theres another thing do you intend to confide in joe  i hadnt thought of that  well it might be a good plan but wait until you know him better and he knows you hes ready to fight for you now hes taken your trouble to heart you wouldnt think joe is deeply religious yet he is he may never breathe a word about religion to you now shefford go ahead youve struck a trail its rough but itll make a man of you itll lead somewhere  im singularly fortunateiwho had lost all friends withers i am grateful ill prove it ill show  witherss upheld hand checked further speech and shefford realized that beneath the rough exterior of this desert trader there was fine feeling these men of crude toil and wild surroundings were beginning to loom up large in sheffords mind  the day began leisurely the men were yet at breakfast when the women of the village began to come one by one to the spring joe lake made friendly and joking remarks to each and as each one passed on down the path he poised a biscuit in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other and with his head cocked sidewise like an owl he said reckon ive got to get me a woman like her  shefford saw and heard yet he was all the time half unconsciously watching with strange eagerness for a white figure to appear at last he saw herthe same girl with the hood the same swift step a little shock or quiver passed over him and at the moment all that was explicable about it was something associated with regret  joe lake whistled and stared  i havent met her he muttered  thats the sago lily said withers  reckon im going to carry that bucket went on joe  and queer yourself with all the other women whove been to the spring dont do it joe advised the trader  but her buckets bigger protested joe weakly  thats true but you ought to know mormons if shed come first all right as she didntwhy dont single her out  joe kept his seat the girl came to the spring a low good morning came from under the hood then she filled her bucket and started home shefford observed that this time she wore moccasins and she carried the heavy bucket with ease when she disappeared he had again the vague inexplicable sensation of regret  joe lake breathed heavily reckon ive got to get me a woman like her he said but the former jocose tone was lacking and he appeared thoughtful              withers first took shefford to the building used for a school it was somewhat larger than the other houses had only one room with two doors and several windows it was full of children of all sizes and ages sitting on rude board benches  there were half a hundred of them sturdy healthy rosy boys and girls clad in homemade garments the young woman teacher was as embarrassed as her pupils were shy and the visitors withdrew without having heard a word of lessons  withers then called upon smith henninger and beal and their wives shefford found himself cordially received and what little he did say showed him how he would be listened to when he cared to talk these folk were plain and kindly and he found that there was nothing about them to dislike the men appeared mild and quiet and when not conversing seemed austere the repose of the women was only on the surface underneath he felt their intensity especially in many of the younger women whom he met in the succeeding hour did he feel this power of restrained emotion this surprised him as did also the fact that almost every one of them was attractive and some of them were exceedingly pretty he became so interested in them all as a whole that he could not individualize one they were as widely different in appearance and temperament as women of any other class but it seemed to shefford that one common trait united themand it was a strange checked yearning for something that he could not discover was it happiness they certainly seemed to be happy far more so than those millions of women who were chasing phantoms were they really sealed wives as withers believed and was this unnatural wifehood responsible for the strange intensity at any rate he returned to camp with the conviction that he had stumbled upon a remarkable situation  he had been told the last names of only three women and their husbands were in the village the names of the others were ruth rebecca joanhe could not recall them all they were the mothers of these beautiful children the fathers as far as he was concerned were as intangible as myths shefford was an educated clergyman a man of the world and as such knew women in his way mormons might be strange and different yet the fundamental truth was that all over the world mothers of children were wives there was a relation between wife and mother that did not need to be named to be felt and he divined from this that whatever the situation of these lonely and hidden women they knew themselves to be wives shefford absolutely satisfied himself on that score if they were miserable they certainly did not show it and the question came to him how just was the criticism of uninformed men his judgment of mormons had been established by what he had heard and read rather than what he knew he wanted now to have an open mind he had studied the totemism and exogamy of the primitive races and here was his opportunity to understand polygamy one wife for one manthat was the law mormons broke it openly gentiles broke it secretly mormons acknowledged all their wives and protected their children gentiles acknowledged one wife only unquestionably the mormons were wrong but were not the gentiles still more wrong                         the following day joe lake appeared reluctant to start for stonebridge with withers  joe youd better come along said the trader dryly i reckon youve seen a little too much of the sago lily  lake offered no reply but it was evident from his sober face that withers had not hit short of the mark withers rode off with a parting word to shefford and finally joe somberly mounted his bay and trotted down the valley as nas ta bega had gone off somewhere to visit indians shefford was left alone  he went into the village and made himself useful and agreeable he made friends with the children and he talked to the women until he was hoarse their ignorance of the world was a spur to him and never in his life had he had such an attentive audience and as he showed no curiosity asked no difficult questions gradually what reserve he had noted wore away and the end of the day saw him on a footing with them that withers had predicted  by the time several like days had passed it seemed from the interest and friendliness of these women that he might have lived long among them he was possessed of wit and eloquence and information which he freely gave and not with selfish motive he liked these women he liked to see the somber shade pass from their faces to see them brighten he had met the girl mary at the spring and along the path but he had not yet seen her face he was always looking for her hoping to meet her and confessed to himself that the best of the day for him were the morning and evening visits she made to the spring nevertheless for some reason hard to divine he was reluctant to seek her deliberately  always while he had listened to her neighbors talk he had hoped they might let fall something about her but they did not he received an impression that she was not so intimate with the others as he had supposed they all made one big family still she seemed a little outside he could bring no proofs to strengthen this idea he merely felt it and many of his feelings were independent of intelligent reason something had been added to curiosity that was sure  it was his habit to call upon mother smith in the afternoons from the first her talk to him hinted of a leaning toward thought of making him a mormon her husband and the other men took up her cue and spoke of their religion casually at first but gradually opening their minds to free and simple discussion of their faith shefford lent respectful attention he would rather have been a mormon than an atheist and apparently they considered him the latter and were earnest to save his soul shefford knew that he could never be one any more than the other he was just at sea but he listened and he found them simple in faith blind perhaps but loyal and good it was noteworthy that mother smith happened to be the only woman in the village who had ever mentioned religion to him she was old of a past generation the young women belonged to the present shefford pondered the significant difference  every day made more steadfast his impression of the great mystery that was like a twining shadow round these women yet in the same time many little ideas shifted and many new characteristics became manifest this last was of course the result of acquaintance he was learning more about the villagers he gathered from keen interpretation of subtle words and looks that here in this lonely village the same as in all the rest of the world where women were together there were cliques quarrels dislikes loves and jealousies the truth once known to him made him feel natural and fortified his confidence to meet the demands of an increasingly interesting position he discovered with a somewhat grim amusement that a clergymans experience in a church full of women had not been entirely useless  one afternoon he let fall a careless remark that was a subtle question in regard to the girl mary whom withers called the sago lily in response he received an answer couched in the sweet poisoned honey of womans jealousy he said no more certain ideas of his were strengthened and straightway he became thoughtful  that afternoon late as he did his camp chores he watched for her but she did not come then he decided to go to see her but even the decision and the strange thrill it imparted did not change his reluctance  twilight was darkening the valley when he reached her house and the shadows were thick under the pinyons there was no light in the door or window he saw a white shape on the porch and as he came down the path it rose it was the girl mary and she appeared startled  good evening he said its shefford may i stay and talk a little while  she was silent for so long that he began to feel awkward  id be glad to have you she replied finally  there was a bench on the porch but he preferred to sit upon a blanket on the step  ive been getting acquainted with everybodyexcept you he went on  i have been here she replied  that might have been a womans speech but it certainly had been made in a girls voice she was neither shy nor embarrassed nor selfconscious as she stood back from him he could not see her face in the dense twilight  ive been wanting to call on you  she made some slight movement shefford felt a strange calm yet he knew the moment was big and potent  wont you sit here he asked  she complied with his wish and then he saw her face though dimly in the twilight and it struck him mute but he had no glimpse such as had flashed upon him from under her hood that other night he thought of a white flower in shadow and received his first impression of the rare and perfect lily withers had said graced the wild cañon she was only a girl she sat very still looking straight before her and seemed to be waiting listening shefford saw the quick rise and fall of her bosom  i want to talk he began swiftly hoping to put her at her ease every one here has been good to me and ive talkedoh for hours and hours but the thing in my mind i havent spoken of ive never asked any questions that makes my part so strange i want to tell why i came out here i need some one who will keep my secret and perhaps help me would you  yes if i could she replied  you see ive got to trust you or one of these other women youre all mormons i dont mean thats anything against you i believe youre all good and noble but the fact makeswell makes a liberty of speech impossible what can i do  her silence probably meant that she did not know shefford sensed less strain in her and more excitement he believed he was on the right track and did not regret his impulse even had he regretted it he would have gone on for opposed to caution and intelligence was his driving mystic force  then he told her the truth about his boyhood his ambition to be an artist his renunciation to his fathers hope his career as a clergyman his failure in religion and the disgrace that had made him a wanderer  ohim sorry she said the faint starlight shone on her face in her eyes and if he ever saw beauty and soul he saw them then she seemed deeply moved she had forgotten herself she betrayed girlhood thenall the quick sympathy the wonder the sweetness of a heart innocent and untutored she looked at him with great starry questioning eyes as if they had just become aware of his presence as if a man had been strange to her  thank you its good of you to be sorry he said my instinct guided me right perhaps youll be my friend  i will beif i can she said  but can you be  i dont know i never had a friend i but sir i mustnt talk of myself oh im afraid i cant help you  how strange the pathos of her voice almost he believed she was in need of help or sympathy or love but he could not wholly trust a judgment formed from observation of a class different from hers  maybe you can help me lets see he said i dont seek to make you talk of yourself butyoure a human beinga girlalmost a woman youre not dumb but even a nun can talk  a nun what is that  wella nun is a sister of mercya woman consecrated to godwho has renounced the world in some ways you mormon women here resemble nuns it is sacrifice that nails you in this lonely valley you seehow i talk one word one thought brings another and i speak what perhaps should be unsaid and its hard because i feel i could unburden myself to you  tell me what you want she said  shefford hesitated and became aware of the rapid pound of his heart more than anything he wanted to be fair to this girl he saw that she was warming to his influence her shadowy eyes were fixed upon him the starlight growing brighter shone on her golden hair and white face  ill tell you presently he said ive trusted you ill trust you with all but let me have my own time this is so strange a thing my wanting to confide in you its selfish perhaps i have my own ax to grind i hope i wont wrong you thats why im going to be perfectly frank i might wait for days to get better acquainted but the impulse is on me ive been so interested in all you mormon women the factthe meaning of this hidden village is soso terrible to me but thats none of my business i have spent my afternoons and evenings with these women at the different cottages you do not mingle with them they are lonely but have not such loneliness as yours i have passed here every night no lightno sound i cant help thinking dont censure me or be afraid or draw within yourself just because i must think i may be all wrong but im curious i wonder about you who are you marymary what maybe i really dont want to know i came with selfish motive and now id like totowhat shall i say make your life a little less lonely for the while im here thats all it neednt offend and if you accept it how much easier i can tell you my secret you are a mormon and iwell i am only a wanderer in these wilds butwe might help each other have i made a mistake  nono she cried almost wildly  we can be friends then you will trust me help me  yes if i dare  surely you may dare what the other women would  she was silent  and the wistfulness of her silence touched him he felt contrition he did not stop to analyze his own emotions but he had an inkling that once this strange situation was ended he would have food for reflection what struck him most now was the girls blanched face the strong nervous clasp of her hands the visible tumult of her bosom excitement alone could not be accountable for this he had not divined the cause for such agitation he was puzzled troubled and drawn irresistibly he had not said what he had planned to say the moment had given birth to his speech and it had flowed what was guiding him  mary he said earnestly tell mehave you mother father sister brother something prompts me to ask that  all deadgoneyears ago she answered  how old are you  eighteen i think im not sure  you are lonely  his words were gentle and divining  o god she cried lonely  then as a man in a dream he beheld her weeping there was in her the unconsciousness of a child and the passion of a woman he gazed out into the dark shadows and up at the white stars and then at the bowed head with its mass of glinting hair but her agitation was no longer strange to him a few gentle and kind words had proved her undoing he knew then that whatever her life was no kindness or sympathy entered it presently she recovered and sat as before only whiter of face it seemed and with something tragic in her dark eyes she was growing cold and still again aloof more like those other mormon women  i understand he said im not sorry i spoke i felt your trouble whatever it is do not retreat into your cold shell i beg of you let me trust you with my secret  he saw her shake out of the cold apathy she wavered he felt an inexplicable sweetness in the power his voice seemed to have upon her she bowed her head in acquiescence and shefford began his story did she grow still like stone or was that only his vivid imagination he told her of venters and bessof lassiter and janeof little fay larkinof the romance and then the tragedy of surprise valley  so when my church disowned me he concluded i conceived the idea of wandering into the wilds of utah to save fay larkin from that cañon prison it grew to be the best and strongest desire of my life i think if i could save her that it would save me i never loved any girl i cant say that i love fay larkin how could i when ive never seen herwhen shes only a dream girl but i believe if she were to become a realitya fleshandblood girlthat i would love her  that was more than shefford had ever confessed to any one and it stirred him to his depths mary bent her head on her hands in strange stonelike rigidity  so here i am in the cañon country he continued withers tells me it is a country of rainbows both in the evanescent air and in the changeless stone always as a boy there had been for me some haunting promise some treasure at the foot of the rainbow i shall expect the curve of a rainbow to lead me down into surprise valley a dreamer you will call me but i have had strange dreams come true mary do you think this dream will come true  she was silent so long that he repeated his question  onlyin heaven she whispered  he took her reply strangely and a chill crept over him  you think my plan to seek to strive to findyou think that idle vain  i think it noble thank god ive met a man like you  dont praise me he exclaimed hastily only help me mary will you answer a few little questions if i swear by my honor ill never reveal what you tell me  ill try  he moistened his lips why did she seem so strange so far away the hovering shadows made him nervous always he had been afraid of the dark his mood now admitted of unreal fancies  have you ever heard of fay larkin he asked very low  yes  was there only one fay larkin  only one  did youever see her  yes came the faint reply  he was grateful how she might be breaking faith with creed or duty he had not dared to hope so much all his inner being trembled at the portent of his next query he had not dreamed it would be so hard to put or would affect him so powerfully a warmth a glow a happiness pervaded his spirit and the chill the gloom were as if they had never been  where is fay larkin now he asked huskily  he bent over her touched her leaned close to catch her whisper  she isdead  slowly shefford rose with a sickening shock and then in bitter pain he strode away into the starlight     vii sagolilies   the indian returned to camp that night and early the next day which was sunday withers rode in accompanied by a stout graybearded personage wearing a long black coat  bishop kane this is my new man john shefford said the trader  shefford acknowledged the introduction with the respectful courtesy evidently in order and found himself being studied intently by clear blue eyes the bishop appeared old dry and absorbed in thought he spoke quaintly using in every speech some biblical word or phrase and he had an air of authority he asked shefford to hear him preach at the morning service and then he went off into the village  guess he liked your looks remarked withers  he certainly sized me up replied shefford  well what could you expect sure i never heard of a deal like thisa handsome young fellow left alone with a lot of pretty mormon women youll understand when you learn to know mormons bishop kanes a square old chap crazy on religion maybe but otherwise hes a good fellow i made the best stand i could for you the mormons over at stonebridge were huffy because i hadnt consulted them before fetching you over here if i had of course youd never have gotten here it was joe lake who made it all right with them joes well thought of and he certainly stood up for you  i owe him something then replied shefford hope my obligations dont grow beyond me did you leave joe at stonebridge  yes he wanted to stay and i had work there thatll keep him awhile shefford we got news of shaddbad news the halfbreeds cutting up rough his gang shot up some piutes over here across the line then he got run out of durango a few weeks ago for murder a posse of cowboys trailed him but he slipped them hes a fox you know he was trailing us here he left the trail nas ta bega said i learned at stonebridge that shadd is well disposed toward mormons it takes the mormons to handle indians shadd knows of this village and thats why he shunted off our trail but he might hang down in the pass and wait for us i think id better go back to kayenta alone across country you stay here till joe and the indian think it safe to leave youll be going up on the slope of navajo to load a packtrain and from there it may be well to go down west cañon to red lake and home over the divide the way you came joell decide whats best and you might as well buckle on a gun and get used to it sooner or later youll have to shoot your way through  shefford did not respond with his usual enthusiasm and the omission caused the trader to scrutinize him closely  whats the matter he queried theres no light in your eye today you look a little shady  i didnt rest well last night replied shefford im depressed this morning but ill cheer up directly  did you get along with the women  very well indeed and ive enjoyed myself its a strange beautiful place  do you like the women  yes  have you seen much of the sago lily  no i carried her bucket one nightand saw her only once again ive been with the other women most of the time  its just as well you didnt run often into mary joes sick over her i never saw a girl with a face and form to equal hers theres danger here for any man shefford even for you who think youve turned your back on the world any of these mormon women may fall in love with you they cant love their husbands thats how i figure it religion holds them not love and the peculiar thing is this theyre second third or fourth wives all sealed that means their husbands are old have picked them out for youth and physical charms have chosen the very opposite to their first wives and then have hidden them here in this lonely hole did you ever imagine so terrible a thing  no withers i did not  maybe thats what depressed you anyway my hunch is worth taking be as nice as you can shefford lord knows it would be good for these poor women if every last one of them fell in love with you that wont hurt them so long as you keep your head savvy perhaps i seem rough and coarse to a man of your class well that may be but human nature is human nature and in this strange and beautiful place you might love an indian girl let alone the sago lily thats all i sure feel better with that load off my conscience hope i dont offend  no indeed i thank you withers replied shefford with his hand on the traders shoulder you are right to caution me i seem to be wildthirsting for adventurechasing a gleam in these unstable days i cant answer for my heart but i can for my honor these unfortunate women are as safe with me asas they are with you and joe  withers uttered a blunt laugh  see here son look things square in the eye men of violent lonely toilsome lives store up hunger for the love of woman love of a strange woman if you want to put it that way its nature it seems all the beautiful young women in utah are corralled in this valley when i come over here i feel natural but im not happy id like to make love toto that flowerfaced girl and im not ashamed to own it ive told molly my wife and she understands as for joe its much harder for him joe never has had a wife or sweetheart i tell you hes sick and if id stay here a month id be sick  withers had spoken with fire in his eyes with grim humor on his lips with uncompromising brutal truth what he admitted was astounding to shefford but once spoken not at all strange the trader was a man who spoke his inmost thought and what he said suddenly focused sheffords mental vision clear and whole upon the appalling significance of the tragedy of those women especially of the girl whose life was lonelier sadder darker than that of the others  withers trust me replied shefford  all right make the best of a bad job said the trader and went off about his tasks  shefford and withers attended the morning service which was held in the schoolhouse exclusive of the children every inhabitant of the village was there the women except the few eldest were dressed in white and looked exceedingly well manifestly they had bestowed care upon this sabbath mornings toilet one thing surely this dress occasion brought out and it was evidence that the mormon women were not poor whatever their misfortunes might be jewelry was not wanting nor fine lace and they all wore beautiful wild flowers of a kind unknown to shefford he received many a bright smile he looked for mary hoping to see her face for the first time in the daylight but she sat far forward and did not turn he saw her graceful white neck the fine lines of her throat and her colorless cheek he recognized her yet in the light she seemed a stranger  the service began with a short prayer and was followed by the singing of a hymn nowhere had shefford heard better music or sweeter voices how deeply they affected him had any man ever fallen into a stranger adventure than this he had only to shut his eyes to believe it all a creation of his fancythe square log cabin with its red mud between the chinks and a roof like an indian hoganthe old bishop in his black coat standing solemnly his hand beating time to the tunethe few old women dignified and statelythe many young women fresh and handsome lifting their voices  shefford listened intently to the bishops sermon in some respects it was the best he had ever heard in others it was impossible for an intelligent man to regard seriously it was very long lasting an hour and a half and the parts that were helpful to shefford came from the experience and wisdom of a man who had grown old in the desert the physical things that had molded characters of iron the obstacles that only strong patient men could have overcome the making of homes in a wilderness showed the greatness of this alien band of mormons shefford conceded greatness to them but the strange religionthe narrowing down of the world to the soil of utah the intimations of prophets on earth who had direct converse with god the austere selfconscious omnipotence of this old bishopthese were matters that shefford felt he must understand better and see more favorably if he were not to consider them impossible  immediately after the service forgetting that his intention had been to get the longwaitedfor look at mary in the light of the sun shefford hurried back to camp and to a secluded spot among the cedars strikingly it had come to him that the fault he had found in gentile religion he now found in the mormon religion an old question returned to haunt himwere all religions the same in blindness as far as he could see religion existed to uphold the founders of a church a creed the church of his own kind was a place where narrow men and women went to think of their own salvation they did not go there to think of others and now sheffords keen mind saw something of mormonism and found it wanting bishop kane was a sincere good mistaken man he believed what he preached but that would not stand logic he taught blindness and mostly it appeared to be directed at the women was there no religion divorced from power no religion as good for one man as another no religion in the spirit of brotherly love nas ta begas bi nai brotherthat was love if not religion and perhaps the one and the other were the same shefford kept in mind an intention to ask nas ta bega what he thought of the mormons  later when opportunity afforded he did speak to the indian nas ta bega threw away his cigarette and made an impressive gesture that conveyed as much sorrow as scorn  the first mormon said god spoke to him and told him to go to a certain place and dig he went there and found the book of mormon it said follow me marry many wives go into the desert and multiply send your sons out into the world and bring us young women many young women and when the first mormon became strong with many followers he said again give to me part of your laborof your cattle and sheepof your silverthat i may build me great cathedrals for you to worship in and i will commune with god and make it right and good that you have more wives that is mormonism  nas ta bega you mean the mormons are a great and good people blindly following a leader  yes and the leader builds for himselfnot for them  that is not religion he has no god but himself  they have no god they are blind like the mokis who have the creeping growths on their eyes they have no god they can see and hear and feel who is with them day and night  it was late in the afternoon when bishop kane rode through the camp and halted on his way to speak to shefford he was kind and fatherly young man are you open to faith he questioned gravely  i think i am replied shefford thankful he could answer readily  then come into the fold you are a lost sheep away on the desert i heard its cry god bless you visit me when you ride to stonebridge  he flicked his horse with a cedar branch and trotted away beside the trader and presently the greenchoked neck of the valley hid them from view shefford could not have said that he was glad to be left behind and yet neither was he sorry  that sabbath evening as he sat quietly with nas ta bega watching the sunset gilding the peaks he was visited by three of the young mormon womenruth joan and hester they deliberately sought him and merrily led him off to the village and to the evening service of singing and prayer afterward he was surrounded and made much of he had been popular before but this was different when he thoughtfully wended his way campward under the quiet stars he realized that the coming of bishop kane had made a subtle change in the women that change was at first hard to define but from every point by which he approached it he came to the same conclusionthe bishop had not objected to his presence in the village the women became natural free and unrestrained a dozen or twenty young and attractive women thrown much into companionship with one man he might become a mormon the idea made him laugh but upon reflection it was not funny it sobered him what a situation he felt instinctively that he ought to fly from this hidden valley but he could not have done it even had he not been in the traders employ the thing was provokingly seductive it was like an arabian nights tale what could these strange fatally bound women do would any one of them become involved in sweet toils such as were possible to him he was no fool already eyes had flashed and lips had smiled  a thousand like thoughts whirled through his mind and when he had calmed down somewhat two things were not lost upon himan intricate and fascinating situation with no end to its possibilities threatened and attracted himand the certainty that whatever change the bishop had inaugurated it had made these poor women happier the latter fact weighed more with shefford than fears for himself his word was given to withers he would have felt just the same without having bound himself still in the light of the traders blunt philosophy and of his own assurance that he was no fool shefford felt it incumbent upon him to accept a belief that there were situations no man could resist without an anchor the ingenuity of man could not have devised a stranger a more enticing a more overpoweringly fatal situation fatal in that it could not be left untried shefford gave in and clicked his teeth as he let himself go and suddenly he thought of her whom these bitter women called the sago lily  the regret that had been his returned with thought of her the saddest disillusion of his life the keenest disappointment the strangest pain would always be associated with her he had meant to see her face once clear in the sunlight so that he could always remember it and then never go near her again and now it came to him that if he did see much of her these other women would find him like the stone wall in the valley folly perhaps it was but she would be safe maybe happier when he decided it was certain that he trembled  then he buried the memory of fay larkin  next day shefford threw himself with all the boy left in him into the work and play of the village he helped the women and made games for the children and he talked or listened in the early evening he called on ruth chatted awhile and went on to see joan and from her to another when the valley became shrouded in darkness he went unseen down the path to marys lonely home  she was there a white shadow against the black  when she replied to his greeting her voice seemed full broken eager to express something that would not come she was happier to see him than she should have been shefford thought he talked swiftly eloquently about whatever he believed would interest her he stayed long and finally left not having seen her face except in pale starlight and shadow and the strong clasp of her hand remained with him as he went away under the pinyons  days passed swiftly joe lake did not return the indian rode in and out of camp watered and guarded the packburros and the mustangs shefford grew strong and active he made gardens for the women he cut cords of firewood he dammed the brook and made an irrigation ditch he learned to love these fatherless children and they loved him  in the afternoons there was leisure for him and for the women he had no favorites and let the occasion decide what he should do and with whom he should be they had little parties at the cottages and picnics under the cedars he rode up and down the valley with ruth who could ride a horse as no other girl he had ever seen he climbed with hester he walked with joan mostly he contrived to include several at once in the little excursions though it was not rare for him to be out alone with one  it was not a game he was playing more and more as he learned to know these young women he liked them better he pitied them he was good for them it shamed him hurt him somehow to see how they tried to forget something when they were with him not improbably a little of it was coquetry as natural as a laugh to any pretty woman but that was not what hurt him it was to see ruth or rebecca as the case might be full of life and fun thoroughly enjoying some jest or play all of a sudden be strangely recalled from the wholesome pleasure of a girl to become a deep and somber woman the crimes in the name of religion how he thought of the blood and the ruin laid at the door of religion he wondered if that were so with nas ta begas religion and he meant to find out some day the women he liked best he imagined the least religious and they made less effort to attract him  every night in the dark he went to marys home and sat with her on the porch he never went inside for all he knew his visits were unknown to her neighbors still it did not matter to him if they found out to her he could talk as he had never talked to any one she liberated all his thought and fancy he filled her mind  as there had been a change in the other women so was there in mary however it had no relation to the bishops visit the time came when shefford could not but see that she lived and dragged through the long day for the sake of those few hours in the shadow of the stars with him she seldom spoke she listened wonderful to himsometimes she laughedand it seemed the sound was a ghost of childhood pleasure when he stopped to consider that she might fall in love with him he drove the thought from him when he realized that his folly had become sweet and that the sweetness imperiously drew him he likewise cast off that thought the present was enough and if he had any treasures of mind and heart he gave them to her  she never asked him to stay but she showed that she wanted him to that made it hard to go still he never stayed late the moment of parting was like a break her goodby was sweet low music it lingered on his ear it bade him come tomorrow night and it sent him away into the valley to walk under the stars a man fighting against himself  one night at parting as he tried to see her face in the wan glow of a clouded moon he said  ive been trying to find a sagolily  have you never seen one she asked  no he meant to say something with a double meaning in reference to her face and the name of the flower but her unconsciousness made him hold his tongue she was wholly unlike the other women  ill show you where the lilies grow she said  when  tomorrow early in the afternoon ill come to the spring then ill take you              next morning joe lake returned and imparted news that was perturbing to shefford reports of shadd had come in to stonebridge from different indian villages joe was not inclined to linger long at the camp and favored taking the trail with the packtrain  shefford discovered that he did not want to leave the valley and the knowledge made him reflective that morning he did not go into the village and stayed in camp alone a depression weighed upon him it was dispelled however early in the afternoon by the sight of a slender figure in white swiftly coming down the path to the spring he had an appointment with mary to go to see the sago lilies everything else slipped his mind  mary wore the long black hood that effectually concealed her face it made of her a woman a mormon woman and strangely belied the lithe form and the braid of gold hair  good day she said putting down her bucket do you still want to goto see the lilies  yes replied shefford with a short laugh  can you climb  ill go where you go  then she set off under the cedars and shefford stalked at her side he was aware that nas ta bega watched them walk away this day so far at least shefford did not feel talkative and mary had always been one who mostly listened they came at length to a place where the wall rose in low smooth swells not steep but certainly at an angle shefford would not of his own accord have attempted to scale  light quick and sure as a mountainsheep mary went up the first swell to an offset above shefford in amaze and admiration watched the little moccasins as they flashed and held on to the smooth rock  when he essayed to follow her he slipped and came to grief a second attempt resulted in like failure then he backed away from the wall to run forward fast and up the slope only to slip halfway up and fall again  he made light of the incident but she was solicitous when he assured her he was unhurt she said he had agreed to go where she went  but im not aa bird he protested  take off your boots then you can climb when we get over the wall itll be easy she said  in his stockingfeet he had no great difficulty walking up the first bulge of the walls and from there she led him up the strange waves of windworn rock he could not attend to anything save the red polished rock under him and so saw little the ascent was longer than he would have imagined and steep enough to make him pant but at last a huge round summit was reached  from here he saw down into the valley where the village lay but for the lazy columns of blue smoke curling up from the pinyons the place would have seemed uninhabited the wall on the other side was about level with the one upon which he stood beyond rose other walls and cliffs up and up to the great towering peaks between which the greenandblack mountain loomed facing the other way shefford had only a restricted view there were low crags and smooth stone ridges between which were aisles green with cedar and pinyon sheffords companion headed toward one of these and when he had followed her a few steps he could no longer see down into the valley the mormon village where she lived was as if it were lost and when it vanished shefford felt a difference scarcely had the thought passed when mary removed the dark hood her small head glistened like gold in the sunlight  shefford caught up with her and walked at her side but could not bring himself at once deliberately to look at her they entered a narrow lowwalled lane where cedars and pinyons grew thickly their fragrance heavy in the warm air and flowers began to show in the grassy patches  this is indian paintbrush she said pointing to little low scarlet flowers a gray sagebush with beautiful purple blossoms she called purple sage another bush with yellow flowers she named buckbrush and there were vermilion cacti and low flat mounds of lavender daisies which she said had no name a whole mossy bank was covered with lace like green leaves and tiny blossoms the color of violets which she called loco  loco is this what makes the horses go crazy when they eat it he asked  it is indeed she said laughing  when she laughed it was impossible not to look at her she walked a little in advance her white cheek and temple seemed framed in the gold of her hair how white her skin but it was like pearl faintly veined and flushed the profile clearcut and pure appeared cold almost stern he knew now that she was singularly beautiful though he had yet to see her full face  they walked on quite suddenly the lane opened out between two rounded bluffs and shefford looked down upon a grander and more aweinspiring scene than ever he had viewed in his dreams  what appeared to be a green mountainside sloped endlessly down to a plain and that rolled and billowed away to a boundless region of strangely carved rock the greatness of the scene could not be grasped in a glance the slope was long the plain not as level as it seemed to be on first sight here and there round red rocks isolated and strange like lonely castles rose out of the green beyond the green all the earth seemed naked showing smooth glistening bones it was a formidable wall of rock that flung itself up in the distance carved into a thousand cañon and walls and domes and peaks and there was not a straight nor a broken nor a jagged line in all that wildness the color low down was red dark blue and purple in the clefts yellow upon the heights and in the distance rainbowhued a land of curves and color  shefford uttered an exclamation  thats utah said mary i come often to sit here you see that winding blue line there thats san juan cañon and the other dark line thats escalante cañon they wind down into this great purple chasmway over here to the leftand thats the grand cañon they say not even the indians have been in there  shefford had nothing to say the moment was one of subtle and vital assimilation such places as this to be unknown to men what strength what wonder what help what glory just to sit there an hour slowly and appallingly to realize something came to shefford from the distance out of the purple cañon and from those dim windworn peaks he resolved to come here to this promontory again and again alone and in humble spirit and learn to know why he had been silenced why peace pervaded his soul  it was with this emotion upon him that he turned to find his companion watching him then for the first time he saw her face fully and was thrilled that chance had reserved the privilege for this moment it was a girls face he saw flowerlike lovely and pure as a madonnas and strangely tragically sad the eyes were large dark gray the color of the sage they were as clear as the air which made distant things close and yet they seemed full of shadows like a ruffled pool under midnight stars they disturbed him her mouth had the sweet curves and redness of youth but it showed bitterness pain and repression  where are the sagolilies he asked suddenly  farther down its too cold up here for them come she said  he followed her down a winding traildown and down till the green plain rose to blot out the scrawled wall of rock down into a verdant cañon where a brook made swift music over stones where the air was sultry and hot laden with the fragrant breath of flower and leaf this was a cañon of summer and it bloomed  the girl bent and plucked something from the grass  heres a white lily she said there are three colors the yellow and pink ones are deeper down in the cañon  shefford took the flower and regarded it with great interest he had never seen such an exquisite thing it had three large petals curving cuplike of a whiteness purer than newfallen snow and a heart of rich warm gold its fragrance was so faint as to be almost indistinguishable yet of a haunting unforgettable sweetness and even while he looked at it the petals drooped and their whiteness shaded and the gold paled in a moment the flower was wilted  i dont like to pluck the lilies said mary they die so swiftly  shefford saw the white flowers everywhere in the open sunny places along the brook they swayed with stately grace in the slow warm wind they seemed like threepointed stars shining out of the green he bent over one with a particularly lofty stem and after a close survey of it he rose to look at her face his action was plainly one of comparison she laughed and said it was foolish for the women to call her the sago lily she had no coquetry she spoke as she would have spoken of the stones at her feet she did not know that she was beautiful shefford imagined there was some resemblance in her to the lilythe same whiteness the same rich gold and more striking than either a strange rare quality of beauty of life intangible as something fleeting the spirit that had swiftly faded from the plucked flower where had the girl been bornwhat had her life been shefford was intensely curious about her she seemed as different from any other women he had known as this rare cañon lily was different from the tame flowers at home  on the return up the slope she outstripped him she climbed lightly and tirelessly when he reached her upon the promontory there was a stain of red in her cheeks and her expression had changed  lets go back up over the rocks she said ive not climbed forfor so long  ill go where you go he replied  then she was off and he followed she took to the curves of the bare rocks and climbed he sensed a spirit released in her it was so strange so keen so wonderful to be with her and when he did catch her he feared to speak lest he break this mood her eyes grew dark and daring and often she stopped to look away across the wavy sea of stones to something beyond the great walls when they got high the wind blew her hair loose and it flew out a golden stream with the sun bright upon it he saw that she changed her direction which had been in line with the two peaks and now she climbed toward the heights they came to a more difficult ascent where the stone still held to the smooth curves yet was marked by steep bulges and slants and crevices here she became a wild thing she ran she leaped she would have left him far behind had he not called then she appeared to remember him and waited  her face had now lost its whiteness it was flushed rosy warm  wheredid youever learnto run over rocksthis way he panted  all my life ive climbed she said ah its so good to be up on the walls againto feel the windto see  thereafter he kept close to her no matter what the effort he would not miss a moment of her if he could help it she was wonderful he imagined she must be like an indian girl or a savage who loved the lofty places and the silence when she leaped she uttered a strange low sweet cry of wildness and exultation shefford guessed she was a girl freed from her prison forgetting herself living again youthful hours still she did not forget him she waited for him at the bad places lent him a strong hand and sometimes let it stay long in his clasp tireless and agile surefooted as a goat fleet and wild she leaped and climbed and ran until shefford marveled at her this adventure was indeed fulfilment of a dream perhaps she might lead him to the treasure at the foot of the rainbow but that thought sad with memory daring forth from its grave was irrevocably linked with a girl who was dead he could not remember her in the presence of this wonderful creature who was as strange as she was beautiful when shefford reached for the brown hand stretched forth to help him in a leap when he felt its strong clasp the youth and vitality and life of it he had the fear of a man who was running towards a precipice and who could not draw back this was a climb a lark a wild race to the mormon girl bound now in the village and by the very freedom of it she betrayed her bonds to shefford it was also a wild race but toward one sure goal he dared not name  they went on and at length hand in hand even where no steep step or wide fissure gave reason for the clasp but she seemed unconscious they were nearing the last height a bare eminence when she broke from him and ran up the smooth stone when he surmounted it she was standing on the very summit her arms wide her full breast heaving her slender body straight as an indians her hair flying in the wind and blazing in the sun she seemed to embrace the west to reach for something afar to offer herself to the wind and distance her face was scarlet from the exertion of the climb and her broad brow was moist her eyes had the piercing light of an eagles though now they were dark shefford instinctively grasped the essence of this strange spirit primitive and wild she was not the woman who had met him at the spring she had dropped some side of her with that mormon hood and now she stood totally strange  she belonged up here he divined she was a part of that wildness she must have been born and brought up in loneliness where the wind blew and the peaks loomed and silence held dominion the sinking sun touched the rim of the distant wall and as if in parting regret shone with renewed golden fire and the girl was crowned as with a glory  shefford loved her then realizing it he thought he might have loved her before but that did not matter when he was certain of it now he trembled a little fearfully though without regret everything pertaining to his desert experience had been strangethis the strangest of all  the sun sank swiftly and instantly there was a change in the golden light quickly it died out the girl changed as swiftly she seemed to remember herself and sat down as if suddenly weary shefford went closer and seated himself beside her  the sun has set we must go she said but she made no movement  whenever you are ready replied he  just as the blaze had died out of her eyes so the flush faded out of her face the whiteness stole back and with it the sadness he had to bite his tongue to keep from telling her what he felt to keep from pouring out a thousand questions but the privilege of having seen her of having been with her when she had forgotten herselfthat he believed was enough it had been wonderful it had made him love her but it need not add to the tragedy of her life whatever that was he tried to eliminate himself and he watched her  her eyes were fixed upon the goldrimmed ramparts of the distant wall in the west plain it was how she loved that wild upland and there seemed to be some haunting memory of the past in her gazesome happy part of life agonizing to think of now  we must go she said and rose  shefford rose to accompany her she looked at him and her haunting eyes seemed to want him to know that he had helped her to forget the present to remember girlhood and that somehow she would always associate a wonderful happy afternoon with him he divined that her silence then was a mormon seal on lips  mary this has been the happiest the best the most revealing day of my life he said simply  swiftly as if startled she turned and faced down the slope at the top of the wall above the village she put on the dark hood and with it that somber something which was mormon  twilight had descended into the valley and shadows were so thick shefford had difficulty in finding marys bucket he filled it at the spring and made offer to carry it home for her which she declined  youll come tonightlater she asked  yes he replied hurriedly promising then he watched her white form slowly glide down the path to disappear in the shadows  nas ta bega and joe were busy at the campfire shefford joined them this night he was uncommunicative joe peered curiously at him in the flare of the blaze later after the meal when shefford appeared restless and strode to and fro joe spoke up gruffly  better hang round camp tonight  shefford heard but did not heed nevertheless the purport of the remark which was either jealousy or admonition haunted him with the possibility of its meaning  he walked away from the campfire under the dark pinyons out into the starry open and every step was hard to take unless it pointed toward the home of the girl whose beauty and sadness and mystery had bewitched him after what seemed hours he took the wellknown path toward her cabin and then every step seemed lighter he divined he was rushing to some fatehe knew not what  the porch was in shadow he peered in vain for the white form against the dark background in the silence he seemed to hear his heartbeats thick and muffled  some distance down the path he heard the sound of hoofs withdrawing into the gloom of a cedar he watched soon he made out moving horses with riders they filed past him to the number of half a score like a flash of fire the truth burned him mormons come for one of those mysterious night visits to sealed wives  shefford stalked far down the valley into the lonely silence and the night shadows under the walls     viii the hogan of nas ta bega   the home of nas ta bega lay far up the cedared slope with the craggy yellow cliffs and the black cañon and the pinefringed top of navajo mountain behind and to the fore the vast rolling descent of cedar groves and sage flats and sandy washes no dim dark range made bold outline along the horizon the stretch of gray and purple and green extended to the blue line of sky  down the length of one sage level shefford saw a long lane where the brush and the grass had been beaten flat this the navajo said was a track where the young braves had raced their mustangs and had striven for supremacy before the eyes of maidens and the old people of the tribe  nas ta bega did you ever race here asked shefford  i am a chief by birth but i was stolen from my home and now i cannot ride well enough to race the braves of my tribe the indian replied bitterly  in another place joe lake halted his horse and called sheffords attention to a big yellow rock lying along the trail and then he spoke in navajo to the indian  ive heard of this stoneisende aha said joe after nas ta bega had spoken get down and lets see shefford dismounted but the indian kept his seat in the saddle  joe placed a big hand on the stone and tried to move it according to sheffords eye measurement the stone was nearly oval perhaps three feet high by a little over two in width joe threw off his sombrero took a deep breath and bending over clasped the stone in his arms he was an exceedingly heavy and powerful man and it was plain to shefford that he meant to lift the stone if that were possible joes broad shoulders strained flattened his arms bulged his joints cracked his neck corded and his face turned black by gigantic effort he lifted the stone and moved it about six inches then as he released his hold he fell and when he sat up his face was wet with sweat  try it he said to shefford with his lazy smile see if you can heave it  shefford was strong and there had been a time when he took pride in his strength something in joes supreme effort and in the gloom of the indians eyes made shefford curious about this stone he bent over and grasped it as joe had done he braced himself and lifted with all his power until a red blur obscured his sight and shooting stars seemed to explode in his head but he could not even stir the stone  shefford maybe youll be able to heft it some day observed joe then he pointed to the stone and addressed nas ta bega  the indian shook his head and spoke for a moment  this is the isende aha of the navajos explained joe the young braves are always trying to carry this stone as soon as one of them can carry it he is a man he who carries it farthest is the biggest man and just so soon as any indian can no longer lift it he is old nas ta bega says the stone has been carried two miles in his lifetime his own father carried it the length of six steps  well its plain to me that i am not a man said shefford or else i am old  joe lake drawled his lazy laugh and mounting rode up the trail but shefford lingered beside the indian  bi nai said nas ta bega i am a chief of my tribe but i have never been a man i never lifted that stone see what the paleface education has done for the indian  the navajos bitterness made shefford thoughtful could greater injury be done to man than thisto rob him of his heritage of strength  joe drove the bobbing packtrain of burros into the cedars where the smoke of the hogans curled upward and soon the whistling of mustangs the barking of dogs the bleating of sheep told of his reception and presently shefford was in the midst of an animated scene great woolly fierce dogs like wolves ran out to meet the visitors sheep and goats were everywhere and little lambs scarcely able to walk with others frisky and frolicsome there were purewhite lambs and some that appeared to be painted and some so beautiful with their fleecy white all except black faces or ears or tails or feet they ran right under nackyals legs and bumped against shefford and kept bleating their thinpiped welcome under the cedars surrounding the several hogans were mustangs that took sheffords eye he saw an irongray with white mane and tail sweeping to the ground and a fiery black wilder than any other beast he had ever seen and a pinto as wonderfully painted as the little lambs and most striking of all a pure creamcolored mustang with grace and fine lines and beautiful mane and tail and strange to see eyes as blue as azure this albino mustang came right up to shefford an action in singular contrast with that of the others and showed a tame and friendly spirit toward him and nackyal indeed shefford had reason to feel ashamed of nackyals temper or jealousy  the first indians to put in an appearance were a flock of children half naked with tangled manes of ravenblack hair and skin like gold bronze they appeared bold and shy by turns then a little sinewy man old and beaten and gray came out of the principal hogan he wore a blanket round his bent shoulders his name was hosteen doetin and it meant gentle man his fine old wrinkled face lighted with a smile of kindly interest his squaw followed him and she was as venerable as he shefford caught a glimpse of the shy dark glen naspa nas ta begas sister but she did not come out other indians appeared coming from adjacent hogans  nas ta bega turned the mustangs loose among those shefford had noticed and presently there rose a snorting whistling kicking plunging melee a cloud of dust hid them and then a thudding of swift hoofs told of a run through the cedars joe lake began picking over stacks of goatskins and bags of wool that were piled against the hogan  reckon well have one grand job packing out this load he growled its not so heavy but awkward to pack  it developed presently from talk with the old navajo that this pile was only a half of the load to be packed to kayenta and the other half was round the corner of the mountain in the camp of piutes hosteen doetin said he would send to the camp and have the piutes bring their share over the suggestion suited joe who wanted to save his burros as much as possible accordingly a messenger was despatched to the piute camp and shefford with time on his hands and poignant memory to combat decided to recall his keen interest in the navajo and learn if possible what the indians life was like what would a day of his natural life be  in the gray of dawn when the hush of the desert night still lay deep over the land the navajo stirred in his blanket and began to chant to the morning light it began very soft and low a strange broken murmur like the music of a brook and as it swelled that weird and mournful tone was slowly lost in one of hope and joy the indians soul was coming out of night blackness the sleep that resembled death into the day the light that was life  then he stood in the door of his hogan his blanket around him and faced the east  night was lifting out of the clefts and ravines the rolling cedar ridges and the sage flats were softly gray with thin veils like smoke mysteriously rising and vanishing the colorless rocks were changing a long horizonwide gleam of light rosiest in the center lay low down in the east and momentarily brightened one by one the stars in the deepblue sky paled and went out and the blue dome changed and lightened night had vanished on invisible wings and silence broke to the music of a mockingbird the rose in the east deepened a wisp of cloud turned gold dim distant mountains showed dark against the red and low down in a notch a rim of fire appeared over the soft ridges and valleys crept a wondrous transfiguration it was as if every blade of grass every leaf of sage every twig of cedar the flowers the trees the rocks came to life at sight of the sun the red disk rose and a golden fire burned over the glowing face of that lonely waste  the navajo dark stately inscrutable faced the sunhis god this was his great spirit the desert was his mother but the sun was his life to the keeper of the winds and rains to the master of light to the maker of fire to the giver of life the navajo sent up his prayer    of all the good things of the earth let me always have plenty  of all the beautiful things of the earth let me always have plenty  peacefully let my horses go and peacefully let my sheep go  god of the heavens give me many sheep and horses  god of the heavens help me to talk straight  goddess of the earth my mother let me walk straight  now all is well now all is well now all is well now all is well   hope and faith were his  a chief would be born to save the vanishing tribe of navajos a bride would rise from a windkiss of the lilies in the moonlight  he drank from the clear cold spring bubbling from under mossy rocks he went into the cedars and the tracks in the trails told him of the visitors of night his mustangs whistled to him from the ridgetops standing clear with heads up and manes flying and then trooped down through the sage the shepherddogs guardians of the flocks barked him a welcome and the sheep bleated and the lambs pattered round him  in the hogan by the warm red fire his women baked his bread and cooked his meat and he satisfied his hunger then he took choice meat to the hogan of a sick relative and joined in the song and the dance and the prayer that drove away the evil spirit of illness down in the valley in a sandy sunny place was his cornfield and here he turned in the water from the ditch and worked awhile and went his contented way  he loved his people his women and his children to his son he said be bold and brave grow like the pine work and ride and play that you may be strong talk straight love your brother give half to your friend honor your mother that you may honor your wife pray and listen to your gods  then with his gun and his mustang he climbed the slope of the mountain he loved the solitude but he was never alone there were voices on the wind and steps on his trail the lofty pine the lichened rock the tiny bluebell the seared cragall whispered their secrets for him their spirits spoke in the morning light old stone face the mountain was a red god calling him to the chase he was a brother of the eagle at home on the heights where the winds swept and the earth lay revealed below  in the golden afternoon with the warm sun on his back and the blue cañon at his feet he knew the joy of doing nothing he did not need rest for he was never tired the sagesweet breath of the open was thick in his nostrils the silence that had so many whisperings was all about him the loneliness of the wild was his his falcon eye saw mustang and sheep the puff of dust down on the cedar level the indian riding on a distant ridge the gray walls and the blue clefts here was home still free still wild still untainted he saw with the eyes of his ancestors he felt them around him they had gone into the elements from which their voices came on the wind they were the watchers on his trails  at sunset he faced the west and this was his prayer                   great spirit god of my fathers                 keep my horses in the night                 keep my sheep in the night                 keep my family in the night                 let me wake to the day                 let me be worthy of the light                 now all is well now all is well                 now all is well now all is well   and he watched the sun go down and the gold sink from the peaks and the red die out of the west and the gray shadows creep out of the cañon to meet the twilight and the slow silent mysterious approach of night with its gift of stars  night fell the white stars blinked the wind sighed in the cedars the sheep bleated the shepherddogs bayed the mourning coyotes and the indian lay down in his blankets with his dark face tranquil in the starlight all was well in his lonely world phantoms hovered illness lingered injury and pain and death were there the shadow of a strange white hand flitted across the face of the moonbut now all was wellthe navajo had prayed to the god of his fathers now all was well              and this thought shefford in revolt was what the white man had killed in the indian tribes was reaching out now to kill in this wild remnant of the navajos the padre the trapper the trader the prospector and the missionaryso the white man had come some of him good no doubt but more of him evil and the young brave learned a thirst that could never be quenched at the cold sweet spring of his forefathers and the young maiden burned with a fever in her blood and lost the sweet strange wild fancies of her tribe              joe lake came to shefford and said withers told me you had a mixup with a missionary at red lake  yes i regret to say replied shefford  about glen naspa  yes nas ta begas sister  withers just mentioned it who was the missionary  willetts so presbrey the trader said  whatd he look like  shefford recalled the smooth brown face the dark eyes the weak chin the mild expression and the soft lax figure of the missionary  cant tell by what you said went on joe but ill bet a peso to a horsehair thats the fellow whos been here old hosteen doetin just told me first visits he ever had from the priest with the long gown thats what he called the missionary these old fellows will never forget whats come down from father to son about the spanish padres well anyway willetts has been here twice after glen naspa the old chap is impressed but he doesnt want to let the girl go im inclined to think glen naspa would as lief go as stay she may be a navajo but shes a girl she wont talk much  wheres nas ta bega asked shefford  he rode off somewhere yesterday perhaps to the piute camp these indians are slow they may take a week to pack that load over here but if nas ta bega or some one doesnt come with a message today ill ride over there myself  joe what do you think about this missionary queried shefford bluntly  reckon theres not much to think unless you see him or find out something i heard of willetts before withers spoke of him hes friendly with mormons i understand hes worked for mormon interests someway or other thats on the quiet savvy this matter of him coming after glen naspa reckon thats all right the missionaries all go after the young people whatd be the use to try to convert the old indians no the missionarys work is to educate the indian and of course the younger he is the better  you approve of the missionary  shefford if you understood a mormon you wouldnt ask that did you ever read or hear of jacob hamblin well he was a mormon missionary among the navajos the navajos were as fierce as apaches till hamblin worked among them he made them friendly to the white man  that doesnt prove he made converts of them replied shefford still bluntly  no for the matter of that hamblin let religion alone he made presents then traded with them then taught them useful knowledge mormon or not shefford ill admit this a good man strong with his body and learned in ways with his hands with some knowledge of medicine can better the condition of these indians but just as soon as he begins to preach his religion then his influence wanes thats natural these heathen have their ideals their gods  which the white man should leave them replied shefford feelingly  thats a matter of opinion but dont lets argue willetts is after glen naspa and if i know indian girls hell persuade her to go to his school  persuade her then shefford broke off and related the incident that had occurred at red lake  reckon any means justifies the end replied joe imperturbably let him talk love to her or rope her or beat her so long as he makes a christian of her  shefford felt a hot flush and had difficulty in controlling himself from this single point of view the mormon was impossible to reason with  that too is a matter of opinion we wont discuss it continued shefford butif old hosteen doetin objects to the girl leaving and if nas ta bega does the same wont that end the matter  reckon not the end of the matter is glen naspa if she wants to go shell go  shefford thought best to drop the discussion for the first time he had occasion to be repelled by something in this kind and genial mormon and he wanted to forget it just as he had never talked about men to the sealed wives in the hidden valley so he could not talk of women to joe lake  nas ta bega did not return that day but next morning a messenger came calling lake to the piute camp shefford spent the morning high on the slope learning more with every hour in the silence and loneliness that he was stronger of soul than he had dared to hope and that the added pain which had come to him could be borne  upon his return toward camp in the cedar grove he caught sight of glen naspa with a white man they did not see him when shefford recognized willetts an embarrassment as well as an instinct made him halt and step into a bushy lowbranched cedar it was not his intention to spy on them he merely wanted to avoid a meeting but the missionarys hand on the girls arm and her uplifted head her pretty face strange intent troubled struck shefford with an unusual and irresistible curiosity willetts was talking earnestly glen naspa was listening intently shefford watched long enough to see that the girl loved the missionary and that he reciprocated or was pretending his manner scarcely savored of pretense shefford concluded as he slipped away under the trees  he did not go at once into camp he felt troubled and wished that he had not encountered the two his duty in the matter of course was to tell nas ta bega what he had seen upon reflection shefford decided to give the missionary the benefit of a doubt and if he really cared for the indian girl and admitted or betrayed it to think all the better of him for the fact glen naspa was certainly pretty enough and probably lovable enough to please any lonely man in this desert the pain and the yearning in sheffords heart made him lenient he had to fight himselfnot to forget for that was impossiblebut to keep rational and sane when a white flowerlike face haunted him and a voice called  the cracking of hard hoofs on stones caused him to turn toward camp and as he emerged from the cedar grove he saw three indian horsemen ride into the cleared space before the hogans they were superbly mounted and well armed and impressed him as being different from navajos perhaps they were piutes they dismounted and led the mustangs down to the pool below the spring shefford saw another mustang standing bridle down and carrying a pack behind the saddle some squaws with children hanging behind their skirts were standing at the door of hosteen doetins hogan shefford glanced in to see glen naspa pale quiet almost sullen willetts stood with his hands spread the old navajos seamed face worked convulsively as he tried to lift his bent form to some semblance of dignity and his voice rolled out sonorously me no savvy jesus christ me hungry  me no eat jesus christ  shefford drew back as if he had received a blow that had been hosteen doetins reply to the importunities of the missionary the old navajo could work no longer his sons were gone his squaw was worn out he had no one save glen naspa to help him she was young strong he was hungry what was the white mans religion to him  with long swift stride shefford entered the hogan willetts seeing him did not look so mild as shefford had him pictured in memory nor did he appear surprised shefford touched hosteen doetins shoulder and said tell me  the aged navajo lifted a shaking hand  me no savvy jesus christ me hungry me no eat jesus christ  shefford then made signs that indicated the missionarys intention to take the girl away him comebig talkjesusall jesus me no want glen naspa go replied the indian  shefford turned to the missionary  willetts is he a relative of the girl  theres some blood tie i dont know what but its not close replied willetts  then dont you think youd better wait till nas ta bega returns hes her brother  what for demanded willetts that indian may be gone a week shes willing to accompany the missionary  shefford looked at the girl  glen naspa do you want to go  she was shy ashamed and silent but manifestly willing to accompany the missionary shefford pondered a moment how he hoped nas ta bega would come back it was thought of the indian that made shefford stubborn what his stand ought to be was hard to define unless he answered to impulse and here in the wilds he had become imbued with the idea that his impulses and instincts were no longer false  willetts what do you want with the girl queried shefford coolly and at the question he seemed to find himself he peered deliberately and searchingly into the others face the missionarys gaze shifted and a tinge of red crept up from under his collar  absurd thing to ask a missionary he burst out impatiently  do you care for glen naspa  i care as gods disciplewho cares to save the soul of heathen he replied with the lofty tone of prayer  has glen naspa nono other interest in youexcept to be taught religion  the missionarys face flamed and his violent tremor showed that under his exterior there was a different man  what right have you to question me he demanded youre an adventureran outcast ive my duty here im a missionary with church and state and government behind me  yes im an outcast replied shefford bitterly and you may be all you say but were alone now out here on the desert and this girls brother is absent you havent answered me yet is there anything between you and glen naspa except religion  no you insulting beggar  shefford had forced the reply that he had expected and which damned the missionary beyond any consideration  willetts you are a liar said shefford steadily  and what are you cried willetts in shrill fury ive heard all about you heretic atheist driven from your church hated and scorned for your blasphemy  then he gave way to ungovernable rage and cursed shefford as a religious fanatic might have cursed the most debased sinners shefford heard with the blood beating strangling the pulse in his ears somehow this missionary had learned his secretmost likely from the mormons in stonebridge and the terms of disgrace were coals of fire upon sheffords head strangely however he did not bow to them as had been his humble act in the past when his calumniators had arraigned and flayed him passion burned in him now for the first time in his life made a tiger of him and these raw emotions new to him were difficult to control  you cant take the girl he replied when the other had ceased not without her brothers consent  i will take her  shefford threw him out of the hogan and strode after him willetts had stumbled when he straightened up he was white and shaken he groped for the bridle of his horse while keeping his eyes upon shefford and when he found it he whirled quickly mounted and rode off shefford saw him halt a moment under the cedars to speak with the three strange indians and then he galloped away it came to shefford then that he had been unconscious of the last strained moment of that encounter he seemed all cold tight locked and was amazed to find his hand on his gun verily the wild environment had liberated strange instincts and impulses which he had answered that he had no regrets proved how he had changed  shefford heard the old woman scolding peering into the hogan he saw glen naspa flounce sullenly down for all the world like any other thwarted girl hosteen doetin came out and pointed down the slope at the departing missionary  heap talk jesusall talkall jesus he exclaimed contemptuously then he gave shefford a hard rap on the chest small talkheap man  the matter appeared to be adjusted for the present but shefford felt that he had made a bitter enemy and perhaps a powerful one  he prepared and ate his supper alone that evening for joe lake and nas ta bega did not put in an appearance he observed that the three strange indians whom he took for piutes kept to themselves and so far as he knew had no intercourse with any one at the camp this would not have seemed unusual considering the taciturn habit of indians had he not remembered seeing willetts speak to the trio what had he to do with them shefford was considering the situation with vague doubts when to his relief the three strangers rode off into the twilight then he went to bed  he was awakened by violence it was the gray hour before dawn dark forms knelt over him a cloth pressed down hard over his mouth strong hands bound it while other strong hands held him he could not cry out he could not struggle a heavy weight evidently a man held down his feet then he was rolled over securely bound and carried to be thrown like a sack over the back of a horse  all this happened so swiftly as to be bewildering he was too astounded to be frightened as he hung head downward he saw the legs of a horse and a dim trail a stirrup swung to and fro hitting him in the face he began to feel exceedingly uncomfortable with a rush of blood to his head and cramps in his arms and legs this kept on and grew worse for what seemed a long time then the horse was stopped and a rude hand tumbled him to the ground again he was rolled over on his face strong fingers plucked at his clothes and he believed he was being searched his captors were as silent as if they had been dumb he felt when they took his pocketbook and his knife and all that he had then they cut tore and stripped off all his clothing he was lifted carried a few steps and dropped upon what seemed a soft low mound and left lying there still tied and naked shefford heard the rustle of sage and the dull thud of hoofs as his assailants went away  his first sensation was one of immeasurable relief he had not been murdered robbery was nothing and though roughly handled he had not been hurt he associated the assault with the three strange visitors of the preceding day still he had no proof of that not the slightest clue remained to help him ascertain who had attacked him  it might have been a short while or a long one his mind was so filled with growing conjectures but a time came when he felt cold as he lay face down only his back felt cold at first he was grateful that he had not been thrown upon the rocks the ground under him appeared soft spongy and gave somewhat as he breathed he had really sunk down a little in this pile of soft earth the day was not far off as he could tell by the brightening of the gray he began to suffer with the cold and then slowly he seemed to freeze and grow numb in an effort to roll over upon his back he discovered that his position or his being bound or the numbness of his muscles was responsible for the fact that he could not move here was a predicament it began to look serious what would a few hours of the powerful sun do to his uncovered skin somebody would trail and find him still he might not be found soon  he saw the sky lighten turn rosy and then gold the sun shone upon him but some time elapsed before he felt its warmth all of a sudden a pain like a sting shot through his shoulder he could not see what caused it probably a bee then he felt another upon his leg and about simultaneously with it a tiny fiery stab in his side a sickening sensation pervaded his body slowly moving as if poison had entered the blood of his veins then a puncture as from a hot wire entered the skin of his breast unmistakably it was a bite by dint of great effort he twisted his head to see a big red ant on his breast then he heard a faint sound so exceedingly faint that he could not tell what it was like but presently his strained ears detected a low swift rustling creeping sound like the slipping rattle of an infinite number of tiny bits of moving gravel then it was a sound like the seeping of windblown sand several hot bites occurred at once and then with his head twisted he saw a red stream of ants pour out of the mound and spill over his quivering flesh  in an instant he realized his position he had been dropped intentionally upon an antheap which had sunk with his weight wedging him between the crusts at the mercy of those terrible desert ants a frantic effort to roll out proved futile as did another and another his violent muscular contractions infuriated the ants and in an instant he was writhing in pain so horrible and so unendurable that he nearly fainted but he was too strong to faint suddenly a bath of vitriol a stripping of his skin and red embers of fire thrown upon raw flesh could not have equaled this there was fury in the bites and poison in the fangs of these ants was this an indians brutal trick or was it the missionarys revenge shefford realized that it would kill him soon he sweat what seemed blood although perhaps the blood came from the bites a strange hollow buzzing roar filled his ears and it must have been the pouring of the angry ants from their mound  then followed a time that was hellworse than fire for fire would have given merciful deathagony under which his physical being began spasmodically to jerk and retchand his eyeballs turned and his breast caved in  a cry rang through the roar in his ears bi nai bi nai  his fading sight seemed to shade round the dark face of nas ta bega  then powerful hands dragged him from the mound through the grass and sage rolled him over and over and brushed his burning skin with strong swift sweep     ix in the desert crucible   that hard experience was but the beginning of many cruel trials for john shefford  he never knew who his assailants were nor their motive other than robbery and they had gotten little for they had not found the large sum of money sewed in the lining of his coat joe lake declared it was shadds work and the mormon showed the stern nature that lay hidden under his mild manner nas ta bega shook his head and would not tell what he thought but a somber fire burned in his eyes  the three started with a heavily laden packtrain and went down the mountain slope into west cañon the second day they were shot at from the rim of the walls lake was wounded hindering the swift flight necessary to escape deeper into the cañon here they hid for days while the mormon recovered and the indian took stealthy trips to try to locate the enemy lack of water and grass for the burros drove them on they climbed out of a side cañon losing several burros on a rough trail and had proceeded to within half a days journey of red lake when they were attacked while making camp in a cedar grove shefford sustained an exceedingly painful injury to his leg but fortunately the bullet went through without breaking a bone with that burning pain there came to shefford the meaning of fight and his rifle grew hot in his hands night alone saved the trio from certain fatality under the cover of darkness the indian helped shefford to escape joe lake looked out for himself the packtrain was lost and the mustangs except nackyal  shefford learned what it meant to lie out at night listening for pursuit cold to his marrow sick with dread and enduring frightful pain from a ragged bullethole next day the indian led him down into the red basin where the sun shone hot and the sand reflected the heat they had no water a wind arose and the valley became a place of flying sand through a heavy stifling pall nas ta bega somehow got shefford to the tradingpost at red lake presbrey attended to sheffords injury and made him comfortable next day joe lake limped in surly and somber with the news that shadd and eight or ten of his outlaw gang had gotten away with the packtrain  in short time shefford was able to ride and with his companions went over the pass to kayenta withers already knew of his loss and all he said was that he hoped to meet shadd some day  shefford showed a reluctance to go again to the hidden village in the silent cañon with the rounded walls the trader appeared surprised but did not press the point and shefford meant sooner or later to tell him yet never quite reached the point the early summer brought more work for the little post and shefford toiled with the others he liked the outdoor tasks and at night was grateful that he was too tired to think then followed trips to durango and bluff and monticello he rode fifty miles a day for many days he knew how a man fares who packs light and rides far and fast when the indian was with him he got along well but nas ta bega would not go near the towns thus many mishaps were sheffords fortune  many and many a mile he trailed his mustang for nackyal never forgot the sagi and always headed for it when he broke his hobbles shefford accompanied an indian teamster in to durango with a wagon and four wild mustangs upon the return with a heavy load of supplies accident put shefford in charge of the outfit in despair he had to face the hardest task that could have been given himto take care of a crippled indian catch water feed harness and drive four wild mustangs that did not know him and tried to kill him at every turn and to get that precious load of supplies home to kayenta that he accomplished it proved to hint the possibilities of a man for both endurance and patience from that time he never gave up in the front of any duty  in the absence of an available indian he rode to durango and back in record time upon one occasion he was lost in a cañon for days with no food and little water upon another he went through a sandstorm in the open desert facing it for forty miles and keeping to the trail when he rode in to kayenta that night the trader in grim praise said there was no worse to endure at monticello shefford stood off a band of desperadoes and this time shefford experienced a strange sickening shock in the wounding of a man later he had other fights but in none of them did he know whether or not he had shed blood  the heat of midsummer came when the blistering sun shone and a hot blast blew across the sand and the furious storms made floods in the washes day and night shefford was always in the open and any one who had ever known him in the past would have failed to recognize him now  in the early fall with nas ta bega as companion he set out to the south of kayenta upon longneglected business of the trader they visited red lake blue cañon keams cañon oribi the moki villages tuba moencopie and moen ave this trip took many weeks and gave shefford all the opportunity he wanted to study the indians and the conditions nearer to the border of civilization he learned the truth about the indians and the missionaries  upon the return trip he rode over the trail he had followed alone to red lake and thence on to the sagi and it seemed that years had passed since he first entered this wild region which had come to be home years that had molded him in the stern and fiery crucible of the desert     x stonebridge   in october shefford arranged for a hunt in the cresaw mountains with joe lake and nas ta bega the indian had gone home for a short visit and upon his return the party expected to start but nas ta bega did not come back then the arrival of a piute with news that excited withers and greatly perturbed lake convinced shefford that something was wrong  the little tradingpost seldom saw such disorder certainly shefford had never known the trader to neglect work joe lake threw a saddle on a mustang he would have scorned to notice in an ordinary moment and without a word of explanation or farewell rode hard to the north on the stonebridge trail  shefford had long since acquired patience he was curious but he did not care particularly what was in the wind however when withers came out and sent an indian to drive up the horses shefford could not refrain from a query  i hate to tell you replied the trader  go on added shefford quickly  did i tell you about the government sending a supreme court judge out to utah to prosecute the polygamists  no replied shefford  i forgot to i reckon youve been away a lot well theres been hell up in utah for six months lately this judge and his men have worked down into southern utah he visited bluff and monticello a few weeks ago now what do you think  withers is he coming to stonebridge  hes there now some one betrayed the whereabouts of the hidden village over in the cañon all the women have been arrested and taken to stonebridge the trial begins today  arrested echoed shefford blankly those poor lonely good women what on earth for  sealed wives exclaimed withers tersely this judge is after the polygamists they say hes absolutely relentless  butwomen cant be polygamists their husbands are the ones wanted  sure but the prosecutors have got to find the sealed wivesthe second wivesto find the lawbreaking husbands thatll be a job or i dont know mormons are you going to ride over to stonebridge with me  shefford shrank at the idea months of toil and pain and travail had not been enough to make him forget the strange girl he had loved but he had remembered only at poignant intervals and the lapse of time had made thought of her a dream like that sad dream which had lured him into the desert with the query of the trader came a bittersweet regret  better come with me said withers have you forgotten the sago lily shell be put on trial that girlthat child shefford you know she hasnt any friends and now no mormon man are protect her for fear of prosecution  ill go replied shefford shortly  the indian brought up the horses nackyal was thin from his long travel during the hot summer but he was as hard as iron and the way he pointed his keen nose toward the sagi showed how he wanted to make for the upland country with its clear springs and valleys of grass withers mounted his bay and with a hurried farewell to his wife spurred the mustang into the trail shefford took time to get his weapons and the light pack he always carried and then rode out after the trader  the pace withers set was the long steady lope to which these indian mustangs had been trained all their lives in an hour they reached the mouth of the sagi and at sight of it it seemed to shefford that the hard halfyear of suffering since he had been there had disappeared withers to sheffords regret did not enter the sagi he turned off to the north and took a wild trail into a split of the red wall and wound in and out and climbed a crack so narrow that the light was obscured and the cliffs could be reached from both sides of a horse  once up on the wild plateau shefford felt again in a different world from the barren desert he had lately known the desert had crucified him and had left him to die or survive according to his spirit and his strength if he had loved the glare the endless level the deceiving distance the shifting sand it had certainly not been as he loved this softer wilder more intimate upland with the red peaks shining up into the blue and the fragrance of cedar and pinyon and the purple sage and flowers and grass and splash of clear water over stoneswith these there came back to him something that he had lost and which had haunted him  it seemed he had returned to this wild upland of color and cañon and lofty crags and green valleys and silent places with a spirit gained from victory over himself in the harsher and sterner desert below and strange to him he found his old self the dreamer the artist the lover of beauty the searcher for he knew not what come to meet him on the fragrant wind  he felt this saw the old wildness with glad eyes yet the greater part of his mind was given over to the thought of the unfortunate women he expected to see in stonebridge  withers was harder to follow to keep up with than an indian for one thing he was a steady and tireless rider and for another there were times when he had no mercy on a horse then an indian always found easier steps in a trail and shorter cuts withers put his mount to some bad slopes and shefford had no choice but to follow but they crossed the great broken bench of upland without mishap and came out upon a promontory of a plateau from which shefford saw a wide valley and the darkgreen alfalfa fields of stonebridge  stonebridge lay in the center of a fertile valley surrounded by pink cliffs it must have been a very old town certainly far older than bluff or monticello though smaller and evidently it had been built to last there was one main street very wide that divided the town and was crossed at right angles by a stream spanned by a small natural stone bridge a line of poplartrees shaded each footpath the little log cabins and stone houses and cottages were half hidden in foliage now tinted with autumn colors toward the center of the town the houses and stores and shops fronted upon the street and along one side of a green square or plaza here were situated several edifices the most prominent of which was a church built of wood whitewashed and remarkable according to withers for the fact that not a nail had been used in its construction beyond the church was a large low structure of stone with a splitshingle roof and evidently this was the town hall  shefford saw before he reached the square that this day in stonebridge was one of singular action and excitement for a mormon village the town was full of people and judging from the horses hitched everywhere and the big canvascovered wagons many of the people were visitors a crowd surrounded the halla dusty booted spurred shirtsleeved and sombreroed assemblage that did not wear the hallmark shefford had come to associate with mormons they were riders cowboys horsewranglers and some of them shefford had seen in durango navajos and piutes were present also but they loitered in the background  withers drew shefford off to the side where under a tree they hitched their horses  never saw stonebridge full of a riffraff gang like this today said withers ill bet the mormons are wild theres a tough outfit from durango if they can get anything to drinkor if theyve got itstonebridge will see smoke today come on ill get in that hall  but before withers reached the hall he started violently and pulled up short then with apparent unconcern turned to lay a hand upon shefford the traders face had blanched and his eyes grew hard and shiny like flint he gripped sheffords arm  look over to your left he whispered see that gang of indians thereby the big wagon see the short indian with the chaps hes got a face big as a ham dark fierce thats shadd you ought to know him shadd and his outfit here hows that for nerve but he pulls a rein with the mormons  sheffords keen eye took in a lounging group of ten or twelve indians and several white men they did not present any great contrast to the other groups except that they were isolated appeared quiet and watchful and were all armed a bunch of lean racy mustangs restive and spirited stood near by in charge of an indian shefford had to take a second and closer glance to distinguish the halfbreed at once he recognized in shadd the broadfaced squat indian who had paid him a threatening visit that night long ago in the mouth of the sagi a fire ran along sheffords veins and seemed to concentrate in his breast shadds dark piercing eyes alighted upon shefford and rested there then the halfbreed spoke to one of his white outlaws and pointed at shefford his action attracted the attention of others in the gang and for a moment shefford and withers were treated to a keeneyed stare  the trader cursed low maybe i wouldnt like to mix it with that damned breed he said but what chance have we with that gang besides were here on other and more important business all the same before i forget let me remind you that shadd has had you spotted ever since you came out here a friendly piute told me only lately shefford did any indian between here and flagstaff ever see that bunch of money you persist in carrying  why yes i suppose soway back in tuba when i first came out replied shefford  huh well shadds after that come on now lets get inside the hall  the crowd opened for the trader who appeared to be known to everybody  a huge man with a bushy beard blocked the way to a shut door  hello meade said withers let us in  the man opened the door permitted withers and shefford to enter and then closed it  shefford coming out of the bright glare of sun into the hall could not see distinctly at first his eyes blurred he heard a subdued murmur of many voices withers appeared to be affected with the same kind of blindness for he stood bewildered a moment but he recovered sooner than shefford gradually the darkness shrouding many obscure forms lifted withers drew him through a crowd of men and women to one side of the hall and squeezed along a wall to a railing where progress was stopped  then shefford raised his head to look with bated breath and strange curiosity  the hall was large and had many windows men were in consultation upon a platform women to the number of twenty sat close together upon benches back of them stood another crowd but the women on the benches held sheffords gaze they were the prisoners they made a somber group some were hooded some veiled all clad in dark garments except one on the front bench and she was dressed in white she wore a long hood that concealed her face shefford recognized the hood and then the slender shape she was maryshe whom her jealous neighbors had named the sago lily at sight of her a sharp pain pierced sheffords breast his eyes were blurred when he forced them away from her and it took a moment for him to see clearly  withers was whispering to him or to some one near at hand but shefford did not catch the meaning of what was said he paid more attention however withers ceased speaking shefford gazed upon the crowd back of him the women were hooded and it was not possible to see what they looked like there were many stalwart cleancut young mormons of joe lakes type and these men appeared troubled even distressed and at a loss there was little about them resembling the stern quiet somber austerity of the more matured men and nothing at all of the strange aloof serene impassiveness of the graybearded old patriarchs these venerable men were the mormons of the old school the sons of the pioneers the ruthless fanatics instinctively shefford felt that it was in them that polygamy was embodied they were the husbands of the sealed wives he conceived an absorbing curiosity to learn if his instinct was correct and hard upon that followed a hot hateful eagerness to see which one was the husband of mary  theres bishop kane whispered withers nudging shefford and theres waggoner with him  shefford saw the bishop and then beside him a man of striking presence  whos waggoner asked shefford as he looked  he owns more than any mormon in southern utah replied the trader hes the biggest man in stonebridge thats sure but i dont know his relation to the church they dont call him elder or bishop but ill bet hes some pumpkins he never had any use for me or any gentile a closefisted tightlipped mormona skinflint if i ever saw one just look him over  shefford had been looking and considered it unlikely that he would ever forget this individual called waggoner he seemed old sixty at least yet at that only in the prime of a wonderful physical life unlike most of the others he wore his grizzled beard closecropped so close that it showed the lean wolfish line of his jaw all his features were of striking sharpness his eyes of a singularly brilliant blue were yet cold and pale the brow had a serious thoughtful cast long furrows sloped down the cheeks it was a strange secretive face full of a power that shefford had not seen in another mans full of intelligence and thought that had not been used as shefford had known them used among men the face mystified him it had so much more than the strange aloofness so characteristic of his fellows  waggoner had five wives and fiftyfive children before the law went into effect whispered withers nobody knows and nobody will ever know how many hes got now thats my private opinion  somehow after withers told that shefford seemed to understand the strange power in waggoners face absolutely it was not the force the strength given to a man from his years of control of men shefford long schooled now in his fairmindedness fought down the feelings of other years and waited with patience who was he to judge waggoner or any other mormon but whenever his glance strayed back to the quiet slender form in white when he realized again and again the appalling nature of this court his heart beat heavy and labored within his breast  then a bustle among the men upon the platform appeared to indicate that proceedings were about to begin some men left the platform several sat down at a table upon which were books and papers and others remained standing these last were all roughly garbed in ridingboots and spurs and sheffords keen eye detected the bulge of hidden weapons they looked like deputymarshals upon duty  somebody whispered that the judges name was stone the name fitted him he was not young and looked a man suited to the prosecution of these secret mormons he had a ponderous brow a deep cavernous eye that emitted gleams but betrayed no color or expression his mouth was the saving human feature of his stony face  shefford took the man upon the judges right hand to be a lawyer and the one on his left an officer of court perhaps a prosecuting attorney presently this fellow pounded upon the table and stood up as if to address a courtroom certainly he silenced that hallful of people then he perfunctorily and briefly stated that certain women had been arrested upon suspicion of being sealed wives of mormon polygamists and were to be herewith tried by a judge of the united states court shefford felt how the impressive words affected that silent hall of listeners but he gathered from the brief preliminaries that the trial could not be otherwise than a crude rapid investigation and perhaps for that the more sinister  the first woman on the foremost bench was led forward by a deputy to a vacant chair on the platform just in front of the judges table she was told to sit down and showed no sign that she had heard then the judge courteously asked her to take the chair she refused and stone nodded his head as if he had experienced that sort of thing before he stroked his chin wearily and shefford conceived an idea that he was a kind man if he was a relentless judge  please remove your veil requested the prosecutor  the woman did so and proved to be young and handsome shefford had a thrill as he recognized her she was ruth who had been one of his bestknown acquaintances in the hidden village she was pale angry almost sullen and her breast heaved she had no shame but she seemed to be outraged her dark eyes scornful and blazing passed over the judge and his assistants and on to the crowd behind the railing shefford keen as a blade with all his faculties absorbed fancied he saw ruth stiffen and change slightly as her glance encountered some one in that crowd then the prosecutor in deliberate and chosen words enjoined her to kiss the bible handed to her and swear to tell the truth how strange for shefford to see her kiss the book which he had studied for so many years stranger still to hear the low murmur from the listening audience as she took the oath  what is your name asked judge stone leaning back and fixing the cavernous eyes upon her  ruth jones was the cool reply  how old are you  twenty  where were you born went on the judge he allowed time for the clerk to record her answers  panguitch utah  were your parents mormons  yes  are you a mormon  yes  are you a married woman  no  the answer was instant cold final it seemed to the truth almost shefford believed she spoke truth the judge stroked his chin and waited a moment and then hesitatingly he went on  have youany children  no and the blazing eyes met the cavernous ones  that about the children was true enough shefford thought and he could have testified to it  you live in the hidden village near this town  yes  what is the name of this village  it has none  did you ever hear of fredonia another village far west of here  yes  it is in arizona near the utah line there are few men there is it the same kind of village as this one in which you live  yes  what does fredonia mean the namehas it any meaning  it means free women  the judge maintained silence for a moment turned to whisper to his assistants and presently without glancing up said to the woman  that will do  ruth was led back to the bench and the woman next to her brought forward this was a heavier person with the figure and step of a matured woman upon removing her bonnet she showed the plain face of a woman of forty and it was striking only in that strange stony aloofness noted in the older men here shefford thought was the real mormon different in a way he could not define from ruth this woman seated herself in the chair and calmly faced her prosecutors she manifested no emotion whatever shefford remembered her and could not see any change in her deportment this trial appeared to be of little moment to her and she took the oath as if doing so had been a habit all her life  what is your name asked judge stone glancing up from a paper he held  mary danton  family or married name  my husbands name was danton  was is he living  no  where did you live when you were married to him  in st george and later here in stonebridge  you were both mormons  yes  did you have any children by him  yes  how many  two  are they living  one of them is living  judge stone bent over his paper and then slowly raised his eyes to her face  are you married now  no  again the judge consulted his notes and held a whispered colloquy with the two men at his table  mrs danton when you were arrested there were five children found in your home to whom do they belong  me  are you their mother  yes  your husband danton is the father of only one the eldest according to your former statement is that correct  yes  who then is the fatheror who are the fathers of your other children  i do not know  she said it with the most stonyfaced calmness with utter disregard of what significance her words had a strong mystic wall of cold flint insulated her strangely it came to shefford how impossible either to doubt or believe her yet he did both judge stone showed a little heat  you dont know the father of one or all of these children he queried with sharp rising inflection of voice  i do not  madam i beg to remind you that you are under oath  the woman did not reply  these children are nameless thenillegitimate  they are  you swear you are not the sealed wife of some mormon  i swear  how do you livemaintain yourself  i work  what at  i weave sew bake and work in my garden  my men made note of your large and comfortable cabin even luxurious considering this country how is that  my husband left me comfortable  judge stone shook a warning finger at the defendant  suppose i were to sentence you to jail for perjury for a year far from your home and children would you speaktell the truth  i am telling the truth i cant speak what i dont know send me to jail  baffled with despairing angry impatience judge stone waved the woman away  that will do for her fetch the next one he said  one after another he examined three more women and arrived by various questions and answers different in tone and temper at precisely the same point as had been made in the case of mrs danton thereupon the proceedings rested a few moments while the judge consulted with his assistants  shefford was grateful for this respite he had been worked up to an unusual degree of interest and now as the next mormon woman to be examined was she whom he had loved and loved still he felt rise in him emotion that threatened to make him conspicuous unless it could be hidden the answers of these mormon women had been not altogether unexpected by him but once spoken in cold blood under oath how tragic how appallingly significant of the shadow the mystery the yoke that bound them he was amazed saddened he felt bewildered he needed to think out the meaning of the falsehoods of women he knew to be good and noble surely religion instead of fear and loyalty was the foundation and the strength of this disgrace this sacrifice absolutely shame was not in these women though they swore to shameful facts they had been coached to give these baffling answers every one of which seemed to brand them not the brazen mothers of illegitimate offspring but faithful unfortunate sealed wives to shefford the truth was not in their words but it sat upon their somber brows  was it only his heightened imagination or did the silence and the suspense grow more intense when a deputy led that darkhooded whiteclad slender woman to the defendants chair she did not walk with the poise that had been manifest in the other women and she sank into the chair as if she could no longer stand  please remove your hood requested the prosecutor  how well shefford remembered the strong shapely hands he saw them tremble at the knot of ribbon and that tremor was communicated to him in a sympathy which made his pulses beat he held his breath while she removed the hood and then there was revealed he thought the loveliest and the most tragic face that ever was seen in a courtroom  a low whispering murmur that swelled like a wave ran through the hall and by it shefford divined as clearly as if the fact had been blazoned on the walls that marys face had been unknown to these villagers but the name sago lily had not been unknown shefford heard it whispered on all sides  the murmuring subsided the judge and his assistants stared at mary as for shefford there was no need of his personal feeling to make the situation dramatic not improbably judge stone had tried many mormon women but manifestly this one was different unhooded mary appeared to be only a young girl and a court confronted suddenly with her youth and the suspicion attached to her could not but have been shocked then her beauty made her seem in that somber company indeed the white flower for which she had been named but more likely it was her agony that bound the court into silence which grew painful perhaps the thought that flashed into sheffords mind was telepathic it seemed to him that every watcher there realized that in this defendant the judge had a girl of softer mold of different spirit and from her the bitter truth could be wrung  mary faced the court and the crowd on that side of the platform unlike the other women she did not look at or seem to see any one behind the railing shefford was absolutely sure there was not a man or a woman who caught her glance she gazed afar with eyes strained humid fearful  when the prosecutor swore her to the oath her lips were seen to move but no one heard her speak  what is your name asked the judge  mary her voice was low with a slight tremor  whats your other name  i wont tell  her singular reply the tones of her voice her manner before the judge marked her with strange simplicity it was evident that she was not accustomed to questions  what were your parents names  i wont tell she replied very low  judge stone did not press the point perhaps he wanted to make the examination as easy as possible for her or to wait till she showed more composure  were your parents mormons he went on  no sir she added the sir with a quaint respect contrasting markedly with the short replies of the women before her  then you were not born a mormon  no sir  how old are you  seventeen or eighteen im not sure  you dont know your exact age  no  where were you born  i wont tell  was it in utah  yes sir  how long have you lived in this state  alwaysexcept last year  and thats been over in the hidden village where you were arrested  yes  but you often visited herethis town stonebridge  i never was heretill yesterday  judge stone regarded her as if his interest as a man was running counter to his duty as an officer suddenly he leaned forward  are you a mormon now he queried forcibly  no sir she replied and here her voice rose a little clearer  it was an unexpected reply judge stone stared at her the low buzz ran through the listening crowd and as for shefford he was astounded when his wits flashed back and he weighed her words and saw in her face truth as clear as light he had the strangest sensation of joy almost it flooded away the gloom and pain that attended this ordeal  the judge bent his head to his assistants as if for counsel all of them were eager where formerly they had been weary shefford glanced around at the dark and somber faces and a slow wrath grew within him then he caught a glimpse of waggoner the steelblue piercing intensity of the mormons gaze impressed him at a moment when all that older generation of mormons looked as hard and immutable as iron either shefford was overexcited and mistaken or the hour had become fraught with greater suspense the secret the mystery the power the hate the religion of a strange people were thick and tangible in that hall for shefford the feeling of the presence of withers on his left was entirely different from that of the mormon on his other side if there was not a shadow there then the sun did not shine so brightly as it had shone when he entered the air seemed clogged with nameless passion  i gather that youve lived mostly in the countryaway from people the judge began  yes sir replied the girl  do you know anything about the government of the united states  no sir  he pondered again evidently weighing his queries leading up to the fatal and inevitable question  still his interest in this particular defendant had become visible  have you any idea of the consequences of perjury  no sir  do you understand what perjury is  its to lie  do you tell lies  no sir  have you ever told a single lie  notyet she replied almost whispering  it was the answer of a child and affected the judge he fussed with his papers perhaps his task was not easy certainly it was not pleasant then he leaned forward again and fixed those deep cavernous eyes upon the sad face  do you understand what a sealed wife is  ive never been told  but you know there are sealed wives in utah  yes sir ive been told that  judge stone halted there watching her the hall was silent except for faint rustlings and here and there deep breaths drawn guardedly the vital question hung like a sword over the whitefaced girl perhaps she divined its impending stroke for she sat like a stone with dilating appealing eyes upon her executioner  are you a sealed wife he flung at her  she could not answer at once she made effort but the words would not come he flung the question again sternly  no she cried  and then there was silence that poignant word quivered in sheffords heart he believed it was a lie it seemed he would have known it if this hour was the first in which he had ever seen the girl he heard he felt he sensed the fatal thing the beautiful voice had lacked some quality before present and the thing wanting was something subtle an essence a beautiful ringthe truth what a hellish thing to make that pure girl a liara perjurer the heat deep within shefford kindled to fire  you are not married went on judge stone  no sir she answered faintly  have you ever been married  no sir  do you expect ever to be married  oh no sir  she was ashen pale now quivering all over with her strong hands clasping the black hood and she could no longer meet the judges glance  have youanyany children the judge asked haltingly it was a hard question to get out  no  judge stone leaned far over the table and that his face was purple showed shefford he was a man his big fist clenched  girl youre not going to swear you too were visitedover there by men youre not going to swear that  ohno sir  judge stone settled back in his chair and while he wiped his moist face that same foreboding murmur almost a menace moaned through the hall  shefford was sick in his soul and afraid of himself he did not know this spirit that flamed up in him his helplessness was a most hateful fact  comeconfess you are a sealed wife called her interrogator  she maintained silence but shook her head  suddenly he seemed to leap forward  unfortunate child confess  that forced her to lift her head and face him yet still she did not speak it was the strength of despair she could not endure much more  who is your husband he thundered at her  she rose wildly terrorstricken it was terror that dominated her not of the stern judge for she took a faltering step toward him lifting a shaking hand but of some one or of some thing far more terrible than any punishment she could have received in the sentence of a court still she was not proof against the judges will she had weakened and the terror must have been because of that weakening  who is the mormon who visits you he thundered relentlessly  ineverknewhisname  but youd know his face ill arrest every mormon in this country and bring him before you youd know his face  oh i wouldnt i couldnt tell ineversaw his facein the light  the tragic beauty of her the certainty of some monstrous crime to youth and innocence the presence of an agony and terror that unfathomably seemed not to be for herselfthese transfixed the court and the audience and held them silenced till she reached out blindly and then sank in a heap to the floor     xi after the trial   shefford might have leaped over the railing but for witherss restraining hand and when there appeared to be some sign of kindness in those other women for the unconscious girl shefford squeezed through the crowd and got out of the hall  the gang outside that had been denied admittance pressed upon shefford with jest and curious query and a good nature that jarred upon him he was far from gentle as he jostled off the first importuning fellows the others gaping at him opened a lane for him to pass through  then there was a hand laid on his shoulder that he did not shake off nas ta bega loomed dark and tall beside him neither the trader nor joe lake nor any white man shefford had met influenced him as this navajo  nas ta bega you here too i guess the whole country is here we waited at kayenta what kept you so long  the indian always slow to answer did not open his lips till he drew shefford apart from the noisy crowd  bi nai there is sorrow in the hogan of hosteen doetin he said  glen naspa exclaimed shefford  my sister is gone from the home of her brother she went away alone in the summer  blue cañon she went to the missionary nas ta bega i thought i saw her there but i wasnt sure i didnt want to make sure i was afraid it might be true  a brave who loved my sister trailed her there  nas ta bega will youwill we go find her take her home  no she will come home some day  what bitter sadness and wisdom in his words  but my friend that damned missionary began shefford passionately the indian had met him at a bad hour  willetts is here i saw him go in there interrupted nas ta bega and he pointed to the hall  here he gets around a good deal declared shefford nas ta bega what are you going to do to him  the indian held his peace and there was no telling from his inscrutable face what might be in his mind he was dark impassive he seemed a wise and bitter indian beyond any savagery of his tribe and the suffering shefford divined was deep  hed better keep out of my sight muttered shefford more to himself than to his companion  the halfbreed is here said nas ta bega  shadd yes we saw him there hes still with his gang nas ta bega what are they up to  they will steal what they can  withers says shadd is friendly with the mormons  yes and with the missionary too  with willetts  i saw them talk togetherstrong talk  strange but maybe its not so strange shadd is known well in monticello and bluff he spends money there they are afraid of him but hes welcome just the same perhaps everybody knows him itd be like him to ride into kayenta but nas ta bega ive got to look out for him because withers says hes after me  bi nai wears a scar that is proof said the indian  then it must be he found out long ago i had a little money  it might be but bi nai the halfbreed has a strange step on your trail  what do you mean demanded shefford  nas ta bega cannot tell what he does not know replied the navajo let that be we shall know some day bi nai there is sorrow to tell that is not the indians sorrow for my brother  shefford lifted his eyes to the indians and if he did not see sadness there he was much deceived  bi nai long ago you told a story to the trader nas ta bega sat before the fire that night you did not know he could understand your language he listened and he learned what brought you to the country of the indian that night he made you his brother all his lonely rides into the cañon have been to find the little goldenhaired child the lost girlfay larkin bi nai i have found the girl you wanted for your sweetheart  shefford was bereft of speech he could not see steadily and the last solemn words of the indian seemed far away  bi nai i have found fay larkin repeated nas ta bega  fay larkin gasped shefford shaking his head butshes dead  it would be less sorrow for bi nai if she were dead  shefford clutched at the indian there was something terrible to be revealed like an aspenleaf in the wind he shook all over he divined the revelationdivined the coming blowbut that was as far as his mind got  shes in there said the indian pointing toward hall  fay larkin whispered shefford  yes bi nai  my god how do you know oh i could have seen ive been blind  tell me indian which one  fay larkin is the sago lily             shefford strode away into a secluded corner of the square where in the shade and quiet of the trees he suffered a storm of heart and mind during that short or long timehe had no idea how longthe indian remained with him he never lost the feeling of nas ta bega close beside him when the period of acute pain left him and some order began to replace the tumult in his mind he felt in nas ta bega the same qualitysilence or strength or helpthat he had learned to feel in the deep cañon and the lofty crags he realized then that the indian was indeed a brother and shefford needed him what he had to fight was more fatal than suffering and loveit was hate rising out of the unsuspected dark gulf of his heartthe instinct to killthe murder in his soul only now did he come to understand jane withersteens tragic story and the passion of venters and what had made lassiter a gunman the desert had transformed shefford the elements had entered into his muscle and bone into the very fiber of his heart sun wind sand cold storm space stone the poison cactus the racking toil the terrible lonelinessthe iron of the desert man the cruelty of the desert savage the wildness of the mustang the ferocity of hawk and wolf the bitter struggle of every surviving thingthese were as if they had been melted and merged together and now made a dark and passionate stream that was his throbbing blood he realized what he had become and gloried in it yet there looking on with grave and earnest eyes was his old self the man of reason of intellect of culture who had been a good man despite the failure and shame of his life and he gave heed to the voice of warning of conscience not by revengefully seeking the mormon who had ruined fay larkin and blindly dealing a wild justice could he help this unfortunate girl this fierce newborn strength and passion must be tempered by reason lest he become merely elemental a man answering wholly to primitive impulses in the darkness of that hour he mined deep into his heart understood himself trembled at the thing he faced and won his victory he would go forth from that hour a man he might fight and perhaps there was death in the balance but hate would never overthrow him  then when he looked at future action he felt a strange unalterable purpose to save fay larkin she was very youngseventeen or eighteen she had saidand there could be there must be some happiness before her it had been his dream to chase a rainbowit had been his determination to find her in the lost surprise valley well he had found her it never occurred to him to ask nas ta bega how he had discovered that the sago lily was fay larkin the wonder was shefford thought that he had so long been blind himself how simply everything worked out now every thought every recollection of her was proof her strange beauty like that of the sweet and rare lily her low voice that showed the habit of silence her shapely hands with the clasp strong as a mans her lithe form her swift step her wonderful agility upon the smooth steep trails and the wildness of her upon the heights and the haunting brooding shadow of her eyes when she gazed across the cañonall these fitted so harmoniously the conception of a child lost in a beautiful surprise valley and growing up in its wildness and silence tutored by the sad love of broken jane and lassiter yes to save her had been sheffords dream and he had loved that dream he had loved the dream and he had loved the child the secret of her hidingplace as revealed by the story told him and his slow growth from dream to actionthese had strangely given fay larkin to him then had come the bitter knowledge that she was dead in the light of this subsequent revelation how easy to account for his loving mary too never would she be mary again to him fay larkin and the sago lily were one and the same she was here near him and he was powerless for the present to help her or to reveal himself she was held back there in that gloomy hall among those somber mormons alien to the women bound in some fatal way to one of the men and now by reason of her weakness in the trial surely to be hated thinking of her past and her present of the future and that secret mormon whose face she had never seen shefford felt a sinking of his heart a terrible cold pang in his breast a fainting of his spirit she had sworn she was no sealed wife but had she not lied so then how utterly powerless he was  but here to save him to uplift him came that strange mystic insight which had been the gift of the desert to him she was not dead he had found her what mattered obstacles even that implacable creed to which she had been sacrificed in the face of this blessed and overwhelming truth it was as mighty as the love suddenly dawning upon him a strong and terrible and deathly sweet wind seemed to fill his soul with the love of her it was her fate that had drawn him and now it was her agony her innocence her beauty that bound him for all time patience and cunning and toil passion and blood the unquenchable spirit of a man to savethese were nothing to givelife itself were little could he but free her  patience and cunning his sharpening mind cut these out as his greatest assets for the present and his thoughts flashed like light through his brain judge stone and his court would fail to convict any mormon in stonebridge just the same as they had failed in the northern towns they would go away and stonebridge would fall to the slow sleepy tenor of its former way the hidden village must become known to all men honest and outlawed in that country but this fact would hardly make any quick change in the plans of the mormons they did not soon change they would send the sealed wives back to the cañon and after the excitement had died down visit them as usual nothing perhaps would ever change these old mormons but death  shefford resolved to remain in stonebridge and ingratiate himself deeper into the regard of the mormons he would find work there if the sealed wives were not returned to the hidden village in case the women went back to the valley shefford meant to resume his old duty of driving witherss packtrains wanting that opportunity he would find some other work some excuse to take him there in due time he would reveal to fay larkin that he knew her how the thought thrilled him she might deny might persist in her fear might fight to keep her secret but he would learn ithear her storyhear what had become of jane withersteen and lassiterand if they were alive which now he believed he would find themand he would take them and fay out of the country  the duty the great task held a grim fascination for him he had a foreboding of the cost he had a dark realization of the force he meant to oppose there were duty here and pity and unselfish love but these alone did not actuate shefford mystically fate seemed again to come like a gleam and bid him follow  when shefford and nas ta bega returned to the town hall the trial had been ended the hall was closed and only a few indians and cowboys remained in the square and they were about to depart on the street however and the paths and in the doorways of stores were knots of people talking earnestly shefford walked up and down hoping to meet withers or joe lake nas ta bega said he would take the horses to water and feed and then return  there were indications that stonebridge might experience some of the excitement and perhaps violence common to towns like monticello and durango there was only one saloon in stonebridge and it was full of roystering cowboys and horsewranglers shefford saw the bunch of mustangs in charge of the same indian that belonged to shadd and his gang the men were inside drinking next door was a tavern called hopewell house a stone structure of some pretensions there were indians lounging outside shefford entered through a wide door and found himself in a large bare room boarded like a loft with no ceiling except the roof the place was full of men and noise here he encountered joe lake talking to bishop kane and other mormons shefford got a friendly greeting from the bishop and then was well received by the strangers to whom joe introduced him  have you seen withers asked shefford  reckon hes around somewhere replied joe better hang up here for hell drop in sooner or later  when are you going back to kayenta went on shefford  hard to say well have to call off our hunt nas ta bega is here too  yes ive been with him  the older mormons drew aside and then joe mentioned the fact that he was half starved shefford went with him into another clapboard room which was evidently a diningroom there were half a dozen men at the long table the seat at the end was a box and scarcely large enough or safe enough for joe and shefford but they risked it  saw you in the hall said joe hellwasnt it  joe i never knew how much i dared say to you so i dont talk much but it was hell replied shefford  you neednt be so scared of me spoke up joe testily  that was the first time shefford had heard the mormon speak that way  im not scared joe but i like yourespect you i cant say so much ofof your people  did you stick out the whole mix asked joe  no i had enough whenwhen they got through with mary shefford spoke low and dropped his head he heard the mormon grind his teeth there was silence for a little space while neither man looked at the other  reckon the judge was pretty decent presently said joe  yes i thought so he might have but shefford did not finish that sentence howd the thing end  it ended all right  was there no convictionno sentence shefford felt a curious eagerness  naw he snorted that court might have saved its breath  i suppose well joe between you and me as old friends now that trial established one fact even if it couldnt be proved those women are sealed wives  joe had no reply for that he looked gloomy and there was a stern line in his lips today he seemed more like a mormon  judge stone knew that as well as i knew went on shefford any man of penetration could have seen it what an ordeal that was for good women to go through i know theyre good and there they were swearing to  didnt it make me sick interrupted joe in a kind of growl reckon it made judge stone sick too after mary went under he conducted that trial like a man cuttin out steers at a roundup he wanted to get it over he never forced any question bad job to ride down stonebridge way its out of creation theres only six men in the party with a poor lot of horses really government officers or not theyre not safe and theyve taken a hunch  have they left already inquired shefford  were packed an hour ago i didnt see them go but somebody said they went took the trail for bluff which sure is the only trail they could take unless they wanted to go to colorado by way of kayenta that might have been the safest trail  joe what might happen to them asked shefford quietly with eyes on the mormon  aw you know that rough trail bad on horses weathered slopesslipping ledgesa rock might fall on you any time then shadds here with his gang and bad piutes  what became of the women shefford asked presently  theyre around among friends  where are their children  left over there with the old women couldnt be fetched over but there are some pretty young babies in that bunchneed their mothers  i shouldthink so replied shefford constrainedly when will their mothers get back to them  tonight maybe if this mob of cowpunchers and wranglers get out of town its a bad mix shefford heres a hunch on that these fellows will get full of whisky and trouble might come if theyapproach the women  you mean they might get drunk enough to take the oaths of those poor womentake the meaning literallypretend to believe the women what they swore they were  reckon youve got the hunch replied joe gloomily  my god man that would be horrible exclaimed shefford  horrible or not its liable to happen the women can be kept here yet awhile reckon there wont be any trouble here itll be over there in the valley shefford getting the women over there safe is a job thats been put to me ive got a bunch of fellows already can i count on you im glad to say youre well thought of bishop kane liked you and what he says goes  yes joe you can count on me replied shefford  they finished their meal then and repaired to the big officeroom of the house several groups of men were there and loud talk was going on outside shefford saw withers talking to bishop kane and two other mormons both strangers to shefford the trader appeared to be speaking with unwonted force emphasizing his words with energetic movements of his hands  reckon somethings up whispered joe hoarsely its been in the air all day  withers must have been watching for shefford  heres shefford now he said to the trio of mormons as joe and shefford reached the group i want you to hear him speak for himself  whats the matter asked shefford  give me a hunch and ill put in my sayso said joe lake  shefford its the matter of a good name more than a job replied the trader a little while back i told the bishop i meant to put you on the pack job over to the valleysame as when you first came to me well the bishop was pleased and said he might put something in your way just now i ran in here to find younot wanted when i kicked i got the straight hunch willetts has said things about you one of themthe one that sticks in my crawwas that youd do anything even pretend to be inclined toward mormonism just to be among those mormon women over there willetts is your enemy and hes worse than i thought now i want you to tell bishop kane why this missionary is bitter toward you  gentlemen i knocked him down replied shefford simply  what for inquired the bishop in surprise and curiosity  shefford related the incident which had occurred at red lake and that now seemed again to come forward fatefully  you insinuate he had evil intent toward the indian girl queried kane  i insinuate nothing i merely state what led to my acting as i did  principles of religion sir  no a mans principles  withers interposed in his blunt way bishop did you ever see glen naspa  no  shes the prettiest navajo in the country willetts was after her thats all  my dear man i cant believe that of a christian missionary weve known willetts for years hes a man of influence he has money back of him hes doing a good work you hint of a love relation  no i dont hint replied withers impatiently i know its not the first time ive known a missionary to do this sort of thing nor is it the first time for willetts bishop kane i live among the indians i see a lot i never speak of my work is to trade with the indians thats all but ill not have willetts or any other damned hypocrite run down my friend here john shefford is the finest young man that ever came to me in the desert and hes got to be put right before you all or ill not set foot in stonebridge again willetts was after glen naspa shefford punched him and later threw him out of the old indians hogan up on the mountain that explains willettss enmity he was after the girl  whats more gentlemen he got her added shefford glen naspa has not been home for six months i saw her at blue cañon i would like to face this willetts before you all  easy enough replied withers with a grim chuckle hes just outside  the trader went out joe lake followed at his heels and the three mormons were next shefford brought up the rear and lingered in the door while his eye swept the crowd of men and indians his feeling was in direct contrast to his movements he felt the throbbing of fierce anger but it seemed a face came between him and his passiona sweet and tragic face that would have had power to check him in a vastly more critical moment than this and in an instant he had himself in hand and strangely suddenly felt the strength that had come to him  willetts stood in earnest colloquy with a short squat indianthe halfbreed shadd they leaned against a hitchingrail other indians were there and outlaws it was a mixed group rough and hardlooking  hey willetts called the trader and his loud ringing voice not pleasant stilled the movement and sound  when willetts turned shefford was halfway across the wide walk the missionary not only saw him but also nas ta bega who was striding forward joe lake was ahead of the trader the mormons followed with decision and they all confronted willetts he turned pale shadd had cautiously moved along the rail nearer to his gang and then they with the others of the curious crowd drew closer  willetts heres shefford now say it to his face declared the trader he was angry and evidently wanted the fact known as well as the situation  willetts had paled but he showed boldness for an instant shefford studied the smooth face with its sloping lines the dark winecolored eyes  willetts i understand youve maligned me to bishop kane and others began shefford curtly  i called you an atheist returned the missionary harshly  yes and more than that and i told these men why you vented your spite on me  willetts uttered a halflaugh an uneasy contemptuous expression of scorn and repudiation  the charges of such a man as you are cant hurt me he said  the man did not show fear so much as disgust at the meeting he seemed to be absorbed in thought yet no serious consideration of the situation made itself manifest shefford felt puzzled perhaps there was no fire to strike from this man the desert had certainly not made him flint he had not toiled or suffered or fought  but i can hurt you thundered shefford with startling suddenness here look at this indian do you know him glen naspas brother look at him let us see you face him while i accuse you you made love to glen naspatook her from her home  harping infidel replied willetts hoarsely so thats your game well glen naspa came to my school of her own accord and she will say so  why will she because you blinded the simple indian girl willetts ill waste little more time on you  and swift and light as a panther shefford leaped upon the man and fastening powerful hands round the thick neck bore him to his knees and bent back his head over the rail there was a convulsive struggle a hard flinging of arms a straining wrestle and then willetts was in a dreadful position shefford held him in iron grasp  you damned whitelivered hypocriteim liable to kill you cried shefford i watched you and glen naspa that day up on the mountain i saw you embrace her i saw that she loved you tell that you liar thatll be enough  the face of the missionary turned purple as shefford forced his head back over the rail  ill kill you man repeated shefford piercingly do you want to go to your god unprepared say you made love to glen naspatell that you persuaded her to leave her home quick  willetts raised a shaking hand and then shefford relaxed the paralyzing grip and let his head come forward the halfstrangled man gasped out a few incoherent words that his livid guilty face made unnecessary  shefford gave him a shove and he fell into the dust at the feet of the navajo  gentlemen i leave him to nas ta bega said shefford with a strange change from passion to calmness  late that night when the roystering visitors had gone or were deep in drunken slumber a melancholy and strange procession filed out of stonebridge joe lake and his armed comrades were escorting the mormon women back to the hidden valley they were mounted on burros and mustangs and in all that dark and somber line there was only one figure which shone white under the pale moon  at the starting until that whiteclad figure had appeared sheffords heart had seemed to be in his throat and thereafter its beat was muffled and painful in his breast yet there was some sad sweetness in the knowledge that he could see her now be near her watch over her  by and by the overcast clouds drifted and the moon shone bright the night was still the great dark mountain loomed to the stars the numberless waves of rounded rock that must be crossed and circled lay deep in shadow there was only a steady pattering of light hoofs  sheffords place was near the end of the line and he kept well back riding close to one woman and then another no word was spoken these sealed wives rode where their mounts were led or driven as blind in their hoods as veiled arab women in palanquins and their heads drooped wearily and their shoulders bent as if under a burden it took an hour of steady riding to reach the ascent to the plateau and here with the beginning of rough and smooth and shadowed trail the work of the escort began the line lengthened out and each man kept to the several women assigned to him shefford had three and one of them was the girl he loved she rode as if the world and time and life were naught to her as soon as he dared trust his voice and his control he meant to let her know the man whom perhaps she had not forgotten was there with her a friend six months it had been a lifetime to him surely eternity to her had she forgotten he felt like a coward who had basely deserted her ohhad he only known  she rode a burro that was slow continually blocking the passage for those behind and eventually it became lame thus the other women forged ahead shefford dismounted and stopped her burro it was a moment before she noted the halt and twice in that time shefford tried to speak and failed what poignant pain regret love made his utterance fail  ride my horse he finally said and his voice was not like his own  obediently and wearily she dismounted from the burro and got up on nackyal the stirrups were long for her and he had to change them his fingers were all thumbs as he fumbled with the buckles  suddenly he became aware that there had been a subtle change in her he knew it without looking up and he seemed to be unable to go on with his task if his life had depended upon keeping his head lowered he could not have done it the listlessness of her drooping form was no longer manifest the peak of the dark hood pointed toward him he knew then that she was gazing at him  never so long as he lived would that moment be forgotten they were alone the others had gotten so far ahead that no sound came back the stillness was so deep it could be felt the moon shone with white cold radiance and the shining slopes of smooth stone waved away crossed by shadows of pinyons  then she leaned a little toward him one swift hand flew up to tear the black hood back so that she could see in its place flashed her white face and her eyes were like the night  you she whispered  his blood came leaping to sting neck and cheek and temple what dared he interpret from that single word could any other word have meant so much  nooneelse he replied unsteadily  her white hand flashed again to him and he met it with his own he felt himself standing cold and motionless in the moonlight he saw her wonderful with the deep shadowy eyes and a silver sheen on her hair and as he looked she released her hand and lifted it with the other to her hood he saw the shiny hair darken and disappearand then the lovely face with its sad eyes and tragic lips  he drew nackyals bridle forward and led him up the moonlit trail     xii the revelation   the following afternoon cowboys and horsewranglers keeneyed as indians for tracks and trails began to arrive in the quiet valley to which the mormon women had been returned  under every cedar clump there were hobbled horses packs and rolled bedding in tarpaulins shefford and joe lake had pitched camp in the old site near the spring the other men of joes escort went to the homes of the women and that afternoon as the curious visitors began to arrive these homes became barred and dark and quiet as if they had been closed and deserted for the winter not a woman showed herself  shefford and joe by reason of the location of their camp and their alertness met all the newcomers the ride from stonebridge was a long and hard one calculated to wear off the effects of the whisky imbibed by the adventureseekers this fact alone saved the situation nevertheless joe expected trouble most of the visitors were decent goodnatured fellows merely curious and simple enough to believe that this really was what the mormons had claimeda village of free women but there were those among them who were coarse evilminded and dangerous  by suppertime there were two dozen or more of these men in the valley camped along the west wall fires were lighted smoke curled up over the cedars gay songs disturbed the usual serenity of the place later in the early twilight the curious visitors by twos and threes walked about the village peering at the dark cabins and jesting among themselves joe had informed shefford that all the women had been put in a limited number of cabins so that they could be protected so far as shefford saw or heard there was no unpleasant incident in the village however as the sauntering visitors returned toward their camps they loitered at the spring and here developments threatened  in spite of the fact that the majority of these cowboys and their comrades were decentminded and beginning to see the real relation of things they were not disposed to be civil to shefford they were certainly not mormons and his position apparently as a gentile among these mormons was one open to criticism they might have been jealous too at any rate remarks were passed in his hearing meant for his ears that made it exceedingly trying for him not to resent moreover joe lakes increasing impatience rendered the situation more difficult shefford welcomed the arrival of nas ta bega the indian listened to the loud talk of several loungers round the campfire and thereafter he was like sheffords shadow silent somber watchful  nevertheless it did not happen to be one of the friendly and sarcastic cowboys that precipitated the crisis a horsewrangler named hurley a man of bad repute as much outlaw as anything took up the bantering  say shefford what in the hells your job here anyway he queried as he kicked a cedar branch into the campfire the brightening blaze showed him swarthy unshaven a largefeatured ugly man  ive been doing odd jobs for withers replied shefford expect to drive packtrains in here for a while  you must stand strong with these mormons must be a mormon yerself  no replied shefford briefly  wal im stuck on your job do you need a packer i can throw a diamondhitch better n any feller in this country  i dont need help  mebbe youll take me over to see the ladies he went on with a coarse laugh  shefford did not show that he had heard hurley waited leering as looked from the keen listeners to shefford  want to have them all yerself eh he jeered  shefford struck himsent him tumbling heavily like a log hurley cursing as he half rose jerked his gun out nas ta bega swift as light kicked the gun out of his hand and joe lake picked it up  deliberately the mormon cocked the weapon and stood over hurley  get up he ordered and shefford heard the ruthless mormon in him then  hurley rose slowly then joe prodded him in the middle with the cocked gun shefford startled expected the gun to go off so did the others especially hurley who shrank in panic from the dark mormon  rustle said joe and gave the man a harder prod assuredly the gun did not have a hairtrigger  joe mebbe its loaded protested one of the cowboys  hurley shrank back and turned to hurry away with joe close after him they disappeared in the darkness a constrained silence was maintained around the campfire for a while presently some of the men walked off and others began to converse everybody heard the sound of hoofs passing down the trail the patter ceased and in a few moments lake returned he still carried hurleys gun  the crowd dispersed then there was no indication of further trouble however shefford and joe and nas ta bega divided the night in watches so that some one would be wide awake  early next morning there was an exodus from the village of the better element among the visitors no fun hangin round hyar one of them expressed it and as goodnaturedly as they had come they rode away six or seven of the desperado class remained behind bent on mischief and they were reinforced by more arrivals from stonebridge they avoided the camp by the spring and when shefford and lake attempted to go to them they gave them a wide berth this caused joe to assert that they were up to some dirty work all morning they lounged around under the cedars keeping out of sight and evidently the reinforcement from stonebridge had brought liquor when they gathered together at their camp half drunk all noisy some wanting to swagger off into the village and others trying to hold them back joe lake said grimly that somebody was going to get shot indeed shefford saw that there was every likelihood of bloodshed  reckon wed better take to one of the cabins said joe  thereupon the three repaired to the nearest cabin and entering kept watch from the windows during a couple of hours however they did not see or hear anything of the ruffians then came a shot from over in the village a single yell and after that a scattering volley the silence and suspense which followed were finally broken by hoofbeats nas ta bega called joe and shefford to the window he had been stationed at from here they saw the unwelcome visitors ride down the trail to disappear in the cedars toward the outlet of the valley joe who had numbered them said that all but one of them had gone  reckon he got it added joe  so indeed it turned out one of the men a wellknown rustler named harker had been killed by whom no one seemed to know he had brazenly tried to force his way into one of the houses and the act had cost him his life naturally shefford never free from his civilized habit of thought remarked apprehensively that he hoped this affair would not cause the poor women to be arrested again and haled before some rude court  law grunted joe there aint any the nearest sheriff is in durango thats colorado and hed give us a medal for killing harker it was a good job for itll teach these rowdies a lesson  next day the old order of life was resumed in the village and the arrival of a heavily laden packtrain under the guidance of withers attested to the fact that the mormons meant not only to continue to live in the valley but also to build and plant and enlarge this was good news to shefford at least the village could be made less lonely and there was plenty of work to give him excuse for staying there furthermore withers brought a message form bishop kane to the effect that the young man was offered a place as teacher in the school in cooperation with the mormon teachers shefford experienced no twinge of conscience when he accepted  it was the fourth evening after the nevertobeforgotten moonlight ride to the valley that shefford passed under the dark pinyontrees on his way to fay larkins cottage he paused in the gloom and memory beset him the six months were annihilated and it was the night he had fled but now all was silent he seemed to be trying to drag himself back a beginning must be made only how to meet herwhat to saywhat to conceal  he tapped on the door and she came out after all it was a meeting vastly different from what his feeling made him imagine it might have been she was nervous frightened as were all the other women for that matter she was alone in the cottage he made haste to reassure her about the improbability of any further trouble such as had befallen the last week as he had always done on those former visits to her he talked rapidly using all his wit and here his emotion made him eloquent he avoided personalities except to tell about his prospects of work in the village and he sought above all to lead her mind from thought of herself and her condition before he left her he had the gladness of knowing he had succeeded  when he said good night he felt the strange falsity of his position he did not expect to be able to keep up the deception for long that roused him and half the night he lay awake thinking next day he was the life of the work and study and play in that village kindness and goodwill did not need inspiration but it was keen deep passion that made him a plotter for influence and friendship was there a woman in the village whom he might trust in case he needed one and his instinct guided him to her whom he had liked wellruth ruth jones she had called herself at the trial and when shefford used the name she laughed mockingly ruth was not very religious and sometimes she was bitter and hard she wanted life and here she was a prisoner in a lonely valley she welcomed sheffords visits he imagined that she had slightly changed and whether it was the added six months with its trouble and pain or a growing revolt he could not tell after a time he divined that the inevitable retrogression had set in she had not enough faith to uphold the burden she had accepted nor the courage to cast it off she was ready to love him that did not frighten shefford and if she did love him he was not so sure it would not be an anchor for her he saw her danger and then he became what he had never really been in all the days of his ministrythe real helper unselfishly for her sake he found power to influence her and selfishly for the sake of fay larkin he began slowly to win her to a possible need  the days passed swiftly mormons came and went though in the open day as laborers new cabins went up and a store and other improvements some part of every evening shefford spent with fay and these visits were no longer unknown to the village women gossiped in a friendly way about shefford but with jealous tongues about the girl joe lake told shefford the run of the village talk anything concerning the sago lily the droll mormon took to heart he had been hard hit and admitted it sometimes he went with shefford to call upon her but he talked little and never remained long shefford had anticipated antagonism on the part of joe however he did not find it  shefford really lived through the busy day for that hour with fay in the twilight and every evening seemed the same he would find her in the dark alone silent brooding hopeless her mood did not puzzle him but how to keep from plunging her deeper into despair baffled him he exhausted all his powers trying to do for her what he had been able to do for ruth yet he failed something had blunted her the shadow of that baneful trial hovered over her and he came to sense a strange terror in her it was mostly always present was she thinking of jane withersteen and lassiter left dead or imprisoned in the valley from which she had been brought so mysteriously shefford wearied his brain revolving these questions the fate of her friends and the cross she boreof these was tragedy born but the terrorthat shefford divined came of waiting for the visit of the mormon whose face she had never seen shefford prayed that he might never meet this man finally he grew desperate when he first arrived at the girls home she would speak she showed gladness relief and then straightway she dropped back into the shadow of her gloom when he got up to go then there was a wistfulness an unspoken need an unconscious reliance in her reluctant good night  then the hour came when he reached his limit he must begin his revelation  you never ask me anythinglet alone about myself he said  id like to hear she replied timidly  do i strike you as an unhappy man  no indeed  well how do i strike you  this was an entirely new tack he had veered to  very good and kind to us women she said  i dont know about that if i am so it doesnt bring me happiness  do you remember what i told you once about my being a preacherdisgrace ruin and all thatand my rainbowchasing dream out here after aa lost girl  iremember allyou said she replied very low  listen his voice was a little husky but behind it there seemed a tide of resistless utterance loss of faith and name did not send me to this wilderness but i had lovelove for that lost girl fay larkin i dreamed about her till i loved her i dreamed that i would find hermy treasureat the foot of a rainbow dreams when you told me she was dead i accepted that there was truth in your voice i respected your reticence but something died in me then i lost myself the best of me the good that might have uplifted me i went away down upon the barren desert and there i rode and slept and grew into another and a harder man yet strange to say i never forgot her though my dreams were done as i toiled and suffered and changed i loved herif not her the thought of hermore and more now i have come back to these walled valleysto the smell of pinyon to the flowers in the nooks to the wind on the heights to the silence and loneliness and beauty and here the dreams come back and she is with me always her spirit is all that keeps me kind and good as you say i am but i suffer i long for her alive if i love her dead how could i love her living always i torture myself with the vain dream thatthat she might not be dead i have never been anything but a dreamer and here i go about my work by day and lie awake at night with that lost girl in my mind i love her does that seem strange to you but it would not if you understood think i had lost faith hope i set myself a great workto find fay larkin and by the fire and the iron and the blood that i felt it would cost to save her some faith must come to me again my work is undoneive never saved her but listen how strange it is to feelnowas i let myself gothat just the loving her and the living here in the wildness that holds her somewhere have brought me hope again some faith must come too it was through her that i met this indian nas ta bega he has saved my lifetaught me much what would i ever have learned of the naked and vast earth of the sublimity of the wild uplands of the storm and night and sun if i had not followed a gleam she inspired in my hunt for a lost girl perhaps i wandered into a place where i shall find a god and my salvation do you marvel that i love fay larkinthat she is not dead to me do you marvel that i love her when i know were she alive chained in a cañon or bound or lost in any way my destiny would lead me to her and she should be saved  shefford ended overcome with emotion in the dusk he could not see the girls face but the white form that had drooped so listlessly seemed now charged by some vitalizing current he knew he had spoken irrationally still he held it no dishonor to have told her he loved her as one dead if she took that love to the secret heart of living fay larkin then perhaps a spirit might light in her darkened soul he had no thought yet that fay larkin might ever belong to him he divined a crimehe had seen her agony and this avowal of his was only one step toward her deliverance  softly she rose retreating into the shadow  forgive me if ii disturb you distress you he said i wanted to tell you she wassomehow known to you i am not happy and are you happy let her memory be a bond between us good night  good night  faintly as the faintest whisper breathed her reply and though it came from a child forced into womanhood it whispered of girlhood not dead of sweet incredulity of amazed tumult of a wondering frantic desire to run and hide of the bewilderment incident to a first hint of love  shefford walked away into the darkness the whisper filled his soul had a word of love ever been spoken to that girl nevernot the love which had been on his lips fay larkins lonely life spoke clearly in her whisper              next morning as the sun gilded the looming peaks and shafts of gold slanted into the valley she came swiftly down the path to the spring  shefford paused in his task of chopping wood joe lake on his knees with his big hands in a pan of dough lifted his head to stare she had left off the somber black hood and although that made a vast difference in her still it was not enough to account for what struck both men  good morning she called brightly  they both answered but not spontaneously she stopped at the spring and with one sweep of her strong arm filled the bucket and lifted it then she started back down the path and pausing opposite the camp set the bucket down  joe do you still pride yourself on your sour dough she asked  reckon i do replied joe with a grin  ive heard your boasts but never tasted your bread she went on  ill ask you to eat with us some day  dont forget she replied  and then shyly she looked at shefford she was like the fresh dawn and the gold of the sun shone on her head  have you chopped all that woodso early she asked  sure replied shefford laughing i have to get up early to keep joe from doing all the camp chores  she smiled and then to shefford she seemed to gleam to be radiant  itd be a lovely morning to climbway high  whyyesit would replied shefford awkwardly i wish i didnt have my work  joe will you climb with me some day  i should smile i will declared joe  but i can run right up the walls  i reckon mary it wouldnt surprise me to see you fly  do you mean im like a cañon swallow or an angel  then as joe stared speechlessly she said goodby and taking up the bucket went on with her swift graceful step  shes perked up said the mormon staring after her never heard her say more n yes or no till now  she did seembright replied shefford  he was stunned what had happened to her today this girl had not been mary the sealed wife or the sago lily alien among mormon women then it flashed upon himshe was fay larkin she who had regarded herself as dead had come back to life in one short night what had transformed herwhat had taken place in her heart shefford dared not accept nor allow lodgment in his mind a thrilling idea that he had made her forget her misery  shefford did you ever see her like that asked joe  never  havent yousomething to do with it  maybe i have ii hope so  reckon youve seen how shes fadedsince the trial  no replied shefford swiftly but ive not seen her face in daylight since then  well take my hunch said joe soberly shes begun to fade like the cañon lily when its broken and shes going to die unless  why man ejaculated shefford didnt you see  sure i see interrupted the mormon i see a lot you dont shes so white you can look through her shes grown thin all in a week she doesnt eat oh i know because ive made it my business to find out its no news to the women but theyd like to see her die and she will die unless  my god exclaimed shefford huskily i never noticedi never thought joe hasnt she any friends  sure you and ruthand me maybe nas ta bega too he watches her a good deal  we can do so little when she needs so much  nobody can help her unless its you went on the mormon thats plain talk she seemed different this morning why she was aliveshe talkedshe smiled shefford if you cheer her up ill go to hell for you  the big mormon on his knees with his hands in a pan of dough and his shirt all covered with flour presented an incongruous figure of a man actuated by pathos and passion yet the contrast made his emotion all the simpler and stronger shefford grew closer to joe in that moment  why do you think i can cheer her help her queried shefford  i dont know but shes different with you its not that youre a gentile though for all the women are crazy about you you talk to her you have power over her shefford i feel that shes only a kid  who is she joe where did she come from asked shefford very low with his eyes cast down  i dont know i cant find out nobody knows its a mysteryto all the younger mormons anyway  shefford burned to ask questions about the mormon whose sealed wife the girl was but he respected joe too much to take advantage of him in a poignant moment like this besides it was only jealousy that made him burn to know the mormons identity and jealousy had become a creeping insidious growing fire he would be wise not to add fuel to it he rejected many things before he thought of one that he could voice to his friend  joe its only her body that belongs toto her soul is lost to  john shefford let that go my minds tired ive been taught so and so and im not bright but after all men are much alike the thing with you and me is thiswe dont want to see her grave  love spoke there the mormon had seized upon the single elemental point that concerned him and his friend in their relation to this unfortunate girl his simple powerful statement united them it gave the lie to his hint of denseness it stripped the truth naked it was such a wonderful thoughtprovoking statement that shefford needed time to ponder how deep the mormon was to what limit would he go did he mean that here between two men who loved the same girl class duty honor creed were nothing if they stood in the way of her deliverance and her life  joe lake you mormons are impossible said shefford deliberately you dont want to see her grave so long as she livesremains on the earthwhite and gold like the flower you call her thats enough for you its her body you think of and thats the great and horrible error in your religion but death of the soul is infinitely worse than death of the body i have been thinking of her soul so here we stand you and i you to save her lifei to save her soul what will you do  why john id turn gentile he said with terrible softness it was a softness that scorned shefford for asking and likewise it flung defiance at his creed and into the face of hell  shefford felt the sting and the exaltation  and id be a mormon he said  all right we understand each other reckon there wont be any call for such extremes i havent an idea what you meanwhat can be done but i say go slow so we wont all find graves first cheer her up somehow make her want to live but go slow john and dont be with her late              that night shefford found her waiting for him in the moonlighta girl who was as transparent as crystalclear water who had left off the somber gloom with the black hood who tremulously embraced happiness without knowing it who was one moment timid and wild like a halffrightened fawn and the next exquisitely halfconscious of what it meant to be thought dead but to be alive to be awakening wondering palpitating and to be loved  shefford lived the hour as a dream and went back to the quiet darkness under the cedars to lie wideeyed trying to recall all that she had said for she had talked as if utterance had long been dammed behind a barrier of silence  there followed other hours like that one indescribable hours so sweet they stung and in which keeping pace with his love was the nobler stride of a spirit that more every day lightened her burden  the thing he had to do sooner or later was to tell her he knew she was fay larkin not dead but alive and that not love nor religion but sacrifice nailed her down to her martyrdom many and many a time he had tried to force himself to tell her only to fail he hated to risk ending this sweet strange thoughtless girlish mood of hers it might not be soon won backperhaps never how could he tell what chains bound her and so as he vacillated between joes cautious advice to go slow and his own pity the days and weeks slipped by  one haunting fear kept him sleepless half the nights and sick even in his dreams and it was that the mormon whose sealed wife she was might come surely would come some night shefford could bear it but what would that visit do to fay larkin shefford instinctively feared the awakening in the girl of womanhood of deeper insight of a spiritual realization of what she was of a physical dawn  he might have spared himself needless torture one day joe lake eyed him with penetrating glance  reckon you dont have to sleep right on that stonebridge trail said the mormon significantly  shefford felt the blood burn his neck and face he had pulled his tarpaulin closer to the trail and his motive was as an open page to the keen mormon  why asked shefford  there wont be any mormons riding in here soonby nightto visit the women replied joe bluntly havent you figured there might be government spies watching the trails  no i havent  well take a hunch then added the mormon gruffly and shefford divined as well as if he had been told that warning word had gone to stonebridge gone despite the fact that nas ta bega had reported every trail free of watchers there was no sign of any spies cowboys outlaws or indians in the vicinity of the valley a passionate gratitude to the mormon overcame shefford and the unreasonableness of it the nature of it perturbed him greatly but something hammered into his brain if he loved one of these sealed wives how could he help being jealous  the result of joes hint was that shefford put off the hour of revelation lived in his dream helped the girl grow farther and farther away from her trouble until that inevitable hour arrived when he was driven by accumulated emotion as much as the exigency of the case  he had not often walked with her beyond the dark shade of the pinyons round the cottage but this night when he knew he must tell her he led her away down the path through the cedar grove to the west end of the valley where it was wild and lonely and sad and silent  the moon was full and the great peaks were crowned as with snow a coyote uttered his cutting cry there were a few melancholy notes from a night bird of the stone walls the air was clear and cold with a tang of frost in it shefford gazed about him at the vast uplifted insulating walls and that feeling of his which was more than a sense told him how walls like these and the silence and shadow and mystery had been nearly all of fay larkins life he felt them all in her  he stopped out in the open near the line where dark shadow of the wall met the silver moonlight on the grass and here by a huge flat stone where he had come often alone and sometimes with ruth he faced fay larkin in the spirit to tell her gently that he knew her and sternly to force her secret from her  am i your friend he began  ahmy only friend she said  do you trust me believe i mean well by you want to help you  yes indeed  well then let me speak of you you know one topic weve never touched upon you  she was silent and looked wonderingly a little fearfully at him as if vague disturbing thoughts were entering the fringe of her mind  our friendship is a strange one is it not he went on  how do i know i never had any other friendship what do you mean by strange  well im a young man youre aa married woman we are together a good dealand like to be  why is that strange she asked  suddenly shefford realized that there was nothing strange in what was natural a remnant of sophistication clung to him and that had spoken he needed to speak to her in a way which in her simplicity she would understand  never mind strange say that i am interested in you and as youre not happy i want to help you and say that your neighbors are curious and oppose my idea why do they  theyre jealous and want you themselves she replied with sweet directness theyve said things i dont understand but i felt theythey hated in me what would be all right in themselves  here to simplicity she added truth and wisdom as an indian might have expressed them but shame was unknown to her and she had as yet only vague perceptions of love and passion shefford began to realize the quickness of her mind that she was indeed awakening  they are jealouswere jealous before i ever came here thats only human nature i was trying to get to a point your neighbors are curious they oppose me they hate you its all bound up in thethe fact of your difference from them your youth beauty that youre not a mormon that you nearly betrayed their secret at the trial in stonebridge  pleaseplease dontspeak of that she faltered  but i must he replied swiftly that trial was a torture to you it revealed so much to me i know you are a sealed wife i know there has been a crime i know youve sacrificed yourself i know that love and religion have nothing to do withwhat you are now is not all that true  i must not tell she whispered  but i shall make you tell he replied and his voice rang  oh no you cannot she said  i canwith just one word  her eyes were great starry shadowy gulfs dark in the white beauty of her face she was calm now she had strength she invited him to speak the word and the wistful tremulous quiver of her lips was for his earnest thought of her  waitalittle said shefford unsteadily ill come to that presently tell me thishave you ever thought of being free  free she echoed and there was singular depth and richness in her voice that was the first spark of fire he had struck from her long ago the minute i was unwatched id have leaped from a wall had i dared oh i wasnt afraid id love to die that way but i never dared  why queried shefford piercingly  she was silent then  suppose i offered to give you freedom that meant life  icouldnttake it  why  oh my friend dont ask me any more  i know i can seeyou want to tell meyou need to tell  but i darent  wont you trust me  i doi do  then tell me  nonooh no  the moment had come how sad tragic yet glorious for him it would be like a magic touch upon this lovely cold white ghost of fay larkin transforming her into a living breathing girl he held his love as a thing aloof and as such intangible because of the living death she believed she lived it had no warmth and intimacy for them what might it not become with a lightning flash of revelation he dreaded yet he was driven to speak he waited swallowing hard fighting the tumultuous storm of emotion and his eyes dimmed  what did i come to this country for he asked suddenly in ringing powerful voice  to find a girl she whispered  ive found her  she began to shake he saw a white hand go to her breast  where is surprise valley how were you taken from jane withersteen and lassiter i know theyre alive but where  she seemed to turn to stone  fayfay larkin i know you he cried brokenly  she slipped off the stone to her knees swayed forward blindly with her hands reaching out her head falling back to let the moon fall full upon the beautiful snowwhite tragically convulsed face     xiii the story of surprise valley    oh i remember so well even now i dream of it sometimes i hear the roll and crash of falling rocklike thunder we rode and rode then the horses fell uncle jim took me in his arms and started up the cliff mother jane climbed close after us they kept looking back down there in the gray valley came the mormons i see the first one now he rode a white horse that was tull oh i remember so well and i was five or six years old  we climbed up and up and into dark cañon and wound in and out then there was the narrow white trail straight up with the little cut steps and the great red ruined walls i looked down over uncle jims shoulder i saw mother jane dragging herself up uncle jims blood spotted the trail he reached a flat place at the top and fell with me mother jane crawled up to us  then she cried out and pointed tull was way below climbing the trail his men came behind him uncle jim went to a great tall rock and leaned against it there was a bloody hole in his hand he pushed the rock it rolled down banging the loose walls they crashed and crashedthen all was terrible thunder and red smoke i couldnt heari couldnt see  uncle jim carried me down and down out of the dark and dust into a beautiful valley all red and gold with a wonderful arch of stone over the entrance  i dont remember well what happened then for what seemed a long long time i can feel how the place looked but not so clear as it is now in my dreams i seem to see myself with the dogs and with mother jane learning my letters marking with red stone on the walls  but i remember now how i felt when i first understood we were shut in for ever shut in surprise valley where venters had lived so long i was glad the mormons would never get me i was seven or eight years old then from that time all is clear in my mind  venters had left supplies and tools and grain and cattle and burros so we had a good start to begin life there he had killed off the wildcats and kept the coyotes out so the rabbits and quail multiplied till there were thousands of them we raised corn and fruit and stored what we didnt use mother jane taught me to read and write with the soft red stone that marked well on the walls  the years passed we kept track of time pretty well uncle jims hair turned white and mother jane grew gray every day was like the one before mother jane cried sometimes and uncle jim was sad because they could never be able to get me out of the valley it was long before they stopped looking and listening for some one venters would come back uncle jim always said but mother jane did not think so  i loved surprise valley i wanted to stay there always i remembered cottonwoods how the children there hated me and i didnt want to go back the only unhappy times i ever had in the valley were when ring and whitie my dogs grew old and died i roamed the valley i climbed to every nook upon the mossy ledges i learned to run up the steep cliffs i could almost stick on the straight walls mother jane called me a wild girl we had put away the clothes we wore when we got there to save them and we made clothes of skins i always laughed when i thought of my little dresshow i grew out of it i think uncle jim and mother jane talked less as the years went by and after id learned all she could teach me we didnt talk much i used to scream into the caves just to hear my voice and the echoes would frighten me  the older i grew the more i was alone i was always running round the valley i would climb to a high place and sit there for hours doing nothing i just watched and listened i used to stay in the cliffdwellers caves and wonder about them i loved to be out in the wind and my happiest time was in the summer storms with the thunder echoes under the walls at evening it was such a quiet placeafter the night birds cry no sound the quiet made me sad but i loved it i loved to watch the stars as i lay awake  so it was beautiful and happy for me there tilltill  two years or more ago there was a bad storm and one of the great walls caved the walls were always weathering slipping many and many a time have i heard the rumble of an avalanche but most of them were in other cañon this slide in the valley made it possible uncle jim said for men to get down into the valley but we could not climb out unless helped from above uncle jim never rested well after that but it never worried me  one day over a year ago while i was across the valley i heard strange shouts and then screams i ran to our camp i came upon men with ropes and guns uncle jim was tied and a rope was round his neck mother jane was lying on the ground i thought she was dead until i heard her moan i was not afraid i screamed and flew at uncle jim to tear the ropes off him the men held me back they called me a pretty cat then they talked together and some were for hanging lassiterthat was the first time i ever knew any name for him but uncle jimand some were for leaving him in the valley finally they decided to hang him but mother jane pleaded so and i screamed and fought so that they left off then they went away and we saw them climb out of the valley  uncle jim said they were mormons and some among them had been born in cottonwoods i was not told why they had such a terrible hate for him he said they would come back and kill him uncle jim had no guns to fight with  we watched and watched in five days they did come back with more men and some of them wore black masks they came to our cave with ropes and guns one was tall he had a cruel voice the others ran to obey him i could see white hair and sharp eyes behind the mask the men caught me and brought me before him  he said lassiter had killed many mormons he said lassiter had killed his father and should be hanged but lassiter would be let live and mother jane could stay with him both prisoners there in the valley if i would marry the mormon i must marry him accept the mormon faith and bring up my children as mormons if i refused they would hang lassiter leave the heretic jane withersteen alone in the valley and take me and break me to their rule  i agreed but mother jane absolutely forbade me to marry him then the mormons took me away it nearly killed me to leave uncle jim and mother jane i was carried and lifted out of the valley and rode a long way on a horse they brought me here to the cabin where i live and i have never been away except thatthat timetostonebridge only little by little did i learn my position bishop kane was kind but stern because i could not be quick to learn the faith  i am not a sealed wife but theyre trying to make me one the master mormonhe visited me oftenat nighttill lately he threatened me he never told me a nameexcept saint george i dontknow himexcept his voice i neversaw his facein the light              fay larkin ended her story toward its close shefford had grown involuntarily restless and when her last tragic whisper ceased all his body seemed shaken with a terrible violence of his joy he strode to and fro in the dark shadow of the stone the receding blood left him cold with a pricking sickening sensation over his body but there seemed to be an overwhelming tide accumulating deep in his breasta tide of passion and pain he dominated the passion but the ache remained and he returned to the quiet figure on the stone  fay larkin he exclaimed with a deep breath of relief that the secret was disclosed so youre not a wife youre free thank heaven but i felt it was sacrifice i knew there had been a crime for crime it is you child you cant understand what crime oh almost i wish you and jane and lassiter had never been found but thats wrong of me one year of agonythat shall not ruin your life fay i will take you away  where she whispered  away from this mormon countryto the east he replied and he spoke of what he had known of travel of cities of people of happiness possible for a young girl who had spent all her life hidden between the narrow walls of a silent lonely valleyhe spoke swiftly and eloquently till he lost his breath  there was an instant of flashing wonder and joy on her white face and then the radiance paled the glow died her soul was the darker for that one strange leaping glimpse of a glory not for such as she  i must stay here she said shudderingly  fayhow strange to say fay aloud to youfay do you know the way to surprise valley  i dont know where it is but i could go straight to it she replied  take me there show me your beautiful valley let me see where you ran and climbed and spent so many lonely years  ah how id love to but i dare not and why should you want me to take you we can run and climb here  i want toi mean to save jane withersteen and lassiter he declared  she uttered a little cry of pain save them  yes save them get them out of the valley take them out of the country far away where they and you  but i cant go she wailed im afraid im bound it cant be broken if i daredif i tried to go they would catch me they would hang uncle jim and leave mother jane alone there to starve  fay lassiter and jane both will starveat least they will die there if we do not save them you have been terribly wronged youre a slave youre not a wife  theysaid ill be burned in hell if i dont marry him mother jane never taught me about god i dont know but hehe said god was there i dare not break it  fay you have been deceived by old men let them have their creed but you mustnt accept it  john what is god to you  dear child ii am not sure of that myself he replied huskily when all this trouble is behind us surely i can help you to understand and you can help me the fact that you are alivethat lassiter and jane are alivethat i shall save you allthat lifts me up i tell youfay larkin will be my salvation  your words trouble me oh i shall be torn one way and another but john i darent run away i will not tell you where to find lassiter and mother jane  i shall find themi have the indian he found you for me nas ta bega will find surprise valley  nas ta bega oh i remember there was an indian with the mormons who found us but he was a piute  nas ta bega never told me how he learned about you that he learned was enough and fay he will find surprise valley he will save uncle jim and mother jane  fays hands clasped sheffords in strong trembling pressure the tears streamed down her white cheeks a tragic and eloquent joy convulsed her face  oh my friend save them but i cant go let them keep me let him kill me  him fayhe shall not harm you replied shefford in passionate earnestness  she caught the hand he had struck out with  you talkyou look like uncle jim when he spoke of the mormons she said then i used to be afraid of him he was so different john you must not do anything about me let me be its too late heand his menthey would hang you and i couldnt bear that ive enough to bear without losing my friend say you wont watch and waitforfor him  shefford had to promise her like an indian she gave expression to primitive feeling for it certainly never occurred to her that whatever shefford might do he was not the kind of man to wait in hiding for an enemy fay had faltered through her last speech and was now weak and nervous and frightened shefford took her back to the cabin  fay dont be distressed he said i wont do anything right away you can trust me i wont be rash ill consult you before i make a move i havent any idea what i could do anyway you must bear up why it looks as if youre sorry i found you  oh im glad she whispered  then if youre glad you mustnt break down this way again suppose some of the women happened to run into us  i wont again its only youyou surprised me so i used to think how id like you to knowi wasnt really dead but nowits different it hurts me here yet im gladif my being alive makes youa little happier  shefford felt that he had to go then he could not trust himself any further  good night fay he said  good night john she whispered i promiseto be good tomorrow  she was crying softly when he left her twice he turned to see the dim white slender form against the gloom of the cabin then he went on under the pinyons blindly down the path with his heart as heavy as lead that night as he rolled in his blanket and stretched wearily he felt that he would never be able to sleep the wind in the cedars made him shiver the great stars seemed relentless passionless white eyes mocking his little destiny and his pain the huge shadow of the mountain resembled the shadow of the insurmountable barrier between fay and him              her pitiful childish promise to be good was in his mind when he went to her home on the next night he wondered how she would be and he realized a desperate need of selfcontrol  but that night fay larkin was a different girl in the dark before she spoke he felt a difference that afforded him surprise and relief he greeted her as usual and then it seemed though not at all clearly that he was listening to a girl strangely and unconsciously glad to see him who spoke with deeper note in her voice who talked where always she had listened whose sadness was there under an eagerness a subdued gaiety as new to her as sweet as it was bewildering and he responded with emotion so that the hour passed swiftly and he found himself back in camp in a kind of dream unable to remember much of what she had said sure only of this strange sweetness suddenly come to her  upon the following night however he discovered what had wrought this singular change in fay larkin she loved him and she did not know it how passionately sweet and sad and painful was that realization for shefford the hour spent with her then was only a moment  he walked under the stars that night and they shed a glorious light upon him he tried to think to plan but the sweetness of remembered word or look made mental effort almost impossible he got as far as the thought that he would do well to drift to wait till she learned she loved him and then perhaps she could be persuaded to let him take her and lassiter and jane away together  and from that night he went at his work and the part he played in the village with a zeal and a cunning that left him free to seek fay when he chose  sometimes in the afternoon always for a while in the evening he was with her they climbed the walls and sat upon a lonely height to look afar they walked under the stars and the cedars and the shadows of the great cliffs she had a beautiful mind listening to her he imagined he saw down into beautiful surprise valley with all its weird shadows its colored walls and painted caves its golden shafts of morning light and the red haze at sunset and he felt the silence that must have been there and the singing of the wind in the cliffs and the sweetness and fragrance of the flowers and the wildness of it all love had worked a marvelous transformation in this girl who had lived her life in a cañon the burden upon her did not weigh heavily she could not have an unhappy thought she spoke of the village of her mormon companions of daily happenings of stonebridge of many things in a matteroffact way that showed how little they occupied her mind she even spoke of sealed wives in a kind of dreamy abstraction something had possession of her something as strong as the nature which had developed her and in its power she in her simplicity was utterly unconscious a watching and feeling girl a strange witching radiant beauty lurked in her smile and shefford heard her laugh in his dreams  the weeks slipped by the black mountain took on a white cap of snow in the early mornings there was ice in the crevices on the heights and frost in the valley in the sheltered cañon where sunshine seemed to linger it was warm and pleasant so that winter did not kill the flowers  shefford waited so long for fays awakening that he believed it would never come and believing had not the heart to force it upon her then there was a growing fear with him what would fay larkin do when she awakened to the truth fay was indeed like that white and fragile lily which bloomed in the silent lonely cañon but the same nature that had created it had created her would she droop as the lily would in a furnace blast more than that he feared a sudden flashing into life of strength power passion hate she did not hate yet because she did not yet realize love she was utterly innocent of any wrong having been done her more and more he began to fear and a foreboding grew upon him he made up his mind to broach the subject of surprise valley and of escaping with lassiter and jane still every time he was with fay the girl and her beauty and her love were so wonderful that he put off the ordeal till the next night as time flew by he excused his vacillation on the score that winter was not a good time to try to cross the desert there was no grass for the mustangs except in wellknown valleys and these he must shun spring would soon come so the days passed and he loved fay more all the time desperately living out to its limit the sweetness of every moment with her and paying for his bliss in the increasing trouble that beset him when once away from her charm              one starry night about ten oclock he went as was his custom to drink at the spring upon his return to the cedars nas ta bega who slept under the same tree with him had arisen with his blanket hanging half off his shoulder  listen said the indian  shefford took one glance at the dark somber face with its inscrutable eyes now so strange and piercing and then with a kind of cold excitement he faced the way the indian looked and listened but he heard only the soft moan of the night wind in the cedars  nas ta bega kept the rigidity of his position for a moment and then he relaxed and stood at ease shefford knew the indian had made a certainty of what must have been a doubtful sound and shefford leaned his ear to the wind and strained his hearing  then the soft night breeze brought a faint patterthe slow trot of horses on a hard trail some one was coming into the village at a late hour shefford thought of joe lake but joe lay right behind him asleep in his blankets it could not be withers for the trader was in durango at that time shefford thought of willetts and shadd  whos coming he asked low of the indian  nas ta bega pointed down the trail without speaking  shefford peered through the white dim haze of starlight and presently he made out moving figures horses with ridersa string of themonetwothreefourfiveand he counted up to eleven eleven horsemen riding into the village he was amazed and suddenly keenly anxious this visit might be one of shadds raids  shadds gang he whispered  no bi nai replied nas ta bega and he drew shefford farther into the shade of the cedars his voice his action the way he kept a hand on sheffords shoulder all this told much to the young man  mormons come on a night visit shefford realized it with a slight shock then swift as a lightning flash he was rent by another shockone that brought cold moisture to his brow and to his heart a flame of hell  he was shaking when he sank down to find the support of a log like a shadow the indian silently moved away shefford watched the eleven horses pass the camp go down the road to disappear in the village they vanished and the soft clipclops of hoofs died away there was nothing left to prove he had not dreamed  nothing to prove it except this sudden terrible demoralization of his physical and spiritual being while he peered out into the valley toward the black patch of cedars and pinyons that hid the cabins moments and moments passed and in them he was gripped with cold and fire  was the mormon who had abducted faythe man with the cruel voicewas he among those eleven horsemen he might not have been what a torturing hope but vainvain for inevitably he must be among them he was there in the cabin already he had dismounted tied his horse had knocked on her door did he need to knock no he would go in he would call her in that cruel voice and then  shefford pulled a blanket from his bed and covered his cold and trembling body he had sunk down off the log was leaning back upon it the stars were pale far off and the valley seemed unreal he found himself listeninglistening with sick and terrible earnestness trying to hear against the thrum and beat of his heart straining to catch a sound in all that cold starblanched silent valley but he could hear no sound it was as if death held the valley in its perfect silence how he hated that silence there ought to have been a million horrible bellowing demons making the night hideous did the stars serenely look down upon the lonely cabins of these exiles was there no thunderbolt to drop down from that dark and looming mountain upon the silent cabin where tragedy had entered in all the world under the sea in the abysmal caves in the vast spaces of the air there was no such terrible silence as this a scream a long cry a moanthese were natural to a woman and why did not one of these sealed wives why did not fay larkin damn this everlasting acquiescent silence perhaps she would fly out of her cabin come running along the path shefford peered into the bright patches of starlight and into the shadows of the cedars but he saw no moving form in the open no dim white shape against the gloom and he heard no soundnot even a whisper of wind in the branches overhead  nas ta bega returned to the shade of the cedars and lying down on his blankets covered himself and went to sleep the fact seemed to bring bitter reality to shefford nothing was going to happen the valley was to be the same this night as any other night shefford accepted the truth he experienced a kind of selfpity the night he had thought so much about prepared for and had forgotten had now arrived then he threw another blanket round him and cold dark grim he faced that lonely vigil meaning to sit there wideeyed to endure and to wait  jealousy and pain following his frenzy abided with him long hours and when they passed he divined that selfishness passed with them what he suffered then was for fay larkin and for her sisters in misfortune he grew big enough to pity these fanatics the fiery racing tide of blood that had made of him only an animal had cooled with thought of others still he feared that stultifying thing which must have been hate what a tempest had raged within him this blood of his that had received a stronger strain from his desert life might in a single moment flood out reason and intellect and make him a vengeful man so in those starlit hours that dragged interminably he looked deep into his heart and tried to fortify himself against a dark and evil moment to come  midnightand the valley seemed a tomb did he alone keep wakeful the sky was a darker blue the stars burned a whiter fire the peaks stood looming and vast tranquil sentinels of that valley and the wind rose to sigh to breathe to mourn through the cedars it was a sad music the indian lay prone dark face to the stars joe lake lay prone sleeping as quietly with his dark face exposed to the starlight the gentle movement of the cedar branches changed the shape of the bright patches on the grass where shadow and light met the walls of the valley waved upward dark below and growing paler to shine faintly at the rounded rims and there was a tiny silvery tinkle of running water over stones  here was a little nook of the vast world here were tranquillity beauty music loneliness life shefford wondereddid he alone keep watchful did he feel that he could see dark wide eyes peering into the gloom and it came to him after a time that he was not alone in his vigil nor was fay larkin alone in her agony there was some one else in the valley a great and breathing and watchful spirit it entered into sheffords soul and he trembled what had come to him and he answeredonly added pain and new love and a strange strength from the firmament and the peaks and the silence and the shadows  the bright belt with its three radiant stars sank behind the western wall and there was a paler gloom upon the valley  then a few lights twinkled in the darkness that enveloped the cabins a womans laugh strangely broke the silence profaning it giving the lie to that somber yoke which seemed to consist of the very shadows the voices of men were heard and then the slow clipclop of trotting horses on the hard trail  shefford saw the mormons file out into the paling starlight ride down the valley and vanish in the gray gloom he was aware that the indian sat up to watch the procession ride by and that joe turned over as if disturbed  one by one the stars went out the valley became a place of gray shadows in the east a light glowed shefford sat there haggard and worn watching the coming of the dawn the kindling of the light and had the power been his the dawn would never have broken and the rose and gold never have tipped the lofty peaks              shefford attended to his camp chores as usual several times he was aware of joes close scrutiny and finally without looking at him shefford told of the visit of the mormons a violent expulsion of breath was joes answer and it might have been a curse straightway joe ceased his cheery whistling and became as somber as the indian the camp was silent the men did not look at one another while they sat at breakfast sheffords back was turned toward the villagehe had not looked in that direction since dawn  ugh suddenly exclaimed nas ta bega  joe lake muttered low and deep and this time there was no mistake about the nature of his speech shefford did not have the courage to turn to see what had caused these exclamations he knew since today had dawned that there was calamity in the air  shefford i reckon if i know women theres a little hell coming to you said the mormon significantly  shefford wheeled as if a powerful force had turned him on a pivot he saw fay larkin she seemed to be almost running she was unhooded and her bright hair streamed down her swift lithe action was without its usual grace she looked wild and she almost fell crossing the steppingstones of the brook  joe hurried to meet her took hold of her arm and spoke but she did not seem to hear him she drew him along with her up the little bench under the cedars straight toward shefford her face held a white mute agony as if in the hour of strife it had hardened into marble but her eyes were darkpurple firewindows of an extraordinarily intense and vital life in one night the girl had become a woman but the blight shefford had dreaded to seethe withering of the exquisite soul and spirit and purity he had considered inevitable just as inevitable as the death of something similar in the flower she resembled when it was broken and defilednothing of this was manifest in her straight and swiftly she came to him back in the shade of the cedars and took hold of his hands  last nighthe came she said  yesfayii know replied shefford haltingly  he was tremblingly conscious of amaze at herof something wonderful in her she did not heed joe who stepped aside a little she did not see nas ta bega who sat motionless on a log apparently oblivious to her presence  you knew he came  yes fay i was awake whenthey rode in i watched them i sat up all night i saw them ride away  if you knew when he came why didnt you run to meto get to me before he did  her question was unanswerable it had the force of a blow it stunned him its sharp frank directness sprang from a simplicity and a strength that had not been nurtured in the life he had lived so far men had wandered from truth and nature  i came to you as soon as i was able she went on i must have fainted i just had to drag myself around and now i can tell you  he was powerless to reply as if she had put another unanswerable question what did she mean to tell him what might she not tell him she loosed her hands from his and lifted them to his shoulders and that was the first conscious action of feeling of intimacy which she had ever shown it quite robbed shefford of strength and in spite of his sorrow there was an indefinable thrill in her touch he looked at her saw the whiteandgold beauty that was hers yesterday and seemed changed today and he recognized fay larkin in a woman he did not know  listen he came  fay donttell me interrupted shefford  i will tell you she said  did the instinct of love teach her how to mitigate his pain shefford felt that as he felt the newborn strength in her  listen she went on he came when i was undressing for bed i heard the horse he knocked on the door something terrible happened to me then i felt sick and my head wasnt clear i remember nexthis being in the roomthe lamp was outi couldnt see very well he thought i was sick and he gave me a drink and let the air blow in on me through the window i remember i lay back in the chair and i thought and i listened when would you come i didnt feel that you could leave me there alone with him for his coming was different this time that pain like a blade in my side when it came i was not the same i loved you i understood then i belonged to you i couldnt let him touch me i had never been his wife when i realized thisthat he was there that you might suffer for iti cried right out  he thought i was sick he worked over me he gave me medicine and then he prayed i saw him in the dark on his knees praying for me that seemed strange yet he was kind so kind that i begged him to let me go i was not a mormon i couldnt marry him i begged him to let me go  then he thought i had been deceiving him he fell into a fury he talked for a long time he called upon god to visit my sins upon me he tried to make me pray but i wouldnt and then i fought him id have screamed for you had he not smothered me i got weak and you never came i know i thought you would come but you didnt then ii gave out and aftersome timei must have fainted  fay for heavens sake how could i come to you burst out shefford hoarse and white with remorse passion pain  if im any mans wife im yours its a thing you feel isnt it i know that now but i want to know what to do  fay he cried huskily  im sick of it all if it werent for you id climb the wall and throw myself off that would be easy for me id love to die that way all my life ive been high up on the walls to fall would be nothing  oh you mustnt talk like that  do you love me she asked with a low and deathless sweetness  love you with all my heart nothing can change that  do you want meas you used to want the fay larkin lost in surprise valley do you love me that way i understand things better than before but stillnot all i am fay larkin i think i must have dreamed of you all my life i was glad when you came here ive been happy lately i forgottill last night maybe it needed that to make me see ive loved you all the time and i fought him like a wildcat tell me the truth i feel im yours is that true if im notill not live another hour something holds me up i am the same do you want me  yes fay larkin i want you replied shefford steadily with his grip on her arms  then take me away i dont want to live here another hour  fay ill take you but it cant be done at once we must plan i need help there are lassiter and jane to get out of surprise valley give me time deargive me time itll be a hard job and we must plan so we can positively get away give me time fay  suppose he comes back she queried with a singular depth of voice  well have to risk that replied shefford miserably buthe wont come soon  he said he would she flashed  shefford seemed to freeze inwardly with her words love had made her a woman and now the woman in her was speaking she saw the truth as he could not see it and the truth was nature she had been hidden all her life from the world from knowledge as he had it yet when love betrayed her womanhood to her she acquired all its subtlety  if i wait and he does come will you keep me from him she asked  how can i im staking all on the chance of his not coming soon  but fay if he does come and i dont give up our secrethow on earth can i keep you from him demanded shefford  if you love me you will do it she said as simply as if she were fate  but how cried shefford almost beside himself  you are a man any man would save the woman who loves him fromfromoh from a beast how would lassiter do it  lassiter  you can kill him  it was there deep and full in her voice the strength of the elemental forces that had surrounded her primitive passion and hate and love as they were in woman in the beginning  my god shefford cried aloud with his spirit when all that was red in him sprang again into a flame of hell that was what had been wrong with him last night he could kill this stealthy nightrider and now face to face with fay who had never been so beautiful and wonderful as in this hour when she made love the only and the sacred thing of life now he had it in him to kill yet murdereven to kill a brutethat was not for john shefford not the way for him to save a woman reason and wisdom still fought the passion in him if he could but cling to themhave them with him in the dark and contending hour  she leaned against him now exhausted her soul in her eyes and they saw only him shefford was all but powerless to resist the longing to take her into his arms to hold her to his heart to let himself go did not her love give her to him shefford gazed helplessly at the stricken joe lake at the somber indian as if from them he expected help  i know him now said fay breaking the silence with startling suddenness  what  ive seen him in the light i flashed a candle in his face i saw it i know him now he was there at stonebridge with us and i never knew him but i know him now his name is  for gods sake dont tell me who he is implored shefford  ignorance was sheffords safeguard against himself to make a name of this heretofore intangible man to give him an identity apart from the crowd to be able to recognize himthat for shefford would be fatal  faytell meno more he said brokenly i love you and i will give you my life trust me i swear ill save you  will you take me away soon  yes  she appeared satisfied with that and dropped her hands and moved back from him a light flitted over her white face and her eyes grew dark and humid losing their fire in changing shadowing thought of submission of trust of hope  i can lead you to surprise valley she said i feel the way its there and she pointed to the west  fay well gosoon i must plan ill see you tonight then well talk run home now before some of the women see you here  she said goodby and started away under the cedars out into the open where her hair shone like gold in the sunlight and she took the steppingstones with her old free grace and strode down the path swift and lithe as an indian once she turned to wave a hand  shefford watched her with a torture of pride love hope and fear contending within him     xiv the navajo   that morning a piute rode into the valley  shefford recognized him as the brave who had been in love with glen naspa the moment nas ta bega saw this visitor he made a singular motion with his handsa motion that somehow to shefford suggested despairand then he waited somber and statuesque for the messenger to come to him it was the piute who did all the talking and that was brief then the navajo stood motionless with his hands crossed over his breast shefford drew near and waited  bi nai said the navajo nas ta bega said his sister would come home some day glen naspa is in the hogan of her grandfather  he spoke in his usual slow guttural voice and he might have been bronze for all the emotion he expressed yet shefford instinctively felt the despair that had been hinted to him and he put his hand on the indians shoulder  if i am the navajos brother then i am brother to glen naspa he said i will go with you to the hogan of hosteen doetin  nas ta bega went away into the valley for the horses shefford hurried to the village made his excuses at the school and then called to explain to fay that trouble of some kind had come to the indian  soon afterward he was riding nackyal on the rough and winding trail up through the broken country of cliffs and cañon to the great leaguelong sage and cedar slope of the mountain it was weeks since he had ridden the mustang nackyal was fat and lazy he loved his master but he did not like the climb and so fell far behind the lean and wiry pony that carried nas ta bega the sage levels were as purple as the haze of the distance and there was a bittersweet tang on the strong cool wind the sun was gold behind the dark line of fringe on the mountaintop a flock of sheep swept down one of the sage levels looking like a narrow stream of white and black and brown it was always amazing for shefford to see how swiftly these navajo sheep grazed along wild mustangs plunged out of the cedar clumps and stood upon the ridges whistling defiance or curiosity and their manes and tails waved in the wind  shefford mounted slowly to the cedar bench in the midst of which were hidden the few hogans and he halted at the edge to dismount and take a look at that downwardsweeping world of color of wide space at the wild desert upland which from there unrolled its magnificent panorama  then he passed on into the cedars how strange to hear the lambs bleating again lambingtime had come early but still spring was there in the new green of grass in the bright upland flower he led his mustang out of the cedars into the cleared circle it was full of colts and lambs and there were the shepherddogs and a few old rams and ewes but the circle was a quiet place this day there were no indians in sight shefford loosened the saddlegirths on nackyal and leaving him to graze went toward the hogan of hosteen doetin a blanket was hung across the door shefford heard a low chanting he waited beside the door till the covering was pulled in then he entered  hosteen doetin met him clasped his hand the old navajo could not speak his fine face was working in grief tears streamed from his dim old eyes and rolled down his wrinkled cheeks his sorrow was no different from a white mans sorrow beyond him shefford saw nas ta bega standing with folded arms somehow terrible in his somber impassiveness at his feet crouched the old woman hosteen doetins wife and beside her prone and quiet half covered with a blanket lay glen naspa  she was dead to shefford she seemed older than when he had last seen her and she was beautiful calm cold dark with only bitter lips to give the lie to peace there was a story in those lips  at her side half hidden under the fold of blanket lay a tiny bundle its human shape startled shefford then he did not need to be told the tragedy when he looked again at glen naspas face he seemed to understand all that had made her older to feel the pain that had lined and set her lips  she was dead and she was the last of nas ta begas family in the old grandfathers agony in the wild chant of the stricken grandmother in the brothers stern and terrible calmness shefford felt more than the death of a loved one the shadow of ruin of doom of death hovered over the girl and her family and her tribe and her race there was no consolation to offer these relatives of glen naspa shefford took one more fascinated gaze at her dark eloquent prophetic face at the tragic tiny shape by her side and then with bowed head he left the hogan              outside he paced to and fro with an aching heart for nas ta bega with something of the white mans burden of crime toward the indian weighing upon his soul  old hosteen doetin came to him with shaking hands and words memorable of the time glen naspa left his hogan  me no savvy jesus christ me hungry me no eat jesus christ  that seemed to be all of his trouble that he could express to shefford he could not understand the religion of the missionary this jesus christ who had called his granddaughter away and the great fear of an old indian was not death but hunger shefford remembered a custom of the navajos a thing barbarous looked at with a white mans mind if an old indian failed on a long march he was inclosed by a wall of stones given plenty to eat and drink and left there to die in the desert not death did he fear but hunger old hosteen doetin expected to starve now that the young and strong squaw of his family was gone  shefford spoke in his halting navajo and assured the old indian that nas ta bega would never let him starve  at sunset shefford stood with nas ta bega facing the west the indian was magnificent in repose he watched the sun go down upon the day that had seen the burial of the last of his family he resembled an impassive destiny upon which no shocks fell he had the light of that flaring golden sky in his face the majesty of the mountain in his mien the silence of the great gulf below on his lips this educated navajo who had reverted to the life of his ancestors found in the wildness and loneliness of his environment a strength no white teaching could ever have given him shefford sensed in him a measureless grief an impenetrable gloom a tragic acceptance of the meaning of glen naspas ruin and deaththe vanishing of his race from the earth death had written the law of such bitter truth round glen naspas lips and the same truth was here in the grandeur and gloom of the navajo  bi nai he said with the beautiful sonorous roll in his voice glen naspa is in her grave and there are no paths to the place of her sleep glen naspa is gone  gone where nas ta bega remember i lost my own faith and i have not yet learned yours  the navajo has one motherthe earth her body has gone to the earth and it will become dust but her spirit is in the air it shall whisper to me from the wind i shall hear it on running waters it will hide in the morning music of a mockingbird and in the lonely night cry of the cañon hawk her blood will go to make the red of the indian flowers and her soul will rest at midnight in the lily that opens only to the moon she will wait in the shadow for me and live in the great mountain that is my home and for ever step behind me on the trail  you will kill willetts demanded shefford  the navajo will not seek the missionary  but if you meet him youll kill him  bi nai would nas ta bega kill after it is too late what good could come the navajo is above revenge  if he crosses my trail i think i couldnt help but kill him muttered shefford in a passion that wrung the threat from him  the indian put his arm round the white mans shoulders  bi nai long ago i made you my brother and now you make me your brother is it not so glen naspas spirit calls for wisdom not revenge willetts must be a bad man but well let him live life will punish him who knows if he was all to blame glen naspa was only one pretty indian girl there are many white men in the desert she loved a white man when she was a baby the thing was a curse  listen bi nai and the navajo will talk  many years ago the spanish padres the first white men came into the land of the indian their search was for gold but they were not wicked men they did not steal and kill they taught the indian many useful things they brought him horses but when they went away they left him unsatisfied with his life and his god  then came the pioneers they crossed the great river and took the pasturelands and the huntinggrounds of the indian they drove him backward and the indian grew sullen he began to fight the white mans government made treaties with the indian and these were broken then war camefierce and bloody war the indian was driven to the waste places the stream of pioneers like a march of ants spread on into the desert every valley where grass grew every river became a place for farms and towns cattle choked the waterholes where the buffalo and deer had once gone to drink the forests in the hills were cut and the springs dried up and the pioneers followed to the edge of the desert  then came the prospectors mad like the padres for the gleam of gold the day was not long enough for them to dig in the creeks and the cañon they worked in the night and they brought weapons and rum to the indian to buy from him the secret of the places where the shining gold lay hidden  then came the traders and they traded with the indian they gave him little for much and that little changed his life he learned a taste for the sweet foods of the white man because he could trade for a sack of flour he worked less in the field and the very fiber of his bones softened  then came the missionaries they were proselytizers for converts to their religion the missionaries are good men there may be a bad missionary like willetts the same as there are bad men in other callings or bad indians they say shadd is a halfbreed but the piutes can tell you he is a fullblood and he like me was sent to a white mans school in the beginning the missionaries did well for the indian they taught him cleaner ways of living better farming useful work with toolsmany good things but the wrong to the indian was the undermining of his faith it was not humanity that sent the missionary to the indian humanity would have helped the indian in his ignorance of sickness and work and left him his god for to trouble the indian about his god worked at the roots of his nature  the beauty of the indians life is in his love of the open of all that is nature of silence freedom wildness it is a beauty of mind and soul the indian would have been content to watch and feel to a white man he might be dirty and lazycontent to dream life away without trouble or what the white man calls evolution the indian might seem cruel because he leaves his old father out in the desert to die but the old man wants to die that way alone with his spirits and the sunset and the white mans medicine keeps his old father alive days and days after he ought to be dead which is more cruel the navajos used to fight with other tribes and then they were stronger men than they are today  but leaving religion greed and war out of the question contact with the white man would alone have ruined the indian the indian and the white man cannot mix the indian brave learns the habits of the white man acquires his diseases and has not the mind or body to withstand them the indian girl learns to love the white manand that is death of her indian soul if not of life  so the red man is passing tribes once powerful have died in the life of nas ta bega the curse of the white man is already heavy upon my race in the south here in the north in the wildest corner of the desert chased here by the great soldier carson the navajo has made his last stand  bi nai you have seen the shadow in the hogan of hosteen doetin glen naspa has gone to her grave and no sisters no children will make paths to the place of her sleep nas ta bega will never have a wifea child he sees the end it is the sunset of the navajo bi nai the navajo is dyingdyingdying     xv wild justice   a crescent moon hung above the lofty peak over the valley and a train of white stars ran along the bold rim of the western wall a few young frogs peeped plaintively the night was cool yet had a touch of balmy spring and a sweeter fragrance as if the cedars and pinyons had freshened in the warm sun of that day  shefford and fay were walking in the aisles of moonlight and the patches of shade and nas ta bega more than ever a shadow of his white brother followed them silently  fay its growing late feel the dew said shefford come i must take you back  but the times so short i have said nothing that i wanted to say she replied  say it quickly then as we go  after all its onlywill you take me away soon  yes very soon the indian and i have talked but weve made no plan yet there are only three ways to get out of this country by stonebridge by kayenta and durango and by red lake we must choose one all are dangerous we must lose time finding surprise valley i hoped the indian could find it then wed bring lassiter and jane here and hide them near till dark then take you and go that would give us a nights start but you must help us to surprise valley  i can go right to it blindfolded or in the dark oh john hurry i dread the wait he might come again  joe saysthey wont come very soon  is it farwhere were goingout of the country  ten days hard riding  oh that night ride to and from stonebridge nearly killed me but i could walk very far and climb for ever  fay well get out of the country if i have to carry you  when they arrived at the cabin fay turned on the porch step and with her face nearer a level with his white and sweet in the moonlight with her eyes shining and unfathomable she was more than beautiful  youve never been inside my house she said come in ive something for you  but its late he remonstrated i suppose youve got me a cake or piesomething to eat you women all think joe and i have to be fed  no youd never guess come in she said and the rare smile on her face was something shefford would have gone far to see  well then for a minute  he crossed the porch the threshold and entered her home her dim white shape moved in the darkness and he followed into a room where the moon shone through the open window giving soft mellow shadowy light he discerned objects but not clearly for his senses seemed absorbed in the strange warmth and intimacy of being for the first time with her in her home  no its not good to eat she said and her laugh was happy here  suddenly she abruptly ceased speaking shefford saw her plainly and the slender form had stiffened alert and strained she was listening  what was that she whispered  i didnt hear anything he whispered back  he stepped softly nearer the open window and listened  clipclop clipclop clipclop hard hoofs on the hard path outside  a strong and rippling thrill went over shefford in the soft light her eyes seemed unnaturally large and black and fearful  clipclop clipclop  the horse stopped outside then followed a metallic clink of spur against stirrupthud of boots on hard groundheavy footsteps upon the porch  a swift cold contraction of throat of breast convulsed shefford his only thought was that he could not think  homary  a voice liberated both sheffords muscle and minda voice of strange vibrant power authority of religion and cruelty of willthese mormon attributes constituted that power and shefford suffered a transformation which must have been ordered by demons that sudden flame seemed to curl and twine and shoot along his veins with blasting force a rancorous and terrible cry leaped to his lips  homary then came a heavy tread across the threshold of the outer room  shefford dared not look at fay yet dimly from the corner of his eye he saw her a pale shadow turned to stone with her arms out if he looked if he made sure of that he was lost when had he drawn his gun it was there a dark and glinting thing in his hand he must flynot through cowardice and fear but because in one more moment he would kill a man swift as the thought he dove through the open window and leaping up he ran under the dark pinyons toward camp  joe lake had been out late himself he sat by the fire smoking his pipe he must have seen or heard shefford coming for he rose with unwonted alacrity and he kicked the smoldering logs into a flickering blaze  shefford realizing his deliverance came panting staggering into the light the mormon uttered an exclamation then he spoke anxiously but what he said was not clear in sheffords thick and throbbing ears he dropped his pipe a sign of perturbation and he stared  but shefford without a word lunged swiftly away into the shadow of the cedars he found relief in action he began a steep ascent of the east wall a dangerous slant he had never dared even in daylight and he climbed it without a slip danger steep walls perilous heights night and black cañon the samethese he never thought of but something drove him to desperate effort that the hours might seem short              the red sun was tipping the eastern wall when he returned to camp and he was neither calm nor sure of himself nor ready for sleep or food only he had put the night behind him  the indian showed no surprise but joe lakes jaw dropped and his eyes rolled moreover joe bore a singular aspect the exact nature of which did not at once dawn upon shefford  by god youve got nerveor youre crazy he ejaculated hoarsely  then it was sheffords turn to stare the mormon was haggard grieved frightened and utterly amazed he appeared to be trying to make certain of sheffords being there in the flesh and then to find reason for it  ive no nerve and i am crazy replied shefford but joewhat do you mean why do you look at me like that  i reckon if i get your horse thatll square us did you come back for him youd better hit the trail quick  its you now whore crazy burst out shefford  wish to god i was replied joe  it was then shefford realized catastrophe and cold fear gnawed at his vitals so that he was sick  joe what has happened he asked with the blood thick in his heart  hadnt you better tell me demanded the mormon and a red wave blotted out the haggard shade of his face  you talk like a fool said shefford sharply and he strode right up to joe  see here shefford weve been pards youre making it hard for me reckon you aint square  shefford shot out a long arm and his hand clutched the mormons burly shoulder  why am i not square what do you mean  joe swallowed hard and gave himself a shake then he eyed his comrade steadily  i was afraid youd kill him i reckon i cant blame you ill help you get away and im a mormon do you take the hunch but dont deny you killed him  killed whom gasped shefford  her husband  shefford seemed stricken by a slow paralyzing horror the mormons changing face grew huge and indistinct and awful in his sight he was clutched and shaken in joes rude hands yet scarcely felt them joe seemed to be bellowing at him but the voice was far off then shefford began to see to hear through some cold and terrible deadness that had come between him and everything  say you killed him hoarsely supplicated the mormon  shefford had not yet control of speech something in his gaze appeared to drive joe frantic  damn you tell me quick say you killed him if you want to know my stand why im glad shefford dont look so stony  for her sake say you killed him  shefford stood with a face as gray and still as stone with a groan the mormon drew away from him and sank upon a log he bowed his head his broad shoulders heaved husky sounds came from him then with a violent wrench he plunged to his feet and shook himself like a huge savage dog  reckon its no time to weaken he said huskily and with the words a dark hard somber bitterness came to his face  whereisshe whispered shefford  shut up in the schoolhouse he replied  did shedid she  she neither denied nor confessed  have youseen her  yes  how didshe look  cool and quiet as the indian there game as hell she always had stuff in her  oh joe its unbelievable cried shefford that lovely innocent girl she couldntshe couldnt  shes fixed him dont think of that its too late we ought to have saved her  god she begged me to hurryto take her away  think what we can do now to save her cut in the mormon  shefford sustained a vivifying shock to save her he echoed  think man  joe i can hit the trail and let you tell them i killed him burst out shefford in panting excitement  reckon i can  so help me god ill do it  the mormon turned a dark and austere glance upon shefford  you mustnt leave her she killed him for your sake you must fight for her nowsave hertake her away  but the law  law scoffed joe in these wilds men get killed and theres no law but if shes taken back to stonebridge those ironjawed old mormons will make law enough toto shefford the thing isget her away once out of the country shes safe mormons keep their secrets  ill take her joe will you help me  shefford even in his agitation felt the mormons silence to be a consent that need not have been asked and shefford had a passionate gratefulness toward his comrade that stultifying and blinding prejudice which had always seemed to remove a mormon outside the pale of certain virtue suffered final eclipse and joe lake stood out a man strange and crude but with a heart and a soul  joe tell me what to do said shefford with a simplicity that meant he needed only to be directed  pull yourself together get your nerve back replied joe reckon youd better show yourself over there no one saw you come in this morningyour absence from camp isnt known its better you seem curious and shocked like the rest of us come on well go over and afterward well get the indian and plan  they left camp and crossing the brook took the shaded path toward the village hope of saving fay the need of all his strength and nerve and cunning to effect that end gave shefford the supreme courage to overcome his horror and fear on that short walk under the pinyons to fays cabin he had suffered many changes of emotion but never anything like this change which made him fierce and strong to fight deep and crafty to plan hard as iron to endure  the village appeared very quiet though groups of women stood at the doors of cabins if they talked it was very low henninger and smith two of the three mormon men living in the village were standing before the closed door of the schoolhouse a tigerish feeling thrilled shefford when he saw them on guard there shefford purposely avoided looking at fays cabin as long as he could keep from it when he had to look he saw several hooded whispering women in the yard and beal the other mormon man standing in the cabin door upon the porch lay the long shape of a man covered with blankets  shefford experienced a horrible curiosity  say beal ive fetched shefford over said lake hes pretty much cut up  beal wagged a solemn head but said nothing his mind seemed absent or steeped in gloom and he looked up as one silently praying  joe lake strode upon the little porch and reaching down he stripped the blanket from the shrouded form  shefford saw a sharp cold ghastly face waggoner he whispered  yes replied lake  waggoner shefford remembered the strange power in his face and now that life had gone that power was stripped of all disguise death in sheffords years of ministry had lain under his gaze many times and in a multiplicity of aspects but never before had he seen it stamped so strangely shefford did not need to be told that here was a man who believed he had conversed with god on earth who believed he had a divine right to rule women who had a will that would not yield itself to death utterly waggoner then was the devil who had come masked to surprise valley had forced a martyrdom upon fay larkin and this was the mormon who had made fay larkin a murderess shefford had hated him living and now he hated him dead death here was robbed of all nobility of pathos of majesty it was only retribution wild justice but alas that it had to be meted out by a whitesoled girl whose innocence was as great as the unconscious savagery which she had assimilated from her lonely and wild environment shefford laid a despairing curse upon his own head and a terrible remorse knocked at his heart he had left her alone this girl in whom love had made the great changelike a coward he had left her alone that curse he visited upon himself because he had been the spirit and the motive of this wild justice and his should have been the deed  joe lake touched sheffords arm and pointed at the haft of a knife protruding from waggoners breast it was a wooden haft shefford had seen it before somewhere  then he was struck with what perhaps joe meant him to seethe singular impression the haft gave of one sweeping accurate powerful stroke a strong arm had driven that blade home the haft was sunk deep there was a little depression in the cloth no blood showed and the weapon looked as if it could not be pulled out sheffords thought went fatally and irresistibly to fay larkins strong arm he saw her flash that white arm and lift the heavy bucket from the spring with an ease he wondered at he felt the strong clasp of her hand as she had given it to him in a flying leap across a crevice upon the walls yes her fine hand and the round strong arm possessed the strength to have given that blade its singular directness and force the marvel was not in the physical action it hid inscrutably in the mystery of deadly passion rising out of a gentle and sad heart  joe lake drew up the blanket and shut from sheffords fascinated gaze that spare form that accusing knife that face of strange cruel power  anybody been sent for asked lake of beal  yes an indian boy went for the piute well send him to stonebridge replied the mormon  how soon do you expect any one here from stonebridge  tomorrow mebbe by noon  meantime whats to be done withthis  elder smith thinks the body should stay right here where it fell till they come from stonebridge  waggoner was found here then  right here  who found him  mother smith she came over early an the sight made her scream the women all came runnin mother smith had to be put to bed  who foundmary  see here joe i told you all i knowed once before replied the mormon testily  ive forgotten was sort of bewildered tell me again who foundher  the women folks she laid right inside the door in a dead faint she hadnt undressed there was blood on her hands an a cut or scratch the women fetched her to but she wouldnt talk then elder smith come an took her theyve got her locked up  then joe led shefford away from the cabin farther on into the village when they were halted by the somber grieving women it was joe who did the talking they passed the schoolhouse and here shefford quickened his step he could scarcely bear the feeling that rushed over him and the mormon gripped his arm as if he understood  shefford which one of these younger women do you reckon your best friend ruth asked lake earnestly  ruth by all means just lately i havent seen her often but weve been close friends i think shed do much for me  maybe therell be a chance to find out maybe well need ruth lets have a word with her i havent seen her out among the women  they stopped at the door of ruths cabin it was closed when joe knocked there came a sound of footsteps inside a hand drew aside the windowblind and presently the door opened ruth stood there dressed in somber hue she was a pretty slender blueeyed brownhaired young woman  shefford imagined from her pallor and the set look of shock upon her face that the tragedy had affected her more powerfully than it had the other women when he remembered that she had been more friendly with fay larkin than any other neighbor he made sure he was right in his conjecture  come in was ruths greeting  no we just wanted to say a word i noticed youve not been out do you knowall about it  she gave them a strange glance  any of the women folks been in added joe  hester ran over she told me through the window then i barred my door to keep the other women out  what for asked joe curiously  please come in she said in reply  they entered and she closed the door after them the change that came over her then was the loosing of restraint  joewhat will they do with mary she queried tensely  the mormon studied her with dark speculative eyes hang her he rejoined in brutal harshness  o mother of saints she cried and her hands went up  youre sorry for mary then asked joe bluntly  my heart is breaking for her  well sos sheffords said the mormon huskily and mines kind of damn shaky  ruth glided to shefford with a womans swift softness  youve been my goodmy best friend you were hers too oh i know  cant you do something for her  i hope to god i can replied shefford  then the three stood looking from one to the other in a strong and subtly realizing moment drawn together  ruth whispered joe hoarsely and then he glanced fearfully around at the window and door as if listeners were there it was certain that his dark face had paled he tried to whisper more only to fail shefford divined the weight of mormonism that burdened joe lake then joe was faithful to a love for fay larkin noble in friendship to shefford desperate in a bitter strait with his own manliness but the power of that creed by which he had been raised struck his lips mute for to speak on meant to be false to that creed already in his heart he had decided yet he could not voice the thing  ruthshefford took up the mormons unfinished whisperif we plan to save herif we need youwill you help  ruth turned white but an instant and splendid fire shone in her eyes  try me she whispered back ill change places with herso you can get her away they cant do much to me  shefford wrung her hands joe licked his lips and found his voice well come back later then he led the way out and shefford followed they were silent all the way back to camp  nas ta bega sat in repose where they had left him a thoughtful somber figure shefford went directly to the indian and joe tarried at the campfire where he raked out some red embers and put one upon the bowl of his pipe he puffed clouds of white smoke then found a seat beside the others  shefford go ahead talk itll take a deal of talk ill listen then ill talk itll be nas ta bega who makes the plan out of it all  shefford launched himself so swiftly that he scarcely talked coherently but he made clear the points that he must save fay get her away from the village let her lead him to surprise valley rescue lassiter and jane withersteen and take them all out of the country  joe lake dubiously shook his head manifestly the surprise valley part of the situation presented a new and serious obstacle it changed the whole thing to try to take the three out by way of kayenta and durango was not to be thought of for reasons he briefly stated the red lake trail was the only one left and if that were taken the chances were against shefford it was five days over sand to red lakeimpossible to hide a trailand even with a days start shefford could not escape the hardriding men who would come from stonebridge besides after reaching red lake there were days and days of deserttravel needful to avoid places like blue cañon tuba moencopie and the indian villages  well have to risk all that declared shefford desperately  its a fool risk retorted joe listen by tomorrow noon all of stonebridge more or less will be riding in here youve got to get away tonight with the girlor never and tomorrow youve got to find that lassiter and the woman in surprise valley this valley must be back deep in the cañon country well youve got to come out this way again no trail through here would be safe why youd put all your heads in a rope you mustnt come through this way itll have to be tried across country off the trails and that means helldayandnight travel no camp no feed for horsesmaybe no water then youll have the best trackers in utah like hounds on your trail  when the mormon ceased his forceful speech there was a silence fraught with hopeless meaning he bowed his head in gloom shefford growing sick again to his marrow fought a cold hateful sense of despair  bi nai in his extremity he called to the indian  the navajo has heard replied nas ta bega strangely speaking in his own language  with a long slow heave of breast shefford felt his despair leave him in the indian lay his salvation he knew it joe lake caught the subtle spirit of the moment and looked up eagerly  nas ta bega stretched an arm toward the east and spoke in navajo but shefford owing to the hurry and excitement of his mind could not translate joe lake listened gave a violent start leaped up with all his big frame quivering and then fired question after question at the indian when the navajo had replied to all joe drew himself up as if facing an irrevocable decision which would wring his very soul what did he cast off in that moment what did he grapple with shefford had no means to tell except by the instinct which baffled him but whether the mormons trial was one of spiritual rending or the natural physical fear of a perilous virtually impossible venture the fact was he was magnificent in his acceptance of it he turned to shefford white cold yet glowing  nas ta bega believes he can take you down a cañon to the big riverthe colorado he knows the head of this cañon nonnezoshe boco its calledcañon of the rainbow bridge he has never been down it only two or three living indians have ever seen the great stone bridge but all have heard of it they worship it as a god theres water runs down this cañon and water runs to the river nas ta bega thinks he can take you down to the river  go on cried shefford breathlessly as joe paused  the indian plans this way god its great if only i can do my end he plans to take mustangs today and wait with them for you tonight or tomorrow till you come with the girl youll go get lassiter and the woman out of surprise valley then youll strike east for nonnezoshe boco if possible you must take a pack of grub you may be days going downand waiting for me at the mouth of the cañon at the river  joe where will you be  ill ride like hell for kayenta get another horse there and ride like hell for the san juan river theres a big flatboat at the durango crossing ill go down the san juan in thatinto the big river ill drift down by day tie up by night and watch for you at the mouth of every cañon till i come to nonnezoshe boco  shefford could not believe the evidence of his ears he knew the treacherous san juan river he had heard of the great sweeping terrible red colorado and its roaring rapids  oh it seems impossible he gasped youll just lose your life for nothing  the indian will turn the trick i tell you take my hunch its nothing for me to drift down a swift river i worked a ferryboat once  shefford to whom flying straws would have seemed stable caught the inflection of defiance and daring and hope of the mormons spirit  what thenafter you meet us at the mouth of nonnezoshe boco he queried  well all drift down to lees ferry thats at the head of marble cañon well get out on the south side of the river thus avoiding any mormons at the ferry nas ta bega knows the country its open deserton the other side of these plateaus he can get horses from navajos then youll strike south for willow springs  willow springs thats presbreys tradingpost said shefford  never met him but hell see you safe out of the painted desert  the thing that worries me most is how not to miss you all at the mouth of nonnezoshe you must have sharp eyes but i forget the indian a bird couldnt pass him and suppose nonnezoshe boco has a steepwalled narrow mouth opening into a rapids whew well the indian will figure that too now lets put our heads together and plan how to turn this end of the trick here getting the girl  after a short colloquy it was arranged that shefford would go to ruth and talk to her of the aid she had promised joe averred that this aid could be best given by ruth going in her somber gown and hood to the schoolhouse and there while joe and shefford engaged the guards outside she would change apparel and places with fay and let her come forth  whatll they do to ruth demanded shefford we cant accept her sacrifice if shes to sufferor be punished  reckon ruth has a strong hunch that she can get away with it did you notice how strange she said that well they cant do much to her the bishop may damn her soul butruth  here lake hesitated and broke off not improbably he had meant to say that of all the mormon women in the valley ruth was the least likely to suffer from punishment inflicted upon her soul  anyway its our only chance went on joe unless we kill a couple of men ruth will gladly take what comes to help you  all right i consent replied shefford with emotion and now after she comes outthe supposed ruthwhat then  you can be naturallike go with her back to ruths cabin then stroll off into the cedars then climb the west wall meanwhile nas ta bega will ride off with a pack of grub and nackyal and several other mustangs hell wait for you or youll wait for him as the case may be at some appointed place when youre gone ill jump my horse and hit the trail for kayenta and the san juan  very well thats settled said shefford soberly ill go at once to see ruth you and nas ta bega decide on where im to meet him  reckon youd do just as well to walk round and come up to ruths from the other sideinstead of going through the village suggested joe  shefford approached ruths cabin in a roundabout way nevertheless she saw him coming before he got there and opening the door stood pale composed and quietly bade him enter briefly in low and earnest voice shefford acquainted her with the plan  you love her so much she said wistfully wonderingly  indeed i do is it too much to ask of you to do this thing he asked  do it she queried with a flash of spirit of course ill do it  ruth i cant thank you i cant ive only a faint idea what youre risking that distresses me im afraid of what may happen to you  she gave him another of the strange glances i dont risk so much as you think she said significantly  why  she came close to him and her hands clasped his arms and she looked up at him her eyes darkening and her face growing paler will you swear to keep my secret she asked very low  yes i swear  i was one of waggoners sealed wives  god almighty broke out shefford utterly overwhelmed  yes thats why i say i dont risk so much i will make up a story to tell the bishop and everybody ill tell that waggoner was jealous that he was brutal to mary that i believed she was goaded to her mad deed that i thought she ought to be free theyll be terrible but what can they do to me my husband is dead and if i have to go to hell to keep from marrying another married mormon ill go  in that low passionate utterance shefford read the deathblow to the old mormon polygamous creed in the uplift of his spirit in the joy at this revelation he almost forgot the stern matter at hand ruth and joe lake belonged to a younger generation of mormons their nobility in this instance was in part a revolt at the conditions of their lives doubt was knocking at joe lakes heart and conviction had come to this young sealed wife bitter and hopeless while she had been fettered strong and mounting now that she was free in a flash of inspiration shefford saw the old order changing the mormon creed might survive but that part of it which was an affront to nature a horrible yoke on womens necks was doomed it could not live it could never have survived more than a generation or two of religious fanatics shefford had marked a different force and religious fervor in the younger mormons and now he understood them  ruth you talk wildly he said but i understand i see you are free and youre going to stay free it stuns me to think of that man of many wives what did you feel when you were told he was dead  i dare not think of that it makes mewicked and he was good to me listen last night about midnight he came to my window and woke me i got up and let him in he was in a terrible state i thought he was crazy he walked the floor and called on his saints and prayed when i wanted to light a lamp he wouldnt let me he was afraid id see his face but i saw well enough in the moonlight and i knew something had happened so i soothed and coaxed him he had been a man as closemouthed as a stone yet then i got him to talk he had gone to marys and upon entering thought he heard some one with her she didnt answer him at first when he found her in her bedroom she was like a ghost he accused her her silence made him furious then he berated her brought down the wrath of god upon her threatened her with damnation all of which she never seemed to hear but when he tried to touch her she flew at him like a shepanther thats what he called her she said shed kill him and she drove him out of her house he was all weak and unstrung and i believe scared too when he came to me she must have been a fury those quiet gentle women are furies when theyre once roused well i was hours up with him and finally he got over it he didnt pray any more he paced the room it was just daybreak when he said the wrath of god had come to him i tried to keep him from going back to mary but he went an hour later the women ran to tell me he had been found dead at marys door  ruthshe was maddrivenshe didnt know what shewas doing said shefford brokenly  she was always a strange girl more like an indian than any one i ever knew we called her the sago lily i gave her the name she was so sweet lovely white and gold like those flowers and to think oh its horrible for her you must save her if you get her away there never will be anything come of it the mormons will hush it up  ruth time is flying rejoined shefford hurriedly i must go back to joe you be ready for us when we come wear something loose easily thrown off and dont forget the long hood  ill be ready and watching she said the sooner the better id say  he left her and returned toward camp in the same circling route by which he had come the indian had disappeared and so had his mustang this significant fact augmented sheffords hurried thrilling excitement but one glance at joes face changed all that to a sudden numbness a sinking of his heart  what is it he queried  look there exclaimed the mormon  sheffords quick eye caught sight of horses and men down the valley he saw several indians and three or four white men they were making camp  who are they demanded shefford  shadd and some of his gang reckon that piute told the news by tomorrow the valley will be full as a horsewranglers corral lucky nas ta bega got away before that gang rode in now things wont look as queer as they might have looked the indian took a pack of grub six mustangs and my guns then there was your rifle in your saddlesheath so youll be well heeled in case you come to close quarters reckon you can look for a running fight for now as soon as your flight is discovered shadd will hit your trail hes in with the mormons you know himwhat youll have to deal with but the advantage will all be yours you can ambush the trail  were in for it and the sooner were off the better replied shefford grimly  reckon thats gospel wellcome on  the mormon strode off and shefford catching up with him kept at his side sheffords mind was full but joes dark and gloomy face did not invite communication they entered the pinyon grove and passed the cabin where the tragedy had been enacted a tarpaulin had been stretched across the front porch beal was not in sight nor were any of the women  i forgot said shefford suddenly where am i to meet the indian  climb the west wall back of camp replied joe nas ta bega took the stonebridge trail but hell leave that climb the rocks then hide the outfit and come back to watch for you reckon hell see you when you top the wall  they passed on into the heart of the village joe tarried at the window of a cabin and passed a few remarks to a woman there and then he inquired for mother smith at her house when they left here the mormon gave shefford a nudge then they separated joe going toward the schoolhouse while shefford bent his steps in the direction of ruths home  her door opened before he had a chance to knock he entered ruth white and resolute greeted him with a wistful smile  all ready she asked  yes are you he replied lowvoiced  ive only to put on my hood i think luck favors you hester was here and she said elder smith told some one that mary hadnt been offered anything to eat yet so im taking her a little itll be a good excuse for me to get in the schoolhouse to see her i can throw off this dress and she can put it on in a minute then the hood i mustnt forget to hide her golden hair you know how it flies but this is a big hood well im ready now andthis s our last time together  ruth what can i sayhow can i thank you  i dont want any thanks itll be something to think of alwaysto make me happy only id like to feel youyou cared a little  the wistful smile was there a tremor on the sad lips and a shadow of soulhunger in her eyes shefford did not misunderstand her she did not mean love although it was a yearning for real love that she mutely expressed  care i shall care all my life he said with strong feeling i shall never forget you  its not likely ill forget you goodby john  shefford took her in his arms and held her close ruthgoodby he said huskily  then he released her she adjusted the hood and taking up a little tray which held food covered with a napkin she turned to the door he opened it and they went out  they did not speak another word  it was not a long walk from ruths home to the schoolhouse yet if it were to be measured by sheffords emotion the distance would have been unending the sacrifice offered by ruth and joe would have been noble under any circumstances had they been gentiles or persons with no particular religion but considering that they were mormons that ruth had been a sealedwife that joe had been brought up under the strange secret and binding creed their action was no less than tremendous in its import shefford took it to mean vastly more than loyalty to him and pity for fay larkin as ruth and joe had arisen to this height so perhaps would other young mormons have arisen it needed only the situation the climax to focus these longinsulated slowdeveloping and inquiring minds upon the truththat one wife one mother of children for one man at one time as a law of nature love and righteousness shefford felt as if he were marching with the whole younger generation of mormons as if somehow he had been a humble instrument in the working out of their destiny in the awakening that was to eliminate from their religion the only thing which kept it from being as good for man and perhaps as true as any other religion  and then suddenly he turned the corner of schoolhouse to encounter joe talking with the mormon henninger elder smith was not present  why hello ruth greeted joe youve fetched mary some dinner now thats good of you  may i go in asked ruth  reckon so replied henninger scratching his head he appeared to be tractable and probably was goodnatured under pleasant conditions she ought to have somethin to eat an nobody pearsto have remembered thatwere so set up  he unbarred the huge clumsy door and allowed ruth to pass in  joe you can go in if you want he said but hurry out before elder smith comes back from his dinner  joe mumbled something gave a husky cough and then went in  shefford experienced great difficulty in presenting to this mild mormon a natural and unagitated front when all his internal structure seemed to be in a state of turmoil he did not see how it was possible to keep the fact from showing in his face so he turned away and took aimless steps here and there  pears like wed hev rain observed henninger its right warm an them clouds are onseasonable  yes replied shefford hope so a little rain would be good for the grass  joe tells me shadd rode in an some of his fellers  so i see about eight in the party  shefford was gritting his teeth and preparing to endure the ordeal of controlling his mind and expression when the door opened and joe stalked out he had his sombrero pulled down so that it hid the upper half of his face his lips were a shade off healthy color he stood there with his back to the door  say what mary needs is quietto be left alone he said ruth says if she rests sleeps a little she wont get fever henninger dont let anybody disturb her till night  all right joe replied the mormon an i take it good of ruth an you to concern yourselves  a slight tap on the inside of the door sent sheffords pulses to throbbing joe opened it with a strong and vigorous sweep that meant more than the mere action  ruthreckon you didnt stay long he said and his voice rang clear sure you feel sick and weak why seeing her flustered even me  a slender darkgarbed woman wearing a long black hood stepped uncertainly out she appeared to be ruth sheffords heart stood still because she looked so like ruth but she did not step steadily she seemed dazed she did not raise the hooded head  go home said joe and his voice rang a little louder take her home shefford or better walk her round some shes faintish  and see here henninger  shefford led the girl away with a hand in apparent carelessness on her arm after a few rods she walked with a freer step and then a swifter he found it necessary to make that hold on her arm a real one so as to keep her from walking too fast no one however appeared to observe them when they passed ruths house then shefford began to lose his fear that this was not fay larkin he was far from being calm or clearsighted he thought he recognized that free step nevertheless he could not make sure when they passed under the trees crossed the brook and turned down along the west wall then doubt ceased in sheffords mind he knew this was not ruth still so strange was his agitation so keen his suspense that he needed confirmation of ear of eye he wanted to hear her voice to see her face yet just as strangely there was a twist of feeling a reluctance a sadness that kept off the moment  they reached the low slowswelling slant of wall and started to ascend how impossible not to recognize fay larkin now in that swift grace and skill on the steep wall still though he knew her he perversely clung to the unreality of the moment but when a long braid of deadgold hair tumbled from under the hood then his heart leaped that identified fay larkin he had freed her he was taking her away then a sadness embittered his joy  as always before she distanced him in the ascent to the top she went on without looking back but shefford had an irresistible desire to took again and the last time at this valley where he had suffered and loved so much     xvi surprise valley   from the summit of the wall the plateau waved away in red and yellow ridges with here and there little valleys green with cedar and pinyon  upon one of these ridges silhouetted against the sky appeared the stalking figure of the indian he had espied the fugitives he disappeared in a niche and presently came again into view round a corner of cliff here he waited and soon shefford and fay joined him  bi nai it is well he said  shefford eagerly asked for the horses and nas ta bega silently pointed down the niche which was evidently an opening into one of the shallow cañon then he led the way walking swiftly it was shefford and not fay who had difficulty in keeping close to him this speed caused shefford to become more alive to the business instead of the feeling of the flight the indian entered a crack between low cliffsa very narrow cañon full of rocks and clumps of cedarsand in a halfhour or less he came to where the mustangs were halted among some cedars three of the mustangs including nackyal were saddled one bore a small pack and the remaining two had blankets strapped on their backs  fay can you ride in that long skirt asked shefford how strange it seemed that his first words to her were practical when all his impassioned thought had been only mute but the instant he spoke he experienced a relief a relaxation  ill take it off replied fay just as practically and in a twinkling she slipped out of both waist and skirt she had worn them over the short whiteflannel dress with which shefford had grown familiar  as nackyal appeared to be the safest mustang for her to ride shefford helped her upon him and then attended to the stirrups when he had adjusted them to the proper length he drew the bridle over nackyals head and upon handing it to her found himself suddenly looking into her face she had taken off the hood too the instant there eyes met he realized that she was strangely afraid to meet his glance as he was to meet hers that seemed natural but her face was flushed and there were unmistakable signs upon it of growing excitement of mounting happiness save for that fugitive glance she would have been the fay larkin of yesterday how he had expected her to look he did not know but it was not like this and never had he felt her strange quality of simplicity so powerfully  have you ever been herethrough this little cañon he asked  oh yes lots of times  youll be able to lead us to surprise valley you think  i know it i shall see uncle jim and mother jane before sunset  i hopeyou do he replied a little shakily perhaps wed better not tell them of thetheabout what happened last night  her beautiful grave and troubled glance returned to meet his and he received a shock that he considered was amaze and after more swift consideration he believed he was amazed because that look instead of betraying fear or gloom or any haunting shadow of darkness betrayed apprehension for himgrave sweet troubled love for him she was not thinking of herself at allof what he might think of her of a possible gulf between them of a vast and terrible change in the relation of soul to soul he experienced a profound gladness though he could not understand her he was happy that the horror of waggoners death had escaped her he loved her he meant to give his life to her and right then and there he accepted the burden of her deed and meant to bear it without ever letting her know of the shadow between them  fay well forgetwhats behind us he said now to find surprise valley lead on nackyal is gentle pull him the way you want to go well follow  shefford mounted the other saddled mustang and they set off fay in advance presently they rode out of this cañon up to level cedarpatched solid rock and here fay turned straight west evidently she had been over the ground before the heights to which he had climbed with her were up to the left great slopes and looming promontories and the course she chose was as level and easy as any he could have picked out in that direction  when a mile or more of this upanddown travel had been traversed fay halted and appeared to be at fault the plateau was losing its rounded smooth wavy characteristics and to the west grew bolder more rugged more cut up into low crags and buttes after a long sweeping glance fay headed straight for this rougher country thereafter from time to time she repeated this action  fay how do you know youre going in the right direction asked shefford anxiously  i never forget any ground ive been over i keep my eyes close ahead all that seems strange to me is the wrong way what ive seen before must be the right way because i saw it when they brought me from surprise valley  shefford had to acknowledge that she was following an indians instinct for ground he had once covered  still shefford began to worry and finally dropped back to question nas ta bega  bi nai she has the eye of a navajo replied the indian look ironshod horses have passed here see the marks in the stone  shefford indeed made out faint cut tracks that would have escaped his own sight they had been made long ago but they were unmistakable  shes following the trail by memoryshe must remember the stones trees sage cactus said shefford in surprise  pictures in her mind replied the indian  thereafter the farther she progressed the less at fault she appeared and the faster she traveled she made several miles an hour and about the middle of the afternoon entered upon the more broken region of the plateau view became restricted low walls and ruined cliffs of red rock with cedars at their base and gullies growing into cañon and cañon opening into larger onesthese were passed and crossed and climbed and rimmed in travel that grew more difficult as the going became wilder then there was a steady ascent up and up all the time though not steep until another level green with cedar and pinyon was reached  it reminded shefford of the forest near the mouth of the sagi it was so dense he could not see far ahead of fay and often he lost sight of her entirely presently he rode out of the forest into a strip of purple sage it ended abruptly and above that abrupt line seemingly far away rose a long red wall instantly he recognized that to be the opposite wall of a cañon which as yet he could not see  fay was acting strangely and he hurried forward she slipped off nackyal and fell sprang up and ran wildly to stand upon a promontory her arms uplifted her hair a mass of moving gold in the wind her attitude one of wild and eloquent significance  shefford ran too and as he ran the red wall in his eager sight seemed to enlarge downward deeper and deeper and then it merged into a strip of green  suddenly beneath him yawned a redwalled gulf a deceiving gulf seen through transparent haze a softly shining greenandwhite valley strange wild beautiful like a picture in his memory  surprise valley he cried in wondering recognition  fay larkin waved her arms as if they were wings to carry her swiftly downward and her plaintive cry fitted the wildness of her manner and the lonely height where she leaned  shefford drew her back from the rim  fay we are here he said i recognize the valley i miss only one thingthe arch of stone  his words seemed to recall her to reality  the arch that fell when the wall slipped in the great avalanche see there is the place we can get down there oh let us hurry  the indian reached the rim and his falcon gaze swept the valley ugh he exclaimed he too recognized the valley that he had vainly sought for half a year  bring the lassos said shefford  with fay leading they followed the rim toward the head of the valley here the wall had caved in and there was a slope of jumbled rock a thousand feet wide and more than that in depth it was easy to descend because there were so many rocks waisthigh that afforded a handhold shefford marked however that fay never took advantage of these more than once he paused to watch her swiftly she went down she stepped from rock to rock lightly she crossed cracks and pits she ran along the sharp and broken edge of a long ledge she poised on a pointed stone and surefooted as a mountainsheep she sprang to another that had scarce surface for a foothold her moccasins flashed seemed to hold wondrously on any angle and when a rock tipped or slipped with her she leaped to a surer stand shefford watched her performance so swift agile so perfectly balanced showing such wonderful accord between eye and foot and then when he swept his gaze down upon that wild valley where she had roamed alone for twelve years he marveled no more  the farther down he got the greater became the size of rocks until he found himself amid huge pieces of cliff as large as houses he lost sight of fay entirely and he anxiously threaded a narrow winding descending way between the broken masses finally he came out upon flat rock again fay stood on another rim looking down he saw that the slide had moved far out into the valley and the lower part of it consisted of great sections of wall in fact the base of the great wall had just moved out with the avalanche and this much of it held its vertical position looking upward shefford was astounded and thrilled to see how far he had descended how the walls leaned like a great wide curving continuous rim of mountain  here here called fay heres where they got downwhere they brought me up here are the sticks they used they stuck them in this crack down to that ledge  shefford ran to her side and looked down there was a narrow split in this section of wall and it was perhaps sixty feet in depth the floor of rock below led out in a ledge with a sheer drop to the valley level  as shefford gazed pondering on a way to descend lower the indian reached his side he had no sooner looked than he proceeded to act selecting one of the sticks which were strong pieces of cedar well hewn and trimmed he jammed it between the walls of the crack till it stuck fast then sitting astride this one he jammed in another some three feet below when he got down upon that one it was necessary for shefford to drop him a third stick in a comparatively short time the indian reached the ledge below then he called for the lassos shefford threw them down his next move was an attempt to assist fay but she slipped out of his grasp and descended the ladder with a swiftness that made him hold his breath still when his turn came her spirit so governed him that he went down as swiftly and even leaped sheer the last ten feet  nas ta bega and fay were leaning over the ledge  heres the place she said excitedly let me down on the rope  it took two thirtyfoot lassos tied together to reach the floor of the valley shefford folded his vest put it round fay and slipped a loop of the lasso under her arms then he and nas ta bega lowered her to the grass below fay throwing off the loop bounded away like a wild creature uttering the strangest cries he had ever heard and she disappeared along the wall  ill go down said shefford to the indian you stay here to help pull us up  hand over hand shefford descended and when his feet touched the grass he experienced a shock of the most singular exultation  in surprise valley he breathed softly the dream that had come to him with his friends story the years of waiting wondering and then the long fruitless hopeless search in the desert uplandsthese were in his mind as he turned along the wall where fay had disappeared he faced a wide terrace green with grass and moss and starry with strange white flowers and darkfoliaged spearpointed sprucetrees below the terrace sloped a bench covered with thick copse and this merged into a forest of dwarf oaks and beyond that was a beautiful strip of white aspens their leaves quivering in the stillness the air was close sweet warm fragrant and remarkably dry it reminded him of the air he had smelled in dry caves under cliffs he reached a point from where he saw a meadow dotted with redandwhitespotted cattle and little black burros there were many of them and he remembered with a start the agony of toil and peril venters had endured bringing the progenitors of this stock into the valley what a strange wild beautiful story it all was but a story connected with this valley could not have been otherwise  beyond the meadow on the other side of the valley extended the forest and that ended in the rising bench of thicket which gave place to green slope and mossy terrace of sharptipped sprucesand all this led the eye irresistibly up to the red wall where a vast dark wonderful cavern yawned with its rustcolored streaks of stain on the wall and the queer little houses of the cliffdwellers with their black vacant silent windows speaking so weirdly of the unknown past  shefford passed a place where the ground had been cultivated but not as recently as the last six months there was a scant shock of corn and many meager standing stalks he became aware of a low whining hum and a fragrance overpowering in its sweetness and there round another corner of wall he came upon an orchard all pink and white in blossom and melodious with the buzz and hum of innumerable bees  he crossed a little stream that had been dammed went along a pond down beside an irrigationditch that furnished water to orchard and vineyard and from there he strode into a beautiful cove between two jutting corners of red wall it was level and green and the spruces stood gracefully everywhere beyond their dark trunks he saw caves in the wall  suddenly the fragrance of blossom was overwhelmed by the stronger fragrance of smoke from a wood fire swiftly he strode under the spruces quail fluttered before him as tame as chickens big gray rabbits scarcely moved out of his way the branches above him were full of mockingbirds and thenthere before him stood three figures  fay larkin was held close to the side of a magnificent woman barbarously clad in garments made of skins and pieces of blanket her face worked in noble emotion shefford seemed to see the ghost of that fair beauty venters had said was jane withersteens her hair was gray near her stood a lean stoopshouldered man whose long hair was perfectly white his gaunt face was bare of beard it had strange sloping sad lines and he was staring with mild surprised eyes  the moment held shefford mute till sight of fay larkins tearwet face broke the spell he leaped forward and his strong hands reached for the woman and the man  jane withersteen lassiter i have found you  oh sir who are you she cried with rich and deep and quivering voice this child came runningscreaming she could not speak we thought she had gone madand escaped to come back to us  i am john shefford he replied swiftly i am

sacrifice herself to save us what of him its not been so many long yearsi remember what my father wasand dyer and tullall those cruel churchmen  waggoner is dead replied shefford  dead she is free oh whathow did he die  he was killed  who did it  thats no matter replied shefford stonily and he met her gaze with steady eyes hes out of the way fay was never his wife fays free weve come to take you

things you want to take with you  ohyesmother jane let us hurry cried fay im so fulli cant talkmy heart hurts so  jane withersteens face shone with an exceedingly radiant light and a glory blended with a terrible fear in her eyes  fay my little fay  lassiter had stood there with his mild clear blue eyes upon shefford  i shore am glad to see youall he drawled and extended his hand as if the meeting were casual whatd you say your name was  shefford repeated it as he met the proffered hand  hows bern an bess lassiter inquired  they were well prosperous happy when last i saw them they had a baby  now aint thet fine jane did you hear bess has a baby an jane didnt i always say bern would come back to get us out shore its just the same  how cool easy slow and mild this lassiter seemed had the man grown old shefford wondered the past to him manifestly was only yesterday and the danger of the present was as nothing looking in lassiters face shefford was baffled if he had not remembered the greatness of this old gunman he might have believed that the lonely years in the valley had unbalanced his mind in an hour like this coolness seemed inexplicableassuredly would have been impossible in an ordinary man yet what hid behind that drawling coolness what was the meaning of those long sloping shadowy lines of the face what spirit lay in the deep mild clear eyes shefford experienced a sudden check to what had been his first growing impression of a drifting broken old man  lassiter pack what little you can carrymustnt be muchand well get out of here said shefford  i shore will reckon i aint agoin to need a packtrain we saved the clothes we wore in here jane never thought it no use but i figgered we might need them some day they wont be stylish but i reckon theyll do better n these skins an theres an old coat thet was venterss  the mild dreamy look became intensified in lassiters eyes  did venters have any hosses when you knowed him he asked  he had a farm full of horses replied shefford with a smile and there were two blacksthe grandest horses i ever saw black star and night you remember lassiter  shore i was wonderin if he got the blacks out they must be growin old by now grand hosses they was but jane had another hoss a big devil of a sorrel his name was wrangle did venters ever tell you about himan thet race with jerry card  a hundred times replied shefford  wrangle run the blacks off their legs but jane never would believe thet an i couldnt change her all these years reckon mebbe well get to see them blacks  indeed i hopei believe you will replied shefford feelingly  shore wont thet be fine jane did you hear black star an night are livin an well get to see them  but jane withersteen only clasped fay in her arms and looked at lassiter with wet and glistening eyes  shefford told them to hurry and come to the cliff where the ascent from the valley was to be made he thought best to leave them alone to make their preparations and bid farewell to the cavern home they had known for so long  then he strolled back along the wall loitering here to gaze into a cave and there to study crude red paintings in the nooks and sometimes he halted thoughtfully and did not see anything at length he rounded a corner of cliff to espy nas ta bega sitting upon the ledge reposeful and watchful as usual shefford told the indian they would be climbing out soon and then he sat down to wait and let his gaze rove over the valley  he might have sat there a long while so sad and reflective and wondering was his thought but it seemed a very short time till fay came in sight with her free swift grace and lassiter and jane some distance behind jane carried a small bundle and lassiter had a sack over his shoulder that appeared no inconsiderable burden  them beans shore is heavy he drawled as he deposited the sack upon the ground  shefford curiously took hold of the sack and was amazed to find that a second and hard muscular effort was required to lift it  beans he queried  shore replied lassiter  thats the heaviest sack of beans i ever saw whyits not possible it can be lassiter weve a long rough trail weve got to pack light  wal i aint agoin to leave this here sack behind reckon ive been all of twelve years in fillin it he declared mildly  shefford could only stare at him  fay may need them beans went on lassiter  why  because theyre gold  gold ejaculated shefford  shore an they represent some work twelve years of diggin an washin  shefford laughed constrainedly well lassiter that alters the case considerably a sack of gold nuggets or grains or beans as you call them certainly must not be left behind come now well tackle this climbing job  he called up to the indian and grasping the rope began to walk up the first slant and then by dint of handoverhand effort and climbing with knees and feet he succeeded with nas ta begas help in making the ledge then he let down the rope to haul up the sack and bundle that done he directed fay to fasten the noose round her as he had fixed it before when she had complied he called to her to hold herself out from the wall while he and nas ta bega hauled her up  hold the rope tight replied fay ill walk up  and to sheffords amaze and admiration she virtually walked up that almost perpendicular wall by slipping her hands along the rope and stepping as she pulled herself up there if never before he saw the fruit of her years of experience on steep slopes only such experience could have made the feat possible  jane had to be hauled up and the task was a painful one for her lassiters turn came then and he showed more strength and agility than shefford had supposed him capable of from the ledge they turned their attention to the narrow crack with its ladder of sticks fay had already ascended and now hung over the rim her white face and golden hair framed vividly in the narrow stream of blue sky above  mother jane uncle jim you are so slow she called  wal fay we havent been second cousins to a cañon squirrel all these years replied lassiter  this upper half of the climb bid fair to be as difficult for jane if not so painful as the lower it was necessary for the indian to go up and drop the rope which was looped around her and then with him pulling from above and shefford assisting jane as she climbed she was finally gotten up without mishap when lassiter reached the level they rested a little while and then faced the great slide of jumbled rocks fay led the way light supple tireless and shefford never ceased looking at her at last they surmounted the long slope and winding along the rim reached the point where fay had led out of the cedars  nas ta bega then was the one to whom shefford looked for every decision or action of the immediate future the indian said he had seen a pool of water in a rocky hole that the day was spent that here was a little grass for the mustangs and it would be well to camp right there so while nas ta bega attended to the mustangs shefford set about such preparations for camp and supper as their light pack afforded the question of beds was easily answered for the mats of soft needles under pinyon and cedar would be comfortable places to sleep  when shefford felt free again the sun was setting lassiter and jane were walking under the trees the indian had returned to camp but fay was missing shefford imagined he knew where to find her and upon going to the edge of the forest he saw her sitting on the promontory he approached her drawn in spite of a feeling that perhaps he ought to stay away  fay would you rather be alone he asked  his voice startled her  i want you she replied and held out her hand  taking it in his own he sat beside her  the red sun was at their backs surprise valley lay hazy dusky shadowy beneath them the opposite wall seemed fired by crimson flame save far down at its base which the sun no longer touched and the dark line of red slowly rose encroaching upon the bright crimson changing transparent yet dusky veils seemed to float between the walls long red rays where the sun shone through notch or crack in the rim split the darker spaces deep down at the floor the forest darkened the strip of aspen paled the meadow turned gray and all under the shelves and in the great caverns a purple gloom deepened then the sun set and swiftly twilight was there below while day lingered above on the opposite wall the fire died and the stone grew cold  a cañon nighthawk voiced his lonely weird and melancholy cry and it seemed to pierce and mark the silence  a pale star peering out of a sky that had begun to turn blue marked the end of twilight and all the purple shadows moved and hovered and changed till softly and mysteriously they embraced black night  beautiful wild strange silent surprise valley shefford saw it before and beneath him a dark abyss now the abode of loneliness he imagined faintly what was in fay larkins heart for the last time she had seen the sun set there and night come with its dead silence and sweet mystery and phantom shadows its velvet blue sky and white trains of stars  he who had dreamed and longed and searched found that the hour had been incalculable for him in its import     xvii the trail to nonnezoshe   when shefford awoke next morning and sat up on his bed of pinyon boughs the dawn had broken cold with a ruddy gold brightness under the trees nas ta bega and lassiter were busy around a campfire the mustangs were haltered near by jane withersteen combed out her long tangled tresses with a crude wooden comb and fay larkin was not in sight as she had been missing from the group at sunset so she was now at sunrise shefford went out to take his last look at surprise valley  on the evening before the valley had been a place of dusky red veils and purple shadows and now it was pinkwalled clear and rosy and green and white with wonderful shafts of gold slanting down from the notched eastern rim fay stood on the promontory and shefford did not break the spell of her silent farewell to her wild home a strange emotion abided with him and he knew he would always all his life regret leaving surprise valley  then the indian called  come fay said shefford gently  and she turned away with dark haunted eyes and a white still face  the somber indian gave a silent gesture for shefford to make haste while they had breakfast the mustangs were saddled and packed and soon all was in readiness for the flight fay was given nackyal jane the saddled horse shefford had ridden and lassiter the indians roan shefford and nas ta bega were to ride the blanketed mustangs and the sixth and last one bore the pack nas ta bega set off leading this horse the others of the party lined in behind with shefford at the rear  nas ta bega led at a brisk trot and sometimes on level stretches of ground at an easy canter and shefford had a grim realization of what this flight was going to be for these three fugitives now so unaccustomed to riding jane and lassiter however needed no watching and showed they had never forgotten how to manage a horse the indian backtrailed yesterdays path for an hour then headed west to the left and entered a low pass all parts of this plateau country looked alike and shefford was at some pains to tell the difference of this strange ground from that which he had been over in another hour they got out of the rugged broken rock to the windworn and smooth shallow cañon shefford calculated that they were coming to the end of the plateau the low walls slanted lower the cañon made a turn nas ta bega disappeared and then the others of the party when shefford turned the corner of wall he saw a short strip of bare rocky ground with only sky beyond the indian and his followers had halted in a group shefford rode to them halted himself and in one sweeping glance realized the meaning of their silent gaze but immediately nas ta bega started down and the mustangs without word or touch followed him shefford however lingered on the promontory  his gaze seemed impelled and held by things afarthe great yellowandpurple corrugated world of distance now on a level with his eyes he was drawn by the beauty and the grandeur of that scene and transfixed by the realization that he had dared to venture to find a way through this vast wild and upflung fastness he kept looking afar sweeping the threequartered circle of horizon till his judgment of distance was confounded and his sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next then he withdrew his fascinated gaze to adopt the indians method of studying unlimited spaces in the desertto look with slow contracted eyes from near to far  his companions had begun to zigzag down a long slope bare of rock with yellow gravel patches showing between the scant strips of green and here and there a scrubcedar half a mile down the slope merged into green level but close keen gaze made out this level to be a rolling plain growing darker green with blue lines of ravines and thin undefined spaces that might be mirage miles and miles it swept and relied and heaved to lose its waves in apparent darker level a round red rock stood isolated marking the end of the barren plain and farther on were other round rocks all isolated all of different shape they resembled huge grazing cattle but as shefford gazed and his sight gained strength from steadily holding it to separate features these rocks were strangely magnified they grew and grew into mounds castles domes cragsgreat red windcarved buttes one by one they drew his gaze to the wall of upflung rock he seemed to see a thousand domes of a thousand shapes and colors and among them a thousand blue clefts each one a little mark in his sight yet which he knew was a cañon so far he gained some idea of what he saw but beyond this wide area of curved lines rose another wall dwarfing the lower dark red horizonlong magnificent in frowning boldness and because of its limitless deceiving surfaces breaks and lines incomprehensible to the sight of man away to the eastward began a winding ragged blue line looping back upon itself and then winding away again growing wider and bluer this line was the san juan cañon where was joe lake at that moment had he embarked yet on the riverdid that blue line so faint so deceiving hold him and the boat almost it was impossible to believe shefford followed the blue line all its length a hundred miles he fancied down toward the west where it joined a dark purple shadowy cleft and this was the grand cañon of the colorado sheffords eye swept along with that winding mark farther and farther to the west round to the left until the cleft growing larger and coming closer losing its deception was seen to be a wild and winding cañon still farther to the left as he swung in fascinated gaze it split the wonderful walla vast plateau now with great red peaks and yellow mesas the cañon was full of purple smoke it turned it gaped it lost itself and showed again in that chaos of a million cliffs and then farther on it became again a cleft a purple line at last to fail entirely in deceiving distance  shefford imagined there was no scene in all the world to equal that the tranquillity of lesser spaces was not here manifest sound movement life seemed to have no fitness here ruin was there and desolation and decay the meaning of the ages was flung at him and a man became nothing when he had gazed at the san juan cañon he had been appalled at the nature of joe lakes herculean task he had lost hope faith the thing was not possible but when shefford gazed at that sublime and majestic wilderness in which the grand cañon was only a dim line he strangely lost his terror and something else came to him from across the shining spaces if nas ta bega led them safely down to the river if joe lake met them at the mouth of nonnezoshe boco if they survived the rapids of that terrible gorge then shefford would have to face his soul and the meaning of this spirit that breathed on the wind  he urged his mustang to the descent of the slope and as he went down slowly drawing nearer to the other fugitives his mind alternated between this strange intimation of faith this subtle uplift of his spirit and the growing gloom and shadow in his love for fay larkin not that he loved her less but more a possible god hovering near him like the indians spiritstep on the trail made his soul the darker for fays crime and he saw with light with deeper sadness with sterner truth  more than once the indian turned on his mustang to look up the slope and the light flashed from his dark somber face shefford instinctively looked back himself and then realized the unconscious motive of the action deep within him there had been a premonition of certain pursuit and the indians reiterated backward glance had at length brought the feeling upward thereafter as they descended shefford gradually added to his already wrought emotions a mounting anxiety  no sign of a trail showed where the base of the slope rolled out to meet the green plain the earth was gravelly with dark patches of heavy silt almost like cinders and round black rocks flinty and glassy cracked away from the hoofs of the mustangs there was a level bench a mile wide then a ravine and then an ascent and after that rounded ridge and ravine one after the other like huge swells of a monstrous sea indian paintbrush vied in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta of cactus there was no sage soapweed and meager grass and a bunch of cactus here and there lent the green to that barren and it was green only at a distance nas ta bega kept on a steady even trot the sun climbed the wind rose and whipped dust from under the mustangs  shefford looked back often and the farther out in the plain he reached the higher loomed the plateau they had descended and as he faced ahead again the lower sank the reddomed and castled horizon to the fore the ravines became deeper with dry rock bottoms and the ridgetops sharper with outcroppings of yellow crumbling ledges once across the central depression of that plain a gradual ascent became evident and the round rocks grew clearer in sight began to rise shine and grow and thereafter every slope brought them nearer  the sun was straight overhead and hot when nas ta bega halted the party under the first lonely scrubcedar they all dismounted to stretch their limbs and rest the horses it was not a talkative group lassiters comments on the neverending green plain elicited no response jane withersteen looked afar with the past in her eyes shefford felt fays wistful glance and could not meet it indeed he seemed to want to hide something from her the indian bent a falcon gaze on the distant slope and shefford did not like that intent searching steadfast watchfulness suddenly nas ta bega stiffened and whipped the halter he held  ugh he exclaimed  all eyes followed the direction of his dark hand puffs of dust rose from the base of the long slope they had descended tiny dark specks moved with the pace of a snail  shadd added the indian  i expected it said shefford darkly as he rose  an whos shadd drawled lassiter in his cool slow speech  briefly shefford explained and then looking at nas ta bega he added  the hardestriding outfit in the country we cant get away from them  jane withersteen was silent but fay uttered a low cry shefford did not look at either of them the indian began swiftly to tighten the saddlecinches of his roan and shefford did likewise for nackyal then shefford drew his rifle out of the saddlesheath and joe lakes big guns from the saddlebag  here lassiter maybe you havent forgotten how to use these he said  the old gunman started as if he had seen ghosts his hands grew clawlike as he reached for the guns he threw open the cylinders spilled out the shells snapped back the cylinders then he went through motions too swift for shefford to follow but shefford heard the hammers falling so swiftly they blended their clicks almost in one sound lassiter reloaded the guns with a speed comparable with the other actions a remarkable transformation had come over him he did not seem the same man the mild eyes had changed the long shadowy sloping lines were tense cords and there was a cold ashy shade on his face  twelve years he muttered to himself i dropped them old guns back there where i rolled the rock twelve years  shefford realized the twelve years were as if they had never been and he would rather have had this old gunman with him than a dozen ordinary men  the indian spoke rapidly in navajo saying that once in the rocks they were safe then after another look at the distant dustpuffs he wheeled his mustang  it was doubtful if the party could have kept near him had they been responsible for the gait of their mounts the fact was that the way the indian called to his mustang or some leadership in the one rode drew the others to a like trot or climb or canter for a long time shefford did not turn round he knew what to expect and when he did turn he was startled at the gain made by the pursuers but he was encouraged as well by the looming red rounded peaks seemingly now so close he could see the dark splits between the sloping curved walls the pinyon patches in the amphitheater under the circled walls that was a wild place they were approaching and once in there he believed pursuit would be useless however there were miles to go still and those hardriding devils behind made alarming decrease in the intervening distance shefford could see the horses plainly now how they made the dust fly he counted up to sixand then the dust and moving line caused the others to be indistinguishable  at last only a long gently rising slope separated the fugitives from that labyrinthine network of wildly carved rock but it was the clear air that made the distance seem short mile after mile the mustangs climbed and when they were perhaps halfway across that last slope to the rocks the first horse of the pursuers mounted to the level behind in a few moments the whole band was strung out in sight nas ta bega kept his mustang at a steady walk in spite of the gaining pursuers there came a point however when the indian reaching comparatively level ground put his mount to a swinging canter the other mustangs broke into the same gait  it became a race then with the couple of miles between fugitives and pursuers only imperceptibly lessened nas ta bega had saved his mustangs and shadd had ridden his to the limit shefford kept looking back gripping his rifle hoping it would not come to a fight yet slowly losing that reluctance  sage began to show on the slope and other kinds of brush and cedars straggled everywhere the great rocks loomed closer the red color mixed with yellow and the slopes lengthening out not so steep yet infinitely longer than they had seemed at a distance  shefford ceased to feel the dry wind in his face they were already in the lee of the wall he could see the rocksquirrels scampering to their holes the mustangs valiantly held to the gait and at last the indian disappeared between two rounded comers of cliff the others were close behind shefford wheeled once more shadd and his gang were a mile in the rear but coming fast despite winded horses  shefford rode around the wall into a widening space thick with cedars it ended in a bare slope of smooth rock here the indian dismounted when the others came up with him he told them to lead their horses and follow then he began the ascent of the rock  it was smooth and hard though not slippery there was not a crack shefford did not see a broken piece of stone nas ta bega climbed straight up for a while and then wound around a swell to turn this way and that always going up shefford began to see similar mounds of rock all around him of every shape that could be called a curve there were yellow domes far above and small red domes far below ridges ran from one hill of rock to another there were no abrupt breaks but holes and pits and caves were everywhere and occasionally deep down an amphitheater green with cedar and pinyon the indian appeared to have a clear idea of where he wanted to go though there was no vestige of a trail on those bare slopes at length shefford was high enough to see back upon the plain but the pursuers were no longer in sight  nas ta bega led to the top of that wall only to disclose to his followers another and a higher wall beyond with a ridged bare wild and scalloped depression between here footing began to be precarious for both man and beast when the ascent of the second wall began it was necessary to zigzag up slowly and carefully taking advantage of every level bulge or depression they must have consumed half an hour mounting this slope to the summit once there shefford drew a sharp breath with both backward and forward glances shadd and his gang in single file showed dark upon the bare stone ridge behind and to the fore there twisted and dropped and curved the most dangerous slopes shefford had ever seen the fugitives had reached the height of stone wall of the divide and many of the drops upon this side were perpendicular and too steep to see the bottom  nas ta bega led along the ridgetop and then started down following the waves in the rock he came out upon a round promontory from which there could not have been any turning of a horse the long slant leading down was at an angle shefford declared impossible for the animals yet the indian started down his mustang needed urging but at last edged upon the steep descent shefford and the others had to hold back and wait it was thrilling to see the intelligent mustang he did not step he slid his fore hoofs a few inches at a time and kept directly behind the indian if he fell he would knock nas ta bega off his feet and they would both roll down together there was no doubt in sheffords mind that the mustang knew this as well as the indian foot by foot they worked down to a swelling bulge and here nas ta bega left his mustang and came back for the packhorse it was even more difficult to get this beast down then the indian called for lassiter and jane and fay to come down shefford began to keep a sharp lookout behind and above and did not see how the three fared on the slope but evidently there was no mishap nas ta bega mounted the slope again and at the moment sight of shadds dark bays silhouetted against the sky caused shefford to call out  weve got to hurry  the indian led one mustang and called to the others shefford stepped close behind they went down in single file inch by inch foot by foot and safely reached the comparative level below  shadds gang are riding their horses up and down these walls exclaimed shefford  shore replied lassiter  both the women were silent  nas ta bega led the way swiftly to the right he rounded a huge dome climbed a low rolling ridge descended and ascended and came out upon the rim of a steepwalled amphitheater along the rim was a yardwide level with the chasm to the left and steep slope to the right there was no time to flinch at the danger when an even greater danger menaced from the rear nas ta bega led and his mustang kept at his heels one misstep would have plunged the animal to his death but he was surefooted and his confidence helped the others at the apex of the curve the only course led away from the rim and here there was no level four of the mustangs slipped and slid down the smooth rock until they stopped in a shallow depression it cost time to get them out to straighten pack and saddles shefford thought he heard a yell in the rear but he could not see anything of the gang  they rounded this precipice only to face a worse one sheffords nerve was sorely tried when he saw steep slants everywhere all apparently leading down into chasms and no place a man let alone a horse could put a foot with safety nevertheless the imperturbable indian never slacked his pace always he appeared to find a way and he never had to turn back his winding course however did not now cover much distance in a straight line and herein lay the greatest peril any moment shadd and his men might come within range  upon a particularly tedious and dangerous side of rocky hill the fugitives lost so much time that shefford grew exceedingly alarmed still they accomplished it without accident and their pursuers did not heave in sight perhaps they were having trouble in a bad place  the afternoon was waning the red sun hung low above the yellow mesa to the left and there was a perceptible shading of light  at last nas ta bega came to a place that halted him it did not look so bad as places they had successfully passed yet upon closer study shefford did not see how they were to get around the neck of the gully at their feet presently the indian put the bridle over the head of his mustang and left him free he did likewise for two more mustangs while lassiter and shefford rendered a like service to theirs then the indian started down with his mustang following him the packanimal came next then fay and nackyal then lassiter and his mount with jane and hers next and shefford last they followed the indian picking their steps swiftly looking nowhere except at the stone under their feet the right side of the chasm was rimmed the curve at the head crossed and then the real peril of this trap had to be faced it was a narrow slant of ledge doubling back parallel with the course already traversed  a sharp warning cry from nas ta bega scarcely prepared shefford for hoarse yells and then a rattling riflevolley from the top of the slope opposite bullets thudded on the cliff whipped up red dust and spanged and droned away  fay larkin screamed and staggered back against the wall nackyal was hit and with frightened snort he reared pawed the air and came down pounding the stone the mustang behind him went to his knees sank with his head over the rim and slipping off plunged into the depths in an instant a dull crash came up  for a moment there was imminent peril for the horses more in the yawning hole than in the spanging of badly aimed bullets lassiter drew jane up a little slope out of the way of the frightened mustangs and shefford risking his neck rushed to fay she was holding her arm which was bleeding unheeding the rain of bullets he half carried half dragged her along the slope of the low bluff where he hid behind a corner till the indian drove the mustangs round it sheffords swift fingers were wet and red with the blood from fays arm when he had bound the wound with his scarf lassiter had gotten around with jane and was calling shefford to hurry  it had been sheffords idea to halt there and fight but he did not want to send fay on alone so he hurried ahead with her the indian had the horses going fast on a long level overhung by bulging wall lassiter and jane were looking back shefford becoming aware of a steep slope to his left looked down to see a narrow chasm and great crevices in the cliffs with bunches of cedars here and there  presently nas ta bega disappeared with the mustangs he had evidently turned off to go down behind the split cliffs shefford and fay caught up with lassiter and jane and panting hurrying looking backward and then forward they kept on as best they could in the indians course shefford made sure they had lost him when he appeared down to the left then they all ran to catch up with him they went around the chasm and then through one of the narrow cracks to come out upon the rim among cedars here the indian waited for them he pointed down another long swell of naked stone to a narrow green split which was evidently different from all these curved pits and holes and abysses for this one had straight walls and wound away out of sight it was the head of a cañon  nonnezoshe boco said the indian  nas ta bega go on replied shefford when shadd comes out on that slope above he cant see youwhere you go down hurry on with the horses and women lassiter you go with them and if shadd passes me and comes up with youdo your best im going to ambush that piute and his gang  shore youve picked out a good place replied lassiter  in another moment shefford was alone he heard the light soft pat and slide of the hoofs of the mustangs as they went down presently that sound ceased  he looked at the red stain on his handsfrom the blood of the girl he loved and he had to stifle a terrible wrath that shook his frame in regard to shadds pursuit it had not been blood that he had feared but capture for fay he and nas ta bega might have expected a shot if they resisted but to wound that unfortunate girlit made a tiger out of him when he had stilled the emotions that weakened and shook him and reached cold and implacable control of himself he crawled under the cedars to the rim and well hidden he watched and waited  shadd appeared to be slow for the first time since he had been sighted with keen eyes shefford watched the corner where he and the others had escaped from that murderous volley but shadd did not come  the sun had lost its warmth and was tipping the lofty mesa to his right soon twilight would make travel on those walls more perilous and darkness would make it impossible shadd must hurry or abandon the pursuit for that day shefford found himself grimly hopeful  suddenly he heard the click of hoofs it came faint yet clear on the still air he glued his sight upon that corner where he expected the pursuers to appear more cracks of hoofs pierced his ear clearer and sharper this time presently he gathered that they could not possibly come from beyond the corner he was watching so he looked far to the left of that place seeing no one then far to the right out over a bulge of stone he caught sight of the bobbing head of a horsethen anotherand still another  he was astounded shadd had gone below that place where the attack had been made and he had come up this steep slope more horses appearedto the number of eight shefford easily recognized a low broad squat rider to be shadd assuredly the piute did not know this country possibly however he had feared an ambush but shefford grew convinced that shadd had not expected an ambush or at least did not fear it and had mistaken the indians course moreover if he led his gang a few rods farther up that slope he would do worse than make a mistakehe would be facing a double peril  what fearless horsemen these indians were shadd was mounted as were three others of his gang evidently the white men the outlaws were the ones on foot shefford thrilled and his veins stung when he saw these pursuers come passing what he considered the danger mark but manifestly they could not see their danger assuredly they were aware of the chasm however the level upon which they were advancing narrowed gradually and they could not tell that very soon they could not go any farther nor could they turn back the alternative was to climb the slope and that was a desperate chance  they came up now about on a level with shefford and perhaps three hundred yards distant he gripped his rifle with a fatal assurance that he could kill one of them now still he waited curiosity consumed him because every foot they advanced heightened their peril shefford wondered if shadd would have chosen that course if he had not supposed the navajo had chosen it first it was plain that one of the walking piutes stooped now and then to examine the rock he was looking for some faint sign of a horse track  shadd halted within two hundred yards of where shefford lay hidden his keen eye had caught the significance of the narrowing level before he had reached the end he pointed and spoke shefford heard his voice the others replied they all looked up at the steep slope down into the chasm right below them and across into the cedars the piute in the rear succeeded in turning his horse went back and began to circle up the slope the others entered into an argument and they became more closely grouped upon the narrow bench their mustangs were lean wiry wild vicious and shefford calculated grimly upon what a stampede might mean in that position  then shadd turned his mustang up the slope like a goat he climbed another indian in the rear succeeded in pivoting his steed and started back apparently to circle round and up the others of the gang appeared uncertain they yelled hoarsely at shadd who halted on the steep slant some twenty paces above them he spoke and made motions that evidently meant the climb was easy enough it looked easy for him his dark face flashed red in the rays of the sun  at this critical moment shefford decided to fire he meant to kill shadd hoping if the leader was gone the others would abandon the pursuit the rifle wavered a little as he aimed then grew still he fired shadd never flinched but the fiery mustang perhaps wounded certainly terrified plunged down with piercing horrid scream shadd fell under him shrill yells rent the air like a thunderbolt the sliding horse was upon men and animals below  a heavy shock wild snorts upflinging heads and hoofs a terrible tramping thudding shrieking melee then a brown twisting tangled mass shot down the slant over the rim  shefford dazedly thought he saw men running he did see plunging horses one slipped fell rolled and went into the chasm  then up from the depths came a crash a long slipping roar in another instant there was a lighter crash and a lighter sliding roar  two horses shaking paralyzed with fear were left upon the narrow level beyond them a couple of men were crawling along the stone up on the level stood the two indians holding down frightened horses and staring at the fatal slope  and shefford lay there under the cedar in the ghastly grip of the moment hardly comprehending that his illaimed shot had been a thunderbolt  he did not think of shooting at the piutes they however recovering from their shock evidently feared the ambush for they swiftly drew up the slope and passed out of sight the frightened horses below whistled and tramped along the lower level finally vanishing there was nothing left on the bare wall to prove to shefford that it had been the scene of swift and tragic death he leaned from his covert and peered over the rim hundreds of feet below he saw dark growths of pinyons there was no sign of a pile of horses and men and then he realized that he could not tell the number that had perished the swift finale had been as stunning to him as if lightning had struck near him  suddenly it flashed over him what state of suspense and torture fay and jane must be in at that very moment and leaping up he ran out of the cedars to the slope behind and hurried down at risk of limb the sun had set by this time he hoped he could catch up with the party before dark he went straight down and the end of the slope was a smooth low wall the indian must have descended with the horses at some other point the cañon was about fifty yards wide and it headed under the great slope of navajo mountain these smooth rounded walls appeared to end at its low rim  shefford slid down upon a grassy bank and finding the tracks of the horses he followed them they led along the wall as soon as he had assured himself that nas ta bega had gone down the cañon he abandoned the tracks and pushed ahead swiftly he heard the soft rush of running water in the center of the cañon wound heavy lines of brightgreen foliage bordering a rocky brook the air was close warm and sweet with perfume of flowers the walls were low and shelving and soon lost that rounded appearance peculiar to the windworn slopes above shefford came to where the horses had plowed down a gravelly bank into the clear swift water of the brook the little pools of water were still muddy shefford drank finding the water cold and sweet without the bitter bite of alkali he crossed and pushed on running on the grassy levels flowers were everywhere but he did not notice them particularly the cañon made many leisurely turns and its size if it enlarged at all was not perceptible to him yet the rims above him were perhaps fifty feet high cottonwoodtrees began to appear along the brook and blossoming buckbrush in the corners of wall  he had traveled perhaps a mile when nas ta bega appearing to come out of the thicket confronted him  hello called shefford wherere fayand the others  the indian made a gesture that signified the rest of the party were beyond a little way shefford took nas ta begas arm and as they walked and he panted for breath he told what had happened back on the slopes  the indian made one of his singular speaking sweeps of hand and he scrutinized sheffords face but he received the news in silence they turned a corner of wall crossed a wide shallow boulderstrewn place in the brook and mounted the bank to a thicket beyond this from a clump of cottonwoods lassiter strode out with a gun in each hand he had been hiding  shore im glad to see you he said and the eyes that piercingly fixed on shefford were now as keen as formerly they had been mild  gone lassitertheyre gone broke out shefford wheres fayand jane  lassiter called and presently the women came out of the thick brake and fay bounded forward with her swift stride while jane followed with eager step and anxious face then they all surrounded shefford  it was shaddand his gang panted shefford eight in all three or four piutesthe others outlaws they lost track of us went below the placewhere they shot at us and they came upon a bad slope  shefford described the slope and the deep chasm and how shadd led up to the point where he saw his mistake and then how the catastrophe fell  i shotand missed repeated shefford with the sweat in beads on his pale face i missed shadd maybe i hit the horse he plungedrearedfell backa terrible fallright upon that bunch of horses and men below in a horrible wrestling screaming tangle they slid over the rim i dont know how many i saw some men running along i saw three other horses plunging one slipped and went over  i have no idea how many but shadd and some of his gang went to destruction  shore thets fine said lassiter but mebbe i wont get to use them guns after all  hardly on that gang laughed shefford the two piutes and what others escaped turned back maybe theyll meet a posse of mormonsfor of course the mormons will track us tooand come back to where shadd lost his life thats an awful place even the piute got lostcouldnt follow nas ta bega it would take any pursuers some time to find how we got in here i believe we need not fear further pursuit certainly not tonight or tomorrow then well be far down the cañon  when shefford concluded his earnest remarks the faces of fay and jane had lost the signs of suppressed dread  nas ta bega make camp here said shefford waterwoodgrasswhy this s something like fay hows your arm  it hurts she replied simply  come with me down to the brook and let me wash and bind it properly  they went and she sat upon a stone while he knelt beside her and untied his scarf from her arm as the blood had hardened it was necessary to slit her sleeve to the shoulder using his scarf he washed the blood from the wound and found it to be merely a cut a groove on the surface  thats nothing shefford said lightly itll heal in a day but therell always be a scar and when wewe get back to civilization and you wear a pretty gown without sleeves people will wonder what made this mark on your beautiful arm  fay looked at him with wonderful eyes do women wear gowns without sleeves she asked  they do  have i abeautiful arm  she stretched it out white blueveined the skin fine as satin the lines graceful and flowing a round firm strong arm  the most beautiful i ever saw he replied  but the pleasure his compliment gave her was not communicated to him his last impression of that right arm had been of its strength and his mind flashed with lightning swiftness to a picture that haunted himwaggoner lying dead on the porch with that powerfully driven knife in his breast shefford shuddered through all his being would this phantom come often to him like that hurriedly he bound up her arm with the scarf and did not look at her and was conscious that she felt a subtle change in him  the short twilight ended with the fugitives comfortable in a camp that for natural features could not have been improved upon darkness found fay and jane asleep on a soft mossy bed a blanket tucked around them and their faces still and beautiful in the flickering campfire light lassiter did not linger long awake nas ta bega seeing sheffords excessive fatigue urged him to sleep shefford demurred insisting that he share the nightwatch but nas ta bega by agreeing that shefford might have the following nights duty prevailed upon him  shefford seemed to shut his eyes upon darkness and to open them immediately to the light the stream of blue sky above the gold tints on the western rim the rosy brightening colors down in the cañon were proofs of the sunrise this morning nas ta bega proceeded leisurely and his manner was comforting when all was in readiness for a start he gave the mustang he had ridden to shefford and walked leading the packanimal  the mode of travel here was a selection of the best levels the best places to cross the brook the best banks to climb and it was a process of continual repetition as the indian picked out the course and the mustangs followed his lead there was nothing for shefford to do but take his choice between reflection that seemed predisposed toward gloom and an absorption in the beauty color wildness and changing character of nonnezoshe boco  assuredly his experience in the desert did not count in it a trip down into a strange beautiful lost cañon such as this it did not widen though the walls grew higher they began to lean and bulge and the narrow strip of sky above resembled a flowing blue river huge caverns had been hollowed out by some work of nature what he could not tell though he was sure it could not have been wind and when the brook ran close under one of these overhanging places the running water made a singular indescribable sound a crack from a hoof on a stone rang like a hollow bell and echoed from wall to wall and the croak of a frogthe only living creature he had so far noted in the cañonwas a weird and melancholy thing  fay rode close to him and his heart seemed to rejoice when she spoke when she showed how she wanted to be near him yet try as he might he could not respond his speech to herwhat little there wasdid not come spontaneously and he suffered a remorse that he could not be honestly natural to her then he would drive away the encroaching gloom trusting that a little time would dispel it  we are deeper down than surprise valley said fay  how do you know he asked  here are the pink and yellow sagolilies you remember we went once to find the white ones i have found white lilies in surprise valley but never any pink or yellow  shefford had seen flowers all along the green banks but he had not marked the lilies here he dismounted and gathered several they were larger than the white ones of higher altitudes of the same exquisite beauty and fragility of such rare pink and yellow hues as he had never seen he gave the flowers to fay  they bloom only where its always summer she said  that expressed their nature they were the orchids of the summer cañon they stood up everywhere starlike out of the green it was impossible to prevent the mustangs treading them under hoof and as the cañon deepened and many little springs added their tiny volume to the brook every grassy bench was dotted with lilies like a green sky starspangled and this increasing luxuriance manifested itself in the banks of purple moss and clumps of lavender daisies and great clusters of yellow violets the brook was lined by blossoming buckrush the rocky corners showed the crimson and magenta of cactus ledges were green with shining moss that sparkled with little white flowers the hum of bees filled the air  but by and by this green and colorful and verdant beauty the almost level floor of the cañon the banks of soft earth the thickets and the clumps of cottonwoods the shelving caverns and the bulging wallsthese features gradually were lost and nonnezoshe boco began to deepen in bare red and white stone steps the walls sheered away from one another breaking into sections and ledges and rising higher and higher and there began to be manifested a dark and solemn concordance with the nature that had created this rent in the earth  there was a stretch of miles where steep steps in hard red rock alternated with long levels of round boulders here one by one the mustangs went lame and the fugitives dismounting to spare the faithful beasts slipped and stumbled over these loose and treacherous stones fay was the only one who did not show distress she was glad to be on foot again and the rolling boulders were as stable as solid rock for her  the hours passed the toil increased the progress diminished one of the mustangs failed entirely and was left and all the while the dimensions of nonnezoshe boco magnified and its character changed it became a thousandfoot walled cañon leaning broken threatening with great yellow slides blocking passage with huge sections split off from the main wall with immense dark and gloomy caverns strangely it had no intersecting cañon it jealously guarded its secret its unusual formations of cavern and pillar and halfarch led the mind to expect any monstrous stoneshape left by an avalanche or cataclysm  down and down the fugitives toiled and now the streambed was bare of boulders and the banks of earth the floods that had rolled down that cañon had here borne away every loose thing all the floor was bare red and white stone polished glistening slippery affording treacherous foothold and the time came when nas ta bega abandoned the streambed to take to the rockstrewn and cactuscovered ledges above  jane gave out and had to be assisted upon the weary mustang fay was persuaded to mount nackyal again lassiter plodded along the indian bent tired steps far in front and shefford traveled on after him footsore and hot  the cañon widened ahead into a great ragged ironhued amphitheater and from there apparently turned abruptly at right angles sunset rimmed the walls shefford wondered dully when the indian would halt to camp and he dragged himself onward with eyes down on the rough ground  when he raised them again the indian stood on a point of slope with folded arms gazing down where the cañon veered something in nas ta begas pose quickened sheffords pulse and then his steps he reached the indian and the point where he too could see beyond that vast jutting wall that had obstructed his view  a mile beyond all was bright with the colors of sunset and spanning the cañon in the graceful shape arid beautiful hues of a rainbow was a magnificent stone bridge  nonnezoshe exclaimed the navajo with a deep and sonorous roll in his voice     xviii at the foot of the rainbow   the rainbow bridge was the one great natural phenomenon the one grand spectacle which shefford had ever seen that did not at first give vague disappointment a confounding of reality a disenchantment of contrast with what the mind had conceived  but this thing was glorious it silenced him yet did not awe or stun his body and brain weary and dull from the toil of travel received a singular and revivifying freshness he had a strange mystic perception of this rosyhued stupendous arch of stone as if in a former life it had been a goal he could not reach this wonder of nature though allsatisfying allfulfilling to his artists soul could not be a restingplace for him a destination where something awaited him a height he must scale to find peace the end of his strife but it seemed all these he could not understand his perception or his emotion still here at last apparently was the rainbow of his boyish dreams and of his manhooda rainbow magnified even beyond those dreams no longer transparent and ethereal but solidified a thing of ages sweeping up majestically from the red walls its irishued arch against the blue sky  nas ta bega led on down the ledge and shefford plodded thoughtfully after him the others followed a jutting corner of wall again hid the cañon the indian was working round to circle the huge amphitheater it was slow irritating strenuous toil for the way was on a steep slant rough and loose and dragging the rocks were as hard and jagged as lava and the cactus further hindered progress when at last the long halfcircle had been accomplished the golden and rosy lights had faded  again the cañon opened to view all the walls were pale and steely and the stone bridge loomed dark nas ta bega said camp would be made at the bridge which was now close just before they reached it the navajo halted with one of his singular actions then he stood motionless shefford realized that nas ta bega was saying his prayer to this great stone god presently the indian motioned for shefford to lead the others and the horses on under the bridge shefford did so and upon turning was amazed to see the indian climbing the steep and difficult slope on the other side all the party watched him until he disappeared behind the huge base of cliff that supported the arch shefford selected a level place for camp some few rods away and here with lassiter unsaddled and unpacked the lame drooping mustangs when this was done twilight had fallen nas ta bega appeared coming down the steep slope on this side of the bridge then shefford divined why the navajo had made that arduous climb he would not go under the bridge nonnezoshe was a navajo god and nas ta bega though educated as a white man was true to the superstition of his ancestors  nas ta bega turned the mustangs loose to fare for what scant grass grew on bench and slope firewood was even harder to find than grass when the camp duties had been performed and the simple meal eaten there was gloom gathering in the cañon and the stars had begun to blink in the pale strip of blue above the lofty walls the place was oppressive and the fugitives mostly silent shefford spread a bed of blankets for the women and jane at once lay wearily down fay stood beside the flickering fire and shefford felt her watching him he was conscious of a desire to get away from her haunting gaze to the gentle goodnight he bade her she made no response  shefford moved away into a strange dark shadow cast by the bridge against the pale starlight it was a weird black belt where he imagined he was invisible but out of which he could see there was a slab of rock near the foot of the bridge and here shefford composed himself to watch to feel to think the unknown thing that seemed to be inevitably coming to him  a slight stiffening of his neck made him aware that he had been continually looking up at the looming arch and he found that insensibly it had changed and grown it had never seemed the same any two moments but that was not what he meant near at hand it was too vast a thing for immediate comprehension he wanted to ponder on what had formed itto reflect upon its meaning as to age and force of nature yet all he could do at each moment was to see white stars hung along the dark curved line the rim of the arch seemed to shine the moon must be up there somewhere the far side of the cañon was now a blank black wall over its towering rim showed a pale glow it brightened the shades in the cañon lightened then a white disk of moon peered over the dark line the bridge turned to silver and the gloomy shadowy belt it had cast blanched and vanished  shefford became aware of the presence of nas ta bega dark silent statuesque with inscrutable eyes uplifted with all that was spiritual of the indian suggested by a somber and tranquil knowledge of his place there he represented the same to shefford as a solitary figure of human life brought out the greatness of a great picture nonnezoshe boco needed life wild life life of its millions of yearsand here stood the dark and silent indian  there was a surge in sheffords heart and in his mind a perception of a moment of incalculable change to his soul and at that moment fay larkin stole like a phantom to his side and stood there with her uncovered head shining and her white face lovely in the moonlight  may i stay with youa little she asked wistfully i cant sleep  surely you may he replied does your arm hurt too badly or are you too tired to sleep  noits this place iicant tell you how i feel  but the feeling was there in her eyes for shefford to read had he too great an emotiondid he read too muchdid he add from his soul for him the wild starry haunted eyes mirrored all that he had seen and felt under nonnezoshe and for herself they shone eloquently of courage and love  i need to talkand i dont know how she said  he was silent but he took her hands and drew her closer  why are you soso different she asked bravely  different he echoed  yes you are kindyou speak the same to me as you used to but since we started youve been different somehow  fay think how hard and dangerous the trips been ive been worriedand sick with dreadwithoh you cant imagine the strain im under how could i be my old self  it isnt worry i mean  he was too miserable to try to find out what she did mean besides he believed if he let himself think about it he would know what troubled her  ii am almost happy she said softly  fay arent you at all afraid  no youll take care of me dodo you love melike you did before  why child of coursei love you he replied brokenly and he drew her closer he had never embraced her never kissed her but there was a whiteness about her thena wraitha something from her soul and he could only gaze at her  i love you she whispered i thought i knew it thatthat night but im only finding it out now and somehow i had to tell you here  fay i havent said much to you he said hurriedly huskily i havent had a chance i love you ii ask youwill you be my wife  of course she said simply but the white moonblanched face colored with a dark and leaping blush  well be married as soon as we get out of the desert he went on and well forgetallall thats happened youre so young youll forget  id forgotten already till this difference came in you and pretty soonwhen i can say something more to youill forget all except surprise valleyand my evenings in the starlight with you  say it thenquick  she was leaning against him holding his hands in her strong clasp soulful tender almost passionate  you couldnt help it im to blame i remember what i said  what he queried in amaze  you can kill him i said that i made you kill him  killwhom cried shefford  waggoner im to blame that must be whats made you different and oh ive wanted you to know its all my fault but i wouldnt be sorry if you werent im glad hes dead  youthinki sheffords gasping whisper failed in the shock of the revelation that fay believed he had killed waggoner then with the inference came the staggering truthher guiltlessness and a paralyzing joy held him stricken  a powerful hand fell upon sheffords shoulder startling him nas ta bega stood there looking down upon him and fay never had the indian seemed so dark inscrutable of face but in his magnificent bearing in the spirit that shefford sensed in him there were nobility and power and a strange pride  the indian kept one hand on sheffords shoulder and with the other he struck himself on the breast the action was that of an indian impressive and stern significant of an indians prowess  my god breathed shefford very low  oh what does he mean cried fay  shefford held her with shaking hands trying to speak to fight a way out of these stultifying emotions  nas ta begayou heard she thinksi killed waggoner  all about the navajo then was dark and solemn disproof of her belief he did not need to speak his repetition of that savage almost boastful blow on his breast added only to the dignity and not to the denial of a warrior  fay he means he killed the mormon said shefford he must have for i did not  ah murmured fay and she leaned to him with passionate quivering gladness it was the womanthe humanthe soul born in her that came uppermost then now when there was no direct call to the wild and elemental in her nature she showed a heart above revenge the instinct of a saving right of truth as shefford knew them he took her into his arms and never had he loved her so well  nas ta bega you killed the mormon declared shefford with a voice that had gained strength no silent indian suggestion of a deed would suffice in that moment shefford needed to hear the navajo speakto have fay hear him speak nas ta bega i know i understand but tell her speak so she will know tell it as a white man would  i heard her cry out replied the indian in his slow english i waited when he came i killed him  a poignant why was wrenched from shefford nas ta bega stood silent  bi nai and when that sonorous indian name rolled in dignity from his lips he silently stalked away into the gloom that was his answer to the white man  shefford bent over fay and as the strain on him broke he held her closer and closer and his tears streamed down and his voice broke in exclamations of tenderness and thanksgiving it did not matter what she had thought but she must never know what he had thought he clasped her as something precious he had lost and regained he was shaken with a passion of remorse how could he have believed fay larkin guilty of murder women less wild and less justified than she had been driven to such a deed yet how could he have believed it of her when for two days he had been with her had seen her face and deep into her eyes there was mystery in his very blindness he cast the whole thought from him for ever there was no shadow between fay and him he had found her he had saved her she was free she was innocent and suddenly as he seemed delivered from contending tumults within he became aware that it was no unresponsive creature he had folded to his breast  he became suddenly alive to the warm throbbing contact of her bosom to her strong arms clinging round his neck to her closed eyes to the rapt whiteness of her face and he bent to cold lips that seemed to receive his first kisses as new and strange but tremulously changed at last to meet his own and then to burn with sweet and thrilling fire  my darling my dreams come true he said you are my treasure i found you here at the foot of the rainbow what if it is a stone rainbowif all is not as i had dreamed i followed a gleam and its led me to love and faith              hours afterward shefford walked alone to and fro under the bridge his trouble had given place to serenity but this night of nights he must live out wideeyed to its end  the moon had long since crossed the streak of starfired blue above and the cañon was black in shadow at times a current of wind with all the strangeness of that strange country in its hollow moan rushed through the great stone arch at other times there was silence such as shefford imagined dwelt deep under this rocky world at still other times an owl hooted and the sound was nameless but it had a mocking echo that never ended an echo of night silence gloom melancholy death age eternity  the indian lay asleep with his dark face upturned and the other sleepers lay calm and white in the starlight  shefford saw in them the meaning of life and the pastthe illimitable train of faces that had shone the stars there was a spirit in the cañon and whether or not it was what the navajo embodied in the great nonnezoshe or the life of this present or the death of the ages or the nature so magnificently manifested in those silent dreaming waiting wallsthe truth for shefford was that this spirit was god  life was eternal mans immortality lay in himself love of a woman was hopehappiness brotherhoodthat mystic and grand bi nai of the navajothat was religion     xix the grand canyon of the colorado   the night passed the gloom turned gray the dawn stole cool and pale into the cañon when nas ta bega drove the mustangs into camp the lofty ramparts of the walls were rimmed with gold and the dark arch of nonnezoshe began to lose its steely gray  the women had rested well and were in better condition to travel jane was cheerful and fay radiant one moment and in a dream the next she was beginning to live in that wonderful future they talked more than usual at breakfast and lassiter made droll remarks shefford with his great and haunting trouble ended for ever with now only danger to face ahead was a different man but thoughtful and quiet  this morning the indian leisurely made preparations for the start for all the concern he showed he might have known every foot of the cañon below nonnezoshe but for shefford with the dawn had returned anxiety a restless feeling of the need of hurry what obstacles what impassable gorges might lie between this bridge and the river the indians inscrutable serenity and fays trust her radiance the exquisite glow upon her face sustained shefford and gave him patience to endure and conceal his dread  at length the flight was resumed with nas ta bega leading on foot and shefford walking in the rear a quarter of a mile below camp the indian led down a declivity into the bottom of the narrow gorge where the stream ran he did not gaze backward for a last glance at nonnezoshe nor did jane or lassiter fay however checked nackyal at the rim of the descent and turned to look behind shefford contrasted her tremulous smile her halfhappy goodby to this place with the white stillness of her face when she had bade farewell to surprise valley then she rode nackyal down into the gorge  shefford knew that this would be his last look at the rainbow bridge as he gazed the tip of the great arch lost its cold dark stone color and began to shine the sun had just arisen high enough over some low break in the wall to reach the bridge shefford watched slowly in wondrous transformation the gold and blue and rose and pink and purple blended their hues softly mistily cloudily until once again the arch was a rainbow  ages before life had evolved upon the earth it had spread its grand arch from wall to wall black and mystic at night transparent and rosy in the sunrise at sunset a flaming curve limned against the heavens when the race of man had passed it would perhaps stand there still it was not for many eyes to see only by toil sweat endurance blood could any man ever look at nonnezoshe so it would always be alone grand silent beautiful unintelligible  shefford bade nonnezoshe a mute reverent farewell then plunging down the weathered slope of the gorge to the stream below he hurried forward to join the others they had progressed much farther than he imagined they would have and this was owing to the fact that the floor of the gorge afforded easy travel it was gravel on rock bottom tortuous but open with infrequent and shallow downward steps the stream did not now rush and boil along and tumble over rockencumbered ledges in corners the water collected in round green eddying pools there were patches of grass and willows and mounds of moss sheffords surprise equaled his relief for he believed that the violent descent of nonnezoshe boco had been passed any turn now he imagined might bring the party out upon the river when he caught up with them he imparted this conviction which was received with cheer the hopes of all except the indian seemed mounting and if he ever hoped or despaired it was never manifest  sheffords anticipation however was not soon realized the fugitives traveled miles farther down nonnezoshe boco and the only changes were that the walls of the lower gorge heightened and merged into those above and that these upper ones towered ever loftier shefford had to throw his head straight back to look up at the rims and the narrow strip of sky was now indeed a flowing stream of blue  difficult steps were met too yet nothing compared to those of the upper cañon shefford calculated that this days travel had advanced several hours and more than ever now he was anticipating the mouth of nonnezoshe boco still another hour went by and then came striking changes the cañon narrowed till the walls were scarcely twenty paces apart the color of stone grew dark red above and black down low the light of day became shadowed and the floor was a level gravelly winding lane with the stream meandering slowly and silently  suddenly the indian halted he turned his ear down the cañon lane he had heard something the others grouped round him but did not hear a sound except the soft flow of water and the heave of the mustangs then the indian went on presently he halted again and again he listened this time he threw up his head and upon his dark face shone a light which might have been pride  tse kontsaigi he said  the others could not understand but they were impressed  shore he means somethin big drawled lassiter  oh what did he say queried fay in eagerness  nas ta bega tell us said shefford we are full of hope  grand cañon replied the indian  how do you know asked shefford  i hear the roar of the river  but shefford listen as he might could not hear it they traveled on winding down the wonderful lane every once in a while shefford lagged behind let the others pass out of hearing and then he listened at last he was rewarded low and deep dull and strange with some quality to incite dread came a roar thereafter at intervals usually at turns in the cañon and when a faint stir of warm air fanned his cheeks he heard the sound growing clearer and louder  he rounded an abrupt corner to have the roar suddenly fill his ears to see the lane extend straight to a ragged vent and beyond that at some distance a dark ragged bulging wall like iron as he hurried forward he was surprised to find that the noise did not increase here it kept a strange uniformity of tone and volume the others of the party passed out of the mouth of nonnezoshe boco in advance of shefford and when he reached it they were grouped upon a bank of sand a darkred cañon yawned before them and through it slid the strangest river shefford had ever seen at first glance he imagined the strangeness consisted of the darkred color of the water but at the second he was not so sure all the others except nas ta bega eyed the river blankly as if they did not know what to think the roar came from round a huge bulging wall downstream up the cañon half a mile at another turn there was a leaping rapid of dirty redwhite waves and the sound of this probably was drowned in the unseen but nearer rapid  this is the grand cañon of the colorado said shefford weve come out at the mouth of nonnezoshe boco and now to wait for joe lake  they made camp on a dry level sandbar under a shelving wall nas ta bega collected a pile of driftwood to be used for fire and then he took the mustangs back up the side cañon to find grass for them lassiter appeared unusually quiet and soon passed from weary rest on the sand to deep slumber fay and jane succumbed to an exhaustion that manifested itself the moment relaxation set in and they too fell asleep shefford patrolled the long strip of sand under the wall and watched up the river for joe lake the indian returned and went along the river climbed over the jutting sharp slopes that reached into the water and passed out of sight upstream toward the rapid  shefford had a sense that the river and the cañon were too magnificent to be compared with others still all his emotions and sensations had been so wrought upon he seemed not to have any left by which he might judge of what constituted the difference he would wait he had a grim conviction that before he was safely out of this earthriven crack he would know one thing however struck him and it was that up the cañon high over the lower walls hazy and blue stood other walls and beyond and above them dim in purple distance upreared still other walls the haze and the blue and the purple meant great distance and likewise the height seemed incomparable  the red river attracted him most since this was the medium by which he must escape with his party it was natural that it absorbed him to the neglect of the gigantic cliffs and the more he watched the river studied it listened to it imagined its nature its power its restlessness the more he dreaded it as the hours of the afternoon wore away and he strolled along and rested on the banks his first impressions and what he realized might be his truest ones were gradually lost he could not bring them back the river was changing deceitful it worked upon his mind the low hollow roar filled his ears and seemed to mock him then he endeavored to stop thinking about it to confine his attention to the gap upstream where sooner or later he prayed that joe lake and his boat would appear but though he controlled his gaze he could not his thought and his strange impondering dread of the river augmented  the afternoon waned nas ta bega came back to camp and said any likelihood of joes arrival was past for that day shefford could not get over an impression of strangenessof the impossibility of the reality presented to his naked eyes these lonely fugitives in the hugewalled cañon waiting for a boatman to come down that river strange and wildthose were the words which inadequately at best suited this country and the situations it produced  after supper he and fay walked along the bars of smooth red sand there were a few moments when the distant peaks and domes and turrets were glorified in changing sunset hues but the beauty was fleeting fay still showed lassitude she was quiet yet cheerful and the sweetness of her smile her absolute trust in him stirred and strengthened anew his spirit yet he suffered torture when he thought of trusting fays life her soul and her beauty to this strange red river  night brought him relief he could not see the river only the low roar made its presence known out there in the shadows and there being no need to stay awake he dropped at once into heavy slumber he was roused by hands dragging at him nas ta bega bent over him it was broad daylight the yellow wall high above was glistening a fire was crackling and pleasant odors were wafted to him fay and jane and lassiter sat around the tarpaulin at breakfast after the meal suspense and strain were manifested in all the fugitives even the imperturbable indian being more than usually watchful his eyes scarcely ever left the black gap where the river slid round the turn above soon as on the preceding day he disappeared up the ragged ironbound shore there was scarcely an attempt at conversation a controlling thought bound that group into silenceif joe lake was ever going to come he would come today  shefford asked himself a hundred times if it were possible and his answer seemed to be in the low sullen muffled roar of the river and as the morning wore on toward noon his dread deepened until all chance appeared hopeless already he had begun to have vague and unformed and disquieting ideas of the only avenue of escape leftto return up nonnezoshe bocoand that would be to enter a trap  suddenly a piercing cry pealed down the cañon it was followed by echoes weird and strange that clapped from wall to wall in mocking concatenation nas ta bega appeared high on the ragged slope the cry had been the indians he swept an arm out pointing upstream and stood like a statue on the iron rocks  sheffords keen gaze sighted a moving something in the bend of the river it was long low dark and flat with a lighter object upright in the middle a boat and a man  joe its joe yelled shefford madly there look  jane and fay were on their knees in the sand clasping each other pale faces toward that bend in the river  shefford ran up the shore toward the indian he climbed the jutting slant of rock the boat was now full in the turnit moved fasterit was nearing the smooth incline above the rapid there it glided downheaved darkly upsettled backand disappeared in the frothy muddy roughness of water shefford held his breath and watched a dark bobbing object showed vanished showed again to enlargeto take the shape of a big flatboatand then it rode the swift choppy current out of the lower end of the rapid  nas ta bega began to make violent motions and shefford taking his cue frantically waved his red scarf there was a fivemileanhour current right before them and joe must needs see them so that he might sheer the huge and clumsy craft into the shore before it drifted too far down  presently joe did see them he appeared to be halfnaked he raised aloft both arms and bellowed down the cañon the echoes boomed from wall to wall every one stronger with the deep hoarse triumph in the mormons voice till they passed on growing weaker to die away in the roar of the river below then joe bent to a long oar that appeared to be fastened to the stern of the boat and the craft drifted out of the swifter current toward the shore it reached a point opposite to where shefford and the indian waited and though joe made prodigious efforts it slid on still it also drifted shoreward and halfway down to the mouth of nonnezoshe boco joe threw the end of a rope to the indian  ho ho yelled the mormon again setting into motion the fiendish echoes he was naked to the waist he had lost flesh he was haggard worn dirty wet while he pulled on a shirt nas ta bega made the rope fast to a snag of a log of driftwood embedded in the sand and the boat swung to shore it was perhaps thirty feet long by half as many wide crudely built of roughhewn boards the steeringgear was a long pole with a plank nailed to the end the craft was empty save for another pole and plank joes coat and a brokenhandled shovel there were water and sand on the flooring joe stepped ashore and he was gripped first by shefford and then by the indian he was an unkempt and gaunt giant yet how steadfast and reliable how grimly strong to inspire hope  reckon most of mes here he said in reply to greetings ive had water aplenty my god ive had water he rolled out a grim laugh but no grub for three days forgot to fetch some  how practical he was he told fay she looked good for sore eyes but he needed a biscuit most of all there was just a second of singular hesitation when he faced lassiter and then the big strong hand of the young mormon went out to meet the old gunmans while they fed him and he ate like a starved man shefford told of the flight from the village the rescuing of jane and lassiter from surprise valley the descent from the plateau the catastrophe to shadds gangand concluding shefford without any explanation told that nas ta bega had killed the mormon waggoner  reckon i had that figured replied joe first off i didnt think so so shadd went over the cliff thats good riddance it beats me though never knew that piutes like with a horse and he had some grand horses in his outfit pity about them  later when joe had a moment alone with shefford he explained that during his ride to kayenta he had realized fays innocence and who had been responsible for the tragedy he took withers the trader into his confidence and they planned a story which withers was to carry to stonebridge that would exculpate fay and shefford of anything more serious than flight if shefford got fay safely out of the country at once that would end the matter for all concerned  reckon im some ferryboatman tooa fairy boatman haw haw he added and were going through now i want you to help me rig this tarpaulin up over the bow of the boat if we can fix it up strong itll keep the waves from curling over they filled her four times for me  they folded the tarpaulin three times and with stout pieces of split plank and horseshoe nails from sheffords saddlebags and pieces of rope they rigged up a screen around bow and front corners  nas ta bega put the saddles in the boat the mustangs were far up nonnezoshe boco and would work their way back to green and luxuriant canyons the indian said they would soon become wild and would never be found shefford regretted nackyal but was glad the faithful little mustang would be free in one of those beautiful canyons  reckon wed better be off called joe all aboard he placed fay and jane in a corner of the bow where they would be spared sight of the rapids shefford loosed the rope and sprang aboard pard said joe its one hell of a river and now with the snow melting up in the mountains its twenty feet above normal and rising fast but thats well for us it covers the stones in the rapids if it hadnt been in flood joe would be an angel now  the boat cleared the sand lazily wheeled in the eddying water and suddenly seemed caught by some powerful gliding force when it swept out beyond the jutting wall shefford saw a quarter of a mile of sliding water that appeared to end abruptly beyond lengthened out the gigantic gap between the black and frowning cliffs  wow ejaculated joe drops out of sight there but that one aint much i can tell by the roar when you see my hair stand up straightthen watch out lassiter you look after the women shefford you stand ready to bail out with the shovel for well sure ship water nas ta bega you help here with the oar  the roar became a heavy continuous rumble the current quickened little streaks and ridges seemed to race along the boat strange gurglings rose from under the bow shefford stood on tiptoe to see the break in the river below swiftly it came into sighta wonderful long smooth red slant of water a swelling mound a huge backcurling wave another and another a sea of frothy uplifting crests leaping and tumbling and diminishing down to the narrowing apex of the rapid it was a frightful sight yet it thrilled shefford joe worked the steeringoar back and forth and headed the boat straight for the middle of the incline the boat reached the round rim gracefully dipped with a heavy sop and went shooting down the wind blew wet in sheffords face he stood erect thrilling fascinated frightened then he seemed to feel himself lifted the curling wave leaped at the boat there was a shock that laid him flat and when he rose to his knees all about him was roar and spray and leaping muddy waves shock after shock jarred the boat splashes of water stung his face and then the jar and the motion the confusion and roar gradually lessened until presently shefford rose to see smooth water ahead and the long trembling rapid behind  get busy bailer yelled joe pretty soon youll be glad you have to bailso you cant see  there were several inches of water in the bottom of the boat and shefford learned for the first time the expediency of a shovel in the art of bailing  that tarpaulin worked powerful good went on joe and it saves the women now if it just dont bust on a big wave that one back there was little  when shefford had scooped out all the water he went forward to see how fay and jane and lassiter had fared the women were pale but composed they had covered their heads  but the dreadful roar exclaimed fay  lassiter looked shaken for once  shore id rather taken a chance meetin them mormons on the way out he said  shefford spoke with an encouraging assurance which he did not himself feel almost at the moment he marked a silence that had fallen into the cañon then it broke to a low dull strange roar  aha hear that the mormon shook his shaggy head reckon were in cataract cañon well be standing on end from now on hang on to her boys  danger of this unusual kind had brought out a peculiar levity in the somber mormona kind of wild gay excitement his eyes rolled as he watched the river ahead and he puffed out his cheek with his tongue  the rugged overhanging walls of the cañon grew sinister in sheffords sight they were jaws and the riverthat made him shudder to look down into it the little whirling pits were eyes peering into his and they raced on with the boat disappeared and came again always with the little hollow gurgles  the craft drifted swiftly and the roar increased another rapid seemed to move up into view it came at a bend in the cañon when the breeze struck sheffords cheeks he did not this time experience exhilaration the current accelerated its sliding motion and bore the flatboat straight for the middle of the curve shefford saw the bend a long dark narrow gloomy cañon and a stretch of contending waters then crouching low he waited for the dip the race the shock they camethe last stopping the boatthrowing it aloftletting it dropand crests of angry waves curled over the side shefford kneeling felt the water slap around him and in his ears was a deafening roar there were endless moments of strife and hell and flying darkness of spray all about him and under him the rocking boat when they lessenedceased in violencehe stood ankledeep in water and then madly he began to bail  another roar deadened his ears but he did not look up from his toil and when he had to get down to avoid the pitch he closed his eyes that rapid passed and with more water to bail he resumed his share in the manning of the crude craft it was more than a sharea tremendous responsibility to which he bent with all his might he heard joe yelland againand again he heard the increasing roars one after another till they seemed one continuous bellow he felt the shock the pitch the beating waves and then the lessening power of sound and current that set him to his task always in these long intervals of toil he seemed to see without looking up the growing proportions of the cañon and the river had become a living terrible thing the intervals of his tireless effort when he scooped the water overboard were fleeting and the rides through rapid after rapid were endless periods of waiting terror his spirit and his hope were overwhelmed by the rush and roar and fury  then as he worked there came a changea rest to deafened earsa stretch of river that seemed quiet after chaosand here for the first time he bailed the boat clear of water  jane and fay were huddled in a corner with the flapping tarpaulin now half fallen over them they were wet and muddy lassiter crouched like a man dazed by a bad dream and his white hair hung stained and bedraggled over his face the indian and the mormon grim hard worn stood silent at the oar  the afternoon was far advanced and the sun had already descended below the western ramparts a cool breeze blew up the cañon laden with a sound that was the same yet not the same as those low dull roars which shefford dreaded more and more  joe lake turned his ear to the breeze a stronger puff brought a heavy quivering rumble this time he did not vent his gay and wild defiance to the river he bent lowerlistened then as the rumble became a strange deep reverberating roll as if the monstrous river were rolling huge stones down a subterranean cañon shefford saw with dilating eyes that the mormons hair was rising stiff upon his head  hear that said joe turning an ashen face to shefford well drop off the earth now hang on to the girl so if we go you can go together and pard if youve a godpray  nas ta bega faced the bend from whence that rumble came and he was the same dark inscrutable impassive indian as of old what was death to him  shefford felt the strong rushing love of life surge in him and it was not for himself he thought but for fay and the happiness she merited he went to her patted the covered head and tried with words choking in his throat to give hope and he leaned with hands gripping the gunwale with eyes wide open ready for the unknown  the river made a quick turn and from round the bend rumbled a terrible uproar the current racing that way was divided or uncertain and it gave strange motion to the boat joe and nas ta bega shoved desperately upon the oar all to no purpose the currents had their will the bow of the boat took the place of the stern then swift at the head of a curved incline it shot beyond the bulging wall  and shefford saw an awful place before them the cañon had narrowed to half its width and turned almost at right angles the huge clamor of appalling sound came from under the cliff where the swollen river had to pass and where there was not space the rapid rushed in gigantic swells right upon the wall boomed against it climbed and spread and fell away to recede and gather new impetus to leap madly on down the cañon  shefford went to his knees clasped fay and jane too but facing this appalling thing he had to look courage and despair came to him at the last this must be the end with long buoyant swing the boat sailed down shot over the first waves was caught and lifted upon the great swell and impelled straight toward the cliff huge whirlpools raced alongside and from them came a horrible engulfing roar monstrous bulges rose on the other side all the stupendous power of that mighty river of downwardrushing silt swung the boat aloft up and up as the swell climbed the wall shefford with transfixed eyes and harrowed soul watched the wet black wall it loomed down upon him the stern of the boat went high then when the crash that meant doom seemed imminent the swell spread and fell back from the wall and the boat never struck at all by some miraculous chance it had been favored by a strange and momentary receding of the huge spent swell then it slid back was caught and whirled by the current into a red frothy upflung rapids below shefford bowed his head over fay and saw no more nor felt nor heard what seemed a long time after that the broken voice of the mormon recalled him to his labors  the boat was half full of water nas ta bega scooped out great sheets of it with his hands shefford sprang to aid him found the shovel and plunged into the task slowly but surely they emptied the boat and then shefford saw that twilight had fallen joe was working the craft toward a narrow bank of sand to which presently they came and the indian sprang out to moor to a rock  the fugitives went ashore and weary and silent and drenched they dropped in the warm sand  but shefford could not sleep the river kept him awake in the distance it rumbled low deep reverberating and near at hand it was a thing of mutable mood it moaned whined mocked and laughed it had the soul of a devil it was a river that had cut its way to the bowels of the earth and its nature was destructive it harbored no life fighting its way through those dead walls cutting and tearing and wearing its heavy burden of silt was death destruction and decay a silent river a murmuring strange fierce terrible thundering river of the desert even in the dark it seemed to wear the hue of blood  all night long shefford heard it and toward the dark hours before dawn when a restless broken sleep came to him his dreams were dreams of a river of sounds  all the beautiful sounds he knew and loved he heardthe sigh of the wind in the pines the mourn of the wolf the cry of the laughinggull the murmur of running brooks the song of a child the whisper of a woman and there were the boom of the surf the roar of the north wind in the forest the roll of thunder and there were the sounds not of eartha river of the universe rolling the planets engulfing the stars pouring the sea of blue into infinite space  night with its fitful dreams passed dawn lifted the ebony gloom out of the cañon and sunlight far up on the ramparts renewed sheffords spirit he rose and awoke the others fays wistful smile still held its faith they ate of the gritty watersoaked food then they embarked the current carried them swiftly down and out of hearing of the last rapid the character of the river and the cañon changed the current lessened to a slow smooth silent eddying flow the walls grew straight sheer gloomy and vast shefford noted these features but he was listening so hard for the roar of the next rapid that he scarcely appreciated them all the fugitives were listening every bend in the cañonand now the turns were numerousmight hold a rapid shefford strained his ears he imagined the low dull strange rumble he had it in his ears yet there was the growing sensation of silence  shore this s a dead place muttered lassiter  shes only slowed up for a bigger plunge replied joe listen hear that  but there was no true sound joe only imagined what he expected and hated and dreaded to hear  mile after mile they drifted through the silent gloom between those vast and magnificent walls after the speed the turmoil the whirling shrieking thundering the neverceasing sound and change and motion of the rapids above this slow quiet drifting this utter absolute silence these eddying stretches of still water below worked strangely upon sheffords mind and he feared he was going mad  there was no change to the silence no help for the slow drift no lessening of the strain and the hours of the day passed as moments the sun crossed the blue gap above the golden lights hung on the upper walls the gloom returned and still there was only the dead vast insupportable silence  there came bends where the current quickened ripples widened long lanes of little waves roughened the surface but they made no sound  and then the fugitives turned through a vshaped vent in the cañon the ponderous walls sheered away from the river there was space and sunshine and far beyond this leaguewide open rose vermilioncolored cliffs a mile below the river disappeared in a dark boxlike passage from which came a rumble that made sheffords flesh creep  the mormon flung high his arms and let out the stentorian yell that had rolled down to the fugitives as they waited at the mouth of nonnezoshe boco but now it had a wilder more exultant note strange how he shifted his gaze to fay larkin  girl get up and look he called the ferry the ferry  then he bent his brawny back over the steeringoar and the clumsy craft slowly turned toward the lefthand shore where a long low bank of green willows and cottonwoods gave welcome relief to the eyes upon the opposite side of the river shefford saw a boat similar to the one he was in moored to the bank  shore if i aint losin my eyes i seen an injun with a red blanket said lassiter  yes lassiter cried shefford look fay look jane see indianshogansmustangsthere above the green bank  the boat glided slowly shoreward and the deep hungry terrible rumble of the remorseless river became something no more to dread     xx willow springs   two days travel from the river along the sawtoothed range of echo cliffs stood presbreys tradingpost a little redstone square house in a green and pretty valley called willow springs  it was nearing the time of sunsetthat gorgeous hour of color in the painted desertwhen shefford and his party rode down upon the post  the scene lacked the wildness characteristic of kayenta or red lake there were wagons and teams white men and indians burros sheep lambs mustangs saddled and unsaddled dogs and chickens a young sweetfaced woman stood in the door of the post and she it was who first sighted the fugitives presbrey was weighing bags of wool on a scale and when she called he lazily turned as if to wonder at her eagerness  then he flung up his head with its shock of heavy hair in a start of surprise and his florid face lost its lazy indolence to become wreathed in a huge smile  havent seen a white person in six months was his extraordinary greeting  an hour later shefford cleanshaven comfortably clothed once more found himself a different man and when he saw fay in white again with a new and indefinable light shining through that old haunting shadow in her eyes then the world changed and he embraced perfect happiness  there was a dinner such as shefford had not seen for many a day and such as fay had never seen and that brought to jane withersteens eyes the dreamy memory of the bountiful feasts which long years ago had been her pride and there was a story told to the curious trader and his kind wifea story with its beginning back in those past years of riders of the purple sage of fay larkin as a child and then as a wild girl in surprise valley of the flight down nonnezoshe boco an the cañon of a great mormon and a noble indian  presbrey stared with his deepset eyes and wagged his tousled head and stared again then with the quick perception of the practical desert man he said  im sending teamsters in to flagstaff tomorrow wife and i will go along with you weve light wagons three days maybeor fourand well be there shefford im going to see you marry fay larkin  fay and jane and lassiter showed strangely against this background of approaching civilization and shefford realized more than ever the loneliness and isolation and wildness of so many years for them  when the women had retired shefford and the men talked a while then joe lake rose to stretch his big frame  friends reckon im all in he said good night in passing he laid a heavy hand on sheffords shoulder well you got out ive only a queer notion how but some one besides an indian and a mormon guided you out be good to the girl goodby pard  shefford grasped the big hand and in the emotion of the moment did not catch the significance of joes last words  later shefford stepped outside into the starlight for a few moments quiet walk and thought before he went to bed it was a white night the coyotes were yelping the stars shone steadfast bright cold nas ta bega stalked out of the shadow of the house and joined shefford they walked in silence sheffords heart was too full for utterance and the indian seldom spoke at any time when shefford was ready to go in nas ta bega extended his hand  goodbybi nai he said strangely using english and navajo in what shefford supposed to be merely good night the starlight shone full upon the dark inscrutable face of the indian shefford bade him good night and then watched him stride away in the silver gloom  but next morning shefford understood nas ta bega and joe lake were gone it was a shock to shefford yet what could he have said to either joe had shirked saying goodby to him and fay and the indian had gone out of sheffords life as he had come into it  what these two men represented in sheffords uplift was too great for the present to define but they and the desert that had developed them had taught him the meaning of life he might fail often since failure was the lot of his kind but could he ever fail again in faith in man or god while he had mind to remember the indian and the mormon  still though he placed them on a noble height and loved them well there would always abide with him a sorrow for the mormon and a sleepless and eternal regret for that indian on his lonely cedar slope with the spirits of his vanishing race calling him              willow springs appeared to be a lively place that morning presbrey was gay and his sweetfaced wife was excited the teamsters were a jolly whistling lot and the lean mustangs kicked and bit at one another the trader had brought out two light wagons for the trip and after the manner of desert men desired to start at sunrise  far across the painted desert towered the san francisco peaks blacktimbered bluecanyoned purplehazed with white snow like the clouds around their summits  jane withersteen looked at the radiant fay and lived again in her happiness and at last excitement had been communicated to the old gunman  shore were goin to live with fay an john an be near venters an bess an see the blacks again jane an venters will tell you as he did me how wrangle run black star off his legs  all connected with that early start was sweet sad hopeful  and so they rode away from willow springs through the green fields of alfalfa and cotton wood down the valley with its smoking hogans and whistling mustangs and scarletblanketed indians and out upon the bare ridgy colorful desert toward the rosy sunrise     epilogue   on the outskirts of a little town in illinois there was a farm of rolling pastureland and here a beautiful meadow green and red in clover merged upon an orchard in the midst of which a browntiled roof showed above the trees  one afternoon in may a group of people strangely agitated walked down a shady lane toward the meadow  wal jane i always knew wed get a look at them hosses againi shore knew lassiter was saying in the same old cool careless drawl but his clawlike hands shook a little  oh will they know me asked jane withersteen turning to a stalwart manno other than the darkfaced venters her rider of other days  know you ill bet they will replied venters what do you say bess  the shadow brightened in besss somber blue eyes as if his words had recalled her from a sad and memorable past  black star will know her surely replied bess sometimes he points his nose toward the west and watches as if he saw the purple slopes and smelt the sage of utah he has never forgotten but night has grown deaf and partly blind of late i doubt if hed remember  shefford and fay walked arm in arm in the background  out in the meadow two horses were grazing they were sleek shiny longmaned longtailed black as coal and though old still splendid in every line  do you remember them whispered shefford  oh i only needed to see black star murmured fay her voice quivering i can remember being lifted on his back how strange it seems so long ago look mother jane is going out to them  jane withersteen advanced alone through the clover and it was with unsteady steps presently she halted what glorious and bitter memories were expressed in her strange poignant call  black star started and swept up his noble head and looked but night went on calmly grazing then jane called againthe same strange call only louder and this time broken black star raised his head higher and he whistled a piercing blast he saw jane he knew her as he had remembered the call and he came pounding toward her she met him encircled his neck with her arms and buried her face in his mane  shore i reckon id better never say any more about wrangle runnin the blacks off their legs thet time muttered lassiter as if to himself  lassiter you only dreamed that race replied venters with a smile  oh bern isnt it good that black star remembered herthat shell have himsomething left of her old home asked bess wistfully  indeed it is good but bess jane withersteen will find a new spirit and new happiness here  jane came toward them leading both horses dear friends i am happy today i bury all regrets of the past i shall remember onlymy riders of the purple sage  venters smiled his gladness and youlassiterwhat shall you remember he queried  the old gunman looked at jane and then at his clawlike hands and then at fay his eyes lost their shadow and began to twinkle  wal i rolled a stone once but i reckon now thet time wrangle  lassiter i said you dreamed that race wrangle never beat the blacks interrupted venters and you fay what shall you remember  surprise valley replied fay dreamily  and youshefford  shefford shook his head for him there could never be one memory only in his heart there would never change or die memories of the wild uplands of the great towers and walls of the golden sunsets on the cañon ramparts of the silent fragrant valleys where the cedars and the sagolilies grew of those starlit nights when his love and faith awoke of grand and lonely nonnezoshe of that red sullen thundering mysterious colorado river of a wonderful indian and a noble mormonof all that was embodied for him in the meaning of the rainbow trail   the end
