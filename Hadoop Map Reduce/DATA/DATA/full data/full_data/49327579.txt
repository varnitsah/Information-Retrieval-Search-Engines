49327579	the  dramatic works  of  john dryden  with a  life of the author  by  sir walter scott bart  edited by george saintsbury  vol i   edinburgh   william   paterson  1882    illustration m john dryden     the dramatic works  of  john dryden     editors preface  the bestedited book in the english language is according to southey wilkins edition of sir thomas browne if sir walter scotts dryden cannot challenge this highest position it certainly deserves the credit of being one of the bestedited books on a great scale in english save in one particularthe revision of the text in reading it long ago with no other object than to make acquaintance with dryden again more recently and more minutely for the purpose of a course of lectures which i was asked to deliver at the royal institution and again more recently and more minutely still for the purposes of a monograph on the same subject in mr morleys series of english men of letters i have had tolerably ample opportunities of recognising its merits it was therefore with pleasure that i found on being consulted by the publisher of these volumes as to a reissue of it that mr paterson was as averse as i was myself to any attempt to efface or to mutilate scotts work neither the number the order nor the contents of scotts eighteen volumes will be altered in any way the task which i propose to myself is a sufficiently modest one that of reediting scotts dryden asputting differences of ability out of questionhe might have reedited it himself had he been alive today that is to say to set right errors into which he fell either by inadvertence or deficiency of information to correct the text in accordance with modern requirements and to add the results of the students of dryden during the last three quarters of a century in matter of text as well as of comment  the first part of the plan requires no further remarks and the last not much no literary work of drydens of any great importance has been discovered since scotts edition appeared a few letters will have to be added though i am sorry to say that i cannot promise my readers the satisfaction which dryden students chiefly desirethe satisfaction of reading or at least knowing the contents of the knole correspondence in reply to a request of mine lord sackville has positively though very courteously refused to lift the embargo which his predecessors have placed on this nor have my inquiries succeeded as yet in discovering any hitherto unpublished letters though the present collection will for the first time present those which have been published in a complete form i think that it may not be uninteresting for readers to have an opportunity of comparing with the undoubted work two plays the mistaken husband and the modish lovers which good authorities have suspected to be possibly drydens these will accordingly be given in the last volume of the plays a bibliography of dryden and writers on dryden and a certain number of pieces justificatives of various kinds will also be added as well as notes and where the subject seems to demand them appendices on points of importance these additional notes and appendices will be bracketed and signed ed drydens own notes which are rare will be indicated by a d and scotts will stand without indication  the principles upon which i have proceeded in reediting the text require somewhat fuller explanation dryden never superintended any complete edition of his works but on the other hand there is evidence in his letters that he bestowed considerable pains on them when they first passed through the press the first editions have therefore in every case been followed though they have been corrected in case of need by the later ones but the adoption of this standard leaves unsettled the problem of orthography punctuation etc i have adopted a solution of this which will not i fear be wholly agreeable to some of my friends capital letters apostrophes and the like will be looked for in vain it would i need hardly say have been much less trouble to put copies of the original editions into the hands of the printers to bid them follow copy and to content myself with seeing that the reprint was faithful the result would have been to a very small number of professed students of english literature an interesting example of the changes which printers spelling underwent in the last forty years of the seventeenth century but it would have been a nuisance and a stumblingblock to the ordinary reader in whose way it is certainly not the business of the editor of a great english classic to throw stones of offence where a writer has written in a distinctly archaic form of language as in the case of all english writers before the renaissance adherence to the original orthography is necessary and right even in the socalled elizabethan age where a certain archaism of phrase survives the appreciation of temporal and local colour may be helped by such an adherence but dryden is in every sense a modern his list of obsolete words is insignificant of archaic phrases more insignificant still of obsolete constructions almost a blank if any journalist or reviewer were to write his tomorrows leader or his next weeks article in a style absolutely modelled on dryden no one would notice anything strange in it except perhaps that the english was a good deal better than usual there can therefore be no possible reason for erecting an artificial barrier between him and his readers of today especially as that barrier would be not only artificial but entirely arbitrary i shall however return to this point in some prefatory remarks to the dramas  another problem which presented itself was the question of retaining the irregular stichometric division in some plays and passages which are not in verse scott has in such case generally printed them in prose and with some hesitation i have though not uniformly followed him  i have already received much help from divers persons and i trust dis faventibus to acknowledge this and more at the end of my journey in to use a word for which a great writer of french fought hard a postface in a work of magnitude such as the present which can only be proceeded with pedetentim the proverb about the relations of beginner and finisher is peculiarly applicable for the present i shall confine myself to mentioning with the utmost thankfulness the kindness of mr ew gosse who has placed at my disposal an almost complete set of first editions of the plays and poems one word must be said as to the life which fills this first volume except in minor details there is little to add to it any biographer of dryden who is not carried away by the desire to magnify his office must admit that johnsons opening sentence as to the paucity of materials is still applicable  in conclusion i have but to repeat that in this edition it is not my ambition to put myself or my own writing forward even to the extent ordinarily possible to an editor in particular my plan excludes indulgence in critical disquisitions however tempting they may be for such i must refer my readers to the monograph already mentioned occasionally where critical opinions of scotts are advanced which seem demonstrably erroneous or imperfect something of this nature will be found but on the whole my object is to give the reader my author and not what i have to say about him the office of greek neokoros is a comparatively humble one in itself but it is honourable enough when the shrine is at once the work and the monument of two such masters of english as scott and dryden  george saintsbury  london july 8 1882     advertisement   prefaced to edition issued in 1808 edited by sir walter scott  after the lapse of more than a century since the authors death the works of dryden are now for the first time presented to the public in a complete and uniform edition in collecting the pieces of one of our most eminent english classicsone who may claim at least the third place in that honoured list and who has given proofs of greater versatility of talent than either shakespeare or milton though justly placed inferior to them in their peculiar provincesthe editor did not feel himself entitled to reject any part of his writings even of those which reflect little honour on the age by whose taste they were dictated had a selection been permitted he would have excluded several of the comedies and some part of the translations but this is a liberty which has not lately been indulged to editors of classical poetry literary history is an important step in that of man himself and the unseductive coarseness of dryden is rather a beacon than a temptation  in commencing this task the editor had hopes of friendly assistance which might have rendered his toil more easy and the result more accurate deprived of this by a concurrence of unlucky circumstances he has both to dread the imperfection of his labours and the consequence of perhaps an overzeal to render his edition complete in the first respect although he has many thanks to return for information readily afforded it has sometimes been received after the irrevocable operations of the printer had taken place1 on the second point he may have been too lavish in historical notes and entered too deeply into the secret history of the persons and times to which drydens satirical poems refer but he has endeavoured to avail himself of all information so soon as communicated whether corrective or corroborative of his prior opinions and the wish not only to render intelligible blanks allusions and feigned names but to present if possible the very spirit and political character of drydens contemporaries must be the excuse for intruding a few pages of political history and personal anecdote which after all they whose memory does not require such refreshment may easily dispense with reading in this last part of his task the editor has been greatly assisted by free access to a valuable collection of the fugitive pieces of the reigns of charles ii james ii william iii and queen anne this curious collection was made by narcissus luttrell esq under whose name the editor usually quotes it the industrious collector seems to have bought every poetical tract of whatever merit which was hawked through the streets in his time marking carefully the price and date of the purchase his collection contains the earliest editions of many of our most excellent poems bound up according to the order of time with the lowest trash of grub street it was dispersed on mr luttrells death but a number of the volumes referring chiefly to the latter part of charles the seconds reign have fortunately become the property of mr james bindley of somerset place who with the utmost urbanity permitted the editor the unlimited use of these and other literary curiosities in his valuable libraryit is so much a matter of course with every adventurer in the field of antiquities to acknowledge the liberality and kindness of mr richard heber that the public would probably be surprised had his extensive literary treasures escaped contribution on this occasion particularly as it contains several additional volumes of the luttrell collection to both gentlemen the editor has to offer his public thanks nor will he be tempted to dilate further on the liberality of the one and the tried friendship of the other it is possible that these researches may by their very nature have in some degree warped the editors taste and induced him to consider that as curious which was only scarce and to reprint quotations from the adversaries or contemporaries of dryden of a length more than sufficient to satisfy the reader of their unworthiness but as the painter places a human figure to afford the means of computing the elevation of the principal object in his landscape it seemed that the giantheight of dryden above the poets of his day might be best ascertained by extracts from those who judged themselves and were sometimes deemed by others his equals or his superiors for the same reason there are thrown into the appendix a few indifferent verses to the poets memory which while they show how much his loss was felt point out at the same time the impossibility of supplying it  in the biographical memoir it would have been hard to exact that the editor should rival the criticism of johnson or produce facts which had escaped the accuracy of malone while however he has availed himself of the labours of both particularly of the latter whose industry has removed the cloud which so long hung over the events of drydens life he has endeavoured to take a different and more enlarged view of the subject than that which his predecessors have presented the general critical view of drydens works being sketched by johnson with unequalled felicity and the incidents of his life accurately discussed and ascertained by malone something seemed to remain for him who should consider these literary productions in their succession as actuated by and operating upon the taste of an age where they had so predominant influence and who might at the same time connect the life of dryden with the history of his publications without losing sight of the fate and character of the individual how far this end has been attained is not for the editor to guess especially when as usual at the close of a work he finds he is possessed of double the information he had when he commenced it the kindness of mr octavius gilchrist who undertook a journey to northamptonshire to examine the present state of rushton where dryden often lived and of mr finlay of glasgow who favoured the editor with the use of some original editions falls here to be gratefully acknowledged  in collecting the poetry of dryden some hymns translated from the service of the catholic church were recovered by the favour of captain macdonogh of the inverness militia2 as the body of the work was then printed off they were inserted in the life of the author but should a second impression of this edition be required by the public they shall be transferred to their proper place to the letters of dryden published in mr malones edition of his prose works the editor has been enabled to add one article by the favour of mrs white of bownanhall gloucestershire those preserved at knowles were examined at the request of a noble friend and the contents appeared unfit for publication drydens translations of fresnoys art of painting and of the life of xavier are inserted without abridgment for reasons which are elsewhere alleged3 from the version of maimbourgs history of the league there is an extract given which may be advantageously read along with the duke of guise and the vindication of that play the prefaces and dedications are of course prefixed to the pieces to which they belong but those who mean to study them with reference to theatrical criticism will do well to follow the order recommended by mr malone4  several pieces published in derricks edition of drydens poetry being obviously spurious are here published separately from his authentic poetry and with a suitable note of suspicion prefixed to each they might indeed have been altogether discarded without diminishing the value of the work some account might be here given of the various editions of drydens poems but notices of this kind have been liberally scattered through the life and preliminary matter  upon the whole it is hoped that as the following is the first complete edition of the works of dryden it will be found in accuracy of text and copiousness of illustration not altogether unworthy of the time labour and expense which have been ungrudgingly bestowed upon an object so important to english literature  footnotes  1 the octavo edition of the annus mirabilis did not fall into my hands till the volume containing it was

life of dryden from his birth till the restorationhis early poems including the annus mirabilis  the life of dryden may be said to comprehend a history of the literature of england and its changes during nearly half a century while his great contemporary milton was in silence and secrecy laying the foundation of that immortal fame which no poet has so highly deserved drydens labours were ever in the eye of the public and he maintained from the time of the restoration till his death in 1700 a decided and acknowledged superiority over all the poets of his age as he wrote from necessity he was obliged to pay a certain deference to the public opinion for he whose bread depends upon the success of his volume is compelled to study popularity but on the other hand his better judgment was often directed to improve that of his readers so that he alternately influenced and stooped to the national taste of the day if therefore we would know the gradual changes which took place in our poetry during the above period we have only to consult the writings of an author who produced yearly some new performance allowed to be most excellent in the particular style which was fashionable for the time it is the object of this memoir to connect with the account of drydens life and publications such a general view of the literature of the time as may enable the reader to estimate how far the age was indebted to the poet and how far the poet was influenced by the taste and manners of the age a few preliminary remarks on the literature of the earlier part of the seventeenth century will form a necessary introduction to this biographical memoir  1when james i ascended the throne of england he came to rule a court and people as much distinguished for literature as for commerce and arms shakespeare was in the zenith of his reputation and england possessed other poets inferior to shakespeare alone or indeed the higher order of whose plays may claim to be ranked above the inferior dramas ascribed to him among these we may reckon massinger who approached to shakespeare in dignity beaumont and fletcher who surpassed him in drawing female characters and those of polite and courtly life and jonson who attempted to supply by depth of learning and laboured accuracy of character the want of that flow of imagination which nature had denied to him others who flourished in the reign of james and his son though little known to the general readers of the present age even by name had a just claim to be distinguished from the common herd of authors ford webster marston brome shirley even chapman and decker added lustre to the stage for which they wrote the drama it is true was the branch of poetry most successfully cultivated for it afforded the most ready appeal to the public taste the number of theatres then open in all parts of the city secured to the adventurous poet the means of having his performance represented upon one stage or other and he was neither tired nor disgusted by the difficulties and disagreeable observances which must now be necessarily undergone by every candidate for dramatic laurels2 but although during the reigns of queen elizabeth and james i the stage seems to have afforded the principal employment of the poets there wanted not many who cultivated with success the other departments of parnassus it is only necessary to name spenser whose magic tale continues to interest us in despite of the languor of a continued allegory drayton who though less known possesses perhaps equal powers of poetry beaumont the elder whose poem on bosworth field carries us back to the days of the plantagenets fairfax the translator of tasso the melody of whose numbers became the model of waller besides many others who ornamented this era of british literature  notwithstanding the splendour of these great names it must be confessed that one common fault in a greater or less degree pervaded the most admired poetry of queen elizabeths age this was the fatal propensity to false wit to substitute namely strange and unexpected connections of sound or of idea for real humour and even for the effusions of the stronger passions it seems likely that this fashion arose at court a sphere in which its denizens never think they move with due lustre until they have adopted a form of expression as well as a system of manners different from that which is proper to mankind at large in elizabeths reign the court language was formed on the plan of one lillie a pedantic courtier who wrote a book entitled euphues and his england or the anatomy of wit3 which quality he makes to consist in the indulgence of every monstrous and overstrained conceit that can be engendered by a strong memory and a heated brain applied to the absurd purpose of hatching unnatural conceits4 it appears that this fantastical person had a considerable share in determining the false taste of his age which soon became so general that the tares which sprung from it are to be found even among the choicest of the wheat shakespeare himself affords us too many instances of this fashionable heresy in wit and he who could create new worlds out of his own imagination descended to low and often illtimed puns and quibbles this was not an evil to be cured by the accession of our scottish james whose qualifications as a punster were at least equal to his boasted kingcraft5 the false taste which had been gaining ground even in the reign of elizabeth now overflowed the whole kingdom with the impetuosity of a landflood these outrages upon language were committed without regard to time and place they were held good arguments at the bar though bacon sat on the woolsack and eloquence irresistible by the most hardened sinner when king or corbet were in the pulpit6 where grave and learned professions set the example the poets it will readily be believed ran headlong into an error for which they could plead such respectable example the affectation of the word and of the letter for alliteration was almost as fashionable as punning seemed in some degree to bring back english composition to the barbarous rules of the ancient anglosaxons the merit of whose poems consisted not in the ideas but in the quaint arrangement of the words and the regular recurrence of some favourite sound or letter  this peculiar taste for twisting and playing upon words instead of applying them to their natural and proper use was combined with the similar extravagance of those whom dr johnson has entitled metaphysical poets this class of authors used the same violence towards images and ideas which had formerly been applied to words in truth the two styles were often combined and even when separate had a kindred alliance with each other it is the business of the punster to discover and yoke together two words which while they have some resemblance in sound the more exact the better convey a totally different signification the metaphysical poet on the other hand piqued himself in discovering hidden resemblances between ideas apparently the most dissimilar and in combining by some violent and compelled association illustrations and allusions utterly foreign from each other thus did the metaphysical poet resemble the quibbler exercising precisely the same tyranny over ideas which the latter practised upon sounds only  jonson gave an early example of metaphysical poetry indeed it was the natural resource of a mind amply stored with learning gifted with a tenacious memory and the power of constant labour but to which was denied that vivid perception of what is naturally beautiful and that happiness of expression which at once conveys to the reader the idea of the poet these latter qualities unite in many passages of shakespeare of which the reader at once acknowledges the beauty the justice and the simplicity but such jonson was unequal to produce and he substituted the strange forced and most unnatural though ingenious analogies which were afterwards copied by donne and cowley7 in reading shakespeare we often meet passages so congenial to our nature and feelings that beautiful as they are we can hardly help wondering they did not occur to ourselves in studying jonson we have often to marvel how his conceptions could have occurred to any human being the one is like an ancient statue the beauty of which springing from the exactness of proportion does not always strike at first sight but rises upon us as we bestow time in considering it the other is the representation of a monster which is at first only surprising and ludicrous or disgusting ever after when the taste for simplicity however is once destroyed it is long ere a nation recovers it and the metaphysical poets seem to have retained possession of the public favour from the reign of james i till the beginning of the civil wars silenced the muses the universities were perhaps to blame during this period of usurpation for which it may be admitted in excuse that the metaphysical poetry could only be practised by men whose minds were deeply stored with learning and who could boldly draw upon a large fund of acquired knowledge for supplying the expenditure of farfetched and extravagant images which their compositions required the book of nature is before all men but when her limits are to be overstepped the acquirement of adventitious knowledge becomes of paramount necessity and it was but natural that cambridge and oxford should prize a style of poetry to which depth of learning was absolutely indispensable  i have stated that the metaphysical poetry was fashionable during the early part of charles the firsts reign it is true that milton descended to upbraid that unfortunate prince that the chosen companion of his private hours was one william shakespeare a player but charles admitted less sacred poets to share his partiality ben jonson supplied his court with masques and his pageants with verses and notwithstanding an illnatured story shared no inconsiderable portion of his bounty8 donne a leader among the metaphysical poets with whom king james had punned and quibbled in person9 shared in a remarkable degree the good graces of charles i who may therefore be supposed no enemy to his vein of poetry although neither his sincere piety nor his sacred office restrained him from fantastic indulgence in extravagant conceit even upon the most solemn themes which can be selected for poetry10 cowley who with the learning and acuteness of donne possessed the more poetical qualities of a fertile imagination and frequent happiness of expression and who claims the highest place of all who ever plied the unprofitable trade of combining dissimilar and repugnant ideas was not indeed known to the king during his prosperity but his talents recommended him at the military court of oxford and the transcribers note word missing here in the original ingenious poet of the metaphysical class enjoyed the applause of charles before he shared the exile of his consort henrietta cleveland also was honoured with the early notice of charles11 one of the most distinguished metaphysical bards who afterwards exerted his talents of wit and satire upon the royal side and strained his imagination for extravagant invective against the scottish army who sold their king and the parliament leaders who bought him all these and others unnecessary to mention were read and respected at court being esteemed by their contemporaries and doubtless believing themselves the wonder of their own and the pattern of succeeding ages and however much they transcribers note fragment of word only in original presume might differ from each other in parts and genius they sought the same road to poetical fame by starting the most unnatural images which their imaginations could conceive or by hunting more common allusions through the most minute and circumstantial particulars and ramifications  yet though during the age of charles i the metaphysical poets enjoyed the larger proportion of public applause authors were not wanting who sought other modes of distinguishing themselves milton who must not be named in the same paragraph with others although he had not yet meditated the sublime work which was to carry his name to immortality disdained even in his lesser compositions the preposterous conceits and learned absurdities by which his contemporaries acquired distinction some of his slighter academic prolusions are indeed tinged with the prevailing taste of his age or perhaps were written in ridicule of it but no circumstance in his life is more remarkable than that comus the monody on lycidas the allegro and penseroso and the hymn on the nativity are unpolluted by the metaphysical jargon and affected language which the age esteemed indispensable to poetry this refusal to bend to an evil so prevailing and which held out so many temptations to a youth of learning and genius can only be ascribed to the natural chastity of miltons taste improved by an earnest and eager study of the purest models of antiquity  but besides milton who stood aloof and alone there was a race of lesser poets who endeavoured to glean the refuse of the applause reaped by donne cowley and their followers by adopting ornaments which the latter had neglected perhaps because they could be attained without much labour or abstruse learning the metaphysical poets in their slipshod pindarics had totally despised not only smoothness and elegance but the common rhythm of versification many and long passages may be read without perceiving the least difference between them and barbarous jingling illregulated prose and in appearance though the lines be divided into unequal lengths the eye and ear acknowledge little difference between them and the inscription on a tombstone in a word not only harmony of numbers but numbers themselves were altogether neglected or if an author so far respected ancient practice as to make lines which could be scanned like verse he had done his part and was perfectly indifferent although they sounded like prose12 but as melody will be always acceptable to the ear some poets chose this neglected road to fame and gained a portion of public favour by attending to the laws of harmony which their rivals had discarded waller and denham were the first who thus distinguished themselves but as johnson happily remarks what was acquired by denham was inherited by waller something there was in the situation of both these authors which led them to depart from what was then the beaten path of composition they were men of rank wealth and fashion and had experienced all the interruptions to deep study with which such elevated station is naturally attended it was in vain for waller a wit a courtier and a politician or for denham who was only distinguished at the university as a dreaming dissipated gambler to attempt to rival the metaphysical subtleties of donne and cowley who had spent serious and sequestered lives in acquiring the knowledge and learning which they squandered in their poetry necessity therefore and perhaps a dawning of more simple taste impelled these courtly poets to seek another and more natural mode of pleasing the melody of verse was a province unoccupied and waller forming his rhythm upon the modulation of fairfax and other poets of the maiden reign exhibited in his very first poem13 striking marks of attention to the suavity of numbers denham in his dedication to charles ii informs us that the indulgence of his poetical vein had drawn the notice although accompanied with the gentle censure of charles i when in 1647 he obtained access to his person by the intercession of hugh peters suckling whom dryden has termed a sprightly wit and a courtly writer may be added to the list of smooth and easy poets of the period and had the same motives as denham and waller for attaching himself to that style of composition he was allowed to have the peculiar art of making whatever he did become him and it cannot be doubted that his light and airy style of ballads and sonnets had many admirers upon the whole this class of poets although they hardly divided the popular favour with the others were also noticed and applauded thus the poets of the earlier part of the seventeenth century may be divided into one class who sacrificed both sense and sound to the exercise of extravagant though ingenious associations of imagery and a second who aiming to distinguish themselves by melody of versification were satisfied with light and trivial subjects and too often contented with attaining smoothness of measure neglected the more essential qualities of poetry the intervention of the civil wars greatly interrupted the study of poetry the national attention was called to other objects and those who in the former peaceful reigns would have perhaps distinguished themselves as poets and dramatists were now struggling for fame in the field or declaiming for power in the senate the manners of the prevailing party their fanatical detestation of everything like elegant or literary amusement their affected horror at stage representations which at once silenced the theatres and their contempt for profane learning which degraded the universities all operated during the civil wars and succeeding usurpation to check the pursuits of the poet by withdrawing that public approbation which is the best and often the sole reward of his labour there was at this time a sort of interregnum in the public taste as well as in its government the same poets were no doubt alive who had distinguished themselves at the court of charles but cowley and denham were exiled with their sovereign waller was awed into silence by the rigour of the puritanic spirit and even the muse of milton was scared from him by the clamour of religious and political controversy and only returned like a sincere friend to cheer the adversity of one who had neglected her during his career of worldly importance14  during this period the most unfavourable to literature which had occurred for at least two centuries dryden the subject of this memoir was gradually and silently imbibing those stores of learning and cultivating that fancy which was to do so much to further the reformation of taste and poetry it is now time to state his descent and parentage  the name of dryden is local and probably originated in the north of england where as well as in the neighbouring counties of scotland it frequently occurs though it is not now borne by any person of distinction david driden or dryden married the daughter of william nicholson of staffhill in the county of cumberland and was the greatgreatgrandfather of our poet john dryden eldest son of david settled in northamptonshire where he acquired the estate of canonsashby by marriage with elizabeth daughter and heiress of sir john cope of that county wood says that john dryden was by profession a schoolmaster and honoured with the friendship of the great erasmus who stood godfather to one of his sons15 he appears from some passages in his will to have entertained the puritanical principles which we shall presently find descended to his family16 erasmus driden his eldest son succeeded to the estate of canonsashby was highsheriff of northamptonshire in the fortieth year of queen elizabeth and was created a knight baronet in the seventeenth of king james i sir erasmus married frances second daughter and coheiress of william wilkes of hodnell in warwickshire by whom he had three sons first sir john driden his successor in the title and estate of canonsashby second william driden of farndon in northamptonshire third erasmus driden of tichmarsh in the same county the last of these was the father of the poet  erasmus driden married mary the daughter of the reverend henry pickering younger son of sir gilbert pickering a person who though in considerable favour with james i was a zealous puritan and so noted for opposition to the catholics that the conspirators in the gunpowder treason his own brotherinlaw being one of the number17 had resolved upon his individual murder as an episode to the main plot determined so to conduct it as to throw the suspicion of the destruction of the parliament upon the puritans18 these principles we shall soon see became hereditary in the family of pickering mr malones industry has collected little concerning our authors maternal grandfather excepting that he was born in 1584 named minister of oldwinkle allsaints in 1647 and died in 1657 from the time when he attained this preferment it is highly probable that he had been recommended to it by the puritanical tenets which he doubtless held in common with the rest of his family  of the poets father erasmus we know even less than of his other relations he acted as a justice of peace during the usurpation and was the father of no less than fourteen children four sons and ten daughters the sons were john erasmus henry and james the daughters agnes rose lucy mary martha elizabeth hester hannah abigail frances such anecdotes concerning them as my predecessors have recovered may be found in the note19  john dryden the subject of this memoir was born at the parsonage house of oldwinkle allsaints on or about the 9th day of august 163120 the village then belonged to the family of exeter as we are informed by the poet himself in the postscript to his virgil that his family were puritans may readily be admitted but that they were anabaptists although confidently asserted by some of our authors political or poetical antagonists appears altogether improbable notwithstanding therefore the sarcasm of the duke of buckingham the register of oldwinkle allsaints parish had it been in existence would probably have contained the record of our poets baptism21  dryden seems to have received the rudiments of his education at tichmarsh22 and was admitted a kings scholar at westminster23 under the tuition of the celebrated dr bushby24 for whom he ever afterwards entertained the most sincere veneration one of his letters to his old master is addressed honoured sir and couched in terms of respect and even humility fully sufficient for the occasion another written by dryden when his feelings were considerably irritated by a supposed injustice done to his son is nevertheless qualified by great personal deference to his old preceptor it may be readily supposed that such a scholar under so able a teacher must have made rapid progress in classical learning the bent of the juvenile poet even at this early period distinguished itself he translated the third satire of persius as a thursday nights task and executed many other exercises of the same nature in english verse none of which are now in existence25 during the last year of his residence at westminster the death of henry lord hastings a young nobleman of great learning and much beloved called forth no less than ninetyeight elegies one of which was written by our poet then about eighteen years old they were published in 1650 under the title of lachrymae musarum  dryden having obtained a westminster scholarship was admitted to trinity college cambridge on the 11th may 1650 his tutor being the reverend john templer ma a man of some learning who wrote a latin treatise in confutation of hobbes and a few theological tracts and single sermons while at college our authors conduct seems not to have been uniformly regular he was subjected to slight punishment for contumacy to the vicemaster26 and seems according to the statement of an obscure libeller to have been engaged in some public and notorious dispute with a noblemans son probably on account of the indulgence of his turn for satire27 he took however the degree of bachelor in january 16534 but neither became master of arts28 nor a fellow of the university and certainly never retained for it much of that veneration usually paid by an english scholar to his alma mater he often celebrates oxford but only mentions cambridge as the contrast of the sister university in point of taste and learning    oxford to him a dearer name shall be   than his own motheruniversity   thebes did his green unknowing youth engage   he chooses athens in his riper age29   a preference so uncommon in one who had studied at cambridge probably originated in some cause of disgust which we may now search for in vain  in june 1654 the death of his father erasmus dryden proved a temporary interruption to our authors studies he left the university on this occasion to take possession of his inheritance consisting of twothirds of a small estate near blakesley in northamptonshire worth in all about sixty pounds a year the other third part of this small property was bequeathed to his mother during her life and the property reverted to the poet after her death in 1676 with this little patrimony our author returned to cambridge where he continued until the middle of the year 1657  although drydens residence at the university was prolonged to the unusual space of nearly seven years we do not find that he distinguished himself during that time by any poetical prolusions excepting a few lines prefixed to a work entitled sion and parnassus or epigrams on several texts of the old and new testament published in 1650 by john hoddesdon30 mr malone conjectures that our poet would have contributed to the academic collection of verses entitled oliva pacis and published in 1654 on the peace between england and holland had not his fathers death interfered at that period it is probable we lose but little by the disappearance of any occasional verses which may have been produced by dryden at this time the elegy on lord hastings the lines prefixed to sion and parnassus and some complimentary stanzas which occur in a letter to his cousin honor driden31 would have been enough to assure us even without his own testimony that cowley was the darling of his youth and that he imitated his points of wit and quirks of epigram with a similar contempt for the propriety of their application from these poems we learn enough to be grateful that dryden was born at a later period in his century for had not the road to fame been altered in consequence of the restoration his extensive information and acute ingenuity would probably have betrayed the author of the ode to st cecilia and the father of english poetical harmony into rivalling the metaphysical pindarics of donne and cowley  the verses to which we allude display their sublety transcribers note sic of thought their puerile extravagance of conceit and that structure of verse which as the poet himself says of holydays translations has nothing of verse in it except the worst part of it the rhyme and that far from being unexceptionable the following lines in which the poet describes the death of lord hastings by the smallpox will be probably admitted as a justification of this censure    was there no milder way but the smallpox   the very filthiness of pandoras box   so many spots like naeves our venus soil   one jewel set off with so many a foil   blisters with pride swelled which through s flesh did sprout   like rosebuds stuck ithe lilyskin about   each little pimple had a tear in it   to wail the fault its rising did commit   which rebellike with its own lord at strife   thus made an insurrection gainst his life   or were these gems sent to adorn his skin   the cabinet of a richer soul within   no comet need foretel his change drew on   whose corpse might seem a constellation  this is exactly in the tone of bishop corbets invective against the same disease    oh thou deformed unwomanlike disease   thou ploughst up flesh and blood and there sowst pease   and leavst such prints on beauty that dost come   as clouted shoon do on a floor of loam   thou that of faces honeycombs dost make   and of two breasts two cullenders forsake   thy deadly trade now thou art rich give oer   and let our curses call thee forth no more32  after leaving the university our author entered the world supported by friends from whose character principles and situation it might have been prophesied with probability that his success in life and his literary reputation would have been exactly the reverse of what they actually proved sir gilbert pickering was cousingerman to the poet and also to his mother thus standing related to dryden in a double connection33 this gentleman was a staunch puritan and having set out as a reformer ended by being a regicide and an abettor of the tyranny of cromwell he was one of the judges of the unfortunate charles and though he did not sit in that bloody court upon the last and fatal day yet he seems to have concurred in the most violent measures of the unconscientious men who did so he had been one of the parliamentary counsellors of state and hesitated not to be numbered among the godly and discreet persons who assisted cromwell as a privy council moreover he was lord chamberlain of the protectors court and received the honour of his mock peerage  the patronage of such a person was more likely to have elevated dryden to the temporal greatness and wealth acquired by the sequestrators and committeemen of that oppressive time than to have aided him in attaining the summits of parnassus for according to the slight records which mr malone has recovered concerning sir gilbert pickerings character it would seem that to the hard precise fanatical contempt of every illumination save the inward light which he derived from his sect he added the properties of a fiery temper and a rude and savage address34 in what capacity dryden lived with his kinsman or to what line of life circumstances seemed to destine the future poet we are left at liberty to conjecture shadwell the virulent antagonist of our author has called him sir gilbert pickerings clerk and it is indeed highly probable that he was employed as his amanuensis or secretary    the next step of advancement you began   was being clerk to nolls lord chamberlain   a sequestrator and committeeman  the medal of john bayes  but i cannot with mr malone interpret the same passage by supposing the third line of the triplet to apply to dryden had he been actually a member of a committee of sequestration that circumstance would never have remained in the dubious obscurity of shadwells poetry it would have been as often echoed and reechoed as every other incident of the poets life which was capable of bearing an unfavourable interpretation i incline therefore to believe that the terms sequestrator and committeeman apply not to the poet but to his patron sir gilbert to whom their propriety cannot be doubted  sir gilbert pickering was not our authors only relation at the court of cromwell the chief of his family sir john driden elder brother of the poets father was also a flaming and bigoted puritan35 through whose gifts and merits his nephew might reasonably hope to attain preferment in a youth entering life under the protection of such relations who could have anticipated the future dramatist and poet laureate much less the advocate and martyr of prerogative and of the stuart family the convert and confessor of the roman catholic faith in his after career his early connections with the puritans and the principles of his kinsmen during the civil wars and usurpation were often made subjects of reproach to which he never seems to have deigned an answer36  the death of cromwell was the first theme of our poets muse averse as the puritans were to any poetry save that of hopkins of withers or of wisdom they may be reasonably supposed to have had some sympathy with drydens sorrow upon the death of oliver even although it vented itself in the profane and unprofitable shape of an elegy but we have no means of estimating its reception with the public if in truth the public long interested themselves about the memory of cromwell while his relations and dependants presented to them the more animated and interesting spectacle of a struggle for his usurped power richard perhaps and the immediate friends of the deceased protector with such of drydens relations as were attached to his memory may have thought like the tinker at the taming of the shrew that this same elegy was marvellous good matter it did not probably attract much general attention the first edition in 1659 is extremely rare it was reprinted however along with those of sprat and waller in the course of the same year after the restoration this piece fell into a slate of oblivion from which it may be believed that the author who had seen a new light in politics was by no means solicitous to recall it his political antagonist did not however fail to awaken its memory when dryden became a decided advocate for the royal prerogative and the hereditary right of the stuarts during the controversies of charles the seconds reign in which dryden took so decided a share his eulogy on cromwell was often objected to him as a proof of inconsistence and apostasy one passage which plainly applies to the civil wars in general was wrested to signify an explicit approbation of the murder of charles the first and the whole piece was reprinted by an incensed antagonist under the title of an elegy on the usurper oc by the author of absalom and achitophel published it is ironically added to show the loyalty and integrity of the poetan odd piece of vengeance which has perhaps never been paralleled except in the single case of love in a hollow tree37 the motives of the duchess of marlborough in reprinting lord grimestones memorable dramatic essay did not here apply the elegy on cromwell although doubtless sufficiently faulty contained symptoms of a regenerating taste and politically considered although a panegyric on an usurper the topics of praise are selected with attention to truth and are generally speaking such as cromwells worst enemies could not have denied to him neither had dryden made the errors or misfortunes of the royal family and their followers the subject of censure or of contrast with respect to them it was hardly possible that a eulogy on such a theme could have less offence in it this was perhaps a fortunate circumstance for dryden at the restoration and it must be noticed to his honour that as he spared the exiled monarch in his panegyric on the usurper so after the restoration in his numerous writings on the side of royalty there is no instance of his recalling his former praise of cromwell  after the frequent and rapid changes which the government of england underwent from the death of cromwell in the spring of 1660 charles ii was restored to the throne of his ancestors it may be easily imagined that this event a subject in itself highly fit for poetry and which promised the revival of poetical pursuits was hailed with universal acclamation by all whose turn for verse had been suppressed and stifled during the long reign of fanaticism the restoration led the way to the revival of letters as well as that of legal government with diaries as dryden has expressed it    the officious muses came along   a gay harmonious quire like angels ever young  it was not however to be expected that an alteration of the taste which had prevailed in the days of charles i was to be the immediate consequence of the new order of things the muse awoke like the sleeping beauty of the fairy tale in the same antiquated and absurd vestments in which she had fallen asleep twenty years before or if the reader will pardon another simile the poets were like those who after long mourning resume for a time their ordinary dresses of which the fashion has in the meantime passed away other causes contributed to a temporary revival of the metaphysical poetry almost all its professors attached to the house of stuart had been martyrs or confessors at least in its cause cowley their leader was yet alive and returned to claim the late reward of his loyalty and his sufferings cleveland had died a victim to the contempt rather than the persecution of the republicans38 but this most ardent of cavalier poets was succeeded by wild whose iter boreale a poem on monks march from scotland formed upon clevelands model obtained extensive popularity among the citizens of london39 drydens good sense and natural taste perceived the obvious defects of these the very coarsest of metaphysical poets insomuch that in his essay on dramatic poetry he calls wresting and torturing one word into another a catachresis or clevelandism and charges wild with being in poetry what the french call un mauvais buffon  sprat and an host of inferior imitators marched for a time in the footsteps of cowley delighted probably to discover in pindaric writing as it was called a species of poetry which required neither sound nor sense provided only there was a sufficient stock of florid and extravagant thoughts expressed in harsh and bombastic language  but this style of poetry although it was for a time revived and indeed continued to be occasionally employed even to the end of the eighteenth century had too slight foundation in truth and nature to maintain the exclusive preeminence which it had been exalted to during the reigns of the two first monarchs of the stuart race as rochester profanely expressed it cowleys poetry was not of god and therefore could not stand an approaching change of public taste was hastened by the manners of the restored monarch and his courtiers that pedantry which had dictated the excessive admiration of metaphysical conceits was not the characteristic of the court of charles ii as it had been of those of his grandfather and father lively and witty by nature with all the acquired habits of an adventurer whose wanderings military and political left him time neither for profound reflection nor for deep study the restored monarchs literary taste which was by no means contemptible was directed towards a lighter and more pleasing style of poetry than the harsh and scholastic productions of donne and cowley the admirers therefore of this old school were confined to the ancient cavaliers and the old courtiers of charles i men unlikely to lead the fashion in the court of a gay monarch filled with such men as buckingham rochester etherege sedley and mulgrave whose time and habits confined their own essays to occasional verses and satirical effusions in which they often ridiculed the heights of poetry they were incapable of attaining with such men the class of poets which before the civil war held but a secondary rank began to rise in estimation waller suckling and denham began to assert a preeminence over cowley and donne the ladies whose influence in the court of james and charles i was hardly felt and who were then obliged to be contented with such pedantic worship as is contained in the mistress of cowley and the epithalamion of donne began now when their voices were listened to and their taste consulted to determine that their poetical lovers should address them in strains more musical if not more intelligible what is most acceptable to the fair sex will always sway the mode of a gay court and the character of a smooth and easy sonneteer was soon considered as an indispensable requisite to a man of wit and fashion terms which were then usually synonymous  to those who still retained a partiality for that exercise of the fancy and memory afforded by the metaphysical poetry the style of satire then prevalent afforded opportunities of applying it the same depth of learning the same extravagant ingenuity in combining the most remote images and in driving casual associations to the verge of absurdity almost all the remarkable features which characterised the poetry of cowley may be successfully traced in the satire of hudibras the sublime itself borders closely on the ludicrous but the bombast and extravagant cannot be divided from it the turn of thought and the peculiar kind of mental exertion corresponds in both styles of writing and although butler pursued the ludicrous and cowley aimed at the surprising the leading features of their poetry only differ like those of the same face convulsed with laughter or arrested in astonishment the district of metaphysical poetry was thus invaded by the satirists who sought weapons there to avenge the misfortunes and oppression which they had so lately sustained from the puritans and as it is difficult in a laughing age to render serious what has been once applied to ludicrous purposes butler and his imitators retained quiet possession of the style which they had usurped from the grave bards of the earlier age  a single poet sir william davenant40 made a meritorious though a misguided and unsuccessful effort to rescue poetry from becoming the mere handmaid of pleasure or the partisan of political or personal disputes and to restore her to her natural rank in society as an auxiliary of religion policy law and virtue his heroic poem of gondibert has no doubt great imperfections but it intimates everywhere a mind above those laborious triflers who called that poetry which was only verse and very often exhibits a majestic dignified and manly simplicity equally superior to the metaphysical school by the doctrines of which davenant was occasionally misled yet if that author too frequently imitated their quaint affectation of uncommon sentiment and associations he had at least the merit of couching them in stately and harmonious verse a quality of poetry totally neglected by the followers of cowley i mention davenant here and separate from the other poets who were distinguished about the time of the restoration because i think that dryden to whom we are about to return was at that period an admirer and imitator of gondibert as we are certain that he was a personal and intimate friend of the author  with the return of the king the fall of drydens political patrons was necessarily involved sir gilbert pickering having been one of charless judges was too happy to escape into obscurity under an absolute disqualification for holding any office political civil or ecclesiastical the influence of sir john driden was ended at the same time and thus both those relations under whose protection dryden entered life and by whose influence he was probably to have been aided in some path to wealth or eminence became at once incapable of assisting him and even connection with them was rendered by the change of times disgraceful if not dangerous yet it may be doubted whether dryden felt this evil in its full extent sterne has said of a character that a blessing which closed his mouth or a misfortune which opened it with a good grace were nearly equal to him nay that sometimes the misfortune was the more acceptable of the two it is possible by a parity of reasoning that dryden may have felt himself rather relieved from than deprived of his fanatical patrons under whose guidance he could never hope to have indulged in that career of literary pursuit which the new order of things presented to the ambition of the youthful poet at least he lost no time in useless lamentation but now in his thirtieth year proceeded to exert that poetical talent which had heretofore been repressed by his own situation and that of the country  dryden left to his own exertions hastened to testify his joyful acquiescence in the restoration of monarchy by publishing astroea redux a poem which was probably distinguished among the innumerable congratulations poured forth upon the occasion and he added to those which hailed the coronation in 1661 the verses entitled a panegyric to his sacred majesty these pieces testify that the author had already made some progress in harmonising his versification but they also contain many of those points of wit and turns of epigram which he condemned in his more advanced judgment the same description applies in a yet stronger degree to the verses addressed to lord chancellor hyde lord clarendon on the newyearsday of 1662 in which dryden has more closely imitated the metaphysical poetry than in any poem except the juvenile elegy on lord hastings i cannot but think that the poet consulted the taste of his patron rather than his own in adopting this peculiar style clarendon was educated in the court of charles i and dryden may have thought it necessary in addressing him to imitate the strong verses which were then admired  according to the fashion of the times such copies of occasional verses were rewarded by a gratuity from the person to whom they were addressed and poets had not yet learned to think this mode of receiving assistance incompatible with the feelings of dignity or delicacy indeed in the common transactions of that age one sees something resembling the eastern custom of accompanying with a present and not always a splendid one the usual forms of intercourse and civility thus we find the wealthy corporation of hull backing a polite address to the duke of monmouth their governor with a present of six broad pieces and his grace deemed it a point of civility to press the acceptance of the same gratuity upon the member of parliament for the city by whom it was delivered to him41 we may therefore believe that dryden received some compliment from the king and chancellor and i am afraid the same premises authorise us to conclude that it was but trifling meantime our author having no settled means of support except his small landed property and having now no assistance to expect from his more wealthy kinsmen to whom probably neither his literary pursuits nor his commencing them by a panegyric on the restoration were very agreeable and whom he had also offended by a slight change in spelling his name42 seems to have been reduced to narrow and uncomfortable circumstances without believing in its full extent the exaggerated account given by brown and shadwell43 we may discover from their reproaches that at the commencement of his literary career dryden was connected and probably lodged with herringman the bookseller in the new exchange for whom he wrote prefaces and other occasional pieces but having as mr malone has observed a patrimony though a small one of his own it seems impossible that our author was ever in that state of mean and abject dependence which the malice of his enemies afterwards pretended the same malice misrepresented or greatly exaggerated the nature of drydens obligations to sir robert howard with whom he became acquainted probably about the time of the restoration whose influence was exerted in his favour and whose good offices the poet returned by literary assistance  sir robert howard was a younger son of thomas earl of berkshire44 and like all his family had distinguished himself as a royalist particularly at the battle of cropredy45 bridge he had recently suffered a long imprisonment in windsor castle during the usurpation his rank and merits made him after the restoration a patron of some consequence and upon his publishing a collection of verses very soon after that period dryden prefixed an address to his honoured friend on his excellent poems sir robert howard understood the value of drydens attachment introduced him into his family and probably aided in procuring his productions that degree of attention from the higher world for want of which the most valuable efforts of genius have often sunk into unmerited obscurity such in short were his exertions in favour of dryden that though we cannot believe he was indebted to howard for those necessaries of life which he had the means to procure for himself the poet found ground to acknowledge that his patron had not only been carefull of his fortune which was the effect of his nobleness but solicitous of his reputation which was that of his kindness  thus patronised our author seems to have advanced in reputation as he became more generally known to the learned and ingenious of his time yet we have but few traces of the labour by which he doubtless attained and secured his place in society a short satire on the dutch written to animate the people of england against them appeared in 166246 it is somewhat in the hard style of invective which cleveland applied to the scottish nation yet dryden thought it worth while to weave the same verses into the prologue and epilogue of the tragedy of amboyna a piece written in 1673 with the same kind intentions towards the statesgeneral  science as well as poetry began to revive after the iron dominion of military fanaticism was ended and dryden who through life was attached to experimental philosophy speedily associated himself with those who took interest in its progress he was chosen a member of the newly instituted royal society 26th november 1662 an honour which cemented his connection with the most learned men of the time and is an evidence of the respect in which he was already held most of these and the discoveries by which they had distinguished themselves dryden took occasion to celebrate in his epistle to dr walter charleton a learned physician upon his treatise of stonehenge gilbert boyle harvey and ent are mentioned with enthusiastic applause as treading in the path pointed out by bacon who first broke the fetters of aristotle and taught the world to derive knowledge from experiment in these elegant verses the author divests himself of all the flippant extravagance of point and quibble in which complying with his age he had hitherto indulged though of late in a limited degree  while thus united in friendly communion with men of kindred and congenial spirits dryden seems to have been sensible of the necessity of applying his literary talents to some line in which he might derive a steadier and more certain recompence than by writing occasional verses to the great or doing literary drudgery for the bookseller his own genius would probably have directed him to the ambitious labours of an epic poem but for this the age afforded little encouragement gondibert the style of which dryden certainly both admired and copied became a martyr to the raillery of the critics and to fill up the measure of shame the paradise lost fell stillborn from the press this last instance of bad taste had not it is true yet taken place but the men who were guilty of it were then living under drydens observation and their manners and habits could not fail to teach him to anticipate the little encouragement they were likely to afford to the loftier labours of poetry one only line remained in which poetical talents might exert themselves with some chance of procuring their possessors reward or at least maintenance and this was dramatic composition to this dryden sedulously applied himself with various success for many years but before proceeding to trace the history of his dramatic career i proceed to notice such pieces of his poetry as exhibit marks of his earlier style of composition  the victory gained by the duke of york over the dutch fleet on the 3d of june 1665 and his duchesss subsequent journey into the north furnished dryden with the subject of a few occasional verses in which the style of waller who came forth with a poem on the same subject is successfully imitated in addressing her grace the poet suppresses all the horrors of the battle and turns her eyes upon the splendour of a victory for which the kingdom was indebted to her husbands valour and her chaste vows in these verses not the least vestige of metaphysical wit can be traced and they were accordingly censured as wanting height of fancy and dignity of words this criticism dryden refuted by alleging that he had succeeded in what he did attempt in the softness of expression and smoothness of the measure the appropriate ornaments of an address to a lady and that he was accused of that only thing which he could well defend it seems however very possible that these remarks impelled him to undertake a task in which vigour of fancy and expression might with propriety be exercised accordingly his next poem was of greater length and importance this is a historical account of the events of the year 1666 under the title of annus mirabilis to which distinction the incidents which had occurred in that space gave it some title the poem being in the elegiac stanza dryden relapsed into an imitation of gondibert from which he had departed ever since the elegy on cromwell from this it appears that the authors admiration of davenant had not decreased indeed he long afterwards bore testimony to that authors quick and piercing imagination which at once produced thoughts remote new and surprising such as could not easily enter into any other fancy dryden at least equalled davenant in this quality and certainly excelled him in the powers of composition which are to embody the conceptions of the imagination and in the extent of acquired knowledge by which they were to be enforced and illustrated in his preface he has vindicated the choice of his stanza by a reference to the opinion of davenant47 which he sanctions by affirming that he had always himself thought quatrains or stanzas of verse in alternate rhyme more noble and of greater dignity both for sound and number than any other verse in use among us by this attention to sound and rhythm he improved upon the school of metaphysical poets which disclaimed attention to either but in the thought and expression itself the style of davenant more nearly resembled cowleys than that of denham and waller the same ardour for what dryden calls witwriting the same unceasing exercise of the memory in search of wonderful thoughts and allusions and the same contempt for the subject except as the medium of displaying the authors learning and ingenuity marks the style of davenant though in a less degree than that of the metaphysical poets and though chequered with many examples of a simpler and chaster character some part of this deviation was perhaps owing to the nature of the stanza for the structure of the quatrain prohibited the bard who used it from rambling into those digressive similes which in the pindaric strophe might be pursued through endless ramifications if the former started an extravagant thought or a quaint image he was compelled to bring it to a point within his fourlined stanza the snake was thus scotched though not killed and conciseness being rendered indispensable a great step was gained towards concentration of thought which is necessary to the simple and to the sublime the manner of davenant therefore though shortlived and ungraced by public applause was an advance towards true taste from the unnatural and frantic indulgence of unrestrained fancy and did it claim no other merit it possesses that of having been twice sanctioned by the practice of dryden upon occasions of uncommon solemnity  the annus mirabilis evinces a considerable portion of labour and attention the lines and versification are highly polished and the expression was probably carefully corrected dryden as johnson remarks already exercised the superiority of his genius by recommending his own performance as written upon the plan of virgil and as no unsuccessful effort at producing those wellwrought images and descriptions which create admiration the proper object of heroic poetry the annus mirabilis may indeed be regarded as one of drydens most elaborate pieces although it is not written in his later better and most peculiar style of poetry  the poem first appeared in octavo in 1667 and was afterwards frequently reprinted in quarto it was dedicated to the metropolis of great britain as represented by the lord mayor and magistrates a letter to sir robert howard was prefixed to the poem in which the author explains the purpose of the work and the difficulties which presented themselves in the execution and in this epistle as a contrast between the smooth and easy style of writing which was proper in addressing a lady and the exalted style of heroic or at least historical poetry he introduces the verses to the duchess of york already mentioned  the annus mirabilis being the last poetical work of any importance produced by our author until absalom and achitophel the reader may here pause and consider in the progressive improvement of dryden the gradual renovation of public taste the irregular pindaric ode was now abandoned to arwaker behn durfey and a few inferior authors who either from its tempting facility of execution or from an affected admiration of old times and fashions still pestered the public with imitations of cowley the rough measure of donne if it had any pretension to be called a measure was no longer tolerated and it was expected even of those who wrote satires lampoons and occasional verses that their rhymes should be rhymes both to the ear and eye and that they should neither adore their mistresses nor abuse their neighbours in lines which differed only from prose in the fashion of printing thus the measure used by rochester buckingham sheffield sedley and other satirists if not polished or harmonized approaches more nearly to modern verse than that of hall or donne in the elegy on cromwell and the annus mirabilis dryden followed davenant who abridged if he did not explode the quaintnesses of his predecessors in astroea redux and his occasional verses to dr charlton the duchess of york and others the poet proposed a separate and simpler model more dignified than that of suckling or waller more harmonious in measure and chaste in expression than those of cowley and crashaw much there doubtless remained of ancient subtlety and ingenious quibbling but when dryden declares that he proposes virgil in preference to ovid to be his model in the annus mirabilis it sufficiently implies that the main defect of the poetry of the last age had been discovered and was in the way of being amended by gradual and almost imperceptible degrees  in establishing or refining the latter style of writing in couplet verse our author found great assistance from his dramatic practice to trace the commencement of which is the purpose of the next section   footnotes 1 the statements in this paragraph are somewhat rhetorical massinger for instance was still at oxford when james ascended the throne and though he began to write a few years later his earliest published play now extant appeared nearly twenty years afterwards but the general drift is untoucheded  2 i do not pretend to enter into the question of the effect of the drama upon morals if this shall be found prejudicial two theatres are too many but in the present woful decline of theatrical exhibition we may be permitted to remember that the gardener who wishes to have a rare diversity of a common flower sows whole beds with the species and that the monopoly granted to two huge theatres must necessarily diminish in a complicated ratio both the number of playwriters

euphues he wrote what he styled court comedies the only rare poet of that time the witty comical facetiously quick and unparalleled john lillie moreover his editor mr blount assures us that he sate at

keies executed 31st january 1606 of whom fuller in his church history tells the following anecdotea few days before the fatal blow should have been given keies being at tichmarsh in northamptonshire at his brotherinlaws house mr gilbert pickering a protestant he suddenly whipped out his sword and in merriment made many offers therewith at the heads necks and sides of several gentlemen and ladies then in his company it was then taken for a mere frolic and so passed accordingly but afterwards when the treason was discovered such as remembered his gestures thought he practised what he intended to do when the plot should take effect that is to hack and hew kill and destroy all eminent persons of a different religion from himselfcaulfields history of the gunpowder plot  18 the following curious story is told to that effect in caulfields history of the gunpowder plot p 67  there was a mr pickering of tichmarshgrove in northamptonshire who was in great esteem with king james this mr pickering had a horse of special note for swiftness on which he used to hunt with the king a little before the blow was to be given mr keies one of the conspirators and brotherinlaw to mr pickering borrowed this horse of him and conveyed him to london upon a bloody design which was thus contrivedfawkes upon the day of the fatal blow was appointed to retire himself into st georges fields where this horse was to attend him to further his escape as they made him believe as soon as the parliament should be blown up it was likewise contrived that mr pickering who was noted for a puritan should that morning be murdered in his bed and secretly conveyed away and also that fawkes as soon as he came into st georges fields should be there murdered and so mangled that he could not be known upon which it was to be spread abroad that the puritans had blown up the parliamenthouse and the better to make the world believe it there was mr pickering with his choice horse ready to escape but that stirred up some who seeing the heinousness of the fact and him ready to escape in detestation of so horrible a deed fell upon him and hewed him to pieces and to make it more clear there was his horse known to be of special speed and swiftness ready to carry him away and upon this rumour a massacre should have gone through the whole land upon the puritans  when the contrivance of this plot was discovered by some of the conspirators and fawkes who was now a prisoner in the tower made acquainted with it whereas before he was made to believe by his companions that he should be bountifully rewarded for that his good service to the catholic cause now perceiving that on the contrary his death had been contrived by them he thereupon freely confessed all that he knew concerning that horrid conspiracy which before all the torments of the rack could not force him to do  the truth of this was attested by mr william perkins who had it from mr clement cotton to whom mr pickering gave the above relation   19 erasmus the poets immediate younger brother was in trade and resided in kingstreet westminster he succeeded to the family title and estate upon the death of sir john dryden and

by exertion of the literary talents with which he was so eminently endowed his becoming a writer of plays was a necessary consequence for the theatres newly opened after so long silence were resorted to with all the ardour inspired by novelty and dramatic composition was the only line which promised something like an adequate reward to the professors of literature in our sketch of the taste of the seventeenth century previous to the restoration this topic was intentionally postponed  in the times of james i and of his successor the theatre retained in some degree the splendour with which the excellent writers of the virgin reign had adorned it it is true that authors of the latter period fell far below those gigantic poets who flourished in the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries but what the stage had lost in dramatic composition was in some degree supplied by the increasing splendour of decoration and the favour of the court a private theatre called the cockpit was maintained at whitehall in which plays were performed before the court and the kings company of actors often received command to attend the royal progresses1 masques a species of representation calculated exclusively for the recreation of the great in whose halls they were exhibited were an usual entertainment of charles and his consort the machinery and decorations were often superintended by inigo jones and the poetry composed by ben jonson the laureate even milton deigned to contribute one of his most fascinating poems to the service of the drama and notwithstanding the severity of his puritanic tenets comus could only have been composed by one who felt the full enchantment of the theatre but all this splendour vanished at the approach of civil war the stage and court were almost as closely united in their fate as royalty and episcopacy had the same enemies the same defenders and shared the same overwhelming ruin no throne no theatre seemed as just a dogma as the famous no king no bishop the puritans indeed commenced their attack against royalty in this very quarter and while they impugned the political exertions of prerogative they assailed the private character of the monarch and his consort for the encouragement given to the profane stage that rock of offence and stumblingblock to the godly accordingly the superiority of the republicans was no sooner decisive than the theatres were closed and the dramatic poets silenced no department of poetry was accounted lawful but the drama being altogether unhallowed and abominable its professors were persecuted while others escaped with censure from the pulpit and contempt from the rulers the miserable shifts to which the surviving actors were reduced during the commonwealth have been often detailed at times they were connived at by the caprice or indolence of their persecutors but in general so soon as they had acquired any slender stock of properties they were beaten imprisoned and stripped at the pleasure of the soldiery2  the restoration naturally brought with it a revived taste for those elegant amusements which during the usurpation had been condemned as heathenish or punished as appertaining especially to the favourers of royalty to frequent them therefore became a badge of loyalty and a virtual disavowal of those puritanic tenets which all now agreed in condemning the taste of the restored monarch also was decidedly in favour of the drama at the foreign courts which it had been his lot to visit the theatre was the chief entertainment and as amusement was always his principal pursuit it cannot be doubted that he often sought it there the interest therefore which the monarch took in the restoration of the stage was direct and personal had it not been for this circumstance it seems probable that the general audience for a time at least would have demanded a revival of those pieces which had been most successful before the civil wars and that shakespeare massinger and fletcher would have resumed their acknowledged superiority upon the english stage but as the theatres were reestablished and cherished by the immediate influence of the sovereign and of the court which returned with him from exile a taste formed during their residence abroad dictated the nature of entertainments which were to be presented to them it is worthy of remark that charles took the models of the two grand departments of the drama from two different countries  france afforded the pattern of those tragedies which continued in fashion for twenty years after the restoration and which were called rhyming or heroic plays in that country however contrary to the general manners of the people a sort of stately and precise ceremonial early took possession of the theatre the french dramatist was under the necessity of considering less the situation of the persons of the drama than that of the performers who were to represent it before a monarch and his court it was not therefore sufficient for the author to consider how human beings would naturally express themselves in the predicament of the scene he had the more embarrassing task of so modifying their expressions of passion and feeling that they might not exceed the decorum necessary in the august presence of the grand monarque a more effectual mode of freezing the dialogue of the drama could hardly have been devised than by introducing into the theatre the etiquette of the drawingroom that etiquette also during the reign of louis xiv was of a kind peculiarly forced and unnatural the romances of calprenède and scudéry those ponderous and unmerciful folios now consigned to utter oblivion were in that reign not only universally read and admired but supposed to furnish the most perfect models of gallantry and heroism although in the words of an elegant female author these celebrated writings are justly described as containing only unnatural representations of the passions false sentiments false precepts false wit false honour and false modesty with a strange heap of improbable unnatural incidents mixed up with true history and fastened upon some of the great names of antiquity3 yet upon the model of such works were framed the court manners of the reign of louis and in imitation of them the french tragedy in which every king was by prescriptive right a hero every female a goddess every tyrant a firebreathing chimera and every soldier an irresistible amadis in which when perfected we find lofty sentiments splendid imagery eloquent expression sound morality everything but the language of human passion and human character in the hands of corneille and still more in those of racine much of the absurdity of the original model was cleared away and much that was valuable substituted in its stead but the plan being fundamentally wrong the high talents of these authors unfortunately only tended to reconcile their countrymen to a style of writing which must otherwise have fallen into contempt such as it was it rose into high favour at the court of louis xiv and was by charles introduced upon the english stage the favour which heroic plays have lately found upon our theatres says our author himself have been wholly derived to them from the countenance and approbation they have received at court4  the french comedy although molière was in the zenith of his reputation appears not to have possessed equal charms for the english monarch the same restraint of decorum which prevented the expression of natural passion in tragedy prohibited all indelicate licence in comedy charles probably was secretly pleased with a system which cramped the effusions of the tragic muse and forbade as indecorous those bursts of rapturous enthusiasm which might sometimes contain matter unpleasing to a royal ear5 but the merry monarch saw no good reason why the muse of comedy should be compelled to dwell in decencies for ever and did not feel at all degraded when enjoying a gross pleasantry or profane witticism in company with the mixed mass of a popular audience the stage therefore resumed more than its original licence under his auspices most of our early plays being written in a coarse age and designed for the amusement of a promiscuous and vulgar audience were dishonoured by scenes of coarse and naked indelicacy the positive enactments of james and the grave manners of his son in some degree repressed this disgraceful scurrility and in the common course of events the english stage would have been gradually delivered from this reproach by the increasing influence of decency and taste6 but charles ii during his exile had lived upon a footing of equality with his banished nobles and partaken freely and promiscuously in the pleasure and frolics by which they had endeavoured to sweeten adversity to such a court the amusements of the drama would have appeared insipid unless seasoned with the libertine spirit which governed their lives and which was encouraged by the example of the monarch thus it is acutely argued by dennis in reply to collier that the depravity of the theatre when revived was owing to that very suppression which had prevented its gradual reformation and just so a muddy stream if allowed its free course will gradually purify itself but if dammed up for a season and let loose at once its first torrent cannot fail to be impregnated with every impurity the licence of a rude age was thus revived by a corrupted one and even those plays which were translated from the french and spanish were carefully seasoned with as much indelicacy and double entendre as was necessary to fit them for the ear of the wittiest and most profligate of monarchs  another remarkable feature in the comedies which succeeded the restoration is the structure of their plot which was not like that of the tragedies formed upon the parisian model the english audience had not patience for the regular comedy of their neighbours depending upon delicate turns of expression and nicer delineation of character the spanish comedy with its bustle machinery disguise and complicated intrigue was much more agreeable to their taste this preference did not arise entirely from what the french term the phlegm of our national character which cannot be affected but by powerful stimulants it is indeed certain that an englishman expects his eye as well as his ear to be diverted by theatrical exhibition but the thirst of novelty was another and separate reason which affected the style of the revived drama the number of new plays represented every season was incredible and the authors were compelled to have recourse to that mode of composition which was most easily executed laboured accuracy of expression and fine traits of character joined to an arrangement of action which should be at once pleasing interesting and probable require sedulous study deep reflection and long and repeated correction and revision but these were not to be expected from a playwright by whom three dramas were to be produced in one season and in their place were substituted adventures surprises rencounters mistakes disguises and escapes all easily accomplished by the intervention of sliding panels closets veils masks large cloaks and dark lanthorns if the dramatist was at a loss for employing these convenient implements the fifteen hundred plays of lope de vega were at hand for his instruction presenting that rapid succession of events and those sudden changes in the situation of the personages which according to the noble biographer of the spanish dramatist are the charms by which he interests us so forcibly in his plots7 these spanish plays had already been resorted to by the authors of the earlier part of the century but under the auspices of charles ii who must often have witnessed the originals while abroad and in some instances by his express command translations were executed of the best and most lively spanish comedies8  the favourite comedies therefore after the restoration were such as depended rather upon the intricacy than the probability of the plot rather upon the vivacity and liveliness than on the natural expression of the dialogue and finally rather upon extravagant and grotesque conception of character than upon its being pointedly delineated and accurately supported through the representation these particulars in which the comedies of charles the seconds reign differ from the example set by shakespeare massinger and beaumont and fletcher seem to have been derived from the spanish model but the taste of the age was too cultivated to follow the stage of madrid in introducing or to speak more accurately in reviving the character of the gracioso or clown upon that of london9 something of foreign manners may be traced in the licence assumed by valets and domestics in the english comedy a freedom which at no time made a part of our national manners though something like it may still be traced upon the continent these seem to be the leading characteristics of the comedies of charles the seconds reign in which the rules of the ancients were totally disregarded it were to be wished that the authors could have been exculpated from an heavier chargethat of assisting to corrupt the nation by nourishing and fomenting their evil passions as well as by indulging and pandering to their vices  the theatres after the restoration were limited to two in number a restriction perhaps necessary as the exclusive patent expresses it in regard of the extraordinary licentiousness then used in dramatic representation but for which no very good reason can be shown when they are at least harmless if not laudable places of amusement one of these privileged theatres was placed under the direction of sir william davenant whose sufferings in the royal cause merited a provision and whose taste and talents had been directed towards the drama even during its proscription he is said to have introduced moveable scenes upon the english stage and without entering into the dispute of how closely this is to be interpreted we are certain that he added much to its splendour and decoration his set of performers which contained the famous betterton and others of great merit was called the dukes company the other licensed theatre was placed under the direction of thomas killigrew much famed by tradition for his colloquial wit but the merit of whose good things evaporated so soon as he attempted to interweave them with comedy10 his performers formed what was entitled the kings company with this last theatre dryden particularly connected himself by a contract to be hereafter mentioned none of his earlier plays were acted by the dukes company unless those in which he had received assistance from others whom he might think as well entitled as himself to prescribe the place of representation  such was the state of the english drama when dryden became a candidate for theatrical laurels so early as the year of the restoration he had meditated a tragedy upon the fate of the duke of guise but this he has informed us was suppressed by the advice of some friends who told him that it was an excellent subject but not so artificially managed as to render it fit for the stage it were to be wished these scenes had been preserved since it may be that the very want of artifice alleged by the critics of the day would have recommended them to our more simple taste we might at least have learned from them whether dryden in his first essay leant to the heroic or to the ancient english tragedy but the scene of guises return to paris is the only part of the original sketch which dryden thought fit to interweave with the play as acted in 1682 and as that scene is rendered literally from davila upon the principle that in so remarkable an action the poet was not at liberty to change the words actually used by the persons interested we only learn from it that the piece was composed in blank verse not rhyme  in the course of the year 16612 our author composed the wild gallant which was acted about february 16623 without success the beautiful countess of castlemaine afterwards duchess of cleveland extended her protection to the unfortunate performance and received the incense of the author who boasts    posterity will judge by my success   i had the grecian poets happiness   who waving plots found out a better way   some god descended and preserved the play  it was probably by the influence of this royal favourite that the wild gallant was more than once performed before charles by his own command but the author his piece and his poetical compliment were hardly treated in a session of the poets which appeared about 1670 nor did sir robert howard his associate escape without his share of ridicule    sir robert howard called for over and over       at length sent in teague with a packet of news   wherein the sad knight to his grief did discover       how dryden had lately robbed him of his muse    each man in the court was pleased with the theft       which made the whole family swear and rant   desiring their robin in the lurch being left       the thief might be punished for his wild gallant    dryden who one would have thought had more wit       the censure of every man did disdain   pleading some pitiful rhymes he had writ       in praise of the countess of castlemaine  the play itself contained too many of those prizefights of wit as buckingham called them in which the plot stood absolutely still while two of the characters were showing the audience their dexterity at repartee this error furnishes matter for a lively scene in the rehearsal  the rival ladies acted in 1663 and published in the year following was our authors next dramatic essay it is a tragicomedy and the tragic scenes are executed in rhymea style which dryden anxiously defended in a dedication addressed to the earl of orrery who had himself written several heroic plays he cites against blank verse the universal practice of the most polished and civilised nations the spanish the italian and the french enumerates its advantages in restraining the luxuriance of the poets imagination and compelling him to labour long upon his clearest and richest thoughts but he qualifies his general assertion by affirming that heroic verse ought only to be applied to heroic situations and personages and shows to most advantage in the scenes of argumentation on which the doing or forbearing some considerable action should depend accordingly in the rival ladies those scenes of the play which approach to comedy for it contains none properly comic are written in blank verse the dedication contains two remarkable errors the author mistakes the title of ferrex and porrex a play written by sackville lord buckhurst and norton and he ascribes to shakespeare the first introduction of blank verse the rival ladies seems to have been well received and was probably of some advantage to the author  in 16634 we find dryden assisting sir robert howard who must be termed his friend if not his patron in the composition of a rhyming play called the indian queen the versification of this piece which is far more harmonious than that generally used by howard shows evidently that our author had assiduously corrected the whole play though it may be difficult to say how much of it was written by him clifford afterwards upbraided dryden with having copied his almanzor from the character of montezuma11 and it must be allowed there is a striking resemblance between these two outrageous heroes who carry conquest to any side they choose and are restrained by no human consideration excepting the tears or commands of their mistress but whatever share dryden had in this piece sir robert howard retained possession of the titlepage without acknowledgment and dryden nowhere gives himself the trouble of reclaiming his property except in a sketch of the connection between the indian queen and indian emperor where he simply states that he wrote a part of the former the indian queen was acted with very great applause to which doubtless the scenery and dresses contributed not a little moreover it presented battles and sacrifices on the stage aerial demons singing in the air and the god of dreams ascending through a trap the least of which has often saved a worse tragedy  the indian queen having been thus successful dryden was encouraged to engraft upon it another drama entitled the indian emperor it is seldom that the continuation of a concluded tale is acceptable to the public the present case was an exception perhaps because the connection between the indian emperor and its predecessor was neither close nor necessary indeed the whole persons of the indian queen are disposed of by the bowl and dagger at the conclusion of that tragedy excepting montezuma who with a second set of characters the sons and daughters of those deceased in the first part occupies the stage in the second play the author might therefore have safely left the audience to discover the plot of the indian emperor without embarrassing them with that of the indian queen but to prevent mistakes and principally i should think to explain the appearance of three ghosts the only persons if they can be termed such who have any connection with the former drama dryden took the precaution to print and disperse an argument of the play in order as the rehearsal intimated to insinuate into the audience some conception of his plot the indian emperor was probably the first of drydens performances which drew upon him in an eminent degree the attention of the public it was dedicated to anne duchess of monmouth whom long afterward our author styled his first and best patroness12 this lady in the bloom of youth and beauty and married to a nobleman no less the darling of his father than of the nation had it in her power effectually to serve dryden and doubtless exerted her influence in procuring him that rank in public opinion which is seldom early attained without the sanction of those who lead the fashion in literature the duchess of monmouth probably liked in the indian emperor not only the beauty of the numbers and the frequently exquisite turn of the description but also the introduction of incantations and apparitions of which romantic style of writing she was a professed admirer the indian emperor had the most ample success and from the time of its representation till the day of his death our author though often rudely assailed maintained the very pinnacle of poetical superiority against all his contemporaries  the dreadful fire of london in 1666 put a temporary stop to theatrical exhibitions which were not permitted till the following christmas we may take this opportunity to review the effect which the rise of drydens reputation had upon his private fortune and habits of life  while our author was the literary assistant of sir robert howard and the hired labourer of herringman the bookseller we may readily presume that his pretensions and mode of living were necessarily adapted to that mode of life into which he had descended by the unpopularity of his puritanical connections even for some time after his connection with the theatre we learn from a contemporary that his dress was plain at least if not mean and his pleasures moderate though not inelegant13 but as his reputation advanced he naturally glided into more expensive habits and began to avail himself of the licence as well as to partake of the pleasures of the time we learn from a poem of his enemy milbourne that drydens person was advantageous and that in the younger part of his life he was distinguished by the emulous favour of the fair sex14 and although it would not be edifying were it possible to trace instances of his success in gallantry we may barely notice his intrigue with mrs reeve a beautiful actress who performed in many of his plays this amour was probably terminated before the fair ladys retreat to a cloister which seems to have taken place before the representation of otways don carlos in 167615 their connection is alluded to in the rehearsal which was acted in 1671 bayes talking of amarillis actually represented by mrs reeve says ay tis a pretty little rogue shes my mistress i knew her face would set off armour extremely and to tell you true i writ that part only for her there follows an obscure allusion to some gallantry of our author in another quarter but drydens amours were interrupted if not terminated in 1665 by his marriage  our authors friendship with sir robert howard and his increasing reputation had introduced him to the family of the earl of berkshire father to his friend in the course of this intimacy the poet gained the affections of lady elizabeth howard the earls eldest daughter whom he soon afterwards married16 the lampoons by which drydens private character was assailed in all points allege that this marriage was formed under circumstances dishonourable to the lady but of this there is no evidence while the malignity of the reporters is evident and undisguised we may however believe that the match was not altogether agreeable to the noble family of berkshire dryden it is true might in point of descent be admitted to form pretensions to lady elizabeth howard but his family though honourable was in a kind of disgrace from the part which sir gilbert pickering and sir john driden had taken in the civil wars while the berkshire family were remarkable for their attachment to the royal cause besides many of the poets relations were engaged in trade and the alliance of his brothersinlaw the tobacconist and stationer if it was then formed could not sound dignified in the ears of a howard add to this a very important considerationdryden had no chance of sharing the wealth of his principal relations which might otherwise have been received as an atonement for the guilty confiscations by which it was procured he had quarrelled with them or they with him his present possession was a narrow independence and his prospects were founded upon literary success always precarious and then connected with circumstances of personal abasement which rendered it almost disreputable a noble family might be allowed to regret that one of their members was chiefly to rely for the maintenance of her husband her family and herself upon the fees of dedications and occasional pieces of poetry and the uncertain profits of the theatre  yet as drydens manners were amiable his reputation high and his moral character unexceptionable the earl of berkshire was probably soon reconciled to the match and dryden seems to have resided with his fatherinlaw for some time since it is from the earls seat of charlton in wiltshire that he dates the introduction to the annus mirabilis published in the end of 166717  so honourable a connection might have been expected to have advanced our authors prospects in a degree beyond what he experienced but his fatherinlaw was poor considering his rank and had a large family so that the portion of lady elizabeth was inconsiderable nor was her want of fortune supplied by patronage or family influence drydens preferment as poet laureate was due to and probably obtained by his literary character nor did he ever receive any boon suitable to his rank as soninlaw to an earl but what was worst of all the parties did not find mutual happiness in the engagement they had formed it is difficult for a woman of a violent temper and weak intellects and such the lady seems to have been to endure the apparently causeless fluctuation of spirits incident to one doomed to labour incessantly in the feverish exercise of the imagination unintentional neglect and the inevitable relaxation or rather sinking of spirit which follows violent mental exertion are easily misconstrued into capricious rudeness or intentional offence and life is embittered by mutual accusation not the less intolerable because reciprocally just the wife of one who is to gain his livelihood by poetry or by any labour if any there be equally exhausting must either have taste enough to relish her husbands performances or goodnature sufficient to pardon his infirmities it was drydens misfortune that lady elizabeth had neither the one nor the other and i dismiss the disagreeable subject by observing that on no one occasion when a sarcasm against matrimony could be introduced has our author failed to season it with such bitterness as spoke an inward consciousness of domestic misery18  during the period when the theatres were closed dryden seems to have written and published the annus mirabilis of which we spoke at the close of the last section but he was also then labouring upon his essay of dramatic poesy it was a singular trait in the character of our author that by whatever motive he was directed in his choice of a subject and his manner of treating it he was upon all occasions alike anxious to persuade the public that both the one and the other were the object of his free choice founded upon the most rational grounds of preference he had therefore no sooner seriously bent his thoughts to the stage and distinguished himself as a composer of heroic plays than he wrote his essay of dramatic poesy in which he assumes that the drama was the highest department of poetry and endeavours to prove that rhyming or heroic tragedies are the most legitimate offspring of the drama  the subject is agitated in a dialogue between lord buckhurst sir charles sedley sir robert howard and the author himself under the feigned names of eugenius lisideius crites and neander this celebrated essay was first published in the end of 1667 or beginning of 1668 the author revised it with an unusual degree of care and published it anew in 1684 with a dedication to lord buckhurst  in the introduction of the dialogue our author artfully solicits the attention of the public to the improved versification in which he himself so completely excelled all his contemporaries and contrasts the rugged lines and barbarous conceits of cleveland with the more modern style of composition where the thoughts were moulded into easy and significant words superfluities of expression retrenched and the rhyme rendered so properly a part of the verse that it was led and guided by the sense which was formerly sacrificed in attaining it this point being previously settled a dispute occurs concerning the alleged superiority of the ancient classic models of dramatic composition this is resolutely denied by all the speakers excepting crites the regulation of the unities is condemned as often leading to greater absurdities than those they were designed to obviate and the classic authors are censured for the cold and trite subjects of their comedies the bloody and horrible topics of many of their tragedies and their deficiency in painting the passion of love from all this it is justly gathered that the moderns though with less regularity possess a greater scope for invention and have discovered as it were a new perfection in writing this debated point being abandoned by crites or howard the partisan of the ancients a comparison between the french and english drama is next introduced sedley the celebrated wit and courtier pleads the cause of the french an opinion which perhaps was not singular among the favourites of charles ii but the rest of the speakers unite in condemning the extolled simplicity of the french plots as actual barrenness compared to the variety and copiousness of the english stage and their authors limiting the attention of the audience and interest of the piece to a single principal personage is censured as poverty of imagination when opposed to the diversification of characters exhibited in the dramatis personae of the english poets shakespeare and jonson are then brought forward and contrasted with the french dramatists and with each other the former is extolled as the man of all modern and perhaps ancient poets who had the largest and most comprehensive soul and intuitive knowledge of human nature and the latter as the most learned and judicious writer which any theatre ever had but to shakespeare dryden objects that his comic sometimes degenerates into clenches and his serious into bombast to jonson the sullen and saturnine character of his genius his borrowing from the ancients and the insipidity of his latter plays the examen leads to the discussion of a point in which dryden had differed with sir robert howard this was the use of rhyme in tragedy our author had it will be remembered maintained the superiority of rhyming plays in the introduction to the rival ladies sir robert howard the catalogue of whose virtues did not include that of forbearance made a direct answer to the arguments used in that introduction and while he studiously extolled the plays of lord orrery as affording an exception to his general sentence against rhyming plays he does not extend the compliment to dryden whose defence of rhyme was expressly dedicated to that noble author dryden not much pleased perhaps at being left undistinguished in the general censure passed upon rhyming plays by his friend and ally retaliates in the essay by placing in the mouth of crites the arguments urged by sir robert howard and replying to them in the person of neander to the charge that rhyme is unnatural in consequence of the inverted arrangement of the words necessary to produce it he replies that duly ordered it may be natural in itself and therefore not unnatural in a play and that if the objection be further insisted upon it is equally conclusive against blank verse or measure without rhyme to the objection founded on the formal and uniform recurrence of the measure he alleges the facility of varying it by throwing the cadence upon different parts of the line by breaking it into hemistichs or by running the sense into another line so as to make art and order appear as loose and free as nature19 dryden even contends that for varietys sake the pindaric measure might be admitted of which davenant set an example in the siege of rhodes but this licence which was probably borrowed from the spanish stage has never succeeded elsewhere except in operas finally it is urged that rhyme the most noble verse is alone fit for tragedies the most noble species of composition that far from injuring a scene in which quick repartee is necessary it is the last perfection of wit to put it into numbers and that even where a trivial and common expression is placed from necessity in the mouth of an important character it receives from the melody of versification a dignity befitting the person that is to pronounce it with this keen and animated defence of a mode of composition in which he felt his own excellence dryden concludes the essay of dramatic poesy  the publication of this criticism the first that contained an express attempt to regulate dramatic writing drew general attention and gave some offence sir robert howard felt noways flattered at being made through the whole dialogue the champion of unsuccessful opinions and a partiality to the depreciated blank verse seems to have been hereditary in his family20 he therefore hasted to assert his own opinion against that of dryden in the preface to one of his plays called the duke of lerma published in the middle of the year 1668 it is difficult for two friends to preserve their temper in a dispute of this nature and there may be reason to believe that some dislike to the alliance of dryden as a brotherinlaw mingled with the poetical jealousy of sir robert howard21 the preface to the duke of lerma is written in the tone of a man of quality and importance who is conscious of stooping beneath his own dignity and neglecting his graver avocations by engaging in a literary dispute dryden was not likely of many men to brook this tone of affected superiority he retorted upon sir robert howard very severely in a tract entitled the defence of the essay on dramatic poesy which he prefixed to the second edition of the indian emperor published in 1668 in this piece the author mentions his antagonist as master of more than twenty legions of arts and sciences in ironical allusion to sir roberts coxcombical affectation of universal knowledge which had already exposed him to the satire of shadwell22 he is also described in reference to some foolish appearance in the house of commons as having maintained a contradiction in terminis in the face of three hundred persons neither does dryden neglect to hold up to ridicule the slips in latin and english grammar which marked the offensive preface to the duke of lerma and although he concludes that he honoured his adversarys parts and person as much as any man living and had so many particular obligations to him that he should be very ungrateful not to acknowledge them to the world yet the personal and contemptuous severity of the whole piece must have cut to the heart so proud a man as sir robert howard this quarrel between the baronet and the poet who was suspected of having crutchedup many of his lame performances furnished food for lampoon and amusement to the indolent wits of the day but the breach between the brothersinlaw though wide proved fortunately not irreconcilable and towards the end of drydens literary career we find him again upon terms of friendship with the person by whom he had been befriended at its commencement23 edward howard who it appears had entered as warmly as his brother into the contest with dryden about rhyming tragedies also seems to have been reconciled to our poet at least he pronounced a panegyric on his translation of virgil before it left the press in a passage which is also curious from the author ranking in the same line the two elaborate poems of milton and blackmore24  in testimony of total amnesty the defence of the essay was cancelled and it must be rare indeed to meet with an original edition of it since mr malone had never seen one25  drydens fame as an author was doubtless exalted by the essay of dramatic poesy which showed that he could not only write plays but defend them when written his circumstances rendered it necessary that he should take the full advantage of his reputation to meet the increasing expense of a wife and family and it was probably shortly after the essay appeared that our author entered into his memorable contract with the kings company of players the precise terms of this agreement have been settled by mr malone from unquestionable evidence after being the subject of much doubt and uncertainty it is now certain that confiding in the fertility of his genius and the readiness of his pen dryden undertook to write for the kings house no less than three plays in the course of the year in consideration of this engagement he was admitted to hold one share and a quarter in the profits of the theatre which was stated by the managers to have produced him three or four hundred pounds communibus annis either however the players became sensible that by urging their pensioner to continued drudgery they in fact lessened the value of his labour or dryden felt himself unequal to perform the task he had undertaken for the average number of plays which he produced was only about half that which had been contracted for the company though not without grudging paid the poet the stipulated share of profit and the curious document recovered by mr malone not only establishes the terms of the bargain but that the players although they complained of the laziness of their indented author were jealous of their right to his works and anxious to retain possession of him and of them26 it would have been well for drydens reputation and perhaps not less productive to the company had the number of his plays been still further abridged for while we admire the facility that could produce five or six plays in three years we lament to find it so often exerted to the sacrifice of the more essential qualities of originality and correctness  dryden had however made his bargain and was compelled to fulfil it the best he might as his last tragic piece the indian emperor had been eminently successful he was next to show the public that his talents were not limited to the buskin and accordingly late in 1667 was represented the maiden queen a tragicomedy in which although there is a comic plot separate from the tragic design our author boasts to have retained all that regularity and symmetry of parts which the dramatic laws require the tragic scenes of the maiden queen were deservedly censured as falling beneath the indian emperor they have neither the stately march of the heroic dialogue nor what we would be more pleased to have found in them the truth of passion and natural colouring which characterised the old english drama but the credit of the piece was redeemed by the comic part which is a more light and airy representation of the fashionable and licentious manners of the time than dryden could afterwards attain excepting in marriage à la mode the king whose judgment on this subject was unquestionable graced the maiden queen with the title of his play and dryden insinuates that it would have been dedicated to him had he had confidence to follow the practice of the french poets in like cases at least he avoided the solecism of inscribing the kings own play to a subject and instead of a dedication we have a preface in which the sovereigns favourable opinion of the piece is studiously insisted upon neither was the praise of charles conferred without critical consideration for he justly censured the concluding scene in which celadon and florimel treat of their marriage in very light terms in presence of the queen who stands by an idle spectator this insult to melpomene and preference of her comic sister our author acknowledges to be a fault but seemingly only in deference to the royal opinion for he instantly adds that in his own judgment the scene was necessary to make the piece go off smartly and was in the estimation of good judges the most diverting of the whole comedy  encouraged by the success of the maiden queen dryden proceeded to revive the wild gallant and in deference to his reputation it seems now to have been more favourably received than at its first representation  the maiden queen was followed by the tempest an alteration of shakespeares play of the same name in which dryden assisted sir william davenant it seems probable that dryden furnished the language and davenant the plan of the new characters introduced they do but little honour to his invention although dryden has highly extolled it in his preface the idea of a counterpart to shakespeares plot by introducing a man who had never seen a woman as a contrast to a woman who had never seen a man and by furnishing caliban with a sister monster seems hardly worthy of the delight with which dryden says he filled up the characters so sketched in mixing his tints dryden did not omit that peculiar colouring in which his age delighted mirandas simplicity is converted into indelicacy and dorinda talks the language of prostitution before she has ever seen a man but the play seems to have succeeded to the utmost wish of the authors it was brought out in the dukes house of which davenant was manager with all the splendour of scenic decoration of which he was inventor the opening scene is described as being particularly splendid and the performance of the spirits with mops and mows excited general applause davenant died before the publication of this piece and his memory is celebrated in the preface  our authors next play if it could be properly called his was sir martin marall this was originally a translation of letourdi of molière executed by the duke of newcastle famous for his loyalty and his skill of horsemanship dryden availed himself of the noble translators permission to improve and bring sir martin marall forward for his own benefit it was attended with the most complete success being played four times at court and above thirty times at the theatre in lincolnsinn fields a run chiefly attributed to the excellent performance of nokes who represented sir martin27 the tempest and sir martin marall were both acted by the dukes company probably because dryden was in the one assisted by sir william davenant the manager and because the other was entered in the name of the duke of newcastle of these two plays sir martin marall was printed anonymously in 1668 it did not appear with drydens name until 1697 the tempest though acted before sir martin marall was not printed until 166970 they are in the present as in former editions arranged according to the date of publication which gives the precedence to sir martin marall though last acted  the evenings love or the mock astrologer was drydens next composition it is an imitation of le feint astrologue of t corneille which is founded upon calderons el astrologo fingido several of the scenes are closely imitated from molières dépit amoureux having that lively bustle intricacy of plot and surprising situation which the taste of the time required and being enlivened by the characters of wildblood and jacinta the mock astrologer seems to have met a favourable reception in 1668 when it first appeared it was printed in the same or in the following year and inscribed to the duke of newcastle to whom dryden had been indebted for the sketch of sir martin marall it would seem that this gallant and chivalrous peer was then a protector of dryden though he afterwards seems more especially to have patronised his enemy shadwell upon whose northern dedications inscribed to the duke and his lady our author is particularly severe in the preface to the evenings love dryden anxiously justifies himself from the charge of encouraging libertinism by crownings rake and coquette with success but after he has arrayed all the authority of the ancient and modern poets and has pleaded that these licentious characters are only made happy after being reclaimed in the last scene we may be permitted to think that more proper heroes may be selected than those who to merit the reward assigned them must announce a violent and sudden change from the character they have sustained during five acts and the attempt to shroud himself under authority of others is seldom resorted to by dryden when a cause is otherwise tenable in this preface also he justified himself from the charge of plagiarism by showing that the mere story is the least part either of the labour of the poet or of the graces of the poem quoting against his critics the expression of the king who had said he wished those who charged dryden with theft would always steal him plays like drydens  the royal martyr was acted in 16689 and printed in 1670 it is in every respect a proper heroic tragedy and had a large share of the applause with which those pieces were then received it abounds in bombast but is not deficient in specimens of the sublime and of the tender the preface is distinguished by that tone of superiority which dryden often assumed over the critics of the time their general observations he cut short by observing that those who make them produce nothing of their own or only what is more ridiculous than any thing they reprehend special objections are refuted by an appeal to classical authority thus the couplet    and he who servilely creeps after sense   is safe but neer will reach an excellence  is justified from the serpit humi tutus of horace and by a still more forced derivation the line    and follow fate which does too fast pursue  is said to be borrowed from virgil    eludit gyro interior sequiturque sequentem  and he concludes by exulting that though he might have written nonsense none of his critics had been so happy as to discover it these indications of superiority being thought to savour of vanity had their share in exciting the storm of malevolent criticism of which dryden afterwards so heavily complained tyrannic love is dedicated to the duke of monmouth but it would seem the compliment was principally designed to his duchess the duke whom dryden was afterwards to celebrate in very different strains is however compared to an achilles or rinaldo who wanted only a homer or tasso to give him the fame due to him  it was in this period of prosperity of general reputation of confidence in his genius and perhaps of presumption if that word can be applied to dryden that he produced those two very singular plays the first and second parts of the conquest of granada in these models of the pure heroic drama the ruling sentiments of love and honour are carried to the most passionate extravagance and to maintain the legitimacy of this style of composition our author ever ready to vindicate with his pen to be right that which his timid critics murmured at as wrong threw the gauntlet down before the admirers of the ancient english school in the epilogue to the second part of the conquest of granada and in the defence of that epilogue that these plays might be introduced to the public with a solemnity corresponding in all respects to models of the rhyming tragedy they were inscribed to the duke of york and prefaced by an essay upon heroic plays they were performed in 166970 and received with unbounded applause before we consider the effect which they and similar productions produced on the public together with the progress and decay of the taste for heroic dramas we may first notice the effect which the ascendency of our authors reputation had produced upon his situation and fortunes  whether we judge of the rank which dryden held in society by the splendour of his titled and powerful friends or by his connections among men of genius we must consider him as occupying at this time as high a station in the very foremost circle as literary reputation could gain for its owner independent of the notice with which he was honoured by charles himself the poet numbered among his friends most of the distinguished nobility the great duke of ormond had already begun that connection which subsisted between dryden and three generations of the house of butler thomas lord clifford one of the cabal ministry was uniform in patronising the poet and appears to have been active in introducing him to the kings favour the duke of newcastle as we have seen loved him sufficiently to present him with a play for the stage the witty earl of dorset then lord buckhurst and sir charles sedley admired in that loose age for the peculiar elegance of his loose poetry were his intimate associates as is evident from the turn of the essay of dramatic poesy where they are speakers wilmot earl of rochester soon to act a very different part was then anxious to vindicate drydens writings to mediate for him with those who distributed the royal favour and was thus careful not only of his reputation but his fortune in short the first author of what was then held the first style of poetry was sought for by all among the great and gay who wished to maintain some character for literary taste a description which included all of the court of charles whom nature had not positively incapacitated from such pretension it was then dryden enjoyed those genial nights described in the dedication of the assignation when discourse was neither too serious nor too light but always pleasant and for the most part instructive the raillery neither too sharp upon the present nor too censorious upon the absent and the cups such only as raised the conversation of the night without disturbing the business of the morrow he had not yet experienced the disadvantages attendant on such society or learned how soon literary eminence becomes the object of detraction of envy of injury even from those who can best feel its merit if they are discouraged by dissipated habits from emulating its flight or hardened by perverted feeling against loving its possessors  but besides the society of these men of wit and pleasure dryden enjoyed the affection and esteem of the ingenious cowley who wasted his brilliant talents in the unprofitable paths of metaphysical poetry of waller and of denham who had done so much for english versification of davenant as subtle as cowley and more harmonious than denham who with a happier model would probably have excelled both dryden was also known to milton though it may be doubted whether they justly appreciated the talents of each other of all the men of genius at this period whose claims to immortality our age has admitted butler alone seems to have been the adversary of our authors reputation28  while dryden was thus generally known and admired the advancement of his fortune bore no equal progress to the splendour of his literary fame something was however done to assist it the office of royal historiographer had become vacant in 1666 by the decease of james howell and in 1668 the death of davenant opened the situation of poetlaureate these two offices with a salary of £200 paid quarterly and the celebrated annual butt of canary were conferred upon dryden 18th august 167029 the grant bore a retrospect to the term after davenants demise and is declared to be to john dryden master of arts in consideration of his many acceptable services theretofore done to his present majesty and from an observation of his learning and eminent abilities and his great skill and elegant style both in verse and prose30 thus was our author placed at the head of the literary class of his countrymen so far as that high station could be conferred by the favour of the monarch  if we compute drydens share in the theatre at £300 annually which is lower than it was rated by the actors in their petition31 if we make at the same time some allowance for those presents which authors of that time received upon presenting dedications or occasional pieces of poetry if we recollect that dryden had a small landed property and that his wife lady elizabeth had probably some fortune or allowance however trifling from her familyi think we will fall considerably under the mark in computing the poets income during this period of prosperity at £600 or £700 annually a sum more adequate to procure all the comforts and many of the luxuries of life than thrice the amount at present we must at the same time recollect that though dryden is nowhere censured for extravagance poets are seldom capable of minute economy and that lady elizabeth was by education and perhaps by nature unfitted for supplying her husbands deficiencies these halcyon days too were but of short duration the burning of the theatre in 167032 greatly injured the poets income from that quarter his pension like other appointments of the household establishment of charles ii was very irregularly paid and thus if his income was competent in amount it was precarious and uncertain  leaving dryden for the present in the situation which we have described and which he occupied during the most fortunate period of his life the next section may open with an account of the public taste at this time and of the revolution in it which shortly took place   footnotes  1 malones history of the stage  2 although criticism of the purely literary kind has been as much as possible avoided in these notes it seems necessary to say a few words here to put the reader on his guard scotts acquaintance with the english drama was extensive but he was not equally well acquainted with the french and as almost all persons in france as well as in england were till recently was all but ignorant of french drama before corneille the attribution of the french classical drama to the scudéry romance and the influence of louis xiv is entirely erroneous that drama was introduced by jodelle the dramatic poet of the pléiade in the middle of the sixteenth century and was strictly fashioned on the model of seneca successive improvements culminating in those of corneille were introduced in it but its main lines continued the same scott has also left out of sight a very important element in the constitution of the english heroic play when davenant before the restoration obtained cromwells permission to reintroduce dramatic entertainments if not plays music necessarily formed the chief part of the performance it was in fact an opera and operatic peculiarities remained after all restriction had been taken off scott assigns on the whole far too much influence to the french drama and to the personal predilection of charles the subject is a large one and has never been fully handled but readers may

biography of dryden it has been suggested that the writer was southerne but it is impossible to make things tally as dryden certainly had paid his court to the great by 1670 if not by 1665 there is the almost insuperable difficulty of supposing that the writer could have associated with dryden in parties of pleasure seventyfive years before datea difficulty all the more difficult in that he only claims to be in his eightyseventh year it would be worthy of little attention if the eager assailants of drydens moral character had not sought to see evidence of the deepest turpitude in this

expressions i have formerly made therefore i hope you will not be so unjust as to beleive all that the world sayes of mee but rather credit my protestation of never having named you to my friends

meet mee in the old exchange about six a clock i will justify my selfeletters of philip second earl of chesterfield 1829 p 95 this was the same earl of chesterfield to whom dryden dedicated the georgics thirty years later  as drydens detractors have been nearly as anxious to blacken his wifes character as his own they have seized on this letter to confirm the reckless and random assertions of contemporary libellers that her reputation was questionable the matter may be left to readers to decidei can see nothing in the phrases necessarily implying any improper intimacy  perhaps it is not superfluous to observe that scott has not shown his accustomed judgment and knowledge of the seventeenth century in his remark about the howards and the tobacconists the separation between classes as such was indeed sharp but it was probably rather more than less usual then than now for scions of noble and gentle families to go into retail trade it may be added that the evidence of a quarrel between dryden and his own family is far from strong and that one of the causes assigned by scott for that quarrel the change of spelling is very dubious as a matter of fact it has been seen that driden appears in the licence and it is not certain that the poet invented the y or first used it  very shortly after the marriage occurs the first mention of dryden of a personal kind pepys writes under date february 3d 1664 in covent garden tonight at the great coffeehouse where dryden the poet i knew at cambridge and all the wits of the towned  17 to give exact dates the preface to sir r howard is dated november 10th 1666 the poem appeared immediately afterwards pepys bought it on the 2d of february and pronounced it a very good poem some other dates and facts of a more precise kind than those in the text may be given here dryden left london in the summer of 1665 either from dread of the plague or because the playhouses were shut the interval of eighteen months seems to have been wholly spent at charlton and charles dryden his eldest son was born during this time though the precise date is not known charlton is near malmesbury in wiltshire and as dryden afterwards speaks of himself as possessed of some property in that county it has been reasonably conjectured that it was in virtue of a settlement on his wife but if so it cannot have been freehold property of lord berkshires as the poet says that he holds of the hydes lady elizabeth had received a considerable grant £3000 from the crown in recognition of her fathers services but it is not certain that it was ever paid no london domicile of his is known except the house in gerrard street now marked with a plate by the society of arts there is a housenow subdividedin fetter lane which also has a plate the successor of a stone inscription stating that dryden lived there no biographer takes notice of this and the topographers who do notice it do not believe the story if there be any foundation for it the period of his residence must probably have been before his marriage ed  18 i venture to think this last remark overstated sarcasms on matrimony were the fashion and dryden followed it the evidence of

world upon the naked feet of verse with other works that have their measures adorned with the trappings of rhyme which however they have succeeded in wit or design is still thought music as the heroic tone now goes but whether so natural to a play that should most nearly imitate in some cases our familiar converse the judicious may easily determine   21 a dislike which was silent for five years if it existeded  22 who drew sir robert in the character of sir positive atall in the sullen lovers a foolish knight that pretends to understand everything in the world and will suffer no man to understand anything in his company so foolishly positive that he will never be convinced of an error though never so gross this character is supported with great humour  23 in a letter from dryden to tonson dated 26th may 1696 in which he reckons upon sir robert howards assistance in a pecuniary transaction  24 i am informed mr dryden is now translating of virgil and although i must own it is a fault to forestall or anticipate the praise of a man in his labours yet big with the greatness of the work and the vast capacity of the author i cannot here forbear saying that mr dryden in the translating of virgil will of a certain make maro speak better than ever maro thought besides those already mentioned there are other ingredients and essential parts of poetry necessary for the forming of a truly great and happy genius viz a free air and spirit a vigorous and well governed thought which are as it were the soul which inform and animate the whole mass and body of verse but these are such divine excellencies as are peculiar only to the brave and the wise the first chief in verse who trode in this sweet and delightful path of the muses was the renowned earl of roscommon a

company in building another contracted great debts so that the shares fell much short of what they were formerly thereupon mr dryden complaining to the company of his want of proffit the company was so kind to him that they not only did not presse him for the playes which he so engaged to write for them and for which he was paid beforehand but they did also at his earnest request give him a third day for his last new play called all for love and at the receipt of the money of the said third day he acknowledged it as a guift and a particular kindnesse of the company yet notwithstanding this kind proceeding mr dryden has now jointly with mr lee who was in pension with us to the last day of our playing and shall continue written a play called oedipus and given it to the dukes company

ravenscroftmassacre of amboynastate of innocence  the rage for imitating the french stage joined to the successful efforts of our author had now carried the heroic or rhyming tragedy to its highest pitch of popularity the principal requisites of such a drama are summed up by dryden in the first two lines of the orlando furioso    le donne i cavalier larme gli amori   le cortesie laudaci imprese  the story thus partaking of the nature of a romance of chivalry the whole interest of the play necessarily turned upon love and honour those supreme idols of the days of knighterrantry the love introduced was not of that ordinary sort which exists between persons of common mould it was the love of amadis and oriana of oroondates and statira that love which required a sacrifice of every wish hope and feeling unconnected with itself and which was expressed in the language of prayer and of adoration it was that love which was neither to be chilled by absence nor wasted by time nor quenched by infidelity no caprice in the object beloved entitled her slave to emancipate himself from her fetters no command however unreasonable was to be disobeyed if required by the fair mistress of his affections the hero was not only to sacrifice his interest but his friend his honour his word his country even the gratification of his love itself to maintain the character of a submissive and faithful adorer much of this mystery is summed up in the following speech of almahide to almanzor and his answer from which it appears that a lover of the true heroic vein never thought himself so happy as when he had an opportunity of thus showing the purity and disinterestedness of his passion almanzor is commanded by his mistress to stay to assist his rival the king her husband the lover very naturally asks    almanz what recompence attends me if i stay    almah you know i am from recompence debarred   but i will grant your merit a reward   your flames too noble to deserve a cheat   and i too plain to practise a deceit   i no return of love can ever make   but what i ask is for my husbands sake   he i confess has been ungrateful too   but he and i are ruined if you go   your virtue to the hardest proof i bring   unbribed preserve a mistress and a king    almanz ill stop at nothing that appears so brave   ill dot and now i no reward will have   youve given my honour such an ample field   that i may die but that shall never yield  the king however not perhaps understanding this nice point of honour grows jealous and wishes to dismiss the disinterested ally whom his spouses beauty had enlisted in his service but this did not depend upon him for almanzor exclaims    almanz i wonnot go ill not be forced away   i came not for thy sake nor do i stay   it was the queen who for my aid did send   and tis i only can the queen defend   i for her sake thy sceptre will maintain   and thou by me in spite of thee shalt reign  the most applauded scenes in these plays turned upon nice discussions of metaphysical passion such as in the days of yore were wont to be agitated in the courts and parliaments of love some puzzling dilemma or metaphysical abstraction is argued between the personages on the stage whose dialogue instead of presenting a scene of natural passion exhibits a sort of pleading or combat of logic in which each endeavours to defend his own opinion by catching up the idea expressed by the former speaker and returning him his illustration or simile at the rebound and where the lover hopes everything from his ingenuity and trusts nothing to his passion thus in the following scene between almanzor and almahide the solicitations of the lover and the denials of the queen are expressed in the very carte and tierce of poetical argumentation    almah my light will sure discover those who talk   who dares to interrupt my private walk    almanz he who dares love and for that love must die   and knowing this dares yet love on am i    almah that love which you can hope and i can pay   may be received and given in open day   my praise and my esteem you had before   and you have bound yourself to ask no more    almanz yes i have bound myself but will you take   the forfeit of that bond which force did make    almah you know you are from recompence debarred   but purest love can live without reward    almanz pure love had need be to itself a feast   for like pure elements twill nourish least    almah it therefore yields the only pure content   for it like angels needs no nourishment   to eat and drink can no perfection be   all appetite implies necessity    almanz twere well if i could like a spirit live   but do not angels food to mortals give   what if some demon should my death foreshow   or bid me change and to the christians go   will you not think i merit some reward   when i my love above my life regard    almah in such a case your change must be allowed   i would myself dispense with what you vowed    almanz were i to die that hour when i possess   this minute shall begin my happiness    almah the thoughts of death your passion would remove   death is a cold encouragement to love    almanz no from my joys i to my death would run   and think the business of my life well done   but i should walk a discontented ghost   if flesh and blood were to no purpose lost  this kind of amoebaean dialogue was early ridiculed by the ingenious author of hudibras1  it partakes more of the spanish than of the french tragedy although it does not demand that the parody shall be so very strict as to reecho noun for noun or verb for verb which lord holland gives us as a law of the age of lope de vega2 the english heroic poet did enough if he displayed sufficient point in the dialogue and alertness in adopting and retorting the image presented by the preceding speech though if he could twist the speakers own words into an answer to his argument it seems to have been held the more ingenious mode of confutation  while the hero of a rhyming tragedy was thus unboundedly submissive in love and dexterous in applying the metaphysical logic of amorous jurisprudence it was essential to his character that he should possess all the irresistible courage and fortune of a preux chevalier numbers however unequal were to be as chaff before the whirlwind of his valour and nothing was to be so impossible that at the command of his mistress he could not with ease achieve when in the various changes of fortune which such tragedies demand he quarrelled with those whom he had before assisted to conquer    then to the vanquished part his fate he led   the vanquished triumphed and the victor fled  the language of such a personage unless when engaged in argumentative dialogue with his mistress was in all respects as magnificent and inflated as might beseem his irresistible prowess witness the famous speech of almanzor    almanz     to live   if from thy hands alone my death can be   i am immortal and a god to thee   if i would kill thee now thy fates so low   that i must stoop ere i can give the blow   but mine is fixed so far above thy crown   that all thy men   piled on thy back can never pull it down   but at my ease thy destiny i send   by ceasing from this hour to be thy friend   like heaven i need but only to stand still   and not concurring to thy life i kill   thou canst no title to my duty bring   im not thy subject and my souls thy king   farewell when i am gone   theres not a star of thine dare stay with thee   ill whistle thy tame fortune after me   and whirl fate with me wheresoeer i fly   as winds drive storms before them in the sky  it was expected by the audience that the pomp of scenery and bustle of action in which such tremendous heroes were engaged should in some degree correspond with their lofty sentiments and superhuman valour hence solemn feasts processions and battles by sea and land filled the theatre hence also the sudden and violent changes of fortune by which the hero and his antagonists are agitated through the whole piece fortune has been often compared to the sea but in a heroic play her course resembled an absolute bay of biscay or race of portland disturbed by an hundred contending currents and eddies and never continuing a moment in one steady flow  that no engine of romantic surprise might be wanting dryden contends that the dramatist as he is not confined to the probable in character so he is not limited by the bounds of nature in the action but may let himself loose to visionary objects and to the representation of such things as not depending upon sense leave free exercise for the imagination indeed if ghosts magicians and demons might with propriety claim a place anywhere it must be in plays which throughout disclaim the common rules of nature both in the incidents narrated and the agents interested3  lastly the action of the heroic drama was to be laid not merely in the higher but in the very highest walk of life no one could with decorum aspire to share the sublimities which it annexed to character except those made of the porcelain clay of the earth dukes princes kings and kaisars the matters agitated must be of moment proportioned to their characters and elevated station the fate of cities and the fall of kingdoms  that the language as well as actions and character of the dramatis personae might be raised above the vulgar their sentiments were delivered in rhyme the richest and most ornate kind of verse and the farthest removed from ordinary colloquial diction dryden has himself assigned the following reasonsthe plot the characters the wit the passions the descriptions are all exalted above the level of common converse as high as the imagination of the poet can carry them with proportion to verisimility tragedy we know is wont to image to us the minds and fortunes of noble persons and to portray these exactly heroic rhyme is nearest nature as being the noblest kind of modern verse    indignatur enim priratis et prope socco   dignis carminibus narrari coena thyestae  says horace and in another place    effutire leves indigna tragaedia versus  blank verse is acknowledged to be too low for a poem nay more for a paper of verses but if too low for an ordinary sonnet how much more for tragedy which is by aristotle in the dispute betwixt the epic poesy and the dramatic for many reasons he there alleges ranked above it  when we consider these various essentials of a rhyming play we may perhaps without impropriety define it to be a metrical romance of chivalry in form of a drama the hero is a perfect knighterrant invincible in battle and devoted to his dulcinea by a love subtle metaphysical and abstracted from all the usual qualities of the instinctive passion his adventures diversified by splendid descriptions of bullfeasts battles and tournaments his fortune undergoing the strangest most causeless and most unexpected varieties his history chequered by the marvellous interference of ghosts spectres and hell itself his actions effecting the change of empires and his coagents being all lords and dukes and noble princes in order that their rank might in some slight degree correspond to the native exultation of the champions character  the reader may smile at this description and feel some surprise how compositions involving such gross absurdities were tolerated by an audience having pretence to taste and civilisation but something may be said for the heroic drama  although the manners were preposterous and the changes of fortune rapid and improbable yet the former often attained a sublime though forced elevation of sentiment and the latter by rapidity of transition and of contrast served in no slight degree to interest as well as to surprise the audience if the spectators were occasionally stunned with bombast or hurried and confused by the accumulation of action and intrigue they escaped the languor of a creeping dialogue and the taedium of a barren plot of which the termination is descried full three acts before it can be attained besides if these dramas were sometimes extravagant beautiful passages often occurred to atone for these sallies of fury in others ingenuity makes some amends for the absence of natural feeling and the readers fancy is pleased at the expense of his taste in representation the beauty of the verse assisted by the enunciation of such actors as betterton and mohun gilded over the defects of the sense and afforded a separate gratification the splendour of scenery also in which these plays claimed a peculiar excellence afforded a different but certain road to popular favour and thus this drama with all its faults was very far from wanting the usual requisites for success but another reason for its general popularity may be sought in a certain correspondence with the manners of the time  although in charles the seconds reign the age of chivalry was totally at an end yet the sentiments which had ceased to be motives of action were not so obsolete as to sound totally strange to the public ear the french romances of the lower class such as cassandra cleopatra etc were the favourite pastime of the ladies and retained all the extravagancies of chivalrous sentiment with a double portion of tedious form and metaphysical subtlety there were occasionally individuals romantic enough to manage their correspondence and amours on this exploded system the admired mrs philips carried on an extensive correspondence with ingenious persons of both sexes in which she called herself orinda and her husband mr wogan by the title of antenor shadwell an acute observer of nature in one of his comedies describes a formal coxcomb of this class who courts his mistress out of the grand cyrus and rejoices in an opportunity of showing that his passion could subsist in despite of her scorn4 it is probable he had met with such an original in the course of his observation the précieuses of molière who affected a strange mixture of the romantic heroine and modern fine lady belong to the same class of oddities and had their prototypes under the observation of the satirist but even those who were above such foppery had been early taught to read and admire the conceits of donne and the metaphysical lovepoems of cowley they could not object to the quaint and argumentative dialogues which we have described for the course of their studies had formed their taste upon a model equally artificial and fantastic and thus what between real excellence and false brilliancy the age had been accustomed not only to admit but to admire heroic plays  perhaps even these favourable circumstances of taste and opportunity would hardly have elevated the rhyming drama so high in the public opinion had it been supported by less powers than those of dryden or even by equal talents less happily adapted to that style of composition his versification flowed so easily as to lessen the bad effects of rhyme in dialogue and at the same time abounded with such splendid and sonorous passages as in the mouth of a betterton awed into silence even those critics who could distinguish that the tumid and unnatural was sometimes substituted for the heroic and sublime the felicity of his language the richness of his illustrations and the depth of his reflections often supplied what the scene wanted in natural passion and while enjoying the beauty of his declamation it was only on cool reflection that the hearer discovered it had passed upon him for the expression of genuine feeling even then the pleasure which he actually received from the representation was accepted as an apology for the more legitimate delight which the rules of criticism entitled him to have expected to these considerations the high rank and consequent influence which dryden already held in the fashionable and literary circles of the time must unquestionably be added nor did he fail to avail himself of his access to the great whose applause was often cheaply secured by a perusal of the piece previous to its being presented to the public and thus it afterwards came forth with all the support of a party eminent for rank and literature already prepossessed in its favour5  for all these reasons the heroic drama appears to have gradually risen in reputation from the return of charles till about the year 16701 when drydens conquest of granada was received with such enthusiastic applause the reputation of the poet himself kept pace with that of his favourite style of composition and though posterity has judged more correctly it may be questioned whether tyrannic love and the conquest of granada did not place dryden higher in public esteem in 1670 than his virgil and fables in 1700 he was however now to experience the inconveniencies of elevation and to sustain an attack upon the style of writing which he had vindicated and practised as well as to repel the efforts of rivals who boasted of outstripping him in the very road to distinction which he had himself pointed out the duke of buckingham attacked the system of rhyming plays from the foundation leigh transcribers note print unclear clifford and other scribblers wrote criticisms transcribers note print unclear upon those of our author in particular and elkanah settle was able to form a faction heretical enough to maintain that he could write such compositions better than dryden  the witty farce of the rehearsal is said to have been meditated by its authors for it was the work of several hands so early as a year or two after the restoration when sir william davenants operas and tragedies were the favourite exhibitions the ostensible author was the witty george villiers duke of buckingham whose dissipation was marked with shades of the darkest profligacy he lived an unprincipled statesman a fickle projector a wavering friend a steady enemy and died a bankrupt an outcast and a proverb the duke was unequal to that masculine satire which depends for edge and vigour upon the conception and expression of the author6 but he appears to have possessed considerable powers of discerning what was ludicrous and enough of subordinate humour to achieve an imitation of colloquial peculiarities or a parody upon remarkable passages of poetrytalents differing as widely from real wit as mimicry does from true comic action besides buckingham as a man of fashion and a courtier was master of the persiflage or jargon of the day so essentially useful as the medium of conveying light humour he early distinguished himself as an opponent of the rhyming plays those of the howards of davenant and others the first which appeared after the reformation experienced his opposition at the representation of the united kingdoms by the honourable edward howard a brother of sir robert the dukes active share in damning the piece was so far resented by the author and his friends that he narrowly escaped sanguinary proofs of their displeasure7 this specimen of irritation did not prevent his meditating an attack upon the whole body of modern dramatists in which he had the assistance of several wits who either respected the ancient drama or condemned the modern style or were willing to make common cause with a duke against a poetlaureate these were the witty author of hudibras who while himself starving8 amused his misery by ridiculing his contemporaries sprat afterwards bishop of rochester then buckinghams chaplain and martin clifford afterwards master of the charterhouse the author of a very scurrilous criticism upon some of drydens plays to be mentioned hereafter by the joint efforts of this coalition the rehearsal was produced a lively piece which continues to please although the plays which it parodies are no longer read or acted and although the zest of the personal satire which it contains has evaporated in the lapse of time this attack on the reigning taste was long threatened ere it was made and the precise quarter to be assailed was varied more than once prior says that buckingham suspended his attack till he was certain that the earl of dorset would not rehearse on him again the principal character was termed in the original sketch bilboa a name expressing a traveller and soldier under which sir robert howard or sir william davenant was designated the author of the key to the rehearsal affirms that sir robert was the person meant but mr malone is of opinion that davenant is clearly pointed out by the brown paper patch introduced in ridicule of that which davenant really wore upon his nose yet as this circumstance was retained when the character was assigned to dryden the poet of the rehearsal may be considered as in some degree a knight of the shire representing all the authors of the day and uniting in his person their several absurd peculiarities the first sketch of the rehearsal was written about 1664 but the representation was prevented by the theatres being shut upon the plague and fire of london when they were again opened the plays of the howards of stapleton etc had fallen into contempt by their own demerit and were no longer a wellknown or worthy object of ridicule perhaps also there was a difficulty in bringing the piece forward while of the persons against whom its satire was chiefly directed davenant was manager of the one theatre and dryden a sharer in the other the death of davenant probably removed this difficulty and the success of dryden in the heroic drama the boldness with which he stood forth not only as a practiser but as the champion of that peculiar style a certain provoking tone of superiority in his critical essays which even when flowing from conscious merit is not easily tolerated by contemporaries and perhaps his situation as poetlaureate a post which has been always considered as a fair butt for the shafts of ridiculeinduced buckingham to resume the plan of his satire and to place dryden in the situation designed originally for davenant or howard that the public might be at no loss to assign the character of bayes to the laureate his peculiarities of language were strictly copied lacy the actor was instructed by buckingham himself how to mimic his voice and manner and in performing the part he wore a dress exactly resembling drydens usual habit with these illnatured precautions the rehearsal was in 1671 brought forward for the first time by the kings company as besides the reputation of dryden that of many inferior poets but greater men was assailed by the dukes satire it would appear that the play met a stormy reception on the first night of representation the friends of the earl of orrery of sir robert howard and his brothers and other men of rank who had produced heroic plays were loud and furious in their opposition but as usually happens the party who laughed got the advantage over that which was angry and finally drew the audience to their side when once received the success of the rehearsal was unbounded the very popularity of the plays ridiculed aided the effect of the satire since everybody had in their recollection the originals of the passages parodied besides the attraction of personal severity upon living and distinguished literary characters and the broad humour of the burlesque the part of bayes had a claim to superior praise as drawn with admirable attention to the foibles of the poetic tribe his greedy appetite for applause his testy repulse of censure or criticism his inordinate and overwhelming vanity not unmixed with a vein of flattery to those who he hopes will gratify him by returning it in kind finally that extreme anxious and fidgeting attention to the minute parts of what even in whole is scarce worthy of anyare i fear but too appropriate qualities of the genus vatum  almost all drydens plays including those on which he set the highest value and which he had produced with confidence as models of their kind were parodied in the rehearsal9 he alone contributed more to the farce than all the other poets together his favourite style of comic dialogue which he had declared to consist rather in a quick sharpness of dialogue than in delineations of humour10 is paraphrased in the scene between tom thimble and prince prettyman the lyrics of his astral spirits are cruelly burlesqued in the song of the two lawful kings of brentford as they descend to repossess their throne above all almanzor his favourite hero is parodied in the magnanimous drawcansir and to conclude the whole scope of heroic plays with their combats feasts processions sudden changes of fortune embarrassments of chivalrous love and honour splendid verse and unnatural rants are so held up to ridicule as usually to fix the resemblance upon some one of his own dramas the wild gallant the maiden queen and tyrannic love all furnish parodies as do both parts of the conquest of granada which had been frequently acted before the representation of the rehearsal though not printed till after what seems more strange the play of marriage á la mode is also alluded to although it was neither acted nor printed till 1673 a year after the appearance of the rehearsal but there being no parody of any particular passage although the plot and conduct of the piece is certainly ridiculed it seems probable that as dryden often showed his plays in manuscript to those whom he accounted his patrons the plan of marriage à la mode may have transpired in the circles which buckingham frequented who may thus have made it the subject of satire by anticipation11  it is easy to conceive what dryden must have felt at beholding his labours and even his person held up to public derision on the theatre where he had so often triumphed but he was too prudent to show outward signs of resentment and in conversation allowed that the farce had a great many good things in it though so severe against himself yet i cannot help saying he added in a welljudged tone of contempt that smith and johnson are two of the coolest and most insignificant fellows i ever met with upon the stage12 many years afterwards he assigned nearly the same reason to the public for not replying to the satire13 but though he veiled his resentment under this mask of indifference at the time he afterwards avowed that the exquisite character of zimri in absalom and achitophel was laboured with so much felicitous skill as a requital in kind to the author of the rehearsal14  the ridicule cast upon heroic plays by the rehearsal did not prevent their being still exhibited they contained many passages of splendid poetry which continued to delight the audience after they had laughed at buckinghams parody but the charm began to dissolve and from the time of that representation they seem gradually but perceptibly to have declined in favour accordingly dryden did not trust to his powers of numbers in his next play but produced the marriage à la mode a tragicomedy or rather a tragedy and comedy the plots and scenes of which are intermingled for they have no natural connection with each other the stateintrigue bears evident marks of hurry and inattention and it is at least possible that dryden originally intended it for the subject of a proper heroic play but startled at the effect of buckinghams satire hastily added to it some comic scenes either lying by him or composed on purpose the higher or tragic plot is not only grossly inartificial and improbable but its incidents are so perplexed and obscure that it would have required much more action to detail them intelligibly even the language has an abridged appearance and favours the idea that the tragic intrigue was to have been extended into a proper heroic play instead of occupying a spare corner in a comedy but to make amends the comic scenes are executed with spirit and in a style resembling those in the maiden queen15 they contained much witty and fashionable raillery and the character of melantha is pronounced by cibber to exhibit the most complete system of female foppery that could possibly be crowded into the tortured form of a fine lady it was admirably acted by mrs montfort afterwards mrs verbruggen the piece thus supported was eminently successful a fortunate circumstance for the kings company who were then in distressful circumstances their house in drurylane had been destroyed by fire after which disaster they were compelled to occupy the old theatre in lincolns inn fields lately deserted by the rival company for a splendid one in dorset gardens from a prologue which our author furnished to be spoken at the opening of this house of refuge it would seem that even the scenes and properties of the actors had been furnished by the contributions of the nobility16 perhaps their present reduced situation was an additional reason with dryden for turning his attention to comedy which required less splendour of exhibition and decoration than the heroic plays  marriage à la mode was inscribed to wilmot earl of rochester in strains of adulation not very honourable to the dedicator but as he expresses his gratitude for rochesters care not only of his reputation but of his fortune for his solicitude to overcome the fatal modesty of poets which leads them to prefer want to importunity and finally for the good effects of his mediation in all his concerns at court it may be supposed some recent benefit perhaps an active share in procuring the appointment of poetlaureate had warmed the heart of the author towards the patron the dedication was well received and the compliment handsomely acknowledged as we learn from a letter from dryden to rochester where he says that the shame of being so much overpaid for an ill dedication made him almost repent of his address but he had shortly afterwards rather more substantial reasons for regretting his choice of a patron  the same cause for abstaining from tragic composition still remaining in force dryden in 1672 brought forward a comedy called the assignation or love in a nunnery the plot was after the spanish model the author seems to have apprehended and experienced some opposition on account of this second name and although he deprecates in the epilogue the idea of its being a party play or written to gratify the puritans with satire at the expense of the catholics17 yet he complains in the dedication of the number of its enemies who came prepared to damn it on account of the title the duke of york having just made public profession of the roman faith any reflections upon it were doubtless watched with a jealous eye but though guiltless in this respect the assignation had worse faults the plot is but indifferently conducted and was neither enlivened with gay dialogue nor with striking character the play accordingly proved unsuccessful in the representation yet although upon reading the assignation we cannot greatly wonder at this failure still considering the plays which succeeded about the same time we may be disposed to admit that the weight of a party was thrown into the scale against its reception buckingham who shortly afterwards published a revised edition of the rehearsal failed not to ridicule the absurd and coarse trick by which the enamoured prince prevents his father from discovering the domino of his mistress which had been left in his apartment18 and drydens rivals and enemies now a numerous body hailed with malicious glee an event which seemed to foretell the decay of his popularity  the assignation was published in 1673 and inscribed by dryden to his much honoured friend sir charles sedley there are some acrimonious passages in this dedication referring to the controversies in which the author had been engaged and obscure as these have become it is the biographers duty to detail and illustrate them  it cannot be supposed that the authors of the time saw with indifference drydens rapid success and the measures which he had taken by his critical essays to guide the public attention and to fix it upon himself and the heroic plays in which he felt his full superiority but no writer of the time could hope to be listened to by the public if he entered a claim of personal competition against a poet so celebrated the defence of the ancient poets afforded a less presumptuous and more favourable pretext for taking the field and for assailing drydens writings and avenging the slight notice he had afforded to his contemporaries under the colour of defending the ancients against his criticism the essay of dramatic poesy afforded a pretence for commencing this sort of warfare in that piece dryden had pointed out the faults of shakespeare jonson and fletcher with less ceremony than the height of their established reputation appeared to demand from a young author but the precedence which he undauntedly claimed for the heroic drama and more generally the superiority of the plays of drydens own age whether tragic or comic over those of the earlier part of the seventeenth century was asserted not only distinctly but irreverently in the epilogue to the conquest of granada    they who have best succeeded on the stage   have still conformed their genius to their age   thus jonson did mechanic humour show   when men were dull and conversation low   then comedy was faultless but twas coarse   cobbs tankard was a jest and otters horse   and as their comedy their love was mean   except by chance in some one laboured scene   which must atone for an illwritten play   they rose but at their height could seldom stay   fame then was cheap and the first comer sped   and they have kept it since by being dead   but were they now to write when critics weigh   each line and every word throughout a play   none of them no not jonson in his height   could pass without allowing grains for weight   think it not envy that these truths are told   our poets not malicious though hes bold   tis not to brand them that their faults are shown   but by their errors to excuse his own   if love and honour now are higher raised   tis not the poet but the age is praised   wits now arrived to a more high degree   our native language more refined and free   our ladies and our men now speak more wit   in conversation than those poets writ   then one of these is consequently true   that what this poet writes comes short of you   and imitates you ill which most he fears   or else his writing is not worse than theirs   yet though you judge as sure the critics will   that some before him writ with greater skill   in this one praise he has their fame surpast   to please an age more gallant than the last  the daring doctrine laid down in these obnoxious lines our author ventured to maintain in what he has termed a defence of the epilogue or an essay on the dramatic poetry of the last age it is subjoined to the conquest of granada and as that play was not printed till after the rehearsal it serves to show how little drydens opinions were altered or his tone lowered by the success of that witty satire it was necessary he says either not to print the bold epilogue which we have quoted or to show that he could defend it he censures decidedly the antiquated language irregular plots and anachronisms of shakespeare and fletcher but his main strength seems directed against jonson from his works he selects several instances of harsh inelegant and even inaccurate diction in describing manners he claims for the modern writers a decided superiority over the poets of the earlier age when there was less gallantry and when the authors were not admitted to the best society the manners of their low or dutch school of comedy in which jonson led the way by his bartholomew fair and similar pieces are noticed and censured as unfit for a polished audience the characters in what may be termed genteel comedy are reviewed and restricted to the truewit of jonsons silent woman the mercutio of shakespeare and fletchers don john in the chances even this last celebrated character he observes is better carried on in the modern alteration of the play than in fletchers original a singular instance of drydens liberality of criticism since the alteration of the chances was made by that very duke of buckingham from whom he had just received a bitter and personal offence dryden proceeds to contend that the living poets from the example of a gallant king and sprightly court have learned in their comedies a tone of light discourse and raillery in which the solidity of english sense is blended with the air and gaiety of their french neighbours in short that those who call jonsons the golden age of poetry have only this reason that the audience were then content with acorns because they knew not the use of bread in all this criticism there was much undeniable truth but sufficient weight was not given to the excellencies of the old school while their faults were ostentatiously and invidiously enumerated it would seem that dryden perhaps from the rigour of a puritanical education had not studied the ancient dramatic models in his youth and had only begun to read them with attention when it was his object rather to depreciate than to emulate them but the time came when he did due homage to their genius  meanwhile this avowed preference of his own period excited the resentment of the older critics who had looked up to the era of shakespeare as the golden age of poetry and no less that of the playwrights of his own standing who pretended to discover that dryden designed to establish less the reputation of his age than of himself individually upon the ruined fame of the ancient poets they complained that as the wild bull in the vivarambla of granada    monarchlike he ranged the listed field   and some he trampled down and some he killd  many therefore advancing under pretence of vindicating the fame of the ancients gratified their spleen by attacking that of dryden and strove less to combat his criticisms than to criticise his productions we shall have too frequent occasion to observe that there was during the reign of charles ii a semibarbarous virulence of controversy even upon abstract points of literature which would be now thought injudicious and unfair even by the newspaper advocates of contending factions a critic of that time never deemed he had so effectually refuted the reasoning of his adversary as when he had said something disrespectful of his talents person or moral character thus literary contest was embittered by personal hatred and truth was so far from being the object of the combatants that even victory was tasteless unless obtained by the disgrace and degradation of the antagonist this reflection may serve to introduce a short detail of the abusive controversies in which it was drydens lot to be engaged  one of those who most fiercely attacked our authors system and opinions was matthew19 clifford already mentioned as engaged in the rehearsal at what precise time he began his notes upon drydens poems in four letters or how they were originally published is uncertain the last of the letters is dated from the charterhouse 1st july 1672 and is signed with his name probably the others were written shortly before the only edition now known was printed along with some reflections on the hind and panther by another hand tom brown in 1687 if these letters were not actually printed in 1672 they were probably successively made public by transcripts handed about in the coffeehouses which was an usual mode of circulating lampoons and pieces of satire although clifford was esteemed a man of wit and a scholar his style is rude coarse and ungentlemanlike and the criticism is chiefly verbal in the note the reader may peruse an ample specimen of the kind of wit or rather banter employed by this facetious person20 the letters were written successively at different periods for clifford in the last complains that he cannot extort an answer and therefore seems to conceive that his arguments are unanswerable  there were several other pamphlets and fugitive pieces published against dryden at the same time one of them entitled the censure of the rota on mr drydens conquest of granada was printed at oxford in 1673 this was followed by a similar piece entitled a description of the academy of athenian virtuosi with a discourse held there in vindication of mr drydens conquest of granada against the author of the censure of the rota and a third called a friendly vindication of mr dryden from the author of the censure of the rota was printed at cambridge all these appeared previous to the publication of the assignation the first as wood informs us was written by richard leigh educated at queens college oxford where he entered in 1665 and was probably resident when this piece was there published he was afterwards a player in the dukes company but must be carefully distinguished from the celebrated comedian of the same name it seems likely that he wrote also the second tract which is a continuation of the first both are in a frothy flippant style of raillery of which the reader will find a specimen in the note21 the cambridge vindication seems to have been written by a different hand though in the same taste it is singular in bringing a charge against our author which has been urged by no other antagonist for he is there upbraided with exhibiting in his comedies the persons and follies of living characters22  the friends and admirers of dryden did not see with indifference these attacks upon his reputation for he congratulates23 himself upon having found defenders even among strangers alluding probably to a tract by mr charles blount entitled mr dryden vindicated in answer to the friendly vindication of mr dryden with reflections on the rota this piece is written with all the honest enthusiasm of youth in defence of that genius which has excited its admiration in his address to sedley dryden notices these attacks upon him with a supreme degree of contempt24 in other respects the dedication is drawn with the easy indifference of one accustomed to the best society towards the authority of those who presumed to judge of modern manners without having access to see those of the higher circles the picture which it draws of the elegance of the convivial parties of the wits in that gay time has been quoted a few pages higher  i know not if it be here worth while to mention a pretty warfare between dryden and edward ravenscroft25 an unworthy scribbler who wrote plays or rather altered those of shakespeare and imitated those of molière this person whether from a feud which naturally subsisted between the two rival theatres or from envy and dislike to dryden personally chose in the prologue to the citizen turned gentleman acted at the dukes house in 1672 to level some sneers at the heroic drama which affected particularly the conquest of granada then acting with great applause ravenscrofts play which is a bald translation from the bourgeois gentilhomme of molière was successful chiefly owing to the burlesque procession of turks employed to dub the citizen a mamamouchi or paladin dryden with more indignation than the occasion warranted retorted in the prologue to the assignation by the following attack on ravenscrofts jargon and buffoonery    you must have mamamouchi such a fop   as would appear a monster in a shop   hell fill your pit and boxes to the brim   where rammd in crowds you see yourselves in him   sure theres some spell our poet never knew   in hullibabilah de and chu chu chu   but marababah sahem most did touch you   that is oh how we love the mamamouchi   grimace and habit sent you pleased away   you damned the poet and cried up the play  about this time too the actresses in the kings theatre to vary the amusements of the house represented marriage à la mode in mens dresses the prologue and epilogue were furnished by dryden and in the latter mentioning the projected union of the theatres    all the women most devoutly swear   each would be rather a poor actress here   than to be made a mamamouchi there  ravenscroft thus satirised did not fail to exult in the bad success of the assignation and celebrated his triumph in some lines of a prologue to the careless lovers which was acted in the vacation succeeding the ill fate of drydens play they are thrown into the note that the reader may judge how very unworthy this scribbler was of the slightest notice from the pen of dryden26  and with this te deum on the part of ravenscroft ended a petty controversy which gives him his only title to be named in the life of an english classic  from what has been detailed of these disputes we may learn that even at this period the laureates wreath was not unmingled with thorns and that if dryden still maintained his due ascendancy over the common band of authors it was not without being occasionally under the necessity of descending into the arena against very inferior antagonists  in the course of these controversies dryden was not idle though he cannot be said to have been worthily or fortunately employed his muse being lent to the court who were at this time anxious to awake the popular indignation against the dutch it is a characteristic of the english nation that their habitual dislike against their neighbours is soon and easily blown into animosity but although dryden chose for his theme the horrid massacre of amboyna and fell to the task with such zeal that he accomplished it in a month his play was probably of little service to the cause in which it was written the story is too disgusting to produce the legitimate feelings of pity and terror which tragedy should excite the blackhole of calcutta would be as pleasing a subject the character of the hollanders is too grossly vicious and detestable to give the least pleasure they are neither men nor even devils but a sort of lubber fiends compounded of cruelty avarice and brutal debauchery like dutch swabbers possessed by demons but of this play the author has himself admitted that the subject is barren the persons low and the writing not heightened by any laboured scenes and without attempting to contradict this modest description we may dismiss the tragedy of amboyna it was dedicated to lord clifford of chudleigh an active member of the cabal administration of charles ii but who as a catholic on the test act being passed resigned his post of lord high treasurer and died shortly afterwards there is great reason to think that this nobleman had essentially favoured drydens views in life on a former occasion he had termed lord clifford a better maecenas than that of horace27 and in the present dedication he mentions the numerous favours received through so many years as forming one continued act of his patrons generosity and goodness so that the excess of his gratitude had led the poet to receive those benefits as the jews received their law with mute wonder rather than with outward and ceremonious acclamation these sentiments of obligation he continued long after lord cliffords death to express in terms equally glowing28 so that we may safely do this statesmans memory the justice to record him as an active and discerning patron of drydens genius  in the course of 1673 our authors pen was engaged in a task which may be safely condemned as presumptuous though that pen was drydens it was no other than that of newmodelling the paradise lost of milton into a dramatic poem called the state of innocence or the fall of man the coldness with which miltons mighty epic was received upon the first publication is almost proverbial the character of the author obnoxious for his share in the usurped government the turn of the language so different from that of the age the seriousness of a subject so discordant with its lively frivolitiesgave to the authors renown the slowness of growth with the permanency of the oak miltons merit however had not escaped the eye of dryden29 he was acquainted with the author perhaps even before the restoration and who can doubt drydens power of feeling the sublimity of the paradise lost even had he himself not assured us in the prefatory essay to his own piece that he accounts it undoubtedly one of the greatest most noble and most sublime poems which either this age or nation has produced we are therefore to seek for the motive which could have induced him holding this opinion to gild pure gold and set a perfume on the violet dennis has left a curious record upon this subjectdryden he observes in his preface before the state of innocence appears to have been the first those gentlemen excepted whose verses are before miltons poem who discovered in so public a manner an extraordinary opinion of miltons extraordinary merit and yet mr dryden at that time knew not half the extent of his excellence as more than twenty years afterwards he confessed to me and is pretty plain from his writing the state of innocence had he known the full extent of miltons excellence dennis thought he would not have ventured on this undertaking unless he designed to be a foil to him but they he adds who knew mr dryden know very well that he was not of a temper to design to be a foil to any one30 we are therefore to conclude that it was only the hope of excelling his original admirable as he allowed it to be which impelled dryden upon this unprofitable and abortive labour and we are to examine the improvements which dryden seemed to meditate or in other words the differences between his taste and that of milton  and first we may observe that the difference in their situations affected their habits of thinking upon poetical subjects milton had retired into solitude if not into obscurity relieved from everything like external agency either influencing his choice of a subject or his mode of treating it and in consequence instead of looking abroad to consult the opinion of his age he appealed only to the judge which heaven had implanted within him when he was endowed with severity of judgment and profusion of genius but the taste of dryden was not so independent placed by his very office at the head of what was fashionable in literature he had to write for those around him rather than for posterity was to support a brilliant reputation in the eye of the world and is frequently found boasting of his intimacy with those who led the taste of the age and frequently quoting the    tamen me   cum magnis vixisse invita falebitur usque   invidia  it followed that dryden could not struggle against the tide into which he was launched and that although it might be expected from his talents that he should ameliorate the reigning taste or at least carry those compositions which it approved to their utmost pitch of perfection it could not be hoped that he should altogether escape being perverted by it or should soar so superior to all its prejudices as at once to admit the supereminent excellence of a poem which ran counter to these in so many particulars the versification of milton according to the taste of the times was ignoble from its supposed facility dryden was we have seen so much possessed with this prejudice as to pronounce blank verse unfit even for a fugitive paper of verses even in his later and riper judgment he affirms that whatever pretext milton might allege for the use of blank verse his own particular reason is plainly thisthat rhyme was not his talent he had neither the ease of doing it nor the graces of it which is manifest in his juvenilia or verses written in his youth where his rhyme is always constrained and forced and comes hardly from him at an age when the soul is most pliant and the passion of love makes almost every man a rhymer though not a poet  the want of the dignity of rhyme was therefore according to his idea an essential deficiency in the paradise lost according to aubrey dryden communicated to milton his intention of adding this grace to his poem to which the venerable bard gave a contemptuous consent in these words ay you may tag my verses if you will perhaps few have read so far into the state of innocence as to discover that dryden did not use this licence to the uttermost and that several of the scenes are not taggd with rhyme  dryden at this period engaged in a research recommended to him by a noble wit of scotland as he terms sir george mackenzie the issue of which in his apprehension pointed out further room for improving upon the epic of milton this was an inquiry into the turn of words and thoughts requisite in heroic poetry these turns according to the definition and examples which dryden has given us differ from the points of wit and quirks of epigram common in the metaphysical poets and consist in a happy and at the same time a natural recurrence of the same form of expression melodiously varied having failed in his search after these beauties in cowley the darling of his youth i consulted says dryden a greater genius without offence to the manes of that noble author i meanmilton but as he endeavours everywhere to express homer whose age had not arrived to that fineness i found in him a true sublimity lofty thoughts which were clothed with admirable grecisms and ancient words which he had been digging from the mines of chaucer and spenser and which with all their rusticity had somewhat of venerable in them but i found not there neither that for which i looked this judgment addison has proved to be erroneous by quoting from milton the most beautiful example of a turn of words which can be found in english poetry31 but dryden holding it for just conceived doubtless that in his state of innocence he might exert his skill successfully by supplying the supposed deficiency and for relieving those flats of thought which he complains of where milton for a hundred lines together runs on in a track of scripture but which dennis more justly ascribes to the humble nature of his subject in those passages the graces also which dryden ventured to interweave with the lofty theme of milton were rather those of ovid than of virgil rather turns of verbal expression than of thought such is that conceit which met with censure at the time    seraph and cherub careless of their charge   and wanton in full ease now live at large   unguarded leave the passes of the sky   and all dissolved in hallelujahs lie  i have heard said a petulant critic of anchovies dissolved in sauce but never of an angel dissolved in hallelujahs but this raillery dryden rebuffs with a quotation from virgil    invadunt urbem somno vinoque sepultam  it might have been replied that virgils analogy was familiar and simple and that of dryden was farfetched and startling by its novelty the majesty of miltons verse is strangely degraded in the following speeches which precede the rising of pandaemonium some of the couplets are utterly flat and bald and in others the balance of point and antithesis is substituted for the simple sublimity of the original    moloch changed as we are were yet from homage free   we have by hell at least gained liberty   thats worth our fall thus low though we are driven   better to rule in hell than serve in heaven    lucifer there spoke the better half of

a golden palace let be raised on high   to imitate no to outshine the sky   all mines are ours and gold above the rest   let this be done and quick as twas exprest  i fancy the reader is now nearly satisfied with drydens improvements on milton yet some of his alterations have such peculiar reference to the taste and manners of his age that i cannot avoid pointing them out eve is somewhat of a coquette even in the state of innocence she exclaims      from each tree   the feathered kind press down to look on me   the beasts with upcast eyes forsake their shade   and gaze as if i were to be obeyed   sure i am somewhat which they wish to be   and cannoti myself am proud of me  upon receiving adams addresses she expresses rather unreasonably in the circumstances some apprehensions of his infidelity and upon the whole she is considerably too knowing for the primitive state the same may be said of adam whose knowledge in school divinity and use of syllogistic argument dryden though he found it in the original was under no necessity to have retained  the state of innocence as it could not be designed for the stage seems to have been originally intended as a mere poetical prolusion for dryden who was above affecting such a circumstance tells us that it was only made public because in consequence of several hundred copies every one gathering new faults having been dispersed without his knowledge it became at length a libel on the author who was forced to print a correct edition in his own defence as the incidents and language were ready composed by milton we are not surprised when informed that the composition and revision were completed in a single month the critics having assailed the poem even before publication the author has prefixed an essay upon heroic poetry and poetic licence in which he treats chiefly of the use of metaphors and of the legitimacy of machinery  the dedication of the state of innocence addressed to mary of este duchess of york is a singular specimen of what has been since termed the celestial style of inscription it is a strain of flattery in the language of adoration and the elated station of the princess is declared so suited to her excellence that providence has only done justice to its own works in placing the most perfect work of heaven where it may be admired by all beholders even this flight is surpassed by the followingtis true you are above all mortal wishes no man desires impossibilities because they are beyond the reach of nature to hope to be a god is folly exalted into madness but by the laws of our creation we are obliged to adore him and are permitted to love him too at human distance tis the nature of perfection to be attractive but the excellency of the object refines the nature of the love it strikes an impression of awful reverence tis indeed that love which is more properly a zeal than passion tis the rapture which anchorites find in prayer when a beam of the divinity shines upon them that which makes them despise all worldly objects and yet tis all but contemplation they are seldom visited from above but a single vision so transports them that it makes up the happiness of their lives mortality cannot bear it often it finds them in the eagerness and height of their devotion they are speechless for the time that it continues and prostrate and dead when it departs such eulogy was the taste of the days of charles when ladies were deified in dedications and painted as venus or diana upon canvas in our time the elegance of the language would be scarcely held to counterbalance the absurdity of the compliments  lee the dramatic writer an excellent poet though unfortunate in his health and circumstances evinced his friendship for dryden rather than his judgment by prefixing to the state of innocence a copy of verses in which he compliments the author with having refined the ore of milton dryden repaid this favour by an epistle in which he beautifully apologises for the extravagancies of his friends poetry and consoles him for the censure of those cold judges whose blame became praise when they accused the warmth which they were incapable of feeling32  having thus brought the account of our authors productions down to 1674 from which period we date a perceptible change in his taste and mode of composition i have only to add that his private situation was probably altered to the worse by the burning of the kings theatre and the debts contracted in rebuilding it the value of his share in that company must consequently have fallen far short of what it was originally in other respects he was probably nearly in the same condition as in 1672 the critics who assailed his literary reputation had hitherto spared his private character and excepting rochester whose malignity towards dryden now began to display itself he probably had not lost one person whom he had thought worthy to be called a friend lee who seems first to have distinguished

censure of the rota cambridge 1673 mentions his humble and supplicant addresses to men and ladies of honour to whom he presented the most of his plays to be read and so passing through their families

see key to the rehearsal our most noble author to manifest his just indignation and hatred of this fulsome new way of writing used his utmost interest and endeavours to stifle it at its first appearance on the stage by engaging all his friends to explode and run down these plays especially the united kingdoms which had like to have brought his life into danger  the author of it being nobly born of an ancient and numerous family had many of his relations and friends in the cockpit during the acting of it some of them perceiving his grace to head a party who were very active in damning the play by hissing and laughing immoderately at the strange conduct thereof there were persons laid wait for him as he came out but there being a great tumult and uproar in the house and the passages near it he escaped but he was threatened hard however the business was composed in a short time though by what means i have not been informed the trade of criticism was not uniformly safe in these

that of leonidas who is first introduced as the son of a shepherd secondly discovered to be the son of an unlawful king called polydamas thirdly proved anew to be the son of the shepherd and finally proved to be the son of neither of them but of the lawful king theogenes besides the author of the key to the rehearsal points out a parallel between the revolution of state in the farce and that by which leonidas after being carried off to execution on a sudden snatches a sword from one of the guards proclaims himself rightful king and without more ceremony deposes the powerful and jealous usurper who had sentenced him to death  12 spences anecdotes quoted by mr malone vol i p 106  13 i answered not the rehearsal because i knew the author sat to himself when he drew the picture and was

pains which dryden bestowed on the character of zimri and the esteem in which he held it is evident from his quoting it as the masterpiece of his own satire the character of zimri in my absalom is in my opinion worth the whole poem it is not bloody but it is ridiculous enough and he for him it was intended was too witty to resent it as an injury if i had railed i might have suffered for it justly but i managed my own work more happily perhaps more dexterously i avoided the mention of great crimes and applied myself to the representing of blindsides and little extravagancies to which the

explained himself by telling us the heroes were more noble beasts of prey in his epistle to his conquest of granada distinguishing them into wild and tame and in his play we have almanzor shaking his chains and frighting his keeper broke loose and tearing those that would reclaim his rage to this he added that his bulls excelled other heroes as far as his own heroes surpassed his gods that the champion bull was divested of flesh and blood and made immortal by the poet and bellowed after death that the fantastic bull seemed fiercer than the true and the dead bellowings in verse were louder

opposition to the court  the state of innocence was published in 1674 and aurengzebe drydens next tragedy appeared in 1675 in the interval he informs us his ardour for rhyming plays had considerably abated the course of study which he imposed on himself doubtless led him to this conclusion but it is also possible that he found the peculiar facilities of that drama had excited the emulation of very inferior poets who by dint of show rant and clamorous hexameters were likely to divide with him the public favour before proceeding therefore to state the gradual alteration in drydens own taste we must perform the task of detailing the literary quarrels in which he was at this period engaged the chief of his rivals was elkanah settle a person afterwards utterly contemptible but who first by the strength of a party at court and afterwards by a faction in the state was for a time buoyed up in opposition to dryden it is impossible to detail the progress of the contest for public favour between these two illmatched rivals without noticing at the same time drydens quarrel with rochester who appears to have played off settle in opposition to him as absolutely and nearly as successfully as settle ever played off the literary literal puppets for which in the ebb of his fortune he wrote dramas  in the year 1673 dryden and rochester were on such friendly terms that our poet inscribed to his lordship his favourite play of marriage à la mode not without acknowledgment of the deepest gratitude for favours done to his fortune and reputation the dedication we have seen was so favourably accepted by rochester that the reception called forth a second tribute of thanks from the poet to the patron but at this point the interchange of kindness and of civility received a sudden and irrecoverable check this was partly owing to rochesters fickle and jealous temper which induced him alternately to raise and depress the men of parts whom he loved to patronise so that no one should ever become independent of his favour or so rooted in the public opinion as to be beyond the reach of his satire but it may also in part be attributed to drydens attachment to sheffield earl of mulgrave afterwards duke of buckingham then rochesters rival in wit and courtfavour and from whom he had sustained a deadly affront on an occasion which as the remote cause of a curious incident in drydens life i have elsewhere detailed in the words of sheffield himself rochester who was branded as a coward in consequence of this transaction must be reasonably supposed to entertain a sincere hatred against mulgrave with whom he had once lived on such friendly terms as to inscribe to him an epistle on their mutual poems but as his nerves had proved unequal to a personal conflict with his brother peer his malice prompted the discharge of his spleen upon those men of literature whom his antagonist cherished and patronised among these dryden held a distinguished situation for about 1675 he was as we shall presently see sufficiently in sheffields confidence to correct and revise that noblemans poetry1 and in 1676 dedicated to him the tragedy of aurengzebe as one who enjoyed not only his favour but his love and conversation thus dryden was obnoxious to rochester both as holding a station among the authors of the period grievous to the vanity of one who aimed by a levelling and dividing system to be the tyrant or at least the dictator of wit and also as the friend and even the confidant of mulgrave by whom the witty profligate had been baffled and humiliated dryden was therefore to be lowered in the public opinion and for this purpose rochester made use of elkanah settle whom though he gratified his malice by placing him in opposition to dryden he must in his heart have thoroughly despised2  this playwright whom the jealous spleen of a favourite courtier and the misjudging taste of a promiscuous audience placed for some time in so high a station came into notice in 1671 on the representation of his first play cambyses king of persia which was played six nights successively this run of public favour gave rochester some pretence to bring settle to the notice of the king and through the efforts of this mischievous wit joined to the natural disposition of the people to be carried by show rant and tumult settles second play the empress of morocco was acted with unanimous and overpowering applause for a month together to add to drydens mortification rochester had interest enough to have this tragedy of one whom he had elevated into the rank of his rival first acted at whitehall by the lords and ladies of the court an honour which had never been paid to any of drydens compositions however more justly entitled to it both from intrinsic merit and by the authors situation as poetlaureate rochester contributed a prologue upon this brilliant occasion to add still more grace to settles triumph but what seems yet more extraordinary and has i think been unnoticed in all accounts of the controversy mulgrave3 rochesters rival and the friend of dryden did the same homage to the empress of morocco from the kings private theatre the empress of morocco was transferred in all its honours to the public stage in dorset gardens and received with applause corresponding to the expectation excited by its favour at whitehall while the court and city were thus worshipping the idol which rochester had set up it could hardly be expected of poor settle that he should be first to discern his own want of desert on the contrary he grew presumptuous on success and when he printed his performance the dedication to the earl of norwich was directly levelled against the poetlaureate who termed it the most arrogant calumniatory illmannered and senseless preface he ever saw4 and to add gall to bitterness the bookseller thought the empress of morocco worthy of being decorated with engravings and sold at the advanced price of two shillings being the first drama advanced to such honourable distinction5 moreover the play is ostentatiously stated in the title to be written by elkanah settle servant to his majesty6 an addition which the laureate had assumed with greater propriety  if we are asked the merit of a performance which made such an impression at the time we may borrow an expression applied to a certain orator7 and say that the empress of morocco must have acted to the tune of a good heroic play it had all the outward and visible requisites of splendid scenery prisons palaces fleets combats of desperate duration and uncertain issue8 assassinations a dancing tree a rainbow a shower of hail a criminal executed9 and hell itself opening upon the stage the rhyming dialogue too in which the play was written had an imperative and tyrannical sound and to a foreigner ignorant of the language might have appeared as magnificent as that of dryden but it must raise our admiration that the witty court of charles could patiently listen to a tale told by an idiot full of noise and fury signifying nothing and give it a preference over the poetry of dryden the following description of a hailstorm will vindicate our wonder    this morning as our eyes we upward cast   the desert regions of the air lay waste   but straight as if it had some penance bore   a mourning garb of thick black clouds it wore   but on the sudden   some aery demon changed its form and now   that which looked black above looked white below   the clouds dishevelled from their crusted locks   something like gems coined out of crystal rocks   the ground was with this strange bright issue spread   as if heaven in affront to nature had   designed some newfound tillage of its own   and on the earth these unknown seeds had sown   of these i reached a grain which to my sense   appeared as cool as virgininnocence   and like that too which chiefly i admired   its ravished whiteness with a touch expired   at the approach of heat this candid rain   dissolved to its first element again    mulyh though showers of hail morocco never see   dull priest what does all this portend to me    ham it does portend    muly what    ham that the fates design    muly to tire me with impertinence like thine  such were the strains once preferred to the magnificent verses of dryden whose very worst bombast is sublimity compared to them to prove which the reader need only peruse the indians account of the spanish fleet in the indian emperor to which the above lines are a parallel each being the description of an object familiar to the audience but new to the describer the poet felt the disgraceful preference more deeply than was altogether becoming but he had levelled his powers says johnson when he levelled his desires to those of settle and placed his happiness in the claps of multitudes the moral may be carried yet further for had not dryden stooped to call to the aid of his poetry the auxiliaries of scenery gilded truncheons and verse of more noise than meaning it is impossible his plays could have been drawn into comparison with those of settle but the meretricious ornaments which he himself had introduced were within the reach of the meanest capacity and having been among the first to debauch the taste of the public it was retributive justice that he should experience their inconstancy indeed dryden seems himself to admit that the principal difference between his heroic plays and the empress of morocco was that the former were good sense that looked like nonsense and the latter nonsense which yet looked very like sense a nice distinction and which argued some regret at having opened the way to such a rival  the feelings of contempt ought to have suppressed those of anger but dryden who professedly lived to please his own age had not temper to wait till time should do him justice angry he was and unfortunately he determined to shew the world that he did well in being so with this view in conjunction with shadwell and crowne two brotherdramatists equally jealous of settles success he composed a pamphlet entitled remarks upon the empress of morocco this piece is written in the same tone of boisterous and vulgar raillery with which clifford and leigh had assailed dryden himself and little resembles our poets general style of controversy he seems to have exchanged his satirical scourge for the clumsy flail of shadwell when he stooped to use such raillery as the following description of settle in short he is an animal of a most deplored understanding without reading and conversation his being is in a twilight of sense and some glimmering of thought which he can never fashion either into wit or english his style is boisterous and roughhewn his rhyme incorrigibly lewd and his numbers perpetually harsh and illsounding  settle nothing dismayed with this vehement attack manfully retorted the abuse which had been thrown upon him and answered the insulting clamour of his three antagonists with clamorous insult10 it was obvious that the weaker poet must be the winner by this contest in abuse and dryden gained no more by his dispute with settle than a welldressed man who should condescend to wrestle with a chimneysweeper the feud between them was carried no further until after the publication of absalom and achitophel party animosity added spurs to literary rivalry  we must now return to rochester who observing settles rise to his unmerited elevation in the public opinion became as anxious to lower his presumption as he had formerly been to diminish the reputation of dryden with this view that tyrannical person of honour availed himself of his credit to recommend crowne to write the masque of calisto which was acted by the lords and ladies of the court of charles in 1675 nothing could be more galling towards dryden a part of whose duty as poetlaureate was to compose the pieces designed for such occasions crowne though he was a tolerable comic writer11 had no turn whatever for tragedy or indeed for poetry of any kind but the splendour of the scenery and dresses the quality of the performers selected from the first nobility and the favour of the sovereign gave calisto a run of nearly thirty nights dryden though mortified tendered his services in the shape of an epilogue to be spoken by lady henrietta maria wentworth12 but the influence of his enemy rochester was still predominant and the epilogue of the laureate was rejected13  the author of calisto also lost his credit with rochester so soon as he became generally popular and shortly after the representation of that piece its fickle patron seems to have recommended to the royal protection a rival more formidable to dryden than either settle or starch johnny crowne14 this was no other than otway whose don carlos appeared in 1676 and was hailed as one of the best heroic plays which had been written the author avows in his preface the obligations he owed to rochester who had recommended him to the king and the duke to whose favour he owed his good success and on whose indulgence he reckoned as insuring that of his next attempt15 these effusions of gratitude did not as mr malone observes withhold rochester shortly after from lampooning otway with circumstances of gross insult in the session of the poets16 in the same preface otway in very intelligible language bade defiance to dryden whom he charges with having spoken slightly of his play17 but although dryden did not admire the general structure of otways poetry he is said even at this time to have borne witness to his power of moving the passions an acknowledgment which he long afterwards solemnly repeated thus otway like many others mistook the character of a pretended friend and did injustice to that of a liberal rival dryden and he indeed never appear to have been personal friends even when they both wrote in the tory interest it was probably about this time that otway challenged settle whose courage appears to have failed him upon the occasion  rochester was not content with exciting rivals against dryden in the public opinion but assailed him personally in an imitation of horace which he quaintly entitled an allusion to the tenth satire it came out anonymously about 1678 but the town was at no loss to guess that rochester was the patron or author much of the satire was bestowed on dryden whom rochester for the first time distinguishes by a ridiculous nickname which was afterwards echoed by imitating dunces in all their lampoons the lines are more cutting because mingled with as much praise as the writer probably thought necessary to gain the credit of a candid critic18 dryden on his part did not view with indifference these repeated direct and indirect attacks on his literary reputation by rochester in the preface to all for love published in 1678 he gives a severe rebuke to those men of rank who having acquired the credit of wit either by virtue of their quality or by common fame and finding themselves possessed of some smattering of latin become ambitious to distinguish themselves by their poetry from the herd of gentlemen and is not this he exclaims a wretched affectation not to be contented with what fortune has done for them and sit down quietly with their estates but they must call their wits in question and needlessly expose their nakedness to public view not considering that they are not to expect the same approbation from sober men which they have found from their flatterers after the third bottle if a little glittering in discourse has passed them on us for witty men where was the necessity of undeceiving the world would a man who has an ill title to an estate but yet is in possession of it would he bring it of his own accord to be tried at westminster we who write if we want the talent yet have the excuse that we do it for a poor subsistence but what can be urged in their defence who not having the vocation of poverty to scribble out of mere wantonness take pains to make themselves ridiculous horace was certainly in the right where he said that no man is satisfied with his own condition a poet is not pleased because he is not rich and the rich are discontented because the poets will not admit them of their number thus the case is hard with writers if they succeed not they must starve and if they do some malicious satire is prepared to level them for daring to please without their leave but while they are so eager to destroy the fame of others their ambition is manifest in their concernment some poem of their own is to be produced and the slaves are to be laid flat with their faces on the ground that the monarch may appear in the greater majesty this general censure of the persons of wit and honour about town is fixed on rochester in particular not only by the marked allusion in the last sentence to the despotic tyranny which he claimed over the authors of his time but also by a direct attack upon such imitators of horace who make doggrel of his latin misapply his censures and often contradict their own it is remarkable however that he ascribes this imitation rather to some zany of the great than to one of their number and seems to have thought rochester rather the patron than the author  at the expense of anticipating the order of events and that we may bring drydens dispute with rochester to a conclusion we must recall to the readers recollection our authors friendship with mulgrave this appears to have been so intimate that in 1675 that nobleman intrusted him with the task of revising his essay upon satire a poem which contained dishonourable mention of many courtiers of the time and was particularly severe on sir car scrope and rochester the last of these is taxed with cowardice and a thousand odious and mean vices upbraided with the grossness and scurrility of his writings and with the infamous profligacy of his life19 the versification of the poem is as flat and inharmonious as the plan is careless and illarranged and though the imputation was to cost dryden dear i cannot think that any part of the essay on satire received additions from his pen probably he might contribute a few hints for revision but the author of absalom and achitophel could never completely disguise the powers which were shortly to produce that brilliant satire drydens verses must have shone among mulgraves as gold beside copper the whole essay is a mere stagnant level no one part of it so far rising above the rest as to bespeak the work of a superior hand the thoughts even when conceived with some spirit are clumsily and unhappily brought out a fault never to be traced in the beautiful language of dryden whose powers of expression were at least equal to his force of conception besides as mr malone has observed he had now brought to the highest excellence his system of versification and is it possible he could neglect it so far as to write the rugged lines in the note where all manner of elliptical barbarisms are resorted to for squeezing the words into a measure lame and oerburdened and screaming its wretchedness the essay on satire was finally subjected by the noble author to the criticism of pope who less scrupulous than dryden appears to have made large improvements but after having undergone the revision of two of the first names in english poetry it continues to be a very indifferent performance  in another point of view it seems inconsistent with drydens situation to suppose he had any active share in the essay on satire the character of charles is treated with great severity as well as those of the duchesses of portsmouth and cleveland the royal mistresses this was quite consistent with mulgraves disposition who was at this time discontented with the ministry but certainly would not have beseemed dryden who held an office at court sedley also with whom dryden always seems to have lived on friendly terms is harshly treated in the essay on satire it may be owned however that these reasons were not held powerful at the time since they must in that case have saved dryden from the inconvenient suspicion which we will presently see attached to him the public were accustomed to see the friendship of wits end in mutual satire and the goodnatured charles was so generally the subject of the ridicule which he loved that no one seems to have thought there was improbability in a libel being composed on him by his own laureate  the essay on satire though written as appears from the titlepage of the last edition in 1675 was not made public until 1679 when several copies were handed about in manuscript rochester sends one of these to his friend henry saville on the 21st of november 1679 with this observationi have sent you herewith a libel in which my own share is not the least the king having perused it is no way dissatisfied with his the author is apparently mr dryden his patron lord mulgrave having a panegyric in the midst from hence it is evident that dryden obtained the reputation of being the author in consequence of which rochester meditated the base and cowardly revenge which he afterwards executed and he thus coolly expressed his intention in another of his lettersyou write me word that im out of favour with a certain poet whom i have admired for the disproportion of him and his attributes he is a rarity which i cannot but be fond of as one would be of a hog that could fiddle or a singing owl if he falls on me at the blunt which is his very good weapon in wit i will forgive him if you please and leave the repartee to black will with a cudgel  in pursuance of this infamous resolution dryden upon the night of the 18th december 1679 was waylaid by hired ruffians and severely beaten as he passed through rosestreet coventgarden returning from wills coffeehouse to his own house in gerrardstreet a reward of £50 was in vain offered in the london gazette and other newspapers for the discovery of the perpetrators of this outrage20 the town was however at no loss to pitch upon rochester as the employer of the bravoes with whom the public suspicion joined the duchess of portsmouth equally concerned in the supposed affront thus avenged in our time were a nobleman to have recourse to hired bravoes to avenge his personal quarrel against any one more especially a person holding the rank of a gentleman he might lay his account with being hunted out of society but in the age of charles the ancient high and chivalrous sense of honour was esteemed quixotic and the civil war had left traces of ferocity in the manners and sentiments of the people rencounters where the assailants took all advantages of number and weapons were as frequent and held as honourable as regular duels some of these approached closely to assassination as in the famous case of sir john coventry who was waylaid and had his nose slit by some young men of high rank for a reflection upon the kings theatrical amours this occasioned the famous statute against maiming and wounding called the coventry act an act highly necessary since so far did our ancestors ideas of manly forbearance differ from ours that killigrew introduces the hero of one of his comedies a cavalier and the fine gentleman of the piece lying in wait for and slashing the face of a poor courtezan who had cheated him21 it will certainly be admitted that a man surprised in the dark and beaten by ruffians loses no honour by such a misfortune but if dryden had received the same discipline from rochesters own hand without resenting it his drubbing could not have been more frequently made a matter of reproach to hima sign surely of the penury of subjects for satire in his life and character since an accident which might have happened to the greatest hero who ever lived was resorted to as an imputation on his honour the rosealley ambuscade became almost proverbial22 and even mulgrave the real author of the satire and upon whose shoulders the blows ought in justice to have descended mentions the circumstance in his art of poetry with a cold and selfsufficient complacent sneer    though praised and punished for anothers rhymes   his own deserve as great applause sometimes  to which is added in a note a libel for which he was both applauded and wounded though entirely ignorant of the whole matter this flat and conceited couplet and note the noble author judged it proper to omit in the corrected edition of his poem otway alone no longer the friend of rochester and perhaps no longer the enemy of dryden has spoken of the author of this dastardly outrage with the contempt his cowardly malice deserved    poets in honour of the truth should write   with the same spirit brave men for it fight   and though against him causeless hatreds rise   and daily where he goes of late he spies   the scowls of sullen and revengeful eyes   tis what he knows with much contempt to bear   and serves a cause too good to let him fear   he fears no poison from incensed drab   no ruffians fivefoot sword nor rascals stab   nor any other snares of mischief laid   not a rosealley cudgel ambuscade   from any private cause where malice reigns   or general pique all blockheads have to brains  it does not appear that dryden ever thought it worth his while to take revenge on rochester and the only allusion to him in his writings may be found in the essay prefixed to the translation of juvenal where he is mentioned as a man of quality whose ashes our author was unwilling to disturb and who had paid dorset to whom that piece is inscribed the highest compliment which his selfsufficiency could afford to any one perhaps dryden remembered rochester among others when in the same piece he takes credit for resisting opportunities and temptation to take revenge even upon those by whom he had been notoriously and wantonly provoked23  the detail of these quarrels has interrupted our account of drydens writings which we are now to resume  aurengzebe was his first performance after the failure of the assignation it was acted in 1675 with general applause aurengzebe is a heroic or rhyming play but not cast in a mould quite so romantic as the conquest of granada there is a grave and moral turn in many of the speeches which brings it nearer the style of a french tragedy it is true the character of moral borders upon extravagance but a certain licence has been always given to theatrical tyrants and we excuse bombast in him more readily than in almanzor there is perhaps some reason for this indulgence the possession of unlimited power vested in active and mercurial characters naturally drives them to an extravagant indulgence of passion bordering upon insanity and it follows that their language must outstrip the modesty of nature propriety of diction in the drama is relative and to be referred more to individual character than to general rules to make a tyrant soberminded is to make a madman rational but this discretion must be used with great caution by the writer lest he should confound the terrible with the burlesque two great actors kynaston and booth differed in their style of playing morat  the former who was the original performer and doubtless had his instructions from the author gave full force to the sentiments of avowed and barbarous vainglory which mark the character when he is determined to spare aurengzebe and nourmahal pleads    twill not be safe to let him live an hour  kynaston gave all the stern and haughty insolence of despotism to his answer    ill dot to show my arbitrary power24  but booth with modest caution avoided marking and pressing upon the audience a sentiment hovering between the comic and terrible however consonant to the character by whom it was delivered the principal incident in aurengzebe was suggested by king charles himself the tragedy is dedicated to mulgrave whose patronage had been so effectual as to introduce dryden and his poetical schemes to the peculiar notice of the king and duke the dedication and the prologue of this piece throw considerable light upon these plans as well as upon the revolution which had gradually taken place in drydens dramatic taste  during the space which occurred between writing the conquest of granada and aurengzebe our authors researches into the nature and causes of harmony of versification been unremitted and he had probably already collected the materials of his intended english prosodia besides this labour he had been engaged in a closer and more critical examination of the ancient english poets than he had before bestowed upon them these studies seem to have led dryden to two conclusions first that the drama ought to be emancipated from the fetters of rhyme and secondly that he ought to employ the system of versification which he had now perfected to the more legitimate purpose of epic poetry each of these opinions merits consideration  however hardily dryden stood forward in defence of the heroic plays he confessed even in the heat of argument that rhyme though he was brave and generous and his dominion pleasing had still somewhat of the usurper in him a more minute inquiry seems to have still further demonstrated the weakness of this usurped dominion and our authors good taste and practice speedily pointed out deficiencies and difficulties which sir robert howard against whom he defended the use of rhyme could not show because he never aimed at the excellencies which they impeded the perusal of shakespeare on whom dryden had now turned his attention led him to feel that something further might be attained in tragedy than the expression of exaggerated sentiment in smooth verse and that the scene ought to represent not a fanciful set of agents exerting their superhuman faculties in a fairyland of the poets own creation but human characters acting from the direct and energetic influence of human passions with whose emotions the audience might sympathise because akin to the feelings of their own hearts when dryden had once discovered that fear and pity were more likely to be excited by other causes than the logic of metaphysical love or the dictates of fantastic honour he must have found that rhyme sounded as unnatural in the dialogue of characters drawn upon the usual scale of humanity as the plate and mail of chivalry would have appeared on the persons of the actors the following lines of the prologue to aurengzebe although prefixed to a rhyming play the last which he ever wrote express drydens change of sentiment on these points    our author by experience finds it true   tis much more hard to please himself than you   and out of no feigned modesty this day   damns his laborious trifle of a play   not that its worse than what before he writ   but he has now another taste of wit   and to confess a truth though out of time   grows weary of his longloved mistress rhyme   passions too fierce to be in fetters bound   and nature flies him like enchanted ground   what verse can do he has performed in this   which he presumes the most correct of his   but spite of all his pride a secret shame   invades his breast at shakespeares sacred name   awed when he hears his godlike romans rage   he in a just despair would quit the stage   and to an age less polished more unskilled   does with disdain the foremost honours yield  it is remarkable as a trait of character that though our author admitted his change of opinion on this long disputed point he would not consent that it should be imputed to any arguments which his opponents had the wit to bring against him on this subject he enters a protest in the preface to his revised edition of the essay of dramatic poesy in 1684i confess i find many things in this discourse which i do not now approve my judgment being not a little altered since the writing of it but whether for the better or the worse i know not neither indeed is it much material in an essay where all i have said is problematical for the way of writing plays in verse which i have seemed to favour i have since that time laid the practice of it aside till i have more leisure because i find it troublesome and slow but i am no way altered from my opinion of it at least with any reasons which have opposed it for your lordship may easily observe that none are very violent against it but those who either have not attempted it or who have succeeded ill in their attempt25 thus cautious was dryden in not admitting a victory even in a cause which he had surrendered  but although the poet had admitted that with powers of versification superior to those possessed by any earlier english author and a taste corrected by the laborious study both of the language and those who had used it he found rhyme unfit for the use of the drama he at the same time discovered a province where it might be employed in all its splendour we have the mortification to learn from the dedication of aurengzebe that dryden only wanted encouragement to enter upon the composition of an epic poem and to abandon the thriftless task of writing for the promiscuous audience of the theatrea task which rivalled as he had lately been by crowne and settle he most justly compares to the labour of sisyphus his plot he elsewhere explains was to be founded either upon the story of arthur or of edward the black prince and he mentions it to mulgrave in the following remarkable passage which argues great dissatisfaction with dramatic labour arising perhaps from a combined feeling of the bad taste of rhyming plays the degrading dispute with settle and the failure of the assignation his last theatrical attemptif i must be condemned to rhyme i should find some ease in my change of punishment i desire to be no longer the sisyphus of the stage to roll up a stone with endless labour which to follow the proverb gathers no moss and which is perpetually falling down again i never thought myself very fit for an employment where many of my predecessors have excelled me in all kinds and some of my contemporaries even in my own partial judgment have outdone me in comedy some little hopes i have yet remaining and those too considering my abilities may be vain that i may make the world some part of amends for my ill plays by an heroic poem your lordship has been long acquainted with my design the subject of which you know is great the story english and neither too far distant from the present age nor too near approaching it such it is in my opinion that i could not have wished a nobler occasion to do honour by it to my king my country and my friends most of our ancient nobility being concerned in the action and your lordship has one particular reason to promote this undertaking because you were the first who gave me the opportunity of discoursing it to his majesty and his royal highness they were then pleased both to commend the design and to encourage it by their commands but the unsettledness of my condition has hitherto put a stop to my thoughts concerning it as i am no successor to homer in his wit so neither do i desire to be in his poverty i can make no rhapsodies nor go a begging at the grecian doors while i sing the praises of their ancestors the times of virgil please me better because he had an augustus for his patron and to draw the allegory nearer you i am sure i shall not want a maecenas with him it is for your lordship to stir up that remembrance in his majesty which his many avocations of business have caused him i fear to lay aside and as himself and his royal brother are the heroes of the poem to represent to them the images of their warlike predecessors as achilles is said to be roused to glory with the sight of the combat before the ships for my own part i am satisfied to have offered the design and it may be to the advantage of my reputation to have it refused me26  dr johnson and mr malone remark that dryden observes a mystery concerning the subject of his intended epic to prevent the risk of being anticipated as he finally was by sir richard blackmore on the topic of arthur this as well as other passages in drydens life allows us the pleasing indulgence of praising the decency of our own time were an author of distinguished merit to announce his having made choice of a subject for a large poem the writer would have more than common confidence who should venture to forestall his labours but in the seventeenth century such an intimation would it seems have been an instant signal for the herd of scribblers to souse upon it like the harpies on the feast of the trojans and leave its mangled relics too polluted for the use of genius    turba sonans praedam pedibus circumvolat uncis   polluit ore dopes    semesam praedam et vestigia foeda relinquunt   aurengzebe was followed in 1678 by all for love the only play dryden ever wrote for himself the rest he says were given to the people the habitual study of shakespeare which seems lately to have occasioned at least greatly aided the revolution in his taste induced him among a crowd of emulous shooters to try his strength in this bow of ulysses i have in some preliminary remarks to the play endeavoured to point out the difference between the manner of these great artists in treating the misfortunes of antony and cleopatra27 if these are just we must allow dryden the praise of greater regularity of plot and a happier combination of scene but in sketching the character of antony he loses the majestic and heroic tone which shakespeare has assigned him there is too much of the lovelorn knighterrant and too little of the roman warrior in drydens hero the love of antony however overpowering and destructive in its effects ought not to have resembled the love of a sighing swain of arcadia this error in the original conception of the character must doubtless be ascribed to drydens habit of romantic composition montezuma and almanzor were like the prophets image formed of a mixture of iron and clay of stern and rigid demeanour to all the universe but unbounded devotion to the ladies of their affections in antony the first class of attributes are discarded he has none of that tumid and outrageous dignity which characterised the heroes of the rhyming plays and in its stead is gifted with even more than an usual share of devoted attachment to his mistress28 in the preface dryden piques himself upon venturing to introduce the quarrelling scene between octavia and cleopatra which a french writer would have rejected as contrary to the decorum of the theatre but our authors idea of female character was at all times low and the coarse indecent violence which he has thrown into the expressions of a queen and a roman matron is misplaced and disgusting and contradicts the general and wellfounded observation on the address and selfcommand with which even women of ordinary dispositions can veil mutual dislike and hatred and the extreme keenness with which they can arm their satire while preserving all the external forms of civil demeanour but dryden more than redeemed this error in the scene between antony and ventidius which he himself preferred to any that he ever wrote and perhaps with justice if we except that between dorax and sebastian both are avowedly written in imitation of the quarrel between brutus and cassius all for love was received by the public with universal applause its success with that of aurengzebe gave fresh lustre to the authors reputation which had been somewhat tarnished by the failure of the assignation and the rise of so many rival dramatists we learn from the players petition to the lord chamberlain that all for love was of service to the authors fortune as well as to his fame as he was permitted the benefit of a third night in addition to his profits as a sharer with the company29 the play was dedicated to the earl of danby then a minister in high power but who in the course of a few months was disgraced and imprisoned at the suit of the commons as danby was a great advocate for prerogative dryden fails not to approach him with an encomium on monarchical government as regulated and circumscribed by law in reprobating the schemes of those innovators who surfeiting on happiness endeavoured to persuade their fellowsubjects to risk a change he has a pointed allusion to the earl of shaftesbury who having left the royal councils in disgrace was now at the head of the popular faction  in 1678 drydens next play a comedy entitled limberham was acted at dorsetgarden theatre but was endured for three nights only it was designed the author informs us as a satire on the crying sin of keeping and the crime for which it suffered was that it expressed too much of the vice which it decried grossly indelicate as this play still is it would seem from the dedication to lord vaughan that much which offended on the stage was altered or omitted in the press30 yet more than enough remains to justify the sentence pronounced against it by the public mr malone seems to suppose shaftesburys party had some share in its fate supposing that the character of limberham had reference to their leader yet surely although shaftesbury was ridiculous for aiming at gallantry from which his age and personal infirmity should have deterred him dryden would never have drawn the witty artful politician as a silly henpecked cully besides dryden was about this time supposed even himself to have some leaning to the popular cause a supposition irreconcilable with his caricaturing the foibles of shaftesbury  the tragedy of oedipus was written by dryden in conjunction with lee the entire first and third acts were the work of our author who also arranged the general plan and corrected the whole piece having offered some observations31 elsewhere upon this play and the mode in which its celebrated theme has been treated by the dramatists of different nations i need not here resume the subject the time of the first representation is fixed to the beginning of the playing season in winter 16789 although it was not printed until 167932 both limberham and oedipus were acted at the dukes theatre so that it would seem that our author was relieved from his contract with the kings house probably because the shares were so much diminished in value that his appointment was now no adequate compensation for his labour the managers of the kings company complained to the lord chamberlain and endeavoured as we have seen by pleading upon the contract to assert their right to the play of oedipus33 but their claim to reclaim the poet and the play appears to have been set aside and dryden continued to give his performances to the dukes theatre until the union of the two companies  dryden was now to do a new homage to shakespeare by refitting for the stage the play of troilus and cressida which the author left in a state of strange imperfection resembling more a chronicle or legend than a dramatic piece yet it may be disputed whether dryden has greatly improved it even in the particulars which he censures in his original his plot though more artificial is at the same time more trite than that of shakespeare the device by which troilus is led to doubt the constancy of cressida is much less natural than that she should have been actually inconstant her vindication by suicide is a clumsy as well as a hackneyed expedient and there is too much drum and trumpet in the grand finale where troilus and diomede fight and both parties engage at the same time the trojans make the greeks retire and troilus makes diomede give ground and hurts him trumpets sound achilles enters with his myrmidons on the backs of the trojans who fight in a ring encompassed round troilus singling diomede gets him down and kills him and achilles kills troilus upon him all the trojans die upon the place troilus last such a bellum internecinum can never be waged to advantage upon the stage one extravagant passage in this play serves strongly to evince drydens rooted dislike to the clergy troilus exclaims    that i should trust the daughter of a priest   priesthood that makes a merchandise of heaven   priesthood that sells even to their prayers and blessings   and forces us to pay for our own cozenage    thersites nay cheats heaven too with entrails and with offals   gives it the garbage of a sacrifice   and keeps the best for private luxury    troilus thou hast deserved thy life for cursing priests   let me embrace thee thou art beautiful   that back that nose those eyes are beautiful   live thou art honest for thou hatst a priest  dryden prefixed to troilus and cressida his excellent remarks on the grounds of criticism in tragedy giving up with dignified indifference the faults even of his own pieces when they contradict the rules his later judgment had adopted how much his taste had altered since his essay of dramatic poesy or at least since his remarks on heroic plays will appear from the following abridgment of his new maxims the plot according to these remarks ought to be simply and naturally detailed from its commencement to its conclusiona rule which excluded the crowded incidents of the spanish drama and the personages ought to be dignified and virtuous that their misfortunes might at once excite pity and terror the plots of shakespeare and fletcher are meted by this rule and pronounced inferior in mechanic regularity to those of ben jonson the character of the agents or persons are next to be considered and it is required that their manner shall be at once marked dramatic consistent and natural and here the supereminent power of shakespeare in displaying the manners bent and inclination of his characters is pointed out to the readers admiration the copiousness of his invention and his judgment in sustaining the ideas which he started are illustrated by referring to caliban a creature of the fancy begot by an incubus upon a witch and furnished with a person language and character befitting his pedigree on both sides the passions are then considered as included in the manners and dryden at once and peremptorily condemns both the extravagance of language which substitutes noise for feeling and those points and turns of wit which misbecome one actuated by real and deep emotion he candidly gives an example of the last error from his own montezuma who pursued by his enemies and excluded from the fort describes his situation in a long simile taken besides from the sea which he had only heard of for the first time in the first act as a description of natural passion the famous procession of king richard in the train of the fortunate usurper is quoted in justice to the divine author from these just and liberal rules of criticism it is easy to discover that dryden had already adopted a better taste and was disgusted with comedies where the entertainment arose from bustling incident and tragedies where sounding verse was substituted for the delineation of manners and expression of feeling these opinions he pointedly expresses in the prologue to troilus and cressida which was spoken by betterton representing the ghost of shakespeare    see my loved britons see your shakespeare rise   an awful ghost confessed to human eyes   unnamed methinks distinguished i had been   from other shades by this eternal green   about whose wreaths the vulgar poets strive   and with a touch their withered bays revive   untaught unpractised in a barbarous age   i found not but created first the stage   and if i drained no greek or latin store   twas that my own abundance gave me more   on foreign trade i needed not rely   like fruitful britain rich without supply   in this my roughdrawn play you shall behold   some masterstrokes so manly and so bold   that he who meant to alter found em such   he shook and thought it sacrilege to touch   now where are the successors to my name   what bring they to fill out a poets fame   weak shortlived issues of a feeble age   scarce living to be christened on the stage   for humour farce for love they rhyme dispense   that tolls the knell for their departed sense  it is impossible to read these lines remembering drydens earlier opinions without acknowledging the truth of the ancient proverb magna est veritas et praevalebit  the spanish friar our authors most successful comedy succeeded troilus and cressida without repeating the remarks which are prefixed to the play in the present edition34 we may briefly notice that in the tragic scenes our author has attained that better strain of dramatic poetry which he afterwards evinced in sebastian in the comic part the wellknown character of father dominic though the conception only embodies the abstract idea which the ignorant and prejudiced fanatics of the day formed to themselves of a romish priest is brought out and illustrated with peculiar spirit the gluttony avarice debauchery and meanness of dominic are qualified with the talent and wit necessary to save him from being utterly detestable and from the beginning to the end of the piece these qualities are so happily tinged with insolence hypocrisy and irritability that they cannot be mistaken for the avarice debauchery gluttony and meanness of any other profession than that of a bad churchman in the tragic plot we principally admire the general management of the opening and chiefly censure the coldblooded barbarity and perfidy of the young queen in instigating the murder of the deposed sovereign and then attempting to turn the guilt on her accomplice i fear dryden here forgot his own general rule that the tragic hero and heroine should have so much virtue as to entitle their distress to the tribute of compassion altogether however the spanish friar in both its parts is an interesting and almost a fascinating play although the tendency even of the tragic scenes is not laudable and the comedy though more decent in language is not less immoral in tendency than was usual in that loose age  dryden attached considerable importance to the art with which the comic and tragic scenes of the spanish friar are combined and in doing so he has received the sanction of dr johnson indeed as the ardour of his mind ever led him to prize that task most highly on which he had most lately employed his energy he has affirmed in the dedication to the spanish friar that there was an absolute necessity for combining two actions in tragedy for the sake of variety the truth is he adds the audience are grown weary of continued melancholy scenes and i dare venture to prophesy that few tragedies except those in verse shall succeed in this age if they are not lightened with a course of mirth for the feast is too dull and solemn without the fiddles the necessity of the relief alluded to may be admitted without allowing that we must substitute either the misplaced charms of versification or a secondary comic plot to relieve the solemn weight and monotony of tragedy it is no doubt true that a highlybuskined tragedy in which all the personages maintain the funereal pomp usually required from the victims of melpomene is apt to be intolerably tiresome after all the pains which a skilful and elegant poet can bestow upon finishing it but it is chiefly tiresome because it is unnatural and in respect of propriety ought no more to be relieved by the introduction of a set of comic scenes independent of those of a mournful complexion than the sombre air of a funeral should be enlivened by a concert of fiddles there appear to be two legitimate modes of interweaving tragedy with something like comedy the first and most easy which has often been resorted to is to make the lower or less marked characters of the drama like the porter in macbeth or the fool in king lear speak the language appropriated to their station even in the midst of the distresses of the piece nay they may be permitted to have some slight underintrigue of their own this however requires the exertion of much taste and discrimination for if we are once seriously and deeply interested in the distress of the play the intervention of anything like buffoonery may unloosen the hold which the author has gained on the feelings of the audience if such subordinate comic characters are of a rank to intermix in the tragic dialogue their mirth ought to be chastened till their language bears a relation to that of the higher persons for example nothing can be more absurd than in don sebastian and some of southernes tragedies to hear the comic character answer in prose and with a wouldbe witticism to the solemn unrelaxed blank verse of his tragic companion35 mercutio is i think one of the best instances of such a comic person as may be reasonably and with propriety admitted into tragedy from which however i do not exclude those lower characters whose conversation appears absurd if much elevated above their rank there is however another mode yet more difficult to be used with address but much more fortunate in effect when it has been successfully employed this is when the principal personages themselves do not always remain in the buckram of tragedy but reserve as in common life lofty expressions for great occasions and at other times evince themselves capable of feeling the lighter as well as the more violent or more deep affections of the mind the shades of comic humour in hamlet in hotspur and in falconbridge are so far from injuring that they greatly aid the effect of the tragic scenes in which these same persons take a deep and tragical share we grieve with them when grieved still more because we have rejoiced with them when they rejoiced and on the whole we acknowledge a deeper frater feeling as burns has termed it in men who are actuated by the usual changes of human temperament than in those who contrary to the nature of humanity are eternally actuated by an unvaried strain of tragic feeling but whether the poet diversifies his melancholy scenes by the passing gaiety of subordinate characters or whether he qualifies the tragic state of his heroes by occasionally assigning lighter tasks to them or whether he chooses to employ both modes of relieving the weight of misery through live long acts it is obviously unnecessary that he should distract the attention of his audience and destroy the regularity of his play by introducing a comic plot with personages and interest altogether distinct and intrigue but slightly connected with that of the tragedy dryden himself afterwards acknowledged that though he was fond of the spanish friar he could not defend it from the imputation of gothic and unnatural irregularity for mirth and gravity destroy each other and are no more to be allowed for decent than a gay widow laughing in a mourning habit36  the spanish friar was brought out in 16812 when the nation was in a ferment against the catholics on account of the supposed plot it is dedicated to john lord haughton as protestant play inscribed to a protestant patron it was also the last dramatic work excepting the political play of the duke of guise and the masque of albion and albanius brought out by our author before the revolution and in political tendency the spanish friar has so different colouring from these last pieces that it is worth while to pause to examine the private relations of the author when he composed it  previous to 1678 lord mulgrave our authors constant and probably effectual patron had given him an opportunity of discoursing over his plan of an epic poem to the king and duke of york and in the preface to aurengzebe in that year the poet intimates an indirect complaint that the royal brothers had neglected his plan37 about two years afterwards mulgrave seems himself to have fallen into disgrace and was considered as in opposition to the court38 dryden was deprived of his intercession and seems in some degree to have shared his disgrace the essay on satire became public in november 1679 and being generally imputed to dryden it is said distinctly by one libeller that his pension was for a time interrupted39 this does not seem likely it is more probable that dryden shared the general fate of the household of charles ii whose appointments were but irregularly paid but perhaps his supposed delinquency made it more difficult for him than others to obtain redress at this period broke out the pretended discovery of the popish plot in which dryden even in absalom and achitophel evinces a partial belief40 not encouraged if not actually discountenanced at court sharing in some degree the discontent of his patron mulgrave above all obliged by his situation to please the age in which he lived dryden did not probably hold the reverence of the duke of york so sacred as to prevent his making the ridicule of the catholic religion the means of recommending his play to the passions of the audience neither was his situation at court in any danger from his closing on this occasion with the popular tide charles during the heat of the popish plot was so far from being in a situation to incur odium by dismissing a laureate for having written a protestant play that he was obliged for a time to throw the reins of government into the hands of those very persons to whom the papists were most obnoxious the inference drawn from drydens performance was that he had deserted the court and the duke of york was so much displeased with the tenor of the play that it was the only one of which on acceding to the crown he prohibited the representation the spanish friar was often objected to the author by his opponents after he had embraced the religion there satirised nor was the idea of his apostasy from the court an invention of his enemies after his conversion for it prevailed at the commencement of the partydisputes and the name of dryden is by a partisan of royalty ranked with that of his bitter foe shadwell as followers of shaftesbury in 168041 but whatever cause of coolness or disgust our author had received from charles or his brother was removed as usual so soon as his services became necessary and thus the supposed author of a libel on the king became the ablest defender of the cause of monarchy and the author of the spanish friar the advocate and convert of the catholic religion  in his private circumstances dryden must have been even worse situated than at the close of the last section his contract with the kings company was now ended and long before seems to have produced him little profit if southernes biographer can be trusted dryden never made by a single play more than one hundred pounds so that with all his fertility he could not at his utmost exertion make more than two hundred a year by his theatrical labours42 at the same time they so totally engrossed his leisure that he produced no other work of consequence after the annus mirabilis43 if therefore the payment of his pension was withheld whether from the resentment of the court or the poverty of the exchequer he might well complain of the unsettled state which doomed him to continue these irksome and illpaid labours  footnotes  1 malone vol i p 124  2 denniss account of these feuds though not strictly accurate is lively and too curious to be suppressed nothing says dennis is more certain than that mr settle who is now 1717 the city poet was formerly a poet of the court and at what time was he so why in the reign of king charles the second when that court was more gallant and more polite than ever the english court perhaps had been before when there was at court the present and the late

persia was acted for three weeks together the second which was the empress of morocco was acted for a month together and was in such high esteem both with the court and town that it was acted at whitehall before the king by the gentlemen and ladies of the court and the prologue which was spoken by the lady betty howard was writ by the famous lord rochester the bookseller who printed it depending upon the prepossession of the town ventured to distinguish it from all the plays that had been ever published before for it was the first play that ever was sold in england for two shillings and the first that ever was printed with cuts the booksellers at that time of day had not discovered so much of the weakness of their gentle readers as they have done since nor so plainly discovered that fools like children are to be drawn in by gewgawswell but what was the event of this great success mr settle began to grow insolent as any one may see who reads the epistle dedicatory to the empress of morocco mr dryden mr shadwell and mr crowne began to grow jealous and they three in confederacy wrote remarks on the empress of morocco mr settle answered them and according to the opinion which the town then had of the matter for i have utterly forgot the controversy had by much the better of them all in short mr settle was then a formidable rival to mr dryden and i remember very well that not only the town but the university of cambridge was very much divided in their opinions about the preference that ought to be given to them and in both places the younger fry inclined to

have been appointed to a leaky and frail vessel in hopes that he might perish an injury which he resented so highly as not to permit the kings health to be drunk at his table till the voyage was over

p 26     section v   dryden engages in politicsabsalom and achitophel part firstthe medalmacflecknoeabsalom and achitophel part secondthe duke of guise  the controversies in which dryden had hitherto been engaged were of a private complexion arising out of literary disputes and rivalry but the country was now deeply agitated by political faction and so powerful an auxiliary was not permitted by his party to remain in a state of inactivity the religion of the duke of york rendered him obnoxious to a large proportion of the people still agitated by the terrors of the popish plot the duke of monmouth handsome young brave and courteous had all the external requisites for a popular idol and what he wanted in mental qualities was amply supplied by the machiavel subtlety of shaftesbury the life of charles was the only isthmus between these contending tides which mounting viewed each other from afar and strove in vain to meet it was already obvious that the kings death was to be the signal of civil war his situation was doubly embarrassing because in all probability monmouth whose claims were both unjust in themselves and highly derogatory to the authority of the crown was personally amiable and more beloved by charles than was his inflexible and bigoted brother but to consent to the bill for excluding the lawful heir from the crown would have been at the same time putting himself in a state of pupillage for the rest of his reign and evincing to his subjects that they had nothing to expect from attachment to his person or defence of his interest this was a sacrifice not to be thought of so long as the dreadful recollection of the wars in the preceding reign determined a large party to support the monarch while he continued willing to accept of their assistance charles accordingly adopted a determined course and to the rage rather than confusion of his partisans monmouth was banished to holland from whence he boldly returned without the kings licence and openly assumed the character of the leader of a party estranged from court he made various progresses through the country and employed every art which the genius of shaftesbury could suggest to stimulate the courage and to increase the number of his partisans the press that awful power so often and so rashly misused was not left idle numbers of the booksellers were distinguished as protestant or fanatical publishers and their shops teemed with the furious declamations of ferguson the inflammatory sermons of hickeringill the political disquisitions of hunt and the party plays and libellous poems of settle and shadwell an host of rhymers inferior even to those last named attacked the king the duke of york and the ministry in songs and libels which however paltry were read sung rehearsed and applauded it was time that some champion should appear in behalf of the crown before the public should have been irrecoverably alienated by the incessant and slanderous clamour of its opponents drydens place talents and mode of thinking qualified him for this task he was the poetlaureate and household servant of the king thus tumultuously assailed his vein of satire was keen terse and powerful beyond any that has since been displayed from the time of the restoration he had been a favourer of monarchy perhaps more so because the opinion divided him from his own family if he had been for a time neglected the smiles of a sovereign soon make his coldness forgotten and if his narrow fortune was not increased or even rendered stable he had promises of provision which inclined him to look to the future with hope and endure the present with patience if he had shared in the discontent which for a time severed mulgrave from the royal party that cause ceased to operate when his patron was reconciled to the court and received a share of the spoils of the disgraced monmouth1 if there wanted further impulse to induce dryden conscious of his strength to mingle in an affray where it might be displayed to advantage he had the stimulus of personal attachment and personal enmity to sharpen his political animosity ormond halifax and hyde earl of rochester among the nobles were his patrons lee and southerne among the poets were his friends these were partisans of royalty the duke of york whom the spanish friar probably had offended was conciliated by a prologue on his visiting the theatre at his return from scotland2 and it is said by the omission of certain peculiarly offensive passages so soon as the play was reprinted3 the opposite ranks contained buckingham author of the rehearsal shadwell with whom our poet now urged open war and settle the insolence of whose rivalry was neither forgotten nor duly avenged the respect due to monmouth was probably the only consideration to be overcome but his character was to be handled with peculiar lenity and his duchess who rather than himself had patronised dryden was so dissatisfied with the politics as well as the other irregularities of her husband that there was no danger of her taking a gentle correction of his ambition as any affront to herself thus stimulated by every motive and withheld by none dryden composed and on the 17th november 1681 published the satire of absalom and achitophel  the plan of the satire was not new to the public a catholic poet had in 1679 paraphrased the scriptural story of naboths vineyard and applied it to the condemnation of lord stafford on account of the popish plot4 this poem is written in the style of a scriptural allusion the names and situations of personages in the holy text being applied to those contemporaries to whom the author assigned a place in his piece neither was the obvious application of the story of absalom and achitophel to the persons of monmouth and shaftesbury first made by our poet a prose paraphrase published in 1080 had already been composed upon this allusion5 but the vigour of the satire the happy adaptation not only of the incidents but of the very names to the individuals characterised gave drydens poem the full effect of novelty it appeared a very short time after shaftesbury had been committed to the tower and only a few days before the grand jury were to take under consideration the bill preferred against him for high treason its sale was rapid beyond example and even those who were most severely characterised were compelled to acknowledge the beauty if not the justice of the satire the character of monmouth an easy and gentle temper inflamed beyond its usual pitch by ambition and seduced by the arts of a wily and interested associate is touched with exquisite delicacy the poet is as careful of the offending absaloms fame as the father in scripture of the life of his rebel son the fairer side of his character is industriously presented and a veil drawn over all that was worthy of blame but shaftesbury pays the lenity with which monmouth is dismissed the traits of praise and the tribute paid to that statesmans talents are so qualified and artfully blended with censure that they seem to render his faults even more conspicuous and more hateful in this skilful mixture of applause and blame lies the nicest art of satire there must be an appearance of candour on the part of the poet and just so much merit allowed even to the object of his censure as to make his picture natural it is a child alone who fears the aggravated terrors of a saracens head the painter who would move the awe of an enlightened spectator must delineate his tyrant with human features it seems likely that dryden considered the portrait of shaftesbury in the first edition of absalom and achitophel as somewhat deficient in this respect at least the second edition contains twelve additional lines the principal tendency of which is to praise the ability and integrity with which shaftesbury had discharged the office of lord high chancellor it has been reported that this mitigation was intended to repay a singular exertion of generosity on shaftesburys part who while smarting under the lash of drydens satire and in the short interval between the first and second edition of the poem had the liberality to procure admission for the poets son upon the foundation of the charterhouse of which he was then governor but mr malone has fully confuted this tale and shown from the records of the seminary that drydens son erasmus was admitted upon the recommendation of the king himself6 the insertion therefore of the lines in commemoration of shaftesburys judicial character was a voluntary effusion on the part of dryden and a tribute which he seems to have judged it proper to pay to the merit even of an enemy others of the party of monmouth or rather of the opposition party for it consisted as is commonly the case of a variety of factions agreeing in the single principle of opposition to the government were stigmatised with severity only inferior to that applied to achitophel among these we distinguish the famous duke of buckingham with whom under the character of zimri our author balanced accounts for his share in the rehearsal bethel the whig sheriff whose scandalous avarice was only equalled by his factious turbulence and titus oates the pretended discoverer of the popish plot the account of the tory chiefs who retained in the language of the poem their friendship for david at the expense of the popular hatred included of course most of drydens personal protectors the aged duke of ormond is panegyrised with a beautiful apostrophe to the memory of his son the gallant earl of ossory the bishops of london and rochester mulgrave our authors constant patron now reconciled with charles and his government the plausible and trimming halifax and hyde earl of rochester second son to the great clarendon appear in this list the poet having thus arrayed and mustered the forces on each side some account of the combat is naturally expected and johnson complains that after all the interest excited the story is but lamely winded up by a speech from the throne which produces the instantaneous and even marvellous effect of reconciling all parties and subduing the whole phalanx of opposition even thus says the critic the walls towers and battlements of an enchanted castle disappear when the destined knight winds his horn before it spence records in his anecdotes that charles himself imposed on dryden the task of paraphrasing the speech to his oxford parliament at least the most striking passages as a conclusion to his poem of absalom and achitophel  but let us consider whether the nature of the poem admitted of a different management in the close incident was not to be attempted for the poet had described living characters and existing factions the issue of whose contention was yet in the womb of fate and could not safely be anticipated in the satire besides the dissolution of the oxford parliament with that memorable speech was a remarkable era in the contention of the factions after which the whigs gradually declined both in spirit in power and in popularity their boldest leaders were for a time appalled7 and when they resumed their measures they gradually approached rather revolution than reform and thus alienated the more temperate of their own party till at length their schemes terminated in the ryehouse conspiracy the speech having such an effect was therefore not improperly adopted as a termination to the poem of absalom and achitophel  the success of this wonderful satire was so great that the court had again recourse to the assistance of its author shaftesbury was now liberated from the tower for the grand jury partly influenced by deficiency of proof and partly by the principles of the whig party out of which the sheriffs had carefully selected them refused to find the bill of high treason against him this was a subject of unbounded triumph to his adherents who celebrated his acquittal by the most public marks of rejoicing amongst others a medal was struck bearing the head and name of shaftesbury and on the reverse a sun obscured with a cloud rising over the tower and city of london with the date of the refusal of the bill 24th november 1681 and the motto laetamur these medals which his partisans wore ostentatiously at their bosoms excited the general indignation of the tories and the king himself is said to have suggested it as a theme for the satirical muse of dryden and to have rewarded his performance with an hundred broad pieces to a poet of less fertility the royal command to write again upon a character which in a former satire he had drawn with so much precision and felicity might have been as embarrassing at least as honourable but dryden was inexhaustible and easily discovered that though he had given the outline of shaftesbury in absalom and achitophel the finished colouring might merit another canvas about the sixteenth of march 1681 he published anonymously the medal a satire against sedition with the apt motto    per graium populos mediaeque per elidis urbem   ibat ovans divumque sibi poscebat honores  in this satire shaftesburys history his frequent political apostasies his licentious course of life so contrary to the stern rigour of the fanatics with whom he had associated his arts in instigating the fury of the antimonarchists in fine all the political and moral bearings of his character sounded and exposed to contempt and reprobation the beauty of the poetry adding grace to the severity of the satire what impression these vigorous and wellaimed darts made upon shaftesbury who was so capable of estimating their sharpness and force we have no means to ascertain but long afterwards his grandson the author of the characteristics speaks of dryden and his works with a bitter affectation of contempt offensive to every reader of judgment and obviously formed on prejudice against the man rather than dislike to the poetry8 it is said that he felt more resentment on account of the character of imbecility adjudged to his father in absalom and achitophel than for all the pungent satire there and in the medal bestowed upon his grandfather an additional proof how much more easy it is to bear those reflections which render ourselves or our friends hateful than those by which they are only made ridiculous and contemptible the whig poets for many assumed that title did not behold these attacks upon their leader and party with patience or forbearance but they rushed to the combat with more zeal or rather fury than talent or policy their efforts are numbered and described elsewhere9 so that we need here only slightly notice those which dryden thought worthy of his own animadversion most of them adopted the clumsy and obvious expedient of writing their answers in the style of the successful satire which had provoked them thus in reply to absalom and achitophel pordage and settle imitated the plan of bestowing scriptural names on their poem and characters the former entitling his piece azaria and hushai the latter absalom senior or absalom and achitophel transposed but these attempts to hurl back the satire at him by whom it was first launched succeeded but indifferently and might have convinced the authors that the charm of absalom and achitophel lay not in the plan but in the power of execution it was easy to give jewish titles to their heroes but the difficulty lay in drawing their characters with the force and precision of their prototype buckingham himself was rash enough to engage in this conflict but whether his anger blunted his wit or that his share in the rehearsal was less even than what is generally supposed he loses by his reflections on absalom and achitophel the credit we are disposed to allow him for talent on the score of that lively piece10 a nonconformist clergyman published two pieces which i have never seen one entitled a whip for the fools back who styles honourable marriage a cursed confinement in his profane poem of absalom and achitophel the other a key with the whip to open the mystery and iniquity of the poem called absalom and achitophel little was to be hoped or feared from poems bearing such absurd titles i throw however into the note the specimen which mr malone has given of their contents11 the reverend gentleman having announced that achitophel in hebrew means the brother of a fool dryden retorted with infinite coolness that in that case the author of the discovery might pass with his readers for next akin and that it was probably the relation which made the kindness  the medal was answered by the same authors who replied to absalom and achitophel as if the whigs had taken in sober earnest the advice which dryden bestowed on them in the preface to that satire and moreover as he there expressly recommends they railed at him abundantly without a glimmering of wit to enliven their scurrility hickeringill a crazy fanatic began the attack with a sort of mad poem called the mushroom it was written and sent to press the very day on which the medal appeared a circumstance on which the author valued himself so highly as to ascribe it to divine inspiration12 with more labour and equal issue samuel pordage a minor poet of the day produced the medal reversed for which and his former aggression dryden brands him in a single line of the second part of absalom and achitophel as    lame mephibosheth the wizards13 son  there also appeared the loyal medal vindicated and a piece entitled drydens satire to his muse imputed to lord somers but which in conversation with pope he positively disavowed all these and many other pieces the fruits of incensed and almost frantic party fury are marked by the most coarse and virulent abuse the events in our authors life were few and his morals generally speaking irreproachable so that the topics for the malevolence of his antagonists were both scanty and strained but they ceased not with the true pertinacity of angry dulness to repeat in prose and verse in couplet ballad and madrigal the same unvaried accusations amounting in substance to the following that dryden had been bred a puritan and republican that he had written an elegy on cromwell which one wily adversary actually reprinted that he had been in poverty at the restoration that lady elizabeth drydens character was tarnished by the circumstances attending their nuptials that dryden had written the essay on satire in which the king was libelled that he had been beaten by three men in rosealley finally that he was a tory and a tool of arbitrary power this cuckoo song garnished with the burden of bayes and poet squab14 was rung in the ear of the public again and again and with an obstinacy which may convince us how little there was to be said when that little was so often repeated feeble as these attacks were their number like that of the gnats described by spenser15 seems to have irritated dryden to exert the power of his satire and like the blast of the northern wind to sweep away at once these clamorous and busy though ineffectual assailants two in particular claimed distinction from the nameless crowd settle drydens ancient foe and shadwell who had been originally a dubious friend  of drydens controversy with settle we have already spoken fully but we may here add that in addition to former offences of a public and private nature elkanah in the prologue to the emperor of morocco acted in march 16812 had treated dryden with great irreverence16 shadwell had been for some time in good habits with dryden yet an early difference of taste and practice in comedy not only existed between them but was the subject of reciprocal debate and something approaching to rivalry  dryden as we have seen had avowed his preference of lively dialogue in comedy to delineation of character or in other words of wit and repartee to what was then called humour on this subject shadwell early differed from the laureate conscious of considerable powers in observing nature while he was deficient in that liveliness of fancy which is necessary to produce vivacity of dialogue shadwell affected or perhaps entertained a profound veneration for the memory of ben jonson and proposed him as his model in the representation of such characters as were to be marked by humour or an affectation of singularity of manners speech and behaviour dryden on the other hand was no great admirer either of jonsons plays in general or of the low and coarse characters of vice and folly in describing which lay his chief excellency and this opinion he had publicly intimated in the essay of dramatic poesy in the preface to the very first of shadwells plays printed in 1668 he takes occasion bitterly and with a direct application to dryden to assail the grounds of this criticism and the comedies of the author who had made it17 if this petulance produced any animosity it was not lasting for in the course of their controversy dryden appeals to shadwell whether he had not rather countenanced than impeded his first rise in public favour and in 1674 they made common cause with crowne to write those remarks which were to demolish settles empress of morocco even in 1670 while shadwell expresses the same dissent from drydens opinion concerning the merit of jonsons comedy it is in very respectful terms and with great deference to his respected and admired friend of whom though he will not say his is the best way of writing he maintains his manner of writing it is most excellent18 but the irreconcilable difference in their taste soon after broke out in less seemly terms for shadwell permitted himself to use some very irreverent expressions towards drydens play of aurengzebe in the prologue and epilogue to his comedy of the virtuoso and in the preface to the same piece he plainly intimated that he wanted nothing but a pension to enable him to write as well as the poetlaureate19 this attack was the more intolerable as dryden in the preface to that very play of aurengzebe probably meant to include shadwell among those contemporaries who even in his own judgment excelled him in comedy in 1678 dryden accommodated with a prologue shadwells play of the true widow but to write these occasional pieces was part of his profession and the circumstance does not prove that the breach between these rivals for public applause was ever thoroughly healed on the contrary it seems likely that in the case of shadwell as in that of settle political hatred only gangrened a wound inflicted by literary rivalry after their quarrel became desperate dryden resumed his prologue and adapted it to a play by afra behn called the widow ranter or bacon in virginia20 whatever was the progress of the dispute it is certain that shadwell as zealously attached to the whig faction as dryden to the tories buckled on his armour among their other poetasters to encounter the champion of royalty his answer to the medal is entitled the medal of john bayes it appeared in autumn 1681 and is distinguished by scurrility even among the scurrilous lampoons of settle care and pordage those he coolly says who know dryden know there is not an untrue word spoke of him in the poem although he is there charged with the most gross and infamous crimes shadwell also seems to have had a share in a lampoon entitled the tory poets in which both dryden and otway were grossly reviled21 on both occasions his satire was as clumsy as his overgrown person and as brutally coarse as his conversation for shadwell resembled ben jonson in his vulgar and intemperate pleasures as well as in his style of comedy and corpulence of body22 dryden seems to have thought that such reiterated attacks from a contemporary of some eminence whom he had once called friend merited a more severe castigation than could be administered in a general satire he therefore composed macflecknoe or a satire on the true blue protestant poet ts by the author of absalom and achitophel which was published 4th october 1682 richard flecknoe from whom the piece takes its title was so distinguished as a wretched poet that his name had become almost proverbial shadwell is represented as the adopted son of this venerable monarch who so long    in prose and verse was owned without dispute   through all the realms of nonsense absolute  the solemn inauguration of shadwell as his successor in this drowsy kingdom forms the plan of the poem being the same which pope afterwards adopted on a broader canvas for his dunciad the vices and follies of shadwell are not concealed while the awkwardness of his pretensions to poetical fame are held up to the keenest ridicule in an evil hour leaving the composition of low comedy in which he held an honourable station he adventured upon the composition of operas and pastorals on these the satirist falls without mercy and ridicules at the same time his pretensions to copy ben jonson    nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame   by arrogating jonsons hostile name   let father flecknoe fire thy mind with praise   and uncle ogleby thy envy raise   thou art my blood where jonson has no part   what share have we in nature or in art   where did his wit on learning fix a brand   and rail at arts he did not understand   where made he love in prince nicanders vein   or swept the dust in psyches humble strain  this unmerciful satire was sold off in a very short time and it seems uncertain whether it was again published until 1084 when it appeared with the authors name in tonsons first miscellany it would seem that dryden did not at first avow it though as the titlepage assigned it to the author of absalom and achitophel we cannot believe shadwells assertion that he had denied it with oaths and imprecations dryden however omits this satire in the first 23 printed list of his plays and poems along with the eulogy on cromwell but he was so far from disowning it that in his essay on satire he quotes macflecknoe as an instance given by himself of the varronian satire poor shadwell was extremely disturbed by this attack upon him the more so as he seems hardly to have understood its tendency he seriously complains that he is represented by dryden as an irishman when he knows that i never saw ireland till i was threeandtwenty years old and was there but for four months he had understood drydens parable literally so true it is that a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear  macflecknoe though so cruelly severe was not the only notice which shadwell received of drydens displeasure at his person and politics absalom and achitophel and the medal having been so successful a second part to the first poem was resolved on for the purpose of sketching the minor characters of the contending factions dryden probably conceiving that he had already done his part only revised this additional book and contributed about two hundred lines the body of the poem was written by nahum tate one of those secondrate bards who by dint of pleonasm and expletive can find smooth lines if any one will supply them with ideas the second part of absalom and achitophel is however much beyond his usual pitch and exhibits considerable marks of a careful revision by dryden especially in the satirical passages for the eulogy on the tory chiefs is in the flat and feeble strain of tate himself as is obvious when it is compared with the description of the greendragon club the character of corah and other passages exhibiting marks of drydens hand  but if the second part of absalom and achitophel fell below the first in its general tone the celebrated passage inserted by dryden possessed even a double portion of the original spirit the victims whom he selected out of the partisans of monmouth and shaftesbury for his own particular severity were robert ferguson afterwards well known by the name of the plotter forbes johnson author of the parallel between james duke of york and julian the apostate but above all settle and shadwell whom under the names of doeg and og he has depicted in the liveliest colours his poignant satire could afford they who have patience to look into the lampoons which these worthies had published against dryden will in reading his retort be reminded of the combats between the giants and knights of romance his antagonists came on with infinite zeal and fury discharged their illaimed blows on every side and exhausted their strength in violent and ineffectual rage but the keen and trenchant blade of dryden never makes a thrust in vain and never strikes but at a vulnerable point this we have elsewhere remarked is a peculiar attribute of his satire24 and it is difficult for one assailed on a single ludicrous foible to make good his respectability though possessed of a thousand valuable qualities as it was impossible for achilles invulnerable everywhere else to survive the wound which a dexterous archer had aimed at his heel with regard to settle there is a contempt in drydens satire which approaches almost to goodhumour and plainly shows how far our poet was now from entertaining those apprehensions of rivalship which certainly dictated his portion of the remarks on the empress of morocco settle had now found his level and dryden no longer regarded him with a mixture of rage and apprehension but with more appropriate feelings of utter contempt this poor wight had acquired by practice and perhaps from nature more of a poetical ear than most of his contemporaries were gifted with his blundering melody as dryden terms it is far sweeter to the ear than the flat and ineffectual couplets of tate nor are his verses always destitute of something approaching to poetic fancy and spirit he certainly in his transposition of absalom and achitophel mimicked the harmony of his original with more success than was attained by shadwell buckingham or pordage25 but in this facility of versification all his merit began and ended in our authors phrase    doeg though without knowing how or why   made still a blundering kind of melody   spurred boldly on and dashed though thick and thin   through sense and nonsense never out nor in   free from all meaning whether good or bad   and in one word heroically mad   he was too warm on pickingwork to dwell   but faggoted his notions as they fell   and if they rhymed and rattled all was well  ere we take leave of settle it is impossible to omit mentioning his lamentable conclusion a tale often told and moralised upon and in truth a piece of very tragical mirth elkanah we have seen was at this period a zealous whig nay he was so far in the confidence of shaftesbury that under his direction and with his materials he had been intrusted to compose a noted libel against the duke of york entitled the character of a popish successor having a genius for mechanics he was also exalted to be manager of a procession for burning the pope which the whigs celebrated with great pomp as one of many artifices to inflame the minds of the people26 to this and to the fireworks which attended its solemnisation dryden alludes in the lines to which elkanahs subsequent disasters gave an air of prophecy    in fireworks give him leave to vent his spite   those are the only servants he can write   the height of his ambition is we know   but to be master of a puppetshow   on that one stage his works may yet appear   and a months harvest keeps him all the year  notwithstanding the rank he held among the whig authors27 settle perceiving the cause of his patron shaftesbury was gradually becoming weaker fairly abandoned him to his fate and read a solemn recantation of his political errors in a narrative published in 1683 the truth seems to be that honest doeg was poetlaureate to the city and earned some emolument by composing verses for pageants and other occasions of civic festivity so that when the tory interest resumed its ascendency among the magistrates he had probably no alternative but to relinquish his principles or his post and elkanah like many greater men held the former the easier sacrifice like all converts he became outrageous in his new faith wrote a libel on lord russell a few days after his execution indited a panegyric on judge jefferies and being tam marte quam mercurio actually joined as a trooper the army which king james encamped upon hounslow heath after the revolution he is enumerated with our author and tate among those poets whose strains had been stifled by that great event28 he continued however to be the citylaureate29 but in despite of that provision was reduced by want to write plays like ben jonsons littlewit for the profane motions or puppetshows of smithfield and bartholomew fairs nay having proceeded thus far in exhibiting the truth of drydens prediction he actually mounted the stage in person among these wooden performers and combated st george for england in a green dragon of his own proper device settle was admitted into the charterhouse in his old age and died there in 1723 the lines of pope on poor elkanahs fate are familiar to every poetical reader    in luds old walls though long i ruled renowned   far as loud bows stupendous bells resound   though my own aldermen conferred the bays   to me committing their eternal praise   their fullfed heroes their pacific mayors   their annual trophies and their monthly wars   though long my party built on me their hopes   for writing pamphlets and for roasting popes   yet lo in me what authors have to brag on   reduced at last to hiss in my own dragon   avert it heaven that thou or cibber eer   should wag a serpenttail in smithfield fair   like the vile straw thats blown about the streets   the needy poet sticks to all he meets   coached carted trod upon now loose now fast   and carried off in some dogs tail at last  as dryden was probably more apprehensive of shadwell who though a worse poet than settle has excelled even dryden in the lower walks of comedy he has treated him with sterner severity his person his morals his manners and his politics all that had escaped or been but slightly touched upon in macflecknoe are bitterly reviewed in the character of og and there probably never existed another poet who at the distance of a month which intervened between the publication of the two poems could resume an exhausted theme with an energy which gave it all the charms of novelty shadwell did not remain silent beneath the lash but his clamorous exclamations only tended to make his castigation more ludicrous30  the second part of absalom and achitophel was followed by the religio laici a poem which dryden published in the same month of november 1682 its tendency although of a political nature is so different from that of the satires that it will be most properly considered when we can place it in contrast to the hind and panther it was addressed to henry dickinson a young gentleman who had just published a translation of simons critical history of the new testament  as the publication of the two parts of absalom and achitophel the medal and macflecknoe all of a similar tone and rapidly succeeding each other gave to dryden hitherto chiefly known as a dramatist the formidable character of an inimitable satirist we may here pause to consider their effect upon english poetry the witty bishop hall had first introduced into our literature that species of poetry which though its legitimate use be to check vice and expose folly is so often applied by spleen or by faction to destroy domestic happiness by assailing private character hall possessed a good ear for harmony and living in the reign of elizabeth might have studied it in spenser fairfax and other models but from system rather than ignorance or inability he chose to be hard of conceit and harsh of style in order that his poetry might correspond with the sharp sour and crabbed nature of his theme31 donne his successor was still more rugged in his versification as well as more obscure in his conceptions and allusions the satires of cleveland as we have indeed formerly noticed are if possible still harsher and more strained in expression than those of donne butler can hardly be quoted as an example of the sort of satire we are treating of hudibras is a burlesque tale in which the measure is intentionally and studiously rendered as ludicrous as the characters and incidents oldham who flourished in drydens time and enjoyed his friendship wrote his satires in the crabbed tone of cleveland and donne dryden in the copy of verses dedicated to his memory alludes to this deficiency and seems to admit the subject as an apology    o early ripe to thy abundant store   what could advancing age have added more   it might what nature never gives the young   have taught the numbers of thy native tongue   but satire needs not those and wit will shine   through the harsh cadence of a rugged line  yet the apology which he admitted for oldham dryden disdained to make use of himself he did not as has been said of horace wilfully untune his harp when he commenced satirist aware that a wound may be given more deeply with a burnished than with a rusty blade he bestowed upon the versification of his satires the same pains which he had given to his rhyming plays and serious poems he did not indeed for that would have been pains misapplied attempt to smooth his verses into the harmony of those in which he occasionally celebrates female beauty but he gave them varied tone correct rhyme and masculine energy all which had hitherto been strangers to the english satire  thus while drydens style resembled that of juvenal rather than horace he may claim a superiority for uniform and undeviating dignity over the roman satirist the age whose appetite for scandal had been profusely fed by lampoons and libels now learned that there was a more elevated kind of satire in which poignancy might be united with elegance and energy of thought with harmony of versification the example seems to have produced a strong effect no poet not even settle for even the worst artist will improve from beholding a masterpiece afterwards conceived he had sufficiently accomplished his task by presenting to the public thoughts however witty or caustic he might deem them clothed in the hobbling measure of donne or cleveland and expression and harmony began to be consulted in satire as well as sarcastic humour or powerful illustration  macflecknoe in some degree differs from the other satires which dryden published at this time it is not confined to the description of character but exhibits an imaginary course of incidents in which the principal personage takes a ludicrous share in this it resembles hudibras and both are quoted by dryden himself as examples of the varronian satire but there was this pointed difference that butlers poem is burlesque and drydens mockheroic macflecknoe is i rather believe the first poem in the english language in which the dignity of a harmonised and lofty style is employed not only to excite pleasure in itself but to increase by contrast the comic effect of the scenes which it narrates the subject being ludicrous while the verse is noble the models of satire afforded by dryden as they have never been equalled by any succeeding poet were in a tone of excellence superior far to all that had preceded them  these reflections on the nature of drydens satires have in some degree interrupted our account of his political controversies not only did he pour forth these works one after another with a fertility which seemed to imply delight in his new labour but as if the spirit of the time had taught him speed he found leisure to oppose the whigs in the theatre where the audience was now nearly as much divided as the kingdom by the contending factions settle had produced the tragedy of pope joan shadwell the comedy of the lancashire witches to expose to hatred and ridicule the religion of the successor to the crown otway and durfey crowne and southerne names unequal in fame vied in producing plays against the whigs which might counterbalance the effect of these popular dramas a licence similar to that of aristophanes was introduced on the english stage and living personages were exhibited under very slight disguises32 in the prologues and epilogues which then served as a sort of moral to the plays the veil thin as it was was completely raised and the political analogies pointed out to such of the audience as might otherwise have been too dull to apprehend them in this sharp though petty war dryden bore a considerable share his necessities obliged him among other modes of increasing his income to accept of a small pecuniary tribute for furnishing prologues on remarkable occasions or for new plays and his principles determined their tendency33 but this was not all the support which his party expected and which he afforded them on the theatre even while labouring in their service in a different department  when dryden had but just finished his religio laici lee who had assisted in the play of oedipus claimed drydens promise to requite the obligation it has been already noticed that dryden had in the year succeeding the restoration designed a play on the subject of the duke of guise and he has informed us he had preserved one or two of the scenes these therefore were revised and inserted in the new play of which dryden wrote the first scene the whole fourth act and great part of the fifth lee composed the rest of the duke of guise the general parallel between the league in france and the covenant in england was too obvious to escape early notice but the return of monmouth to england against the kings express command in order to head the opposition perhaps the insurrection of london presented a still closer analogy to the entry of the duke of guise into paris under similar circumstances on the famous day of the barricades of this remarkable incident the united authors of the duke of guise naturally availed themselves though with such precaution that almost the very expressions of the scene are taken from the prose of davila yet the plot though capable of an application so favourable for the royal party contained circumstances of offence to it if the parallel between guise and monmouth was on the one hand felicitous as pointing out the nature of the dukes designs the moral was revolting as seeming to recommend the assassination of charless favourite son the king also loved monmouth to the very last and was slow and reluctant in permitting his character to be placed in a criminal or odious point of view34 the play therefore though ready for exhibition before midsummer 1682 remained in the hands of arlington the lordchamberlain for two months without being licensed for representation but during that time the scene darkened the king had so far suppressed his tenderness for monmouth as to authorise his arrest at stafford and the influence of the duke of york at court became daily more predominant among other evident tokens that no measures were henceforward to be kept between the king and monmouth the representation of the duke of guise was at length authorised  the two companies of players after a long and expensive warfare had now united their forces on which occasion dryden furnished them with a prologue full of violent tory principles by this united company the duke of guise was performed on the 30th december 1682 it was printed with a dedication to hyde earl of rochester subscribed by both authors but evidently the work of dryden it is written in a tone of defiance to the whig authors who had assailed the dedicators it alleges like footpads in the dark though their blows had done little harm and the objects of their malice yet lived to vindicate their loyalty in open day the play itself has as determined a political character as the dedication besides the general parallel between the leaguers and the fanatical sectaries and the more delicate though not less striking connection between the story of guise and of monmouth there are other collateral allusions in the piece to the history of that unfortunate nobleman and to the state of parties the whole character of marmoutiere highspirited loyal and exerting all her influence to deter guise from the prosecution of his dangerous schemes corresponds to that of anne duchess of monmouth35 the love too which the king professes to marmoutiere and which excites the jealousy of guise may bear a remote and delicate allusion to that partiality which the duke of york is said to have entertained for the wife of his nephew36  the amiable colours in which marmoutiere is painted were due to the duchess of monmouth drydens especial patroness another more obvious and more offensive parallel existed between the popular party in the city with the whig sheriffs at their head and that of the echevins or sheriffs of paris violent demagogues and adherents to the league and who in the play are treated with great contumely by grillon and the royal guards the tumults which had taken place at the election of these magistrates were warm in the recollection of the city and the commitment of the exsheriffs shute and pilkington to the tower under pretext of a riot was considered as the butt of the poets satire under these impressions the whigs made a violent opposition to the representation of the piece even when the king gave it his personal countenance and although in despite of them the duke of guise so far succeeded as to be frequently acted and never without a considerable attendance we may conclude from these qualified expressions of the author himself that the play was never eminently popular he who writes for a party can only please at most one half of his audience  it was not to be expected that at a time so very critical a public representation including such bold allusions or rather parallels should pass without critical censure the duke of guise was attacked by drydens old foe shadwell in some verses entitled a lenten prologue refused by the players37 and more formally in reflections on the pretended parallel in the play called the duke of guise in this pamphlet shadwell seems to have been assisted by a gentleman of the temple so zealous for the popular cause that dryden says he was detected disguised in a liverygown proffering his vote at the commonhall thomas hunt a barrister38 likewise stepped forth on this occasion and in his defence of the charter of london then challenged by the famous process of quo warranto he accuses dryden of having prepared the way for that arbitrary step by the degrading representation of their magistrates executed in effigy upon the stage dryden thought these pamphlets of consequence enough to deserve an answer and published soon after the vindication of the duke of guise in perusing the controversy we may admire two circumstances eminently characteristical of the candour with which such controversies are usually maintained first the anxiety with which the critics labour to fix upon dryden a disrespectful parallel between charles ii and henry ii iii of france which certainly our author did not propose to carry farther than their common point of situation and secondly the labour with which he disavows what he unquestionably did intenda parallel between the rebellious conduct of monmouth and of guise the vindication is written in a tone of sovereign contempt for the adversaries particularly for shadwell speaking of thomas hunt dryden sayseven this their celebrated writer knows no more of style and english than the northern dictator as if dulness and clumsiness were fatal to the name of tom it is true he is a fool in three languages more than the poet for they say he understands latin greek and hebrew from all which to my certain knowledge i acquit the other og may write against the king if he pleases so long as he drinks for him and his writings will never do the government so much harm as his drinking does it good for true subjects will not be much perverted by his libels but the wineduties rise considerably by his claret he has often called me an atheist in print i would believe more charitably of him and that he only goes the broad way because the other is too narrow for him he may see by this i do not delight to meddle with his course of life and his immoralities though i have a long beadroll of them i have hitherto contented myself with the ridiculous part of him which is enough in all conscience to employ one man even without the story of his late fall at the old devil where he broke no ribs because the hardness of the stairs could reach no bones and for my part i do not wonder how he came to fall for i have always known him heavy the miracle is how he got up again i have heard of a sea captain as fat as he who to escape arrests would lay himself flat upon the ground and let the bailiffs carry him to prison if they could if a messenger or two nay we may put in three or four should come he has friendly advertisement how to escape them but to leave him who is not worth any further consideration now i have done laughing at himwould every man knew his own talent and that they who are only born for drinking would let both poetry and prose alone this was the last distinct and prolonged animadversion which our author bestowed upon his corpulent antagonist  soon after this time dryden wrote a biographical preface to plutarchs lives of which a new translation by several hands was in the press the dedication is addressed to the duke of ormond the barzillai of absalom and achitophel whom charles after a long train of cold and determined neglect had in emergency recalled to his favour and his councils the first volume of plutarchs lives with drydens life of the author appeared in 1683  about the same time the kings express command engaged dryden in a work which may be considered as a sort of illustration of the doctrines laid down in the vindication of the duke of guise it was the translation of maimbourgs history of the league expressly composed to draw a parallel between the huguenots of france and the leaguers as both equal enemies of the monarchy this comparison was easily transferred to the sectaries of england and the association proposed by shaftesbury the work was published with unusual solemnity of titlepage and frontispiece the former declaring that the translation was made by his majestys command the latter representing charles on his throne surrounded by emblems expressive of hereditary and indefeasible right39 the dedication to the king contains sentiments which savour strongly of party violence and even ferocity the forgiving disposition of the king is according to the dedicator the encouragement of the conspirators like antaeus they rise refreshed from a simple overthrow these sons of earth are never to be trusted in their mother element they must be hoisted into the air and strangled thus exasperated were the most gentle tempers in these times of doubt and peril the rigorous tone adopted confirms the opinion of those historians who observe that after the discovery of the ryehouse plot charles was fretted out of his usual debonair ease and became more morose and severe than had been hitherto thought consistent with his disposition  this translation was to be the last service which dryden was to render his goodhumoured selfish and thoughtless patron while the laureate was preparing for the stage the opera of albion and albanius intended to solemnise the triumph of charles over the whigs or as the author expressed it the double restoration of his sacred majesty the king died of an apoplexy upon the 6th february 16845 his death opened to many and to dryden among others new hopes and new prospects which were in his instance doomed to terminate in disappointment and disgrace we may therefore pause and review the private life of the poet during the period which has occupied our last sections  the vigour and rapidity with which dryden poured forth his animated satire plainly intimates that his mind was pleased with the exercise of that formidable power it was more easy for him he has himself told us to write with severity than with forbearance and indeed where is the expert swordsman who does not delight in the flourish of his weapon neither could this selfcomplacent feeling be much allayed by the vague and abusive ribaldry with which his satire was repaid this was natural to the controversy was no more than he expected and was easily retorted with terrible interest as for knave says he and sycophant and rascal and impudent and devil and old serpent and a thousand such good morrows i take them to be only names of parties and could return murderer and cheat and whignapper and sodomite and in short the goodly number of the seven deadly sins with all their kindred and relations which are names of parties too but saints will be saints in spite of villainy with such feelings we may believe drydens rest was little disturbed by the litter of libels against him    sons of a day just buoyant on the flood   then numbered with the puppies in the mud  but he who keenly engages in political controversy must not only encounter the vulgar abuse which he may justly contemn but the altered eye of friends whose regard is chilled or alienated that dryden sustained such misfortune we cannot doubt when he informs us that out of the large party in opposition comprehending doubtless many men of talent and eminence who were formerly familiar with him he had during the course of a whole year only spoken to four and to those but casually and cursorily and only to express a wish that the times might come when the names of whig and tory might be abolished and men live together as they had done before they were introduced  neither did the protecting zeal of his partyfriends compensate for the loss of those whom dryden had alienated in their service true it is that a host of tory rhymers came forward with complimentary verses to the author of absalom and achitophel and of the medal but of all payment that in kind is least gratifying to a povertystruck bard and the courtly patrons of dryden were in no haste to make him more substantial requital a gratuity of an hundred broad pieces is said to have been paid him by charles for one of his satires but no permanent provision was made for him he was coolly left to increase his pittance by writing occasional pieces and it was probably with this view that he arranged for publication a miscellaneous collection of poetry which he afterwards continued it was published for tonson in 16834 and contained several versions of epistles from ovid and translations of detached pieces of virgil horace and theocritus with some smaller pieces by dryden himself and a variety of poems by other hands the epistles had appeared in 1680 in a version of the original by several hands to which dryden also contributed an introductory discourse on translation contrary to our authors custom the miscellany appeared without either preface or dedication  the miscellany among other minor poems of dryden contained many of his occasional prologues and epilogues the composition of which his necessity had rendered so important a branch of income that in the midst of his splendour of satirical reputation the poet was obliged to chaffer about the scanty recompence which he drew from such petty sources such a circumstance attended the commencement of his friendship with southerne that poet then opening his dramatic career with the play of the loyal brother came as was usual to request a prologue from dryden and to offer him the usual compliment of five guineas but the laureate demurred and insisted upon double the sum not out of disrespect he added to you young man but the players have had my goods too cheap hence southerne who was peculiarly fortunate in his dramatic revenue is designed by pope as        tom sent down to raise   the price of prologues and of plays40  it may seem surprising that dryden should be left to make an object of such petty gains when labouring for the service of government he had in little more than twelve months produced both parts of absalom and achitophel the medal macflecknoe religio laici and the duke of guise but this was not the worst for although his pension as poetlaureate was apparently all the encouragement which he received from the crown so illregulated were the finances of charles so expensive his pleasures and so greedy his favourites that our author shortly after finishing these immortal poems was compelled to sue for more regular payment of that very pension and for a more permanent provision in the following affecting memorial addressed to hyde earl of rochesteri would plead says he a little merit and some hazards of my life from the common enemies my refusing advantages offered by them and neglecting my beneficial studies for the kings service but i only think i merit not to starve i never applied myself to any interest contrary to your lordships and on some occasions perhaps not known to you have not been unserviceable to the

to learning beyond my fortune but they are too hopeful to be neglected though i want be pleased to look on me with an eye of compassion some small employment would render my condition easy the king is not unsatisfied of me the duke has often promised me his assistance and your lordship is the conduit through which their favours pass either in the customs or the appeals of the excise or some other

incorrigibleness of our poets in their pedantic manner their vanity defiance of criticism their rhodomontade and poetical bravado we need only turn to our famous poetlaureat the very mr bayes himself in one of his latest and most valued pieces writ many years after the ingenious author of the rehearsal had drawn his picture i have been listening says our poet in his preface to don sebastian what objections had been made against the conduct of the play but found them all so trivial that if i should name them a true critic would imagine that i played booty some are pleased to say the writing is dull but aedatum habet de se loquatur others that the double poison is unnatural let the common received opinion and ausoniuss famous epigram answer that lastly a more ignorant sort of creatures than either of the former maintain that the character of dorax is not only unnatural but inconsistent with itself let them read the play and think again a longer reply is what those cavillers deserve not but i will give them and their fellows to understand that the earl of  was pleased to read the tragedy twice over before it was acted and did me the favour to send me word that i had written beyond

same with that of lucans hero against an army concurrere bellum atque virum i think i may modestly conclude etc  thus he goes on to the very end in the selfsame strain who after this can ever say of

where theres hope of bread   a wellfilled paunch forgets a broken head  17 i quote the passage at length as evincing the difference between drydens taste in comedy and that of shadwell  i have endeavoured to represent variety of humours most of the persons of the play differing in their characters from one another which was the practice of ben jonson whom i think all drammatick poets ought to imitate though none are like to come near he being the onely person that appears to me to have made perfect representation of human life most other authors that i ever read either have wilde romantick tales wherein they strein love and honour to that ridiculous height that it becomes burlesque or in their lower comedies content themselves with one or two humours at most and those not near so perfect characters as the admirable jonson always made who never wrote comedy without seven or eight considerable humours i never saw one except that of falstaffe that was in my judgment comparable to any of jonsons considerable humours you will pardon this digression when i tell you he is the man of all the world i most passionately admire for his excellency in drammatick poetry  though i have known some of late so insolent to say that ben jonson wrote his best playes without wit imagining that all the wit playes consisted in bringing two persons upon the stage to break jest and to bob one another which they call repartie not considering that there is more wit and invention required in the finding out good humour and matter proper for it then in all their smart reparties for in the writing of a humour a man is confined not to swerve from the character and obliged to say nothing but what is proper to it but in the playes which have been wrote of late there is no such thing as perfect character but the two chief persons are most commonly a swearing drinking whoring ruffian for a lover and impudent illbred tomrig for a mistress and these are the fine people of the play and there is that latitude in this that almost anything is proper for them to say but their chief subject is bawdy and profaneness which they call brisk writing when the most dissolute of men that relish those things well enough in private are choked at em in publick and methinks if there were nothing but the ill manners of it it should make poets avoid that indecent way of writingpreface to the sullen lovers  lest this provocation should be insufficient the prologue of the same piece has a fling at heroic plays the poet says he has    no kind romantic lover in his play   to sigh and whine out passion such as may   charm waitingwomen with heroic chime   and still resolve to live and die in rhyme   such as your ears with love and honour feast   and play at crambo for three hours at least   that fight and wooe in verse in the same breath   and make similitude and love in death  whatever symptoms of reconciliation afterwards took place between the poets i greatly doubt if this first offence was ever cordially forgiven  18 vol vii  19 see these offensive passages vol x  20 vol x  21   the laurel makes a wit a brave the sword   and all are wise men at the council board   settles a

translation of the tenth satire of juvenal in the preface to which he rails plentifully against dryden  31 the omission of marston here is remarkable because no satirist exhibits this extraordinary roughness of versification more glaringly scott can hardly have read himed  i infer that the want of harmony was intentional from these expressions it is not for every one to relish a true and natural satire being of itself besides the nature and inbred bitterness and tartness of particulars both hard of conceit and harsh of style and therefore cannot but be unpleasing both to the unskilful and

ridiculed in the character of hothead as well as the fanatical whig under that of testimony  33 see the prologues and epilogues in vol x  34 the concealed partiality of charles towards monmouth survived even the discovery of the ryehouse plot he could not dissemble his satisfaction upon seeing him after his surrender and pressed his hand affectionatelysee monmouths diary in wellwoods memorials p 322  35 carte in his life of the duke of ormond says that monmouths resolutions varied from submission to resistance against the king according to his residence with the duchess at moorpark who schooled him to the former or with his associates and partisans in the city who instigated him to more desperate resolutions  36 this dryden might learn from mulgrave who mentions in his memoirs as a means of monmouths advancement the great friendship which the duke of york had openly professed to his wife a lady of wit and reputation who had both the ambition of making her husband considerable and the address of succeeding in it by using her interest in so friendly an uncle whose design i believe was only to convert her whether this familiarity of theirs was contrived or only connived at by the duke of monmouth himself is hard to determine but i remember that after these two princes had become declared enemies the duke of york one day told me with some emotion as conceiving it a new mark of his nephews insolence that he had forbidden his wife to receive any more visits from him at which i could not help frankly replying that i who was not used to excuse him yet could not hold from doing it in that case wishing his highness might have no juster cause to complain of him upon which the duke surprised to find me excuse his and my own enemy changed the discourse immediatelymemoirs p 13  i have perused letters from sir gideon scott of highchester to the duchess of monmouth recommending a prudent and proper attention to the duke of york and this advice she probably followed for after her husbands execution james restored to her all her family estates  37 bought by mr luttrell 11th april 1683 see it in vol x it is expressly levelled against the duke of guise and generally against dryden as a court poet i may however be wrong in ascribing it to shadwell  38 i observe anthony wood as well as mr malone suppose hunt and the templar associated in the reflections to be the same person but in the vindication of the duke of guise shadwell and they are spoke of as three distinct persons  39 see vol xvii in this edition i have retained a specimen of a translation which our author probably executed with peculiar care selecting it from the account of the barricades of paris as illustrating the tragedy of the duke of guise  40 this story is told with great variation of figures johnson mentions two and three guineas as the old and new prices others give four and sixed  41 probably alluding to having defended clarendon in public company for nothing of the kind occurs in drydens publications it is not impossible that the new years day poem 1662 to the lord chancellor is partly referred to hereed  42 probably the translation of religio laici  43 some important evidence has come to light since scott wrote which shows that the response to drydens petitions and the reward of his services was not so insignificant as appears from the text though it was meagre enough the facts were not known fully even to macaulay and his ignorance enabled him in perfect honesty to make the case against dryden for supposed venal apostasy stronger than it might otherwise appear the documents referred to were discovered by mr peter cunningham and by mr charles beville dryden the latter of whom communicated his discovery to mr robert bell as the facts are undoubted and macaulays ignorance of them equally so it seems a little remarkable that a reviewer of the little book on dryden to which i am too often obliged to refer my readers should have announced his adherence to macaulay and fact rather than mr bell and sophistry it is not obvious how fact can be on the side of a writer who was owing to no fault of his own ignorant of the fact and whose ignorance furnished him with his premises the state of the case is this drydens application to hyde produced the following treasury warrant     of the sume of fifty pounds for one   quarter of the said annuity or pencon due at midsummer   1680 and by vertue of his mats lres of privy   scale directing an additionall annuity of one hundred   pounds to him the said john dryden to draw one or   more orders for payment of the sume of twenty five   pounds for one quarter of the said annuity due at   lady day 1680 and let both the said sumes making   the sume of seaventy five pounds be satisfyed out of   any his mats treasure now or hereafter being and   remaining in the receipt of excheqr not appropriated   to particular uses for wch this shal be your

mr dryden 75l   it will be seen from this that independently of the appointment of the laureateship dryden had in or before the year 1679 received an additional pension of £100 a year confirmatory of this is a treasury order for the quarter of the same pension due january 5th 1679 and a secret service payment of the same year apparently referring to the same pension moreover on december 17th 1683 dryden was appointed collector of customs in the port of london the value of this is unknown but the sum of £5 for collecting the duties on cloth which is the only part of the emoluments as to which there is documentary evidence must have been a very small part of it now these two appointments the laureateship and the collectorship were by letterspatent and were in the usual course confirmed on the accession of the new sovereign though james characteristically cut out the butt of sack but the extra pension which was merely granted by letters of privy seal lapsed and it was absolutely within the discretion of the new sovereign to continue or discontinue it it was not formally regranted for a year and this pension was mistaken by macaulay for an original one granted in payment of apostasy that the difference is very considerable must strike every one and i for one cannot see that the drawing of the obvious inference can be called sophistry if the time between the lapsing and the regranting seems long it has to be observed first that arrears to the date of the lapse are carefully specified secondly that even in the case of the laureateship patent four whole months as has been seen elapsed between the instruction for it and the patent itself the circumstances are of course consistent with the supposition that apostasy was made a condition of the renewal but they cannot be

excited new hopes in all orders of men on the accession of a new prince the loyal looked to rewards the rebellious to amnesty the catholics exulted in beholding one of their persuasion attain the crown after an interval of two centuries the church of england expected the fruits of her unlimited devotion to the royal line even the sectaries might hope indulgence from a prince whose religion deviated from that established by law as widely as their own all therefore hastened in sugared addresses to lament the sun which had set and hail the beams of that which had arisen dryden among other expectants chose the more honourable of these themes and in the threnodia augustalis at once paid a tribute to the memory of the deceased monarch and decently solicited the attention of his successor but although he had enjoyed personal marks of the favour of charles they were of a nature too unsubstantial to demand a deep tone of sorrow little was the muses hire and light their gain and the pension of a princes praise is stated to have been all their encouragement dryden therefore by no means sorrowed as if he had no hope but having said all that was decently mournful over the bier of charles tuned his lyrics to a sounding close in praise of james  about the same time dryden resumed with new courage the opera of albion and albanius which had been nearly finished before the death of charles this was originally designed as a masque or emblematical prelude to the play of king arthur for dryden wearied with the inefficient patronage of charles from whom he only received fair words had renounced in despair the task of an epic poem and had converted one of his themes that of the tale of arthur into the subject of a romantic drama as the epic was to have been adapted to the honour and praise of charles and his brother the opera had originally the same political tendency albion and albanius was a sort of introductory masque in which under a very thin veil of allegory first the restoration of the stuarts to the throne and secondly their recent conquest over their whig opponents were successively represented the death of charles made little alteration in this piece it cost but the addition of an apotheosis and the opera concluded with the succession of james to the throne from which he had been so nearly excluded these topics were however temporary and probably from the necessity of producing it while the allusions were fresh and obvious albion and albanius was detached from king arthur which was not in such a state of forwardness great expense was bestowed in bringing forward this piece and the scenery seems to have been unusually perfect particularly the representation of a celestial phenomenon actually seen by captain gunman of the navy whose evidence is quoted in the printed copies of the play1 the music of albion and albanius was arranged by grabut a frenchman whose name does not stand high as a composer yet dryden pays him some compliments in the preface of the piece which were considered as derogatory to purcel and the english school and gave great offence to a class of persons at least as irritable as their brethren the poets this among other causes seems to have injured the success of the piece but its deathblow was the news of the duke of monmouths invasion which reached london on saturday 13th june 1685 while albion and albanius was performing for the sixth time the audience broke up in consternation and the piece was never again repeated2 this opera was prejudicial to the company who were involved by the expense in a considerable debt and never recovered half the money laid out neither was it of service to our poets reputation who had on this occasion to undergo the gibes of angry musicians as well as the reproaches of disappointed actors and hostile poets one went so far as to suggest with some humour that probably the laureate and grabut had mistaken their trade the forming writing the music and the latter the verse  we have now reached a remarkable incident in our authors life namely his conversion to the catholic faith which took place shortly after the accession of james ii to the british throne the biographer of dryden must feel considerable difficulty in discussing the probable causes of his change although this essay be intended to contain the life not the apology of the poet it is the duty of the writer to place such circumstances in view as may qualify the strong prepossession at first excited by a change of faith against the individual who makes it this prepossession powerful in every case becomes doubly so if the step be taken at a time when the religion adopted seems more readily to pave the way for the temporal prosperity of the proselyte even where the grounds of conviction are ample and undeniable we have a respect for those who suffer rather than renounce a mistaken faith when it is discountenanced or persecuted a brave man will least of all withdraw himself from his ancient standard when the tide of battle beats against it on the other hand those who at such a period admit conviction to the better and predominant doctrine are viewed with hatred by the members of the deserted creed and with doubt by their new brethren in faith many who adopted christianity in the reign of constantine were doubtless sincere proselytes but we do not find that any of them have been canonised these feelings must be allowed powerfully to affect the mind when we reflect that dryden a servant of the court and zealously attached to the person of james to whom he looked for the reward of long and faithful service did not receive any mark of royal favour until he professed himself a member of the religion for which that king was all but an actual martyr there are other considerations however greatly qualifying the conclusions which might be drawn from these suspicious circumstances and tending to show that drydens conversion was at least in a great measure effected by sincere conviction the principal clew to the progress of his religious principles is to be found in the poets own lines in the hind and the panther and may by a very simple commentary be applied to the state of his religious opinions at different periods of his life    my thoughtless youth was winged with vain desires   my manhood long misled by wandering fires   followed false lights and when their glimpse was gone   my pride struck out new sparkles of her own   such was i such by nature still i am   be thine the glory and be mine the shame  the vain desires of drydens thoughtless youth require no explanation they obviously mean that inattention to religious duties which the amusements of youth too frequently occasion the false lights which bewildered the poets manhood were i doubt not the puritanical tenets which coming into the world under the auspices of his fanatical relations sir gilbert pickering and sir john driden he must have at least professed but probably seriously entertained it must be remembered that the poet was thirty years of age at the restoration so that a considerable space of his fullgrown manhood had passed while the rigid doctrines of the fanatics were still the order of the day but the third state of his opinions those sparkles which his pride struck out after the delusions of puritanism had vanished in other words those sentiments which he imbibed after the restoration and which immediately preceded his adoption of the catholic faith cannot be ascertained without more minute investigation we may at the outset be easily permitted to assume that the adoption of a fixed creed of religious principles was not the first business of our author when that merry period set him free from the rigorous fetters of fanaticism unless he differed more than we can readily believe from the public feeling at that time dryden was satisfied to give to caesar the things that were caesars without being in a hurry to fulfil the counterpart of the precept foremost in the race of pleasure engaged in labours alien from serious reflection the favourite of the most lively and dissolute nobility whom england ever saw religious thoughts were not at this period likely to intrude frequently upon his mind or to be encouraged when they did so the time therefore when dryden began seriously to compare the doctrines of the contending sects of christianity was probably several years after the restoration when reiterated disappointment and satiety of pleasure prompted his mind to retire within itself and think upon hereafter the religio laici published in 1682 evinces that previous to composing that poem the author had bestowed serious consideration upon the important subjects of which it treats and i have postponed the analysis of it to this place in order that the reader may be able to form his own conjecture from what faith dryden changed when he became a catholic  the religio laici has indeed a political tendency being written to defend the church of england against the sectaries it is not therefore so much from the conclusions of the piece as from the mode of the authors deducing these conclusions that drydens real opinions may he gatheredas we learn nothing of the bowls bias from its having reached its mark though something may be conjectured by observing the course which it described in attaining it from many minute particulars i think it almost decisive that dryden when he wrote the religio laici was sceptical concerning revealed religion i do not mean that his doubts were of that fixed and permanent nature which have at different times induced men of whom better might have been hoped to pronounce themselves freethinkers on principle on the contrary dryden seems to have doubted with such a strong wish to believe as accompanied with circumstances of extrinsic influence led him finally into the opposite extreme of credulity his view of the doctrines of christianity and of its evidence were such as could not legitimately found him in the conclusions he draws in favour of the church of england and accordingly in adopting them he evidently stretches his complaisance towards the national religion while perhaps in his heart he was even then disposed to think there was no middle course between natural religion and the church of rome the first creed which he examines is that of deism which he rejects because the worship of one sole deity was not known to the philosophers of antiquity and is therefore obviously to be ascribed to revelation revelation thus proved the puzzling doubt occurs whether the scripture as contended by calvinists was to be the sole rule of faith or whether the rules and traditions of the church are to be admitted in explanation of the holy text here dryden does not hesitate to point out the inconveniences ensuing from making the sacred page the subject of the dubious and contradictory commentary of the laity at large when    the common rule was made the common prey   and at the mercy of the rabble lay   the tender page with horny fists was galled   and he was gifted most that loudest bawled   the spirit gave the doctoral degree   and every member of a company   was of his trade and of the bible free  this was the rule of the sectariesof those whose innovations seemed in the eyes of the tories to be again bursting in upon monarchy and episcopacy with the strength of a landflood dryden therefore at once and heartily reprobates it but the opposite extreme of admitting the authority of the church as omnipotent in deciding all matters of faith he does not give up with the same readiness the extreme convenience nay almost necessity for such authority is admitted in these remarkable lines    such an omniscient church we wish indeed   twere worth both testaments cast in the creed  a wish so forcibly expressed shows a strong desire on the part of the poet to be convinced of the existence of what he so ardently desired and the argument which dryden considers as conclusive against the existence of such an omniscient church is precisely that which a subtle catholic would find little trouble in repelling if there be such a church says dryden why does it not point out the corruption of the canon and restore it where lost the answer is obvious providing that the infallibility of the church be previously assumed for where can the necessity of restoring or explaining scripture if god has given to pope and council the inspiration necessary to settle all doubts in matters of faith dryden must have perceived where this argument led him and he rather compounds with the difficulty than faces it the scripture he admits must be the rule on the one hand but on the other it was to be qualified with the traditions of the earlier ages and the exposition of learned men and he concludes boldly enough    shall i speak plain and in a nation free   assume an honest laymans liberty   i think according to my little skill   to my own motherchurch submitting still   that many have been saved and many may   who never heard this question brought in play   the unlettered christian who believes in gross   plods on to heaven and neer is at a loss   for the strait gate would be made straiter yet   were none admitted there but men of wit  this seems to be a plain admission that the author was involved in a question from which he saw no very decided mode of extricating himself and that the best way was to think as little as possible upon the subject but this was a sorry conclusion for affording firm foundation in religious faith  another doubt appears to have puzzled dryden so much as to lead him finally to the catholic faith for its solution this was the future fate of those who never heard the gospel preached supposing belief in it essential to salvation    because a general law is that alone   which must to all and every where be known  dryden it is true founds upon the mercy of the deity a hope that the benefit of the propitiatory sacrifice of our mediator may be extended to those who knew not of its power but the creed of st athanasius stands in the poets road and though he disposes of it with less reverence to the patriarch than is quite seemly there is an indecision if not in his conclusion at least in his mode of deducing it that shows an apt inclination to cut the knot and solve the objection of the deist by alleging that belief in the christian religion is an essential requisite to salvation  if i am right in these remarks it will follow that dryden never could be a firm or steady believer in the church of englands doctrines the arguments by which he proved them carried him too far and when he commenced a teacher of faith or when as he expresses it his pride struck out new sparkles of its own at that very time while in words he maintained the doctrines of his motherchurch his conviction really hovered between natural religion and the faith of rome it is remarkable that his friends do not seem to have considered the religio laici as expressive of his decided sentiments for charles blount a noted freethinker in consequence of that very work wrote a deistical treatise in prose bearing the same title and ascribed it with great testimony of respect to his muchhonoured friend john dryden esquire3 mr blount living in close habits with dryden must have known perfectly well how to understand his polemical poem and had he supposed it was written under a deep belief of the truth of the english creed can it be thought he would have inscribed to the author a tract against all revelation4 the inference is therefore sufficiently plain that the dedicator knew that dryden was sceptical on the subject on which he had out of compliment to church and state affected a conviction and that his religio laici no more inferred a belief in the doctrines of christianity than the sacrifice of a cock to esculapius proved the heathen philosophers faith in the existence of that divine leech thus far dryden had certainly proceeded his disposition to believe in christianity was obvious but he was bewildered in the maze of doubt in which he was involved and it was already plain that the church whose promises to illuminate him were most confident was likely to have the honour of this distinguished proselyte dryden did not therefore except in outward profession abandon the church of england for that of rome but was converted to the catholic faith from a state of infidelity or rather of pyrrhonism this is made more clear by the words of dryden from which it appears that having once admitted the mysterious doctrines of the trinity and of redemption so incomprehensible to human reason he felt no right to make any further appeal to that fallible guide    good life be now my task my doubts are done   what more could fright my faith than three in one   can i believe eternal god could lie   disguised in mortal mould and infancy   that the great maker of the world could die   and after that trust my imperfect sense   which calls in question his omnipotence  from these lines it may be safely inferred that drydens sincere acquiescence in the more abstruse points of christianity did not long precede his adoption of the roman faith in some preceding verses it appears how eagerly he received the conviction of the churchs infallibility as affording that guide the want of whom he had in some degree lamented in the religio laici    what weight of ancient witness can prevail   if private reason hold the public scale   but gracious god how well dost thou provide   for erring judgments an unerring guide   thy throne is darkness in the abyss of light   a blaze of glory that forbids the sight   o teach me to believe thee thus concealed   and search no farther than thyself revealed   but her alone for my director take   whom thou hast promised never to forsake  we find therefore that drydens conversion was not of that sordid kind which is the consequence of a strong temporal interest for he had expressed intelligibly the imagined desiderata which the church of rome alone pretends to supply long before that temporal interest had an existence neither have we to reproach him that grounded and rooted in a pure protestant creed he was foolish enough to abandon it for the more corrupted doctrines of rome he did not unloose from the secure haven to moor in the perilous road but being tossed on the billows of uncertainty he dropped his anchor in the first moorings to which the winds waves and perhaps an artful pilot chanced to convey his bark we may indeed regret that having to choose between two religions he should have adopted that which our education reason and even prepossessions combine to point out as foully corrupted from the primitive simplicity of the christian church but neither the protestant christian nor the sceptic philosopher can claim a right to despise the sophistry which bewildered the judgment of chillingworth or the toils which enveloped the active and suspicious minds of bayle and of gibbon the latter in his account of his own conversion to the catholic faith fixes upon the very arguments pleaded by dryden as those which appeared to him irresistible the early traditions of the church the express words of the text are referred to by both as the grounds of their conversion and the works of bossuet so frequently referred to by the poet were the means of influencing the determination of the philosopher5 the victorious argument to which chillingworth himself yielded was that there must be somewhere an infallible judge and the church of rome is the only christian society which either does or can pretend to that character  it is also to be observed that towards the end of charles iis reign the high churchmen and the catholics regarded themselves as on the same side in political questions and not greatly divided in their temporal interests both were sufferers in the plot both were enemies of the sectaries both were adherents of the stuarts  alternate conversion had been common between them so early as since milton made a reproach to the english universities of the converts to the roman faith daily made within their colleges of those sheep       whom the grim wolf with privy paw   daily devours apace and nothing said  in approaching dryden therefore a catholic priest had to combat few of those personal prejudices which in other cases have been impediments to their making converts the poet had besides before him the example of many persons both of rank and talent who had adopted the catholic religion  such being the disposition of drydens mind and such the peculiar facilities of the roman churchmen in making proselytes it is by no means to be denied that circumstances in the poets family and situation strongly forwarded his taking such a step his wife lady elizabeth had for some time been a catholic and though she may be acquitted of any share in influencing his determination yet her new faith necessarily brought into his family persons both able and disposed to do so his eldest and best beloved son charles is also said though upon uncertain authority to have been a catholic before his father and to have contributed to his change6 above all james his master to whose fortunes he had so closely attached himself had now become as parsimonious of his favour as his church is of salvation and restricted it to those of his own sect it is more than probable though only a conjecture that dryden might be made the subject of those private exhortations which in that reign were called closeting and predisposed as he was he could hardly be supposed capable of resisting the royal eloquence for while pointing out circumstances of proof that drydens conversion was not made by manner of bargain and sale but proceeded upon a sincere though erroneous conviction it cannot be denied that his situation as poetlaureate and his expectations from the king must have conduced to his taking his final resolution all i mean to infer from the above statement is that his interest and internal conviction led him to the same conclusion  if we are to judge of drydens sincerity in his new faith by the determined firmness with which report retained it through good report and bad report we must allow him to have been a martyr or at least a confessor in the catholic cause if after the revolution like many greater men he had changed his principles with the times he was not a person of such mark as to be selected from all the nation and punished for former tenets supported by the friendship of rochester and most of the tory nobles who were active in the revolution of leicester and many whigs and especially of the lordchamberlain dorset there would probably have been little difficulty in his remaining poetlaureate if he had recanted the errors of popery but the catholic religion and the consequent disqualifications was an insurmountable obstacle to his holding that or any other office under government and drydens adherence to it with all the poverty reproach and even persecution which followed the profession argued a deep and substantial conviction of the truth of the doctrines it inculcated so late as 1699 when an union in opposition to king william had led the tories and whigs to look on each other with some kindness dryden thus expresses himself in a letter to his cousin mrs steward the court rather speaks kindly of me than does anything for me though they promise largely and perhaps they think i will advance as they go backward in which they will be much deceived for i can never go an inch beyond my conscience and my honour if they will consider me as a man who has done my best to improve the language and especially the poetry and will be content with my acquiescence under the present government and forbearing satire on it that i can promise because i can perform it but i can neither take the oaths nor forsake my religion because i know not what church to go to if i leave the catholic they are all so divided amongst themselves in matters of faith necessary to salvation and yet all assuming the name of protestants may god be pleased to open your eyes as he has opened mine truth is but one and they who have once heard of it can plead no excuse if they do not embrace it but these are things too serious for a trifling letter7 if therefore adherence to the communion of a falling sect loaded too at the time with heavy disqualifications and liable to yet more dangerous suspicions can be allowed as a proof of sincerity we can hardly question that dryden was from the date of his conviction a serious and sincere roman catholic  the conversion of dryden did not long remain unrewarded8 nor was his pen suffered to be idle in the cause which he had adopted on the 4th of march 16856 an hundred pounds a year payable quarterly was added to his pension9 and probably he found himself more at ease under the regular and economical government of james than when his support depended on the exhausted exchequer of charles soon after the granting of this boon he was employed to defend the reasons of conversion to the catholic faith alleged by anne hyde duchess of york which together with two papers on a similar subject said to be found in charles iis strong box james had with great rashness given to the public stillingfleet now at the head of the champions of the protestant faith published some sharp remarks on these papers another hand probably that of a jesuit was employed to vindicate against him the royal grounds of conversion while to dryden was committed the charge of defending those alleged by the duchess the tone of drydens apology was to say the least highly injudicious and adapted to irritate the feelings of the clergy of the established church already sufficiently exasperated to see the sacrifices which they had made to the royal cause utterly forgotten the moment that they paused in the extremity of their devotion towards the monarch the name of legion which the apologist bestows on his adversaries intimates the committee of the clergy by whom the protestant cause was then defended and the tone of his arguments is harsh contemptuous and insulting a raker up of the ashes of princes an hypocrite a juggler a latitudinarian are the best terms which he affords the advocate of the church of england in defence of which he had so lately been himself a distinguished champion stillingfleet returned to the charge and when he came to the part of the defence written by dryden he did not spare the personal invective to which the acrimonious style of the poetlaureate had indeed given an opening zeal says stillingfleet in a new convert is a terrible thing for it not only burns but rages like the eruptions of mount etna it fills the air with noise and smoke and throws out such a torrent of living fire that there is no standing before it in another passage stillingfleet talks of the temptation of changing religion for bread in another our authors words that    priests of all religions are the same 10  are quoted to infer that he who has no religion may declare for any dryden took his revenge both on stillingfleet the author and on burnet whom he seems to have regarded as the reviser of this answer in his polemical poem of the hind and the panther  if we can believe an ancient tradition this poem was chiefly composed in a country retirement at rushton near his birthplace in huntingdon northamptonshire there was an embowered walk at this place which from the pleasure which the poet took in it retained the name of drydens walk and here was erected about the middle of last century an urn with the following inscription in memory of dryden who frequented these shades and is here said to have composed his poem of the hind and the panther11  the hind and the panther was written with a view to obviate the objections of the english clergy and people to the power of dispensing with the test laws usurped by james ii a change of political measures which took place while the poem was composing has greatly injured its unity and consistence in the earlier part of his reign james endeavoured to gain the church of england by fair means and flattery to submit to the remission which he claimed the liberty of granting to the catholics the first part of drydens poem is written upon this soothing plan the panther or church of england is            sure the noblest next the hind   and fairest offspring of the spotted kind   oh could her inborn stains be washed away   she were too good to be a beast of prey  the sects on the other hand are characterised wolves bears boars foxesall that is odious and horrible in the brute creation but ere the poem was published the king had assumed a different tone with the established church relying upon the popularity which the suspension of the penal laws was calculated to procure among the dissenters he endeavoured to strengthen his party by making common cause between them and the catholics and bidding open defiance to the church of england for a short time and with the most ignorant of the sectaries this plan seemed to succeed the pleasure of a triumph over their ancient enemies rendering them blind to the danger of the common protestant cause during this interval the poem was concluded and the last book seems to consider the cause of the hind and panther as gone to a final issue and incapable of any amicable adjustment the panther is fairly resigned to her fate    her hour of grace was passed  and the downfall of the english hierarchy is foretold in that of the doves who in a subaltern allegory represent the clergy of the established church    tis said the doves repented though too late   become the smiths of their own foolish fate   nor did their owner hasten their ill hour   but sunk in credit they decreased in power   like snows in warmth that mildly pass away   dissolving in the silence of decay  in the preface as well as in the course of the poem dryden frequently alludes to his dispute with stillingfleet and perhaps none of his poems contain finer lines than those in which he takes credit for the painful exertion of christian forbearance when called by injured feeling to resent personal accusation    if joys hereafter must be purchased here   with loss of all that mortals hold so dear   then welcome infamy and public shame   and last a long farewell to worldly fame   tis said with ease but oh how hardly tried   by haughty souls to human honour tied   o sharp convulsive pangs of agonising pride   down then rebel never more to rise   and what thou didst and dost so dearly prize   that fame that darling fame make that thy sacrifice   tis nothing thou hast given then add thy tears   for a long race of unrepenting years   tis nothing yet yet all thou hast to give   then add those maybe years thou hast to live   yet nothing still then poor and naked come   thy father will receive his unthrift home   and thy blest saviours blood discharge the mighty sum  stillingfleet is however left personally undistinguished but burnet afterwards bishop of salisbury receives chastisement in his stead the character of this prelate however unjustly exaggerated preserves many striking and curious traits of resemblance to the original and as was natural gave deep offence to the party for whom it was drawn for not only did burnet at the time express himself with great asperity of dryden but long afterwards when writing his history he pronounced a severe censure on the immorality of his plays so inaccurately expressed as to be applicable by common construction to the authors private character from this coarse and inexplicit accusation the memory of dryden was indignantly vindicated by his friend lord lansdowne  it is also worth remarking that in the allegory of the swallows introduced in the third part of the hind and the panther the author seems to have had in his eye the proposal made at a grand consult of the catholics that they should retire from the general and increasing hatred of all ranks and either remain quiet at home or settle abroad this plan which originated in their despair of jamess being able to do anything effectual in their favour was set aside by the fiery opposition of father petre the martin of the fable told by the panther to the hind12  the appearance of the hind and the panther excited a clamour against the author far more general than the publication of absalom and achitophel upon that occasion the offence was given only to a party but this open and avowed defence of jamess strides towards arbitrary power with the unpopular circumstance of its coming from a new convert to the royal faith involved our poet in the general suspicion with which the nation at large now viewed the slightest motions of their infatuated monarch the most noted amongst those who appeared to oppose the triumphant advocate of the hind were montague and prior young men now rising into eminence they joined to produce a parody entitled the town and country mouse part of which mr bayes is supposed to gratify his old friends smith and johnson by repeating to them the piece is therefore founded upon the twicetold jest of the rehearsal of the parody itself we have given ample specimen in its proper place there is nothing new or original in the idea which chiefly turns upon the ridiculing the poem of dryden where religious controversy is made the subject of dispute and adjustment between a hind and a panther who vary between their typical character of animals and their real character as the catholic and english church in this piece prior though the younger man seems to have had by far the larger share lord peterborough on being asked whether the satire was not written by montague in conjunction with prior answered yes as if i seated in mr cheseldens chaise drawn by his fine horse should say lord how finely we draw this chaise indeed although the parody was trite and obvious the satirists had the public upon their side and it now seems astonishing with what acclamations this attack upon the most able champion of jamess faith was hailed by his discontented subjects dryden was considered as totally overcome by his assailants they deemed themselves and were deemed by others as worthy of very distinguished and weighty recompence13 and what was yet a more decisive mark that their bolt had attained its mark the aged poet is said to have lamented even with tears the usage he had received from two young men to whom he had been always civil this last circumstance is probably exaggerated montague and prior had doubtless been frequenters of wills coffeehouse where dryden held the supreme rule in criticism and had thus among other rising wits been distinguished by him that he should have felt their satire is natural for the arrow flew with the wind and popularity amply supplied its deficiency in real vigour but the reader may probably conclude with johnson that dryden was too much hackneyed in political warfare to suffer so deeply from the parody as dr lockiers anecdote would lead us to believe if we can suppose him vexed says that accurate judge of human nature we can hardly deny him sense to conceal his uneasiness  although prior and montague were first in place and popularity there wanted not the usual crowd of inferior satirists and poetasters to follow them to the charge the hind and the panther was assailed by a variety of pamphlets by tom brown and others of which an account with specimens perhaps more than sufficient is annexed to the notes on the poem in this edition it is worth mentioning that on this as on a former occasion an adversary of dryden chose to select one of his own poems as a contrast to his latter opinions the religio laici was reprinted and carefully opponed to the various passages of the hind and the panther which appeared most contradictory to its tenets but while the grubstreet editor exulted in successfully pointing out the inconsistency between drydens earlier and later religious opinions he was incapable of observing that the change was adopted in consequence of the same unbroken train of reasoning and that dryden when he wrote the religio laici was under the impulse of the same conviction which further prosecuted led him to acquiesce in the faith of rome  the king appears to have been hardly less anxious to promote the dispersion of the hind i and the panther than the protestant party to ridicule the piece and its author it was printed about the same time at london and in edinburgh where a printingpress was maintained in holyrood house for the dispersion of tracts favouring the catholic religion the poem went rapidly through two or three editions a circumstance rather to be imputed to the celebrity of the author and to the anxiety which foes as well as friends entertained to learn his sentiments than to any disposition to acquiesce in his arguments  but drydens efforts in favour of the catholic cause were not limited to this controversial poem he is said to have been at first employed by the court in translating varillass history of heresies a work held in considerable estimation by the catholic divines accordingly an entry to that purpose was made by tonson in the stationers books of such a translation made by dryden at his majestys command this circumstance is also mentioned by burnet who adds in very coarse and abusive terms that the success of his own remarks having destroyed the character of varillas as an historian the disappointed translator revenged himself by the severe character of the buzzard under which the future bishop of sarum is depicted in the hind and the panther14 the credulity of burnet especially where his vanity was concerned was unbounded and there seems room to trace drydens attack upon him rather to some real or supposed concern in the controversy about the duchess of yorks papers so often alluded to in the poem than to the commentary on varillas which is not once mentioned yet it seems certain that dryden entertained thoughts of translating the history of heresies and for whatever reason laid the task aside he soon after was engaged in a task of a kind as unpromising as remote from his poetical studies and connected in the same close degree with the religious views of the unfortunate james ii this was no other than the translation of the life of st francis xavier one of the last adopted saints of the catholic church at least whose merits and supposed miracles were those of a missionary xavier is perhaps among the latest also whose renown for sanctity and the powers attending it appears to have been extensive even while he was yet alive15 above all he was of the order of jesuits and the very saint to whom mary of este had addressed her vows in hopes to secure a catholic successor to the throne of england16 it was therefore natural enough that dryden should have employed himself in translating the life of a saint whose virtues must at that time have appeared so peculiarly meritorious whose praises were so acceptable to his patroness and whose miracles were wrought for the credit of the catholic church within so late a period besides the work had been composed by bartoli in portuguese and by bouhours in french with the merits of the latter we are well acquainted of the former dryden speaks highly in the dedication it may perhaps be more surprising that the present editor should have retained this translation than that dryden should have undertaken it but surely the only work of this very particular and enthusiastic nature which the modern english language has to exhibit was worthy of preservation were it but as a curiosity the creed and the character of catholic faith are now so much forgotten among us popularly speaking that in reading the life of xavier the protestant finds himself in a new and enchanted land the motives and the incidents and the doctrines are alike new to him and indeed occasionally form a strange contrast among themselves there are few who can read without a sentiment of admiration the heroic devotion with which from the highest principle of duty xavier exposes himself to hardship to danger to death itself that he may win souls to the christian faith the most rigid protestant and the most indifferent philosopher cannot deny to him the courage and patience of a martyr with the good sense resolution ready wit and address of the best negotiator that ever went upon a temporal embassy it is well that our admiration is qualified by narrations so monstrous as his actually restoring the dead to life17 so profane as the inference concerning the sweating crucifix18 so trivial and absurd as a crabs fishing up the saints cross which had fallen into the sea and19 to conclude so shocking to humanity as the account of the saint passing by the house of his ancestors the abode of his aged mother on his road to leave europe for ever and conceiving he did god good service in denying himself the melancholy consolation of a last farewell20 altogether it forms a curious picture of the human mind strung to a pitch of enthusiasm which we can only learn from such narratives and those to whom this affords no amusement may glean some curious particulars from the life of xavier concerning the state of india and japan at the time of his mission as well as of the internal regulations and singular policy adopted by the society of which the saint was a member besides the life of xavier dryden is said to have translated bossuets exposition of the catholic doctrine but for this we have but slight authority21  drydens political and polemic discussions naturally interfered at this period with his more general poetical studies about the period of jamess accession tonson had indeed published a second volume of miscellanies to which our poet contributed a critical preface with various translations from virgil lucretius and theocritus and four odes of horace of which the third of the first book is happily applied to lord roscommon and the twentyninth to lawrence hyde earl of rochester upon these and his other translations garth has the following striking and forcible observations though expressed in language somewhat quaint i cannot pass by that admirable english poet without endeavouring to make his country sensible of the obligations they have to his muse whether they consider the flowing grace of his versification the vigorous sallies of his fancy or the peculiar delicacy of his periods they all discover excellencies never to be enough admired if they trace him from the first productions of his youth to the last performances of his age they will find that as the tyranny of rhyme never imposed on the perspicuity of sense so a languid sense never wanted to be set off by the harmony of rhyme and as his early works wanted no maturity so his latter wanted no force or spirit the falling off of his hair had no other consequence than to make his laurels be seen the more  as a translator he was just as an inventor he was rich his versions of some parts of lucretius horace homer and virgil throughout gave him a just pretence to that compliment which was made to monsieur dablancourt a celebrated french translator it is uncertain who have the greatest obligation to him the dead or the living  with all these wondrous talents he was libelled in his lifetime by the very men who had no other excellencies but as they were his imitators where he was allowed to have sentiments superior to all others they charged him with theft but how did he steal no otherwise than like those who steal beggars children only to clothe them the better  in this reign dryden wrote the first ode to st cecilia for her festival in 1687 this and the ode to the memory of mrs anne killigrew a performance much in the manner of cowley and which has been admired perhaps fully as much as it merits were the only pieces of general poetry which he produced between the accession of james and the revolution it was however about this time that the poet became acquainted with the simple and beautiful hymns of the catholic ritual the only pieces of uninspired sacred poetry which are worthy of the purpose to which they are dedicated it is impossible to hear the dies iræ or the stabat mater dolorosa without feeling that the stately simplicity of the language differing almost as widely from classical poetry as from that of modern nations awes the congregation like the architecture of the gothic cathedrals in which they are chanted the ornaments which are wanting to these striking effusions of devotion are precisely such as would diminish their grand and solemn effect and nothing but the cogent and irresistible propriety of addressing the divinity in a language understood by the whole worshipping assembly could have justified the discarding these magnificent hymns from the reformed worship we must suppose that dryden as a poet was interested in the poetical part of the religion which he had chosen and his translation of veni creator spiritus which was probably recommended to him as being the favourite hymn of st francis xavier22 shows that they did so but it is less generally known that the english catholics have preserved two other translations ascribed to dryden one of the te deum the other of the hymn for st johns eve with which the public are here for the first time presented as the transcripts with which i have been favoured reached me too late to be inserted in the poets works23 i think most of my readers will join with me in opinion that both their beauties and faults are such as ascertain their authenticity    the te deum    thee sovereign god our grateful accents praise   we own thee lord and bless thy wondrous ways   to thee eternal father earths whole frame   with

the secrets of each others breast  a characteristic of jamess administration was rigid economy not only in ordinary matters but towards his own partisansa wretched quality in a prince who was attempting a great and unpopular revolution both in religion and politics and ought by his liberality and even profusion to have attached the hearts and excited the hopes of those fiery and unsettled spirits who are ever foremost in times of national tumult dryden one of his most efficient and zealous supporters and who had taken the step which of all others was calculated to please james received only as we have seen after the interval of nearly a year from that princes accession an addition of £100 to his yearly pension there may however on occasion of the hind and the panther the controversy with stillingfleet and other works undertaken with an express view to the royal interest have been private communications of jamess favour but dryden always ready to supply with hope the deficiency of present possession went on his literary course rejoicing a lively epistle to his friend etherege then envoy for james at ratisbon shows the lightness and buoyancy of his spirits at this supposed auspicious period26  an event deemed of the utmost and most beneficial importance to the family of stuart but which according to their usual illfortune helped to precipitate their ruin next called forth the public gratulation of the poetlaureate this was the birth of that son of prayers prophesied in the dedication to xavier whom the english with obstinate incredulity long chose to consider as an impostor grafted upon the royal line to the prejudice of the protestant succession drydens britannia rediviva hailed with the enthusiasm of a catholic and a poet the very event which removing all hope of succession in the course of nature precipitated the measures of the prince of orange exhausted the patience of the exasperated people and led them violently to extirpate a hated dynasty which seemed likely to be protracted by a new reign the merits of the poem have been considered in the introductory remarks prefixed in this edition27  whatever hopes dryden may have conceived in consequence of the hind and the panther britannia rediviva and other works favourable to the cause of james and of his religion they were suddenly and for ever blighted by the revolution it cannot be supposed that the poet viewed without anxiety the crisis while yet at a distance and perhaps his own tale of the swallows may have begun to bear even to the author the air of a prophecy he is said in an obscure libel to have been among those courtiers who encouraged by frequent visits the camp on hounslow heath28 upon which the king had grounded his hopes of subduing the contumacy of his subjects and repelling the invasion of the prince of orange if so he must there have learned how unwilling the troops were to second their monarch in his unpopular and unconstitutional attempts and must have sadly anticipated the event of a struggle between a king and his whole people when this memorable catastrophe had taken place our author found himself at once exposed to all the insult calumny and sarcasm with which a successful party in politics never fail to overwhelm their discomfited adversaries but what he must have felt yet more severely the unpopularity of his religion and principles rendered it not merely unsafe but absolutely impossible for him to make retaliation his powers of satire at this period were of no more use to dryden than a sword to a man who cannot draw it only serving to render the pleasure of insulting him more poignant to his enemies and the necessity of passive submission more bitter to himself of the numerous satires libels songs parodies and pasquinades which solemnised the downfall of popery and of james dryden had not only some exclusively dedicated to his case but engaged a portion more or less of almost every one which appeared scarce father petre or the papal envoy adda themselves were more distinguished by these lampoons than the poetlaureate the unsparing exertion of whose satirical powers as well as his unrivalled literary preeminence had excited a strong party against him among the inferior wits whose political antipathy was aggravated by ancient resentment and literary envy an extract from one of each kind may serve to show how very little wit was judged necessary by drydens contemporaries to a successful attack upon him29  nor was the pelting of this pitiless storm of abusive raillery the worst evil to which our author was subjected the religion which he professed rendered him incapable of holding any office under the new government even if he could have bended his political principles to take the oaths to william and mary we may easily believe that drydens old friend dorset now lord highchamberlain felt repugnance to vacate the places of poetlaureate and royal historiographer by removing the man in england most capable of filling them but the sacrifice was inevitable drydens own feelings on losing the situation of poetlaureate must have been greatly aggravated by the selection of his despised opponent shadwell as his successor a scribbler whom in macflecknoe he had himself placed preeminent in the regions of dulness being now so far as royal mandate can arrange such precedence raised in his stead as chief among english poets this very remarkable coincidence has led several of drydens biographers and dr johnson among others to suppose that the satire was actually written to ridicule shadwells elevation to the honours of the laurel though nothing is more certain than that it was published while dryden was himself laureate and could be hardly supposed to anticipate the object of his satire becoming his successor shadwell however possessed merits with king william which were probably deemed by that prince of more importance than all the genius of shakespeare milton and dryden if it could have been combined in one individual he was a staunch whig and had suffered under the former government being silenced as a nonconforming poet the doors of the theatre closed against his plays and if he may himself be believed even his life endangered not only by the slow process of starving but some more active proceeding of his powerful enemies30 shadwell moreover had not failed to hail the dawn of the revolution by a congratulatory poem to the prince of orange and to gratulate its completion by another inscribed to queen mary on her arrival in every point of view his principles fidelity and alacrity claimed williams countenance he was presented to him by dorset not as the best poet but as the most honest man politically speaking among the competitors31 and accordingly succeeded to drydens situation as poetlaureate and royal historiographer with the appointment of £300 a year shadwell as might have been expected triumphed in his success over his great antagonist but his triumph was expressed in strains which showed he was totally unworthy of it32  dryden deprived by the revolution of present possession and future hope was now reduced to the same or a worse situation than he had occupied in the year of the restoration his income resting almost entirely upon his literary exertions his expenses increased by the necessity of providing and educating his family and the advantage of his high reputation perhaps more than counterbalanced by the popular prejudice against his religion and party so situated he patiently and prudently bent to the storm which he could not resist and though he might privately circulate a few light pieces in favour of the exiled family as the ladys song33 and the translation of pitcairns beautiful epitaph34 on the viscount of dundee it seems certain that he made no formal attack on the government either in verse or prose those who imputed to him the satires on the revolution called suum cuique and tarquin and tullia did injustice both to his prudence and his poetry the last and probably both satires were written by mainwaring who lived to be sorry for what he had done  the theatre again became drydens immediate resource indeed the very first play queen mary attended was one of our poets which had been prohibited during the reign of james ii but the revival of the spanish friar could afford but little gratification to the author whose newlyadopted religion is so severely satirised in the person of father dominic nor was this illfated representation doomed to afford more pleasure to the personage by whom it was appointed for the audience applied the numerous passages concerning the deposing the old king and planting a female usurper on the throne to the memorable change which had just taken place and all eyes were fixed upon queen mary with an expression which threw her into extreme confusion35  dryden after the revolution began to lay the foundation for a new structure of fame and popularity in the tragedy of don sebastian this tragedy which has been justly regarded as the chefdoeuvre of his plays was not he has informed us huddled up in haste the author knew the circumstances in which he stood while as he expresses it his ungenerous enemies were taking advantage of the times to ruin his reputation and was conscious that the full exertion of his genius was necessary to secure a favourable reception from an audience prepossessed against him and his tenets nor did he neglect to smooth the way by inscribing the piece to the earl of leicester brother of algernon sidney who had borne arms against charles in the civil war and yet whig or republican as he was had taste and feeling enough to patronise the degraded laureate and proscribed catholic the dedication turns upon the philosophical and moderate use of political victory the liberality of considering the friend rather than the cause the dignity of forgiving and relieving the fallen adversary themes upon which the eloquence of the suffering party is usually unbounded although sometimes forgotten when they come again into power with all this deprecatory reasoning dryden does not recede or hint at receding one inch from his principles but concludes his preface with a resolution to adopt the counsel of the classic    tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito  the merits of this beautiful tragedy i have attempted to analyse in another place36 and at considerable length it was brought forward in 1690 with great theatrical pomp37 but with all these advantages the first reception of don sebastian was but cool nor was it until several retrenchments and alterations had been made that it rose to the high pitch in public favour which it maintained for many years and deserved to maintain for ever  in the same year amphitryon in which dryden displays his comic powers to more advantage than anywhere excepting in the spanish friar was acted with great applause calling forth the gratulations even of milbourne who afterwards made so violent an attack upon the translation of virgil the comedy was inscribed to sir william leveson gower whose name well known in the history of the revolution may be supposed to have been invoked as a talisman against misconstructions to which drydens situation so peculiarly exposed him and to which he plainly alludes in the prologue38 our authors choice of this patron was probably dictated by sir william gowers connection with the earl of rochester whose granddaughter he had married  encouraged by the revival of his popularity dryden now ventured to bring forward the opera of king arthur originally designed as an entertainment to charles ii albion and albanius being written as a sort of introductory masque upon the occasion39 when we consider the strong and even violent political tendency of that prefatory piece we may readily suppose that the opera was originally written in a strain very different from the present and that much must have been softened altered and erased ere a play designed to gratulate the discovery of the ryehouse plot could without hazard be acted after the revolution the odious though necessary task of defacing his own labours was sufficiently disgusting to the poet who complains that not to offend the present times nor a government which has hitherto protected me i have been obliged so much to alter the first design and take away so many beauties from the writing that it is now no more what it was formerly than the present ship of the royal sovereign after so often taking down and altering is the vessel it was at the first building persevering in the prudent system of seeking patrons among those whose patronage was rendered effectual by their influence with the prevailing party dryden prefixed to king arthur a beautiful dedication to the marquis of halifax to whose cautious and nice policy he ascribes the nations escape from the horrors of civil war which seemed impending in the latter years of charles ii and he has not failed at the same time to pay a passing tribute to the merits of his original and goodhumoured master the music of king arthur being composed by purcel gave dryden occasion to make that eminent musician some welldeserved compliments which were probably designed as a peaceoffering for the injudicious preference given to grabut in the introduction to albion and albanius40 the dances were composed by priest and the whole piece was eminently successful its good fortune however was imputed by the envious to a lively song in the last act41 which had little or nothing to do with the business of the piece in this opera ended all the hopes which the world might entertain of an epic poem from dryden on the subject of king arthur  our author was by no means so fortunate in cleomenes his next dramatic effort the times were something changed since the revolution the tories who had originally contributed greatly to that event had repented them of abandoning the stuart family and one after another were returning to their attachment to james it is probable that this gave new courage to dryden who although upon the accession of king william he saw himself a member of an odious and proscribed sect now belonged to a broad political faction which a variety of events was daily increasing hence his former caution was diminished and the suspicion of his enemies increased in proportion the choice of the subject the history of a spartan prince exiled from his kingdom and waiting the assistance of a foreign monarch to regain it corresponded too nearly with that of the unfortunate james the scene of a popular insurrection where the minds of a whole people were inflamed was liable to misinterpretation in short the whole story of the spartan cleomenes was capable of being wrested to political and jacobitic purposes and there wanted not many to aver that to such purposes it had been actually applied by dryden neither was the state of our author such at the time as to permit his pleading his own cause the completion of the piece having been interrupted by indisposition was devolved upon his friend southerne who revised and concluded the last act the whispers of the authors enemies in the meantime procured a prohibition at least a suspension of the representation of cleomenes from the lord chamberlain the exertions of hyde earl of rochester who although a tory was possessed necessarily of some influence as maternal uncle to the queen procured a recall of this award against a play which was in every respect truly inoffensive but there was still a more insuperable obstacle to its success the plot is flat and unsatisfactory involving no great event and in truth being only the question whether cleomenes should or should not depart upon an expedition which appears far more hazardous than remaining where he was the grave and stoical character of the hero is more suitable to the french than the english stage nor had the general conduct of the play that interest or perhaps bustle which is necessary to fix the attention of the promiscuous audience of london in a theatre where every man may if he will express his dissatisfaction in defiance of beauxesprits nobles or mousquetaires that which is dull will seldom be long fashionable cleomenes was accordingly coldly received dryden published it with a dedication to lord rochester and the life of cleomenes prefixed as translated from plutarch by creech that it might appear how false those reports were which imputed to him the composing a jacobite play  omitting for the present drydens intermediate employments i hasten to close his dramatic career by mentioning that love triumphant his last play was acted in 1692 with very bad success those who look over this piece which is in truth one of the worst our author ever wrote can be at no loss to discover sufficient reason for its condemnation the comic part approaches to farce and the tragic unites the wild and unnatural changes and counterchanges of the spanish tragedy with the involutions of unnatural and incestuous passion which the british audience has been always averse to admit as a legitimate subject of dramatic pity or terror but it cannot be supposed that dryden received the failure with anything like an admission of its justice he was a veteran foiled in the last of his theatrical trials of skill and retreated forever from the stage with expressions which transferred the blame from himself to his judges for in the dedication to james the fourth earl of salisbury a relation of lady elizabeth and connected with the poet by a similarity of religious and political opinions he declares that the characters of the persons in the drama are truly drawn the fable not injudiciously contrived the changes of fortune not unartfully managed and the catastrophe happily introduced thus leaving were the authors opinion to be admitted as decisive no grounds upon which the critics could ground their opposition the enemies of dryden as usual triumphed greatly in the fall of this piece42 and thus the dramatic career of dryden began and closed with bad success  this section cannot be more properly concluded than with the list43 which mr malone has drawn out of drydens plays with the respective dates of their being acted and published which is a correction and enlargement of that subjoined by the author himself to the opera of prince arthur henceforward we are to consider dryden as unconnected with the stage    plays                       acted by        entered at       published

seven   oclock saw in the firmament three suns with two demirainbows and   all within one whole rainbow in form and shape as here pourtrayed  illustration    the sun towards the left hand bore east and that on the right hand   bore southeast of me i did sit and draw it as well as the time and   place would permit me for it was seen in its full form about the   space of half an hour but part of the rainbow did see above two   hours it appeared first at threequarters past six and was   overclouded at a quarter past seven the wind northbywest  mr gunman the descendant of the captain has lately had a picture on the subject painted by serres the marine painter which makes an interesting historypiece it represents the phenomenon in the heavens the harbour of calaisand the yacht lying off it etc etc  2 this tradition is thus critically examined and proved by mr malone  from a letter written by king james to the prince of orange june 15 1685 it appears that though the duke of monmouth landed at lyme in dorsetshire on thursday evening june 11th an account of his landing did not reach the king at whitehall till saturday morning the 13th the house of commons having met on that day at the usual hour between nine and ten oclock the news was soon afterwards communicated to them by a message from the king delivered by the earl of middleton to whom etheredge afterwards wrote two poetical epistles from ratisbon having voted and drawn up an address to his majesty desiring him to take care of his royal person they adjourned to four oclock in which interval they went to whitehall presented their address and then met again com jour vol ix p 735 about this time therefore it may be presumed the news transpired and in an hour afterwards probably reached the theatre where an audience was assembled at the representation of the opera of albion and albanius for pays at that time began at four oclock it seems from mr luttrells ms note that the first representation of this opera was on saturday the 6th of june and downes roscius ang p 40 says that in consequence of monmouths invasion it was only performed six times so that the sixth representation was without doubt on saturday the 13th of june an examination of dates is generally fatal to tales of this kind here however they certainly support the tradition mentioned in the text life of dryden page 188  3 the expressions in the dedication are such as to preclude all idea but of profound respect sir the value i have ever had for your writings makes me impatient to peruse all treatises that are crowned with your name whereof the last that fell into my hands was your religio laici which expresses as well your great judgment in as value for religion a thing too rarely found in this age among gentlemen of your parts and i am confident with the blessing of god upon your endeavours not unlikely to prove of great advantage to the public since as mr herbert well observes    a verse may find him who a sermon flies   and turn delight into a sacrifice  4 blount preserves indeed that affectation of respect for the doctrines of the established church which decency imposes but the tendency of his work is to decry all revelation it is founded on the noted work of lord herbert of cherbury de veritate  5 i was unable to resist the weight of historical evidence that within the same period most of the loading doctrines of popery were already introduced in theory and practice nor was my conclusion absurd that miracles are the test of truth and that the church must be orthodox and pure which was so often approved by the visible interposition of the deity the marvellous tales which are so boldly attested by the basils and chrysostoms the austins and jeroms compelled me to embrace the superior merits of celibacy the institution of the monastic life the use of the sign of the cross of holy oil and even of images the invocation of saints the worship of relics the rudiments of purgatory in prayers for the dead and the tremendous mystery of the sacrifice of the body and blood of christ which insensibly swelled into the prodigy of transubstantiation in these dispositions and already more than half a convert i formed an unlucky intimacy with a young gentleman of our college whose name i shall spare with a character less resolute mr  had imbibed the same religious opinions and some popish books i know not through what channel were conveyed into his possession i read i applauded i believed the english translations of two famous works of bossuet bishop of meaux the exposition of the catholic doctrine and the history of the protestant variations achieved my conversion and i surely fell by a noble hand i have since examined the originals with a more discerning eye and shall not hesitate to pronounce that bossuet is indeed a master of all the weapons of controversy in the exposition a specious apology the orator assumes with consummate art the tone of candour and simplicity and the tenhorned monster is transformed at his magic touch into the milkwhite hind who must be loved as soon as she is seen in the history a bold and wellaimed attack he displays with a happy mixture of narrative and argument the faults and follies the changes and contradictions of our first reformers whose variations as he dexterously contends are the mark of historical error while the perpetual unity of the catholic church is the sign and test of infallible truth to my present feelings it seems incredible that i should ever believe that i believed in transubstantiation but my conqueror oppressed me with the sacramental words hoc est corpus meum and dashed against each other the figurative halfmeanings of the protestant sects every objection was resolved into omnipotence and after repeating at st marys the athanasian creed i humbly acquiesced in the mystery of the real presence    to take up half on trust and half to try   name it not faith but bungling bigotry   both knave and

thinking that scott is mistaken here i owe it to an accomplished critic of my former work in the saturday review to take more notice than i did in that work of evelyns entry in his diary january 19 1686 dryden the famous playwriter and his two sons and mrs nelly miss to the late king were said to go to mass such proselytes are no great loss to the church i need only say first that it is obviously a mere rumour secondly that it is known to be false as to nell gwynne who abode in that purity of the protestant faith which had already differentiated her from others of charless favourites as evelyns anonymous informer was wrong in one part of his evidence the error vitiates the other it may perhaps be noted here that scotts positive assertion that lady elizabeth had been converted before her husband is based only on a supposition of malonesed  9 the grant bears this honourable consideration which i extract from mr malones work pat 2 jac p 4 n 1 know ye that we for and in

corbet no solid foundation for this tradition is known though there is a certain circumstantial verisimilitude about it rushton was and is in the midst of forest scenery such as the poem describes and it had been the seat of the persecuted roman catholic family of tresham some of whose buildings covered with emblems of their faith survive to this day here perhaps maybe mentioned another of the few local traditions respecting dryden one too which has i think escaped mention as a rule hitherto it was brought to my notice by my friends mrs hubbard and dr sebastian evans that there is a drydens walk at croxall near lichfield i consulted guidebooks and county histories in vain but lysons magna britannia informed me that croxall passed from the curzons to the sackvilles early in the seventeenth century that the family occasionally lived there and that dryden is traditionally said to have visited dorset there croxall is now a station on the midland railway between burton and tamworthed  12 see a long note upon this subject vol x  13 that prior was discontented with his share of preferment appears from the verses entitled earl roberts mice and an angry expostulation elsewhere    my friend charles montagues preferred   nor would i have it long observed   that one mouse eats while tothers starved  there is a popular tradition but no farther to be relied on than as showing the importance attached to the town and country mouse which says that dorset in presenting montague to king william said i have brought a mouse to wait on your majesty i will make a man of him said the king and settled a pension of £500 upon the fortunate satirist  14 the passage as quoted at length by mr malone removes an obscurity which puzzled former biographers at least as far as anything can be made clear which must ultimately depend upon such clumsy diction as the following it the answer of burnet will perhaps be a little longer a digesting to mons varillas than it was a preparing to me one proof will quickly appear whether the world is so satisfied with his answer as upon that to return to any thoughts of his history for i have been informed from england that a gentleman who is known both for poetry and other things had spent three months in translating m varillass history but that as soon as my reflections appeared he discontinued his labour finding the credit of his author was gone now if he thinks it is recovered by his answer he will perhaps go on with his translation and this may be for aught i know as good an entertainment for him as the conversation that he had set on between the hinds and panthers and all the rest of animals for whom m varillas may serve well enough for an author and this history and that poem are such extraordinary things of their kind that it will be but suitable to see the author of the worst poem become likewise the translator of the worst history that the age has produced if his grace and his wit improve both proportionably he will hardly find that he has gained much by the change he has made from having no religion to choose one of the worst it is true he had something to sink from in matter of wit but as for his morals it is scarce possible for him to grow a worse man than he was he has lately wreaked his malice on me for spoiling his three months labour but in it he has done me all the honour that any man can receive from him which is to be railed at by him if i had illnature enough to prompt me to wish a very bad wish for him it should be that he would go on and finish his translation by that it will appear whether the english nation which is the most competent judge in this matter has upon the seeing our debate pronounced in m varillass favour or in mine it is true mr d will suffer a little by it but at least it will serve to keep him in from other extravagancies and if he gains little honour by this work yet he cannot lose so much by it as he has done by his last employment  15 in the staple of news act iii scene 2 jonson talks of the miracles done by the jesuits in japan and china as current articles of intelligence  16 in the dedication to the queen this is stated with a gravity suitable to the occasion the reverend author of this life in his dedication to his most christian majesty affirms that france was owing for him to the intercession of st francis xavier that anne of austria his mother after twenty years of barrenness had recourse to heaven by her fervent prayers to draw down that blessing and addressed her devotions in a particular manner to this holy apostle of the indies i know not madam whether i may presume to tell the world that your majesty has chosen this great saint for one of your celestial patrons though i am sure you will never be ashamed of owning so glorious an intercessor not even in a country where the doctrine of the holy church is questioned and those religious addresses ridiculed your majesty i doubt not has the inward satisfaction of knowing that such pious prayers have not been unprofitable to you and the nation may one day come to understand how happy it will be for them to have a son of prayers ruling over them

bossuet bishop of meaux and published at london in 1685 the only authority for attributing this translation to dryden should seem to have been the following note in bishop barlows handwriting at the bottom of the titlepage of the copy belonging to the bodleian library  by mr dryden then only a poet now a papist too may be he was a papist before but not known till of late  this book had belonged

family  the evil consequences of the revolution upon drydens character and fortunes began to abate sensibly within a year or two after that event it is well known that king williams popularity was as shortlived as it had been universal all parties gradually drew off from the king under their ancient standards the clergy returned to their maxims of hereditary right the tories to their attachment to the house of stuart the whigs to their jealousy of the royal authority dryden we have already observed so lately left in a small and detested party was now among multitudes who from whatever contradictory motives were joined in opposition to the government and some of his kinsmen particularly with john driden of chesterton his first cousin with whom till his death he lived upon terms of uninterrupted friendship the influence of clarendon and rochester the queens uncles were we have seen often exerted in the poets favour and through them he became connected with the powerful families with which they were allied dorset by whom he had been deprived of his office seems to have softened this harsh though indispensable exertion of authority by a liberal present and to his bounty dryden had frequently recourse in cases of emergency1 indeed upon one occasion it is said to have been administered in a mode savouring more of ostentation than delicacy for there is a tradition that dryden and tom brown being invited to dine with the lord chamberlain found under their covers the one a banknote for £100 the other for £50 i have already noticed that these pecuniary benefactions were not held so degrading in that age as at present and probably many of drydens opulent and noble friends took like dorset occasional opportunities of supplying wants which neither royal munificence nor the favour of the public now enabled the poet fully to provide for  if drydens critical empire over literature was at any time interrupted by the mischances of his political party it was in abeyance for a very short period since soon after the revolution he appears to have regained and maintained till his death that sort of authority in wills coffeehouse to which we have frequently had occasion to allude his supremacy indeed seems to have been so effectually established that a pinch out of drydens snuffbox2 was equal to taking a degree in that academy of wit among those by whom it was frequented southerne and congreve were principally distinguished by drydens friendship his intimacy with the former though oddly commenced seems soon to have ripened into such sincere friendship that the aged poet selected southerne to finish cleomenes and addressed to him an epistle of condolence on the failure of the wives excuse which as he delicately expresses it was with a kind civility dismissed from the scene this was indeed an occasion in which even dryden could tell from experience how much the sympathy of friends was necessary to soothe the injured feelings of an author but congreve seems to have gained yet further than southerne upon drydens friendship he was introduced to him by his first play the celebrated old bachelor being put into the poets hands to be revised dryden after making a few alterations to fit it for the stage returned it to the author with the high and just commendation that it was the best first play he had ever seen in truth it was impossible that dryden could be insensible to the brilliancy of congreves comic dialogue which has never been equalled by any english dramatist unless by mr sheridan less can be said for the tragedies of southerne and for the mourning bride although these pieces contain many passages of great interest and of beautiful poetry i know not but they contributed more than even the subsequent homilies of rowe to chase natural and powerful expression of passion from the english stage and to sink it into that maudlin and affected and pedantic style of tragedy which haunted the stage till shakespeare awakened at the call of garrick the fatal marriage of southerne is an exception to this false taste for no one who has seen mrs siddons in isabella can deny southerne the power of moving the passions till amusement becomes bitter and almost insupportable distress but these observations are here out of place addison paid an early tribute to drydens fame by the verses addressed to him on his translations among drydens less distinguished intimates we observe sir henry shere dennis the critic moyle motteux walsh who lived to distinguish the youthful merit of pope and other men of the second rank in literature these as his works testify he frequently assisted with prefaces occasional verses or similar contributions but among our authors followers and admirers we must not reckon swift although related to him3 and now coming into notice it is said that swift had subjected to his cousins perusal some of those performances entitled odes which appear in the seventh volume of the last edition of his works even the eye of dryden was unable to discover the wit and the satirist in the clouds of incomprehensible pindaric obscurity in which he was enveloped and the aged bard pronounced the hasty and never to be pardoned sentence cousin swift you will never be a poet4 a doom which he on whom it was passed attempted to repay by repeated although impotent attacks upon the fame of dryden everywhere scattered through his works with the exception of swift no author of eminence whose labours are still in request has ventured to assail the poetical fame of dryden  shortly after the revolution dryden had translated several satires of juvenal and calling in the aid of his two sons of congreve creech tate and others he was enabled in 1692 to give a complete version both of that satirist and of persius in this undertaking he himself bore a large share translating the whole of persius with the first third sixth tenth and sixteenth satires of juvenal to this version is prefixed the noted essay on satire inscribed to the earl of dorset and middlesex in that treatise our author exhibits a good deal of that sort of learning which was in fashion among the french critics and i suspect was contented rather to borrow something from them than put himself to the trouble of compiling more valuable materials such is the disquisition concerning the origin of the word satire which is chiefly extracted from casaubon dacier and rigault but the poets own incidental remarks upon the comparative merits of horace juvenal and persius his declamation against the abuse of satire his incidental notices respecting epic poetry translation and english literature in general render this introduction highly valuable  without noticing the short prefaces to walshs essay upon woman a meagre and stiff composition and to sir henry sheres wretched translation of polybius published in 1691 and 1692 we hasten to the elegy on the countess of abingdon entitled eleonora this lady died suddenly 31st may 1691 in a ballroom in her own house just then prepared for an entertainment the disconsolate husband who seems to have been a patron of the muses5 not satisfied with the volunteer effusions of some minor poets employed a mutual friend to engage dryden to compose a more beautiful tribute to his consorts memory the poet it would seem neither knew the lord nor the lady but was doubtless propitiated upon the mournful occasion6 nor was the application and fee judged more extraordinary than that probably offered on the same occasion to the divine who was to preach the countesss funeral sermon the leading and most characteristic features of the ladys character were doubtless pointed out to our author as subjects for illustration yet so difficult is it even for the best poet to feign a sorrow which he feels not or to describe with appropriate and animated colouring a person whom he has never seen that drydens poem resembles rather an abstract panegyric on an imaginary being than an elegy on a real character the elegy was published early in 1692  in 1693 tonsons third miscellany made its appearance with a dedication to lord ratcliffe eldest son of the earl of derwentwater who was himself a pretender to poetry though our author thought so slightly of his attempts in that way that he does not even deign to make them enter into his panegyric but contents himself with saying what you will be hereafter may be more than guessed by what you are at present it is probable that the rhyming peer was dissatisfied with drydens unusual economy of adulation at least he disappointed some expectations which the poet and bookseller seem to have entertained of his liberality7 this dedication indicates that a quarrel was commenced between our author and the critic rymer it appears from a passage in a letter to tonson that rymer had spoken lightly of him in his last critique probably in the short view of tragedy and that the poet took this opportunity as he himself expresses it to snarl again he therefore acquaints us roundly that the corruption of a poet was the generation of a critic exults a little over the memory of rymers edgar a tragedy just reeking from damnation and hints at the difference which the public is likely to experience between the present royal historiographer and him whose room he occupied in his epistle to congreve alluding to the same circumstance of rymers succeeding to the office of historiographer as tate did to the laurel on the death of thomas shadwell in 1692 dryden has these humorous lines    o that your brows my laurel had sustained   well had i been deposed if you had reigned   the father had descended for the son   for only you are lineal to the throne   thus when the state one edward did depose   a greater edward in his room arose   but now not i but poetry is cursed   for tom the second reigns like tom the first   but let them not mistake my patrons part   nor call his charity their own desert  from the letter to tonson above referred to it would seem that the dedication of the third miscellany gave offence to queen mary being understood to reflect upon her government and that she had commanded rymer to return to the charge by a criticism on drydens plays but the breach does not appear to have become wider and dryden has elsewhere mentioned rymer with civility  the third miscellany contained of drydens poetry a few songs the first book with part of the ninth and sixteenth books of the metamorphoses and the parting of hector and andromache from the iliad it was also to have had the poem of hero and leander from the greek but none such appeared nor is it clear whether dryden ever executed the version or only had it in contemplation the contribution although ample was not satisfactory to old jacob tonson who wrote on the subject a most mercantile expostulatory letter8 to dryden which is fortunately the minutiae of a literary bargain in the 17th century tonson with reference to dryden having offered a strange bookseller six hundred lines for twenty guineas enters into a question in the rule of three by which he discovers and proves that for fifty guineas he has only 1446 lines which he seems to take more unkindly as he had not counted the lines until he had paid the money from all which jacob infers that dryden ought out of generosity at least to throw him in something to the bargain especially as he had used him more kindly in juvenal which saith the said jacob is not reckoned so easy to translate as ovid what weight was given to this supplication does not appear probably very little for the translations were not extended and as to getting back any part of the copymoney it is not probable tonsons most sanguine expectation ever reached that point perhaps the songs were thrown in as a makeweight there was a fourth miscellany published in 1694 but to this dryden only gave a version of the third georgic and his epistle to sir godfrey kneller the requital of a copy of the portrait of shakespeare9  in 1963 dryden addressed the beautiful lines to congreve on the cold reception of his double dealer he was himself under a similar cloud from the failure of love triumphant and therefore in a fit mood to administer consolation to his friend the epistle contains among other striking passages the affecting charge of the care of his posthumous fame which congreve did not forget when dryden was no more  but independently of occasional exertions our author now retired from the stage had bent his thoughts upon one great literary task the translation of virgil this weighty and important undertaking was probably suggested by the experience of tonson the success of whose miscellanies had taught him the value placed by the public on drydens translations from the classics from hints thrown out by contemporary scheme was meditated even before 1964 but in that year the poet in a letter to dennis speaks of it as under his immediate contemplation the names of virgil and dryden were talismans powerful to arrest the eyes of all that were literary in england upon the progress of the work mr malone has recorded the following particulars concerning it with pious enthusiasm  dr johnson has justly remarked that the nation seemed to consider its honour interested in the event mr gilbert dolben gave him the various editions of his author dr knightly chetwood furnished him with the life of virgil and the preface to the pastorals and addison supplied the arguments of the several books and an essay on the georgics the first lines of this great poet which he translated he wrote with a diamond on a pane of glass in one of the windows of chesterton house in huntingdonshire the residence of his kinsman and namesake john driden esq10 the version of the first georgic and a great part of the last aeneid was made at denham court in buckinghamshire the seat of sir william bowyer baronet and the seventh Æneid was translated at burleigh the noble mansion of the earl of exeter these circumstances which must be acknowledged to be of no great importance i yet have thought it proper to record because they will for ever endear those places to the votaries of the muses and add to them a kind of celebrity which neither the beauties of nature nor the exertions of art can bestow  neither was the liberality of the nation entirely disproportioned to the general importance attached to the translation of virgil by so eminent a poet the researches of mr malone have ascertained in some degree the terms there were two classes of subscribers the first set of whom paid five guineas apiece to adorn the work with engravings beneath each of which in due and grateful remembrance was blazoned the arms of a subscriber this class amounted to one hundred and one persons a list of whom appears in this edition in vol xiii and presents an assemblage of noble names few of whom are distinguished more to their credit than by the place they there occupy the second subscribers were two hundred and fifty in number at two guineas each but from these sums was to be deducted the expense of the engravings though these were only the plates used for ogilbys virgil a little retouched besides the subscriptions it would seem that dryden received from tonson fifty pounds for each book of the georgics and Æneid and probably the same for the pastorals collectively11 on the other hand it is probable that jacob charged a price for the copies delivered to the subscribers which with the expense of the plates reduced drydens profit to about twelve or thirteen hundred poundsa trifling sum when compared to what pope received for the iliad which was certainly between £5000 and £6000 yet great in proportion to what the age of dryden had ever afforded as an encouragement to literature it must indeed be confessed that the revolution had given a new impulse and superior importance to literary pursuits the semibarbarous age which succeeded the great civil war had been civilised by slow degrees it is true the king and courtiers among their disorderly and dissolute pleasures enumerated songs and plays and in the course of their political intrigues held satires in request but they had neither money nor time to spare for the encouragement or study of any of the higher and more elaborate departments of poetry meanwhile the bulk of the nation neglected verse as what they could not understand or with puritanical bigotry detested as sinful the use as well as the abuse of poetical talent but the lapse of thirty years made a material change in the manners of the english people instances began to occur of individuals who rising at first into notice for their proficience in the fine arts were finally promoted for the active and penetrating talents which necessarily accompany a turn towards them an outward reformation of manners at least the general abjuration of grosser profligacy was also favourable to poetry    still first to fly where   sensual joys invade  this was wrought partly by the religious manners of mary partly by the cold and unsocial temper of william who shunned excess not perhaps because it was criminal but because it was derogatory partly by the political fashion of the day which was to disown the profligacy that marked the partisans of the stuarts but most of all by the general increase of good taste and the improvement of education all these contributed to the encouragement of drydens great undertaking which promised to rescue virgil from the degraded version of ogilby and present him in a becoming form to a public now prepared to receive him with merited admiration  while our author was labouring in this great work and the public were waiting the issue with impatience and attention a feud of which it is now impossible to trace the cause arose between the bard and his publisher their union before seems to have been of a nature more friendly than interest alone could have begotten for dryden in one letter talks with gratitude of tonsons affording him his company down to northamptonshire and this friendly intimacy jacob neglected not to cultivate by those occasional compliments of fruit and wine which are often acknowledged in the course of their correspondence but a quarrel broke out between them when the translation of virgil had advanced so far as the completion of the seventh aeneid at which period dryden charges tonson bitterly with an intention from the very beginning to deprive him of all profit by the second subscriptions alluding i presume to the price which the bookseller charged him upon the volumes delivered to the subscribers the bibliopolist seems to have bent before the storm and pacified the incensed bard by verbal submission though probably without relaxing his exactions and drawbacks in any material degree another cause of this dissension appears to have been the notes upon virgil for which tonson would allow no additional emolument to the author although dryden says that to make them good would cost six months labour at least and elsewhere tells tonson ironically that since not to be paid they shall be short for the saving of the paper i cannot think that we have sustained any great loss by tonsons penurious economy on this occasion in his prefaces and dedications dryden let his own ideas freely forth to the public but in his notes upon the classics witness those on juvenal and persius he neither indulged in critical dissertations on particular beauties and defects nor in general remarks upon the kind of poetry before him but contented himself with rendering into english the antiquarian dissertations of dacier and other foreign commentators with now and then an explanatory paraphrase of an obscure passage the parodies of martin scriblerus had not yet consigned to ridicule the verbal criticism and solemn trifling with which the ancient schoolmen pretended to illustrate the classics but beside the dispute about the notes in particular and the various advantages which dryden suspected tonson of attempting in the course of the transaction he seems to have been particularly affronted at a presumptuous plan of that publisher a keen whig and secretary of the kitcat club to drive him into inscribing the translation of virgil to king william with this view tonson had an especial care to make the engraver aggravate the nose of aeneas in the plates into a sufficient resemblance of the hooked promontory of the deliverers countenance12 and foreseeing drydens repugnance to this favourite plan he had recourse it would seem to more unjustifiable means to further it for the poet expresses himself as convinced that through tonsons means his correspondence with his sons then at rome was intercepted13 i suppose jacob having fairly laid siege to his authors conscience had no scruple to intercept all foreign supplies which might have confirmed him in his pertinacity but dryden although thus closely beleaguered held fast his integrity and no prospect of personal advantage or importunity on the part of tonson could induce him to take a step inconsistent with his religious and political sentiments it was probably during the course of these bickerings with his publisher that dryden incensed at some refusal of accommodation on the part of tonson sent him three wellknown coarse and forcible satirical lines descriptive of his personal appearance    with leering looks bullfaced and freckled fair   with two left legs and judascoloured hair   and frowzy pores that taint the ambient air  tell the dog said the poet to the messenger that he who wrote these can write more but tonson perfectly satisfied with this single triplet hastened to comply with the authors request without requiring any further specimen of his poetical powers it would seem however that when dryden neglected his stipulated labour tonson possessed powers of animadversion which though exercised in plain prose were not a little dreaded by the poet lord bolingbroke already a votary of the muses and admitted to visit their high priest was wont to relate that one day he heard another person enter the house this said dryden is tonson you will take care not to depart before he goes away for i have not completed the sheet which i promised him and if you leave me unprotected i shall suffer all the rudeness to which his resentment can prompt his tongue14 but whatever occasional subjects of dissension arose between dryden and his bookseller appears always to have brought them together after the first ebullition of displeasure had subsided there might on such occasions be room for acknowledging faults on both sides for if we admit that the bookseller was penurious and churlish we cannot deny that dryden seems often to have been abundantly captious and irascible indeed as the poet placed and justly more than a mercantile value upon what he sold the trader on his part was necessarily cautious not to afford a price which his returns could not pay so that while in one point of view the author sold at an inadequate price the purchaser in another really got no more than value for his money that literature is ill recompensed is usually rather the fault of the public than the bookseller whose trade can only exist by buying that which can be sold to advantage the trader who purchased the paradise lost for ten pounds had probably no very good bargain15  however fretted by these teasing and almost humiliating discussions dryden continued steadily advancing in his great labour and about three years after it had been undertaken the translation of virgil the most noble and spirited said pope which i know in any language was given to the public in july 1697 so eager was the general expectation that the first edition was exhausted in a few months and a second published early in the next year it satisfied says johnson his friends and for the most part silenced his enemies but although this was generally the case there wanted not some to exercise the invidious task of criticism or rather of malevolent detraction among those the highest name is that of swift the most distinguished for venomous and persevering malignity that of milbourne  in his epistle to prince posterity prefixed to the tale of a tub swift in the character of the dedicator declares upon the word of a sincere man that there is now actually in being a certain poet called john dryden whose translation of virgil was lately printed in a large folio wellbound and if diligent search were made for aught i know is yet to be seen in his battle of the books he tells us that dryden who encountered virgil soothed the good ancient by the endearing title of father and by a large deduction of genealogies made it appear that they were nearly related and humbly proposed an exchange of armour as a mark of hospitality virgil consented though his was of gold and cost an hundred beeves the others but of rusty iron however this glittering armour became the modern still worse than his own then they agreed to exchange horses but when it came to the trial dryden was afraid and utterly unable to mount a yet more bitter reproach is levelled by the wit against the poet for his triple dedication of the pastorals georgics and aeneid to three several patrons clifford chesterfield and mulgrave16 but though the recollection of the contemned odes like the spretae injuria formae of juno still continued to prompt these overflowings of swifts satire he had too much taste and perception of poetry to attempt gravely to undermine by a formal criticism the merits of drydens virgil  this was reserved for luke milbourne a clergyman who by that assurance has consigned his name to no very honourable immortality this person appears to have had a living at great yarmouth17 which dryden hints he forfeited by writing libels on his parishioners and from another testimony he seems to have been a person of no very strict morals18 milbourne was once an admirer of our poet as appears from his letter concerning amphitryon vol viii but either poetical rivalry for he had also thought of translating virgil himself19 or political animosity for he seems to have held revolution principles or deep resentment for drydens sarcasms against the clergy or most probably all these united impelled milbourne to publish a most furious criticism entitled notes on drydens virgil in a letter to a friend and here said he in the first place i must needs own jacob tonsons ingenuity to be greater than the translators who in the inscription of his fine gay title in the front of the book calls it very honestly drydens virgil to let the reader know that this is not that virgil so much admired in the augustaean age an author whom mr dryden once thought untranslatable but a virgil of another stamp of a coarser allay a silly impertinent nonsensical writer of a various and uncertain style a mere alexander ross or somebody inferior to him who could never have been known again in the translation if the name of virgil had not been bestowed upon him in large characters in the frontispiece and in the running title indeed there is scarce the magni nominis umbra to be met with in this translation which being fairly intimated by jacob he needs add no more but si populus vult decipi decipiatur  with an assurance which induced pope to call him the fairest of critics not content with criticising the production of dryden milbourne was so ill advised as to produce and place in opposition to it a rickety translation of his own probably the fragments of that which had been suppressed by drydens version a short specimen both of his criticism and poetry will convince the reader that the powers of the former were as has been often the case neutralised by the insipidity of the latter for who can rely on the judgment of a critic so ill qualified to illustrate his own precepts i take the remarks on the tenth eclogue as a specimen at hazard this eclogue is translated in a strain too luscious and effeminate for virgil who might bemoan his friend but does it in a noble and a manly style which mr ogilby answers better than mr d whose paraphrase looks like one of mrs behns when somebody had turned the original into english prose before  where virgil says    lauri et myricae flevêre  the figures beautiful where mr d says           the laurel stands in tears   and hung with humid pearls the lowly shrub appears  the figure is lost and a foolish and impertinent representation comes in its place an ordinary dewy morning might fill the laurels and shrubs with mr ds tears though gallus had not been concerned in it    and yet the queen of beauty blest his bed  here mr d comes with his ugly patch upon a beautiful face what had the queen of beauty to do here lycoris did not despise her lover for his meanness but because she had a mind to be a catholic whore gallus was of quality but her spark a poor inferior fellow and yet the queen of beauty etc would have followed there very well but not where wanton mr d has fixt her    flushed were his cheeks and glowing were his eyes  this character is fitter for one that is drunk than one in an amazement and is a thought unbecoming virgil    and for thy rival tempts the raging sea   the forms of horrid war and heavens inclemency  lycoris doubtless was a jilting baggage but why should mr d belie her virgil talks nothing of her going to sea and perhaps she had a mind to be only a camp laundress which office she might be advanced to without going to sea the forms of horrid war for horrida castra is incomparable        his brows a country crown   of fennel and of nodding lilies drown  is a very odd figure sylvanus had swinging brows to drown such a crown as that ie to make it invisible to swallow it up if it be a country crown drown his brows it is false english    the meads are sooner drunk with morning dews  rivi signifies no such thing but then that bees should be drunk with flowery shrubs or goats be drunk with brouze for drunks the verb is a very quaint thought  after much more to the same purpose milbourne thus introduces his own version of the first eclogue with a confidence worthy of a better causethat mr dryden might be satisfied that id offer no foul play nor find faults in him without giving him an opportunity of retaliation i have subjoined another metaphrase or translation of the first and fourth pastoral which i desire may be read with his by the original  tityrus  eclogue i    mel beneath a spreading beech you tityrus lie   and country songs to humble reeds apply   we our sweet fields our native country fly   we leave our country you in shades may lie   and amaryllis fair and blythe proclaim   and make the woods repeat her buxom name    tit o melibaeus twas a bounteous god   these peaceful playdays on our muse bestowed   at least hest alway be a god to me   my lambs shall oft his grateful offerings be   thou seest he lets my herds securely stray   and me at pleasure on my pipe to play    mel your peace i dont with looks of envy view   but i admire your happy state and you   in all our farms severe

her hopeful twins she cast   yet had not all ons dull and senseless been   wed long agon this coming stroke foreseen   oft did the blasted oaks our fate unfold   and boding choughs from hollow trees foretold   but say good tityrus tell me whos the god   who peace so lost to us on you bestowd  some critics there were though but few who joined milbourne in his abortive attempt to degrade our poets translation oldmixon celebrated for his share in the games of the dunciad20 and samuel parker21 a yet more obscure name have informed us of this by volunteering in drydens defence but dryden needed not their assistance the real excellencies of his version were before the public and it was rather to clear himself from the malignant charges against his moral principles which melbourne had mingled with his criticism than for any other purpose that the poet deemed his antagonist worthy of the following animadversionmilbourne who is in orders pretends amongst the rest this quarrel to me that i have fallen foul on priesthood if i have i am only to ask pardon of good priests and am afraid his part of the reparation will come to little let him be satisfied that he shall not he able to force himself upon me for an adversary i contemn him too much to enter into competition with him his own translations of virgil have answered his criticisms on mine if as they say he has declared in print he prefers the version of ogilby to mine the world has made him the same compliment for it is agreed on all hands that he writes even below ogilby that you will say is not easily to be done but what cannot milbourne bring about i am satisfied however that while he and i live together i shall not be thought the worst poet of the age it looks as if i had desired him underhand to write so ill against me but upon my honest word i have not bribed him to do me this service and am wholly guiltless of his pamphlet it is true i should be glad if i could persuade him to continue his good offices and write such another critique on anything of mine for i find by experience he has a great stroke with the reader when he condemns any of my poems to make the world have a better opinion of them he has taken some pains with my poetry but nobody will be persuaded to take the same with his if i had taken to the church as he affirms but which was never in my thoughts i should have had more sense if not more grace than to have turned myself out of my benefice by writing libels on my parishioners but his account of my manners and my principles are of a piece with his cavils and his poetry and so i have done with him for ever22  while dryden was engaged with his great translation he found two months leisure to execute a prose version of fresnoys art of painting to which he added an ingenious preface the work of twelve mornings containing a parallel between that art and poetry of which mason has said that though too superficial to stand the test of strict criticism yet it will always give pleasure to readers of taste even when it fails to convince their judgment this version appeared in 1695 mr malone conjectures that our author was engaged in this task by his friends closterman and sir godfrey kneller artists who had been active in procuring subscriptions for his virgil he also wrote a life of lucian for a translation of his works by mr walter moyle sir henry shere and other gentlemen of pretension to learning this version although it did not appear till after his death and although he executed no part of the translation still retains the title of drydens lucian  there was one event of political importance which occurred in december 1695 and which the public seem to have expected should have employed the pen of drydenthis was the death of mary wife of william the third it is difficult to conceive in what manner the poet laureate of the unfortunate james could have treated the memory of his daughter satire was dangerous and had indeed been renounced by the poet and panegyric was contrary to the principles for which he was suffering yet among the swarm of rhymers who thrust themselves upon the nation on that mournful occasion there are few who do not call with friendly or unfriendly voice upon our poet to break silence23 but the voice of praise and censure was heard in vain and drydens only interference was in character of the first judge of his time to award the prize to the duke of devonshire as author of the best poem composed on occasion of the queens death24  virgil was hardly finished when our author distinguished himself by the immortal ode to saint cecilia commonly called alexanders feast there is some difference of evidence concerning the time occupied in this splendid task he had been solicited to undertake it by the stewards of the musical meeting which had for several years met to celebrate the feast of st cecilia their patroness and whom he had formerly gratified by a similar performance in september 1697 dryden writes to his sonin the meantime i am writing a song for st cecilias feast who you know is the patroness of music this is troublesome and no way beneficial but i could not deny the stewards who came in a body to my house to desire that kindness one of them being mr bridgeman whose parents are your mothers friends this account seems to imply that the ode was a work of some time which is countenanced by dr birchs expression that dryden himself observes in an original letter of his that he was employed for almost a fortnight in composing and correcting it25 on the other hand the following anecdote is told upon very respectable authority mr st john afterwards lord bolingbroke happening to pay a morning visit to dryden whom he always respected found him in an unusual agitation of spirits even to a trembling on inquiring the cause i have been up all night replied the old bard my musical friends made me promise to write them an ode for their feast of st cecilia i have been so struck with the subject which occurred to me that i could not leave it till i had completed it here it is finished at one sitting and immediately he showed him this ode which places the british lyric poetry above that of any other nation26 these accounts are not however so contradictory as they may at first sight appear it is possible that dryden may have completed at one sitting the whole ode and yet have employed a fortnight or much more in correction there is strong internal evidence to show that the poem was speaking with reference to its general structure wrought off at once a halt or pause even of a day would perhaps have injured that continuous flow of poetical language and description which argues the whole scene to have arisen at once upon the authors imagination it seems possible more especially in lyrical poetry to discover where the author has paused for any length of time for the union of the parts is rarely so perfect as not to show a different strain of thought and feeling there may be something fanciful however in this reasoning which i therefore abandon to the readers mercy only begging him to observe that we have no mode of estimating the exertions of a quality so capricious as a poetic imagination so that it is very possible that the ode to st cecilia may have been the work of twentyfour hours whilst correction and emendations perhaps of no very great consequence occupied the author as many days derrick in his life of dryden tells us upon the authority of walter moyle that the society paid dryden £40 for this sublime ode which from the passage in his letter above quoted seems to have been more than the bard expected at commencing his labour the music for this celebrated poem was originally composed by jeremiah clarke27 one of the stewards of the festival whose productions where more remarkable for deep pathos and delicacy than for fire and energy it is probable that with such a turn of mind and taste he may have failed in setting the sublime lofty and daring flights of the ode to st cecilia indeed his composition was not judged worthy of publication the ode after some impertinent alterations made by hughes at the request of sir richard steele was set to music by clayton who with steele managed a public concert in 1711 but neither was this a successful essay to connect the poem with the art it celebrated at length in 1736 alexanders feast was set by handel and performed in the theatreroyal covent garden with the full success which the combined talents of the poet and the musician seemed to insure28 indeed although the music was at first less successful the poetry received even in the authors time all the applause which its unrivalled excellence demanded i am glad to hear from all hands says dryden in a letter to tonson that my ode is esteemed the best of all my poetry by all the town i thought so myself when i writ it but being old i mistrusted my own judgment mr malone has preserved a tradition that the father of lord chiefjustice marlay then a templar and frequenter of wills coffeehouse took an opportunity to pay his court to dryden on the publication of alexanders feast and happening to sit next him congratulated him on having produced the finest and noblest ode that had ever been written in any language you are right young gentleman replied dryden a nobler ode never was produced nor ever will this singularly strong expression cannot be placed to the score of vanity it was an inward consciousness of merit which burst forth probably almost involuntarily and i fear must be admitted as prophetic  the preparation of a new edition of the virgil which appeared in 1698 occupied nine days only after which dryden began seriously to consider to what he should next address his pen the state of his circumstances rendered constant literary labour indispensable to the support of his family although the exertion and particularly the confinement occasioned by his studies considerably impaired his health his son charles had met with an accident at rome which was attended with a train of consequences perilous to his health and dryden anxious to recall him to britain was obliged to make extraordinary exertions to provide against this additional expense if it please god he writes to tonson that i must die of overstudy i cannot spend my life better than in preserving his it is affecting to read such a passage in the life of such a man yet the necessities of the poet like the afflictions of the virtuous smooth the road to immortality while milton and dryden were favoured by the rulers of the day they were involved in the religious and political controversies which raged around them it is to hours of seclusion neglect and even penury that we owe the paradise lost the virgil and the fables  among other projects dryden seems to have had thoughts of altering and revising a tragedy called the conquest of china by the tartars written by his ancient friend and brotherinlaw sir robert howard the unkindness which had arisen between them upon the subject of blank verse and rhyme seems to have long since passed away and we observe with pleasure that dryden in the course of the pecuniary transactions about virgil reckons upon the assistance of sir robert howard and consults his taste also in the revisal of the version29 but dryden never altered the conquest of china being first interrupted by the necessity of revising virgil and afterwards perhaps by a sort of quarrel which took place between him and the players of whom he speaks most resentfully in his epistle to granville upon his tragedy of heroic love acted in the beginning of 169830  the success of virgil encouraged dryden about this time to turn his eyes upon homer and the general voice of the literary world called upon him to do the venerable grecian the same service which the roman had received from him it was even believed that he had fixed upon the mode of translation and that he was as he elsewhere expresses it to fight unarmed without his rhyme31 a dubious anecdote bears that he even regretted he had not rendered virgil into blank verse and shows at the same time if genuine how far he must now have disapproved of his own attempt to turn into rhyme the paradise lost the story is told by the elder richardson in his remarks on the tardy progress of miltons great work in the public opinion32 when dryden did translate the first book of homer which he published with the fables he rendered it into rhyme nor have we sufficient ground to believe that he ever seriously intended in so large a work to renounce the advantages which he possessed by his unequalled command of versification that in other respects the task was consonant to his temper as well as talents he has himself informed us my thoughts he says in a letter to halifax in 1699 are at present fixed on homer and by my translation of the first iliad i find him a poet more according to my genius than virgil and consequently hope i may do him more justice in his fiery way of writing which as it is liable to more faults so it is capable of more beauties than the exactness and sobriety of virgil since it is for my countrys honour as well as for my own that i am willing to undertake this task i despair not of being encouraged in it by your favour but this task dryden was not destined to accomplish although he had it so much at heart as to speak of resuming it only three months before his death33  in the meanwhile our author had engaged himself in making those imitations of boccacio and chaucer which have been since called the fables and in spring 1699 he was in such forwardness as to put into tonsons hands seven thousand five hundred verses more or less as the contract bears being a partial delivery to account of ten thousand verses which by that deed he agreed to furnish for the sum of two hundred and fifty guineas to be made up three hundred pounds upon publication of the second edition this second payment dryden lived not to receive with the contents of this miscellaneous volume we are to suppose him engaged from the revisal of the virgil in 1697 to the publication of the fables in march 16991700 this was the last period of his labours and of his life and like all the others it did not pass undisturbed by acrimonious criticism and controversy the dispute with milbourne we noticed before dismissing the subject of virgil but there were two other persons who in their zeal for morality and religion chose to disturb the last years of the life of dryden  the indelicacy of the stage being in its earliest period merely the coarse gross raillery of a barbarous age was probably of no greater injury to the morals of the audience than it is to those of the lower ranks of society with whom similar language is everywhere admitted as wit and humour during the reigns of james i and charles i this licence was gradually disappearing in the domination of the fanatics which succeeded matters were so much changed that far from permitting the use of indelicate or profane allusions they wrapped up not only their most common temporal affairs but even their very crimes and vices in the language of their spiritual concerns luxury was using the creature avarice was seeking experiences insurrection was putting the hand to the plough actual rebellion fighting the good fight and regicide doing the great work of the lord this vocabulary became grievously unfashionable at the reformation and was at once swept away by the torrent of irreligion blasphemy and indecency which were at that period deemed necessary to secure conversation against the imputation of disloyalty and fanaticism the court of cromwell if lampoons can be believed was not much less vicious than that of charles ii but it was less scandalous and as dryden himself expresses it    the sin was of our native growth tis true   the scandal of the sin was wholly new   misses there were but modestly concealed   whitehall the naked goddess first revealed   who standing as at cyprus in her shrine   the strumpet was adored with rites divine  this torrent of licentiousness had begun in some degree to abate even upon the accession of james ii whose manners did not encourage the same general licence as those of charles but after the revolution when an affectation of profligacy was no longer deemed a necessary attribute of loyalty and when it began to be thought possible that a man might have some respect for religion without being a republican or even a fanatic the licence of the stage was generally esteemed a nuisance it then happened as is not uncommon that those most bustling and active to correct public abuses were men whose intentions may without doing them injury be estimated more highly than their talents thus sir richard blackmore a grave physician residing and practising on the sober side of templebar was the first who professed to reform the spreading pest of poetical licentiousness and to correct such men as dryden congreve and wycherly this worthy person compassionating the state to which poetry was reduced by his contemporaries who used their wit in opposition to religion and to the destruction of virtue and good manners in the world resolved to rescue the muses from this unworthy thraldom to restore them to their sweet and chaste mansions and to engage them in an employment suited to their dignity with this laudable view he wrote prince arthur an epic poem published in 1695 the preface contained a furious though just diatribe against the licence of modern comedy with some personal reflections aimed at dry den directly34 this the poet felt more unkindly as sir richard had without acknowledgment availed himself of the hints he had thrown out in the essay upon satire for the management of an epic poem on the subject of king arthur he bore however the attack without resenting it until he was again assailed by sir richard in his satire upon wit written expressly to correct the dissolute and immoral performances of the writers of his time with a ponderous attempt at humour the good knight proposes that a bank for wit should be established and that all which had hitherto passed as current should be called in purified in the mint recoined and issued forth anew freed from alloy  this satire was published in 1700 as the titlepage bears but mr luttrell marks his copy 23rd november 169935 it contains more than one attack upon our author thus we are told wit being previously described as a malady    vanine that looked on all the danger past   because he scaped so long is seized at last   by p by hunger and by dryden bit   he grins and snarls and in his dogged fit   froths at the mouth a certain sign of wit  elsewhere the poet complains that the universities        debauched by dryden and his crew   turn bawds to vice and wicked aims pursue  again p 14    dryden condemn who taught men how to make   of dunces wits an angel of a rake  but the main offence lies in the following passage    set forth your edict let it be enjoined   that all defective species be recoined   st emt and rr both are fit   to oversee the coining of our wit   let these be made the masters of essay   theyll every piece of metal touch and weigh   and tell which is too light which has too much allay   tis true that when the coarse and worthless dross   is purged away there will be mighty loss   een congreve southerne manly wycherly   when thus refined will grievous sufferers be   into the meltingpot when dryden comes   what horrid stench will rise what noisome fumes   how will he shrink when all his lewd allay   and wicked mixture shall be purged away   when once his boasted heaps are melted down   a chestfull scarce will yield one sterling crown   those who will dns melt and think to find   a goodly mass of bullion left behind   do as the hibernian wit who as tis told   burnt his gilt feather to collect the gold                                       but what remains will be so pure twill bear   the examination of the most severe   twill srs scales and talbots test abide   and with their mark please all the world beside  these repeated attacks at length called down the vengeance of dryden who thus retorted upon him in the preface to the fables  as for the city bard or knight physician i hear his quarrel to me is that i was the author of absalom and achitophel which he   thinks is a little hard on his fanatic patrons in london  but i will deal the more civilly with his two poems because nothing ill is to be spoken of the dead and therefore peace be to the manes of his arthurs i will only say that it was not for this noble knight that i drew the plan of an epic poem on king arthur in my preface to the translation of juvenal the guardian angels of kingdoms were machines too ponderous for him to manage and therefore he rejected them as dares did the whirl bats of eryx when they were thrown before him by entellus yet from that preface he plainly took his hint for he began immediately upon the story though he had the baseness not to acknowledge his benefactor but instead of it to traduce me in a libel  blackmore who had perhaps thought the praise contained in his two last couplets ought to have allayed drydens resentment finding that they failed in producing this effect very unhandsomely omitted them in his next edition and received as will presently be noticed another flagellation in the last verses dryden ever wrote  but a more formidable champion than blackmore had arisen to scourge the profligacy of the theatre this was no other than the celebrated jeremy collier a nonjuring clergyman who published in 1698 a short view of the immorality and profaneness of the stage his qualities as a reformer are described by dr johnson in language never to be amended he was formed for a controvertist with sufficient learning with diction vehement and pointed though often vulgar and incorrect with unconquerable pertinacity with wit in the highest degree keen and sarcastic and with all those powers exalted and invigorated by the just confidence in his cause  thus qualified and thus incited he walked out to battle and assailed at once most of the living writers from dryden to durfey his onset was violent those passages which while they stood single had passed with little notice when they were accumulated and exposed together caught the alarm and the nation wondered why it had so long suffered irreligion and licentiousness charge  notwithstanding the justice of this description there is a strange mixture of sense and nonsense in colliers celebrated treatise not contented with resting his objections to dramatic immorality and religion jeremy labours to confute the poets of the 17th century by drawing them into comparison with plautus and aristophanes which is certainly judging of one crooked line by another neither does he omit like his predecessor prynne to marshal against the british stage those fulminations directed by the fathers of the church against the pagan theatres although collier could not but know that it was the performance of the heathen ritual and not merely the action of the drama which rendered it sinful for the early christians to attend the theatre the book was however of great service to dramatic poetry which from that time was less degraded by licence and indelicacy  dryden it may be believed had as his comedies well deserved a liberal share of the general censure but however he might have felt the smart of colliers severity he had the magnanimity to acknowledge its justice in the preface to the fables he makes the amende honorable i shall say the less of mr collier because in many things he has taxed me justly and i have pleaded guilty to all thoughts and expressions of mine which can be truly argued of obscenity profaneness or immorality and retract them if he be my enemy let him triumph if he be my friend as i have given him no personal occasion to be otherwise he will be glad of my repentance it becomes me not to draw my pen in the defence of a bad cause when i have so often drawn it for a good one to this manly and liberal admission he has indeed tacked a complaint that collier had sometimes by a strained interpretation made the evil sense of which he complained that he had too much horseplay in his raillery and that if the zeal for gods house had not eaten him up it had at least devoured some part of his good manners and civility collier seems to have been somewhat pacified by this qualified acknowledgment and during the rest of the controversy turned his arms chiefly against congreve who resisted and spared comparatively at least the sullen submission of dryden36  while these controversies were raging drydens time was occupied with the translations or imitations of chaucer and boccacio among these the character of the good parson is introduced probably to confute milbourne blackmore and collier who had severally charged our author with the wilful and premeditated contumely thrown upon the clergy in many passages of his satirical writings this too seems to have inflamed the hatred of swift who with all his levities was strictly attached to his order and keenly jealous of its honours37 dryden himself seems to have been conscious of his propensity to assail churchmen i remember he writes to his sons the counsel you gave me in your letter but dissembling although lawful in some cases is not my talent yet for your sake i will struggle with the plain openness of my nature and keep in my just resentments against that degenerate order38 milbourne and other enemies of our author imputed this resentment against the clergy to his being refused orders when he wished to take them in the reign of charles with a view to the provostship of eton or some irish preferment39 but dryden assures us that he never had any thoughts of entering the church indeed his original offences of this kind may be safely ascribed to the fashionable practice after the restoration of laughing at all that was accounted serious before that period  and when dryden became a convert to the catholic faith he was we have seen involved in an immediate and furious controversy with the clergy of the church of england thus an unbeseeming strain of raillery adopted in wantonness became aggravated by controversy into real dislike and animosity but dryden in the character of a good parson seems determined to show that he could estimate the virtue of the clerical order he undertook the task at the instigation of mr pepys the founder of the library in magdalen college which bears his name40 and has accomplished it with equal spirit and elegance not forgetting however to make his pattern of clerical merit of his own jacobitical principles  another very pleasing performance which entered into the miscellany called the fables is the epistle to john driden of chesterton the poets cousin the letters to mrs steward show the friendly intimacy in which the relations had lived since the opposition of the whigs to king williams government in some degree united that party in conduct though not in motive with the favourers of king james yet our authors strain of politics as at first expressed in the epistle was too severe for his cousins digestion some reflections upon the dutch allies and their behaviour in the war were omitted as tending to reflect upon king william and the whole piece to avoid the least chance of giving offence was subjected to the revision of montague with a deprecation of his displeasure an entreaty of his patronage and the humiliating offer that although repeated correction had already purged the spirit out of the poem nothing should stand in it relating to public affairs without mr montagues permission what answer fullblown bufo returned to drydens petition does not appear but the authors opposition principles were so deeply woven in with the piece that they could not be obliterated without tearing it to pieces his model of an english member of parliament votes in opposition as his good parson is a nonjuror and the fox in the fable of old chaucer is translated into a puritan41 the epistle was highly acceptable to mr driden of chesterton who acknowledged the immortality conferred on him by a noble present which family tradition states to have amounted to £50042 neither did dryden neglect so fair an opportunity to avenge himself on his personal as well as his political adversaries milbourne and blackmore receive in the epistle severe chastisement for their assaults upon his poetry and private character    what help from arts endeavours can we have   guibbons but guesses nor is sure to save   but maurus sweeps whole parishes and peoples every grave   and no more mercy to mankind will use   than when he robbed and murdered maros muse   wouldst thou be soon despatched and perish whole   trust maurus with thy life and milbourne with thy soul  referring to another place what occurs upon the style and execution of the fables i have only to add that they were published early in spring 1700 in a large folio and with the ode to saint cecilia the epistle to driden of chesterton and a translation of the first iliad must have move than satisfied the mercantile calculations of tonson since they contained seventeen hundred verses above the quantity which dryden had contracted to deliver in the preface the author vindicates himself with great spirit against his literary adversaries makes his usual strong and forcible remarks on the genius of the authors whom he had imitated and in this his last critical work shows all the acumen which had so long distinguished his powers the fables were dedicated to the last duke of ormond the grandson of the barzillai of absalom and achitophel and the son of the heroic earl of ossory friends both and patrons of drydens earlier essays there is something affecting in a connection so honourably maintained and the sentiment as touched by dryden is simply pathetic i am not vain enough to boast that i have deserved the value of so illustrious a line but my fortune is the greater that for three descents they have been pleased to distinguish my poems from those of other men and have accordingly made me their peculiar care may it be permitted me to say that as your grandfather and father were cherished monarchs so i have been esteemed and patronised by the grandfather the father and the son descended from one of the most ancient most conspicuous and most deserving families in europe  there were also prefixed to the fables those introductory verses addressed to the beautiful duchess of ormond43 which have all the easy felicitous and sprightly gallantry demanded on such occasions the incense it is said was acknowledged by a present of £500 a donation worthy of the splendid house of ormond the sale of the fables was surprisingly slow even the death of the author which has often sped away a lingering impression does not seem to have increased the demand and the second edition was not printed till 1713 when dryden and all his immediate descendants being no more the sum stipulated upon that event was paid by tonson to lady sylvius daughter of one of lady elizabeth drydens brothers for the benefit of his widow then in a state of lunacysee appendix vol xviii  the end of drydens labours was now fast approaching and as his career began upon the stage it was in some degree doomed to terminate there it is true he never recalled his resolution to write no more plays but vanbrugh having about this time revised and altered for the drurylane theatre fletchers lively comedy of the pilgrim it was agreed that dryden or as one account says his son charles44 should have the profits of a third night on condition of adding to the piece a secular masque adapted to the supposed termination of the seventeenth century45 a dialogue in the madhouse between two distracted lovers and a prologue and epilogue the secular masque contains a beautiful and spirited delineation of the reigns of james i charles i and charles ii in which the influence of diana mars and venus are supposed to have respectively predominated our author did not venture to assign a patron to the last years of the century though the expulsion of saturn might have given a hint for it the music of the masque is said to have been good at least it is admired by the eccentric author of john buncle46 the prologue and epilogue to the pilgrim were written within twenty days of drydens death 47 and their spirit equals that of any of his satirical compositions they afford us the less pleasing conviction that even the last fortnight of drydens life was occupied in repelling or retorting the venomed attacks of his literary foes in the prologue he gives blackmore a drubbing which would have annihilated any author of ordinary modesty but the knight48 was as remarkable for his powers of endurance as some modern pugilists are said to be for the quality technically called bottom after having been brayed in a mortar as solomon expresses it by every wit of his time sir richard not only survived to commit new offences against ink and paper but had his faction his admirers and his panegyrists among that numerous and sober class of readers who think that genius consists in good intention49 in the epilogue dryden attacks collier but with more courteous weapons it is rather a palliation than a defence of dramatic immorality and contains nothing personally offensive to collier thus so dearly was drydens preeminent reputation purchased that even his last hours were embittered with controversy and nature overwatched and worn out was like a besieged garrison forced to obey the call to arms and defend reputation even with the very last exertion of the vital spirit  the approach of death was not however so gradual as might have been expected from the poets chronic diseases he had long suffered both by the gout and gravel and more lately the erysipelas seized one of his legs to a shattered frame and a corpulent habit the most trifling accident is often fatal a slight inflammation in one of his toes became from neglect a gangrene mr hobbes an eminent surgeon to prevent mortification proposed to amputate the limb but dryden who had no reason to be in love with life refused the chance of prolonging it by a doubtful and painful operation50 after a short interval the catastrophe expected by mr hobbes took place and dryden not long surviving the consequences left life on wednesday morning 1st may 1700 at three oclock he seems to have been sensible till nearly his last moments and died in the roman catholic faith with submission and entire resignation to the divine will taking of his friends says mrs creed one of the sorrowful number so tender and obliging a farewell as none but he himself could have expressed  the death of a man like dryden especially in narrow and neglected circumstances is usually an alarumbell to the public unavailing and mutual reproaches for unthankful and pitiless negligence waste themselves in newspaper paragraphs elegies and funeral processions the debt to genius is then deemed discharged and a new account of neglect and commemoration is opened between the public and the next who rises to supply his room it was thus with dryden his family were preparing to bury him with the decency becoming their limited circumstances when charles montague lord jefferies and other men of quality made a subscription for a public funeral the body of the poet was then removed to the physicians hall where it was embalmed and lay in state till the 13th day of may twelve days after the decease on that day the celebrated dr garth pronounced a latin oration over the remains of his departed friend which were then with considerable state preceded by a band of music and attended by a numerous procession of carriages transported to westminster abbey and deposited between the graves of chaucer and cowley  the malice of drydens contemporaries which he had experienced through life attempted to turn into burlesque these funeral honours farquhar the comic dramatist wrote a letter containing a ludicrous account of the funeral51 in which as mr malone most justly remarks he only sought to amuse his fair correspondent by an assemblage of ludicrous and antithetical expressions and ideas which when accurately examined express little more than the bustle and confusion which attends every funeral procession of uncommon splendour upon this groundwork mrs thomas the corinna of pope and cromwell raised at the distance of thirty years the marvellous structure of fable which has been copied by all drydens biographers till the industry of mr malone has sent it with other figments of the same lady to the grave of all the capulets52 she appears to have been something assisted by a burlesque account of the funeral imputed by mr malone to tom brown who certainly continued to insult drydens memory whenever an opportunity offered53  indeed mrs thomas herself quotes this last respectable authority it must be a wellconducted and uncommon public ceremony where the philosopher can find nothing to condemn nor the satirist to ridicule yet to our imagination what can be more striking than the procession of talent and rank which escorted the remains of dryden to the tomb of chaucer  the private character of the individual his personal appearance and rank in society are the circumstances which generally interest the public most immediately upon his decease  we are enabled from the various paintings and engravings of dryden as well as from the less flattering delineations of the satirists of his time to form a tolerable idea of his face and person in youth he appears to have been handsome54 and of a pleasing countenance when his age was more advanced he was corpulent and florid which procured him the nickname attached to him by rochester55 in his latter days distress and disappointment probably chilled the fire of his eye and the advance of age destroyed the animation of his countenance56 still however his portraits bespeak the look and features of genius especially that in which he is drawn with his waving grey hairs  in disposition and moral character dryden is represented as most amiable by all who had access to know him and his works as well as letters bear evidence to the justice of their panegyric congreves character of the poet was drawn doubtless favourably yet it contains points which demonstrate its fidelity  whoever shall censure me i dare be confident you my lord will excuse me for anything that i shall say with due regard to a gentleman for whose person i had as just an affection as i have an admiration of his writings and indeed mr dryden had personal qualities to challenge both love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him  he was of a nature exceedingly humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with them who had offended him  such a temperament is the only solid foundation of all moral virtues and sociable endowments his friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professions and i have been told of strong and generous instances of it by the persons themselves who received them though his hereditary income was little more than a bare competency  as his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of everything that he had read he was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily promoted or required he was extreme ready and gentle in his correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes he was of very easy i may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others he had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion into any society whatsoever indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable in the other extreme for by that means he was personally less known and consequently his character might become liable both to misapprehensions and misrepresentations  to the best of my knowledge and observation he was of all the men that i ever knew one of the most modest and the most easily to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equals  this portrait is from the pen of friendship yet if we consider all the circumstances of drydens life we cannot deem it much exaggerated for about forty years his character personal and literary was the object of assault by every subaltern scribbler titled or untitled laureated or pilloried my morals he himself has said have been sufficiently aspersed that only sort of reputation which ought to be dear to every honest man and is to me in such an assault no weapon would remain unhandled no charge true or false unurged and what qualities we do not there find excepted against must surely be admitted to pass to the credit of dryden his change of political opinion from the time he entered life under the protection of a favourite of cromwell might have argued instability if he had changed a second time when the current of power and popular opinion set against the doctrines of the reformation as it is we must hold dryden to have acted from conviction since personal interest had that been the ruling motive of his political conduct would have operated as strongly in 1688 as in 1660 the change of his religion we have elsewhere discussed and endeavoured to show that although dryden was unfortunate in adopting the more corrupted form of our religion yet considered relatively it was a fortunate and laudable conviction which led him from the mazes of scepticism to become a catholic of the communion of rome57 it would be vain to maintain that in his early career he was free from the follies and vices of a dissolute period but the absence of every positive charge and the silence of numerous accusers may be admitted to prove that he partook in them more from general example than inclination and with a moderate rather than voracious or undistinguishing appetite it must be admitted that he sacrificed to the belial or asmodeus of the age in his writings and that he formed his taste upon the licentious and gay society with which he mingled but we have the testimony of one who knew him well that however loose his comedies the temper of the author was modest58 his indelicacy was like the forced impudence of a bashful man and rochester has accordingly upbraided him that his licentiousness was neither natural nor seductive dryden had unfortunately conformed enough to the taste of his age to attempt that nice mode of wit as it is termed by the said noble author whose name has become inseparably connected with it but it sate awkwardly upon his natural modesty and in general sounds impertinent as well as disgusting the clumsy phraseology of burnet in passing censure on the immorality of the stage after the restoration terms dryden the greatest master of dramatic poesy a monster of immodesty and of impurity of all sorts the expression called forth the animated defence of granville lord lansdowne our authors noble friend all who knew him said lansdowne can testify this was not his character he was so much a stranger to immodesty that modesty in too great a degree was his failing he hurt his fortune by it he complained of it and never could overcome it he was adds he esteemed courted and admired by all the great men of the age in which he lived who would certainly not have received into friendship a monster abandoned to all sorts of vice and impurity his writings will do immortal honour to his name and country and his poems last as long if i may have leave to say it as the bishops sermons supposing them to be equally excellent in their kind59  the bishops youngest son thomas burnet in replying to lord lansdowne explained his fathers last expressions as limited to drydens plays and showed by doing so that there was no foundation for fixing this gross and dubious charge upon his private moral character  drydens conduct as a father husband and master of a family seems to have been affectionate faithful and so far as his circumstances admitted liberal and benevolent the whole tenor of his correspondence bears witness to his paternal feelings and even when he was obliged to have recourse to tonsons immediate assistance to pay for the presents he sent them his affection vented itself in that manner as a husband if lady elizabeths peculiarities of temper precluded the idea of a warm attachment he is not upbraided with neglect or infidelity by any of his thousand assailants as a landlord mr malone has informed us on the authority of lady dryden that his little estate at blakesley is at this day occupied by one harriots grandson of the tenant who held it in drydens time and he relates that his grandfather was used to take great pleasure in talking of our poet he was he said the easiest and the kindest landlord in the world and never raised the rent during the whole time he possessed the estate  some circumstances however may seem to degrade so amiable a private so sublime a poetical character the licence of his comedy as we have seen had for it only the apology of universal example and must be lamented though not excused let us however remember that if in the heyday of the merry monarchs reign dryden ventured to maintain that the prime end of poetry being pleasure the muses ought not to be fettered by the chains of strict decorum yet in his more advanced and sober mood he evinced sincere repentance for his trespass by patient and unresisting submission to the coarse and rigorous chastisement of collier if it is alleged that in the fury of his loyal satire he was not always solicitous concerning its justice let us make allowance for the prejudice of party and consider at what advantage after the laps of more than a century and through the medium of impartial history we now view characters who were only known to their contemporaries as zealous partisans of an opposite and detested faction the moderation of drydens reprisals when provoked by the grossest calumny and personal insult ought also to plead in his favour of the hundreds who thus assailed not only his literary but his moral reputation he has distinguished settle and shadwell alone by an elaborate retort those who look into mr luttrells collections will at once see the extent of drydens sufferance and the limited nature of his retaliation  the extreme flattery of drydens dedications has been objected to him as a fault of an opposite description and perhaps no writer has equalled him in the profusion and elegance of his adulation of this kind of meanness says johnson he never seems to decline the practice or lament the necessity he considers the great as entitled to encomiastic homage and brings praise rather as a tribute than a gift more delighted with the fertility of his invention than mortified by the prostitution of his judgment it may be noticed in palliation of this heavy charge that the form of address to superiors must be judged of by the manners of the times and that the adulation contained in dedications was then as much a matter of course as the words of submissive style which still precede the subscription dryden considered his panegyrics as merely conforming with the fashion of the day and rendering unto caesar the things which were caesarsattended with no more degradation than the payment of any other tribute to the forms of politeness and usage of the world  of drydens general habits of life we can form a distinct idea from the evidence assembled by mr malone his mornings were spent in study he dined with his family probably about two oclock after dinner he went usually to wills coffeehouse the famous rendezvous of the wits of the time where he had his established chair by the chimney in winter and near the balcony in summer whence he pronounced ex cathedra his opinion upon new publications and in general upon all matters of dubious criticism60 latterly all who had occasion to ridicule or attack him represent him as presiding in this little senate61 his opinions however were not maintained with dogmatism and we have an instance in a pleasing anecdote told by dr lockier62 that dryden readily listened to criticism provided it was just from whatever unexpected and undignified quarter it happened to come in general however it may be supposed that few ventured to dispute his opinion or place themselves of his censure he was most falsely accused of carrying literary jealousy to such a length as feloniously to encourage creech to venture on a translation of horace that he might lose the character he had gained by a version of lucretius but this is positively contradicted upon the authority of southerne63  we have so often stopped in our narrative of drydens life to notice the respectability of his general society that little need here be said on the subject although no enemy to conviviality he is pronounced by pope to have been regular in his hours in comparison with addison who otherwise lived the same coffeehouse course of life he has himself told us that he was saturnine and reserved and not one of those who endeavour to entertain company by lively sallies of merriment and wit and an adversary has put into his mouth this couplet    nor wine nor love could ever see me gay   to writing bred i knew not what to say  drydens satire to his muse  but the admission of the author and the censure of the satirist must be received with some limitation dryden was thirty years old before he was freed from the fetters of puritanism and if the habits of lively expression in society are not acquired before that age they are seldom gained afterward but this applies only to the deficiency of repartee in the sharp encounter of wit which was fashionable at the court of charles and cannot be understood to exclude drydens possessing the more solid qualities of agreeable conversation arising from a memory profoundly stocked with knowledge and a fancy which supplied modes of illustration faster than the author could use them64 some few sayings of dryden have been however preserved which if not witty are at least jocose he is said to have been the original author of the repartee to the duke of buckingham who in bowling offered to lay his soul to a turnip or something still more vile give me the odds said dryden and i take the bet when his wife wished to be a book that she might enjoy more of his company be an almanac then my dear said the poet that i may change you once a year65 another time a friend expressing his astonishment that even durfey could write such stuff as a play they had just witnessed ah sir replied dryden you do not know my friend tom so well as i do ill answer for him he can write worse yet none of these anecdotes intimate great brilliancy of repartee but that dryden possessed of such a fund of imagination and acquired learning should be dull in conversation is impossible he is known frequently to have regaled his friends by communicating to them a part of his labours but his poetry suffered by his recitation he read his productions very ill66 owing perhaps to the modest reserve of his temper which prevented his showing an animation in which he feared his audience might not participate the same circumstance may have repressed the liveliness of his conversation i know not however whether we are with mr malone to impute to diffidence his general habit of consulting his literary friends upon his poems before they became public since it might as well arise from a wish to anticipate and soften criticism67  of drydens learning his works form the best proof he had read polybius before he was ten years of age68 and was doubtless well acquainted with the greek and roman classics but from these studies he could descend to read romances and the present editor records with pride that dryden was a decided admirer of old ballads and popular tales69 his researches sometimes extended into the vain province of judicial astrology in which he was a firm believer and there is reason to think that he also credited divination by dreams in the country he delighted in the pastime of fishing and used says mr malone to spend some time with mr jones of ramsden in wiltshire durfey was sometimes of this party but dryden appears to have undervalued his skill in fishing as much as his attempts at poetry hence fenton in his epistle to mr lambard    by long experience durfey may no doubt   ensnare a gudgeon or sometimes a trout   yet dryden once exclaimed in partial spite   he fishbecause the man attempts to write  i may conclude this notice of drydens habits which i have been enabled to give chiefly by the researches of mr malone with two notices of a minute nature dryden was a great taker of snuff which he made himself moreover as a preparation to a course of study he usually took medicine and observed a cooling diet70  drydens house which he appears to have resided in from the period of his marriage till his death was in gerrard street the fifth on the left hand coming from little newport street71 the back windows looked upon the gardens of leicester house of which circumstance our poet availed himself to pay a handsome compliment to the noble owner72 his excursions to the country seem to have been frequent perhaps the more so as lady elizabeth always remained in town in his latter days the friendship of his relations john driden of chesterton and mrs steward of cotterstock rendered their houses agreeable places of abode to the aged poet they appear also to have had a kind solicitude about his little comforts of value infinitely beyond aiding them and thus concludes all that we have learned of the private life of dryden  the fate of drydens family must necessarily interest the admirers of english literature it consisted of his wife lady elizabeth dryden and three sons john charles and erasmus henry upon the poets death it may be believed they felt themselves slenderly provided for since all his efforts while alive were necessary to secure them from the gripe of penury  yet their situation was not very distressing john and erasmus henry were abroad and each had an office at rome in which he was able to support himself charles had for some time been entirely dependent on his father and administered to his effects as he died without a will the liberality of the duchess of ormond and of driden of chesterton had been lately received and probably was not expended there was besides the poets little patrimonial estate and a small property in wiltshire which the earl of berkshire settled upon lady elizabeth at her marriage and which yielded £50 or £60 annually there was therefore an income of about £100 a year to maintain the poets widow and children enough in these times to support them in decent frugality  lady elizabeth drydens temper had long disturbed her husbands domestic happiness his invectives says mr malone against the married state are frequent and bitter and were continued to the latest period of his life and he adds from most respectable authority that the family of the poet held no intimacy with his lady confining their intercourse to mere visits of ceremony73 a similar alienation seems to have taken place between her and her own relations sir robert howard perhaps being excepted for her brother the honourable edward howard talks of virgil as a thing he had learned merely by common report74 her wayward disposition was however the effect of a disordered imagination which shortly after drydens death degenerated into absolute insanity in which state she remained until her death in summer 1714 probably says mr malone in the seventyninth year of her life  drydens three sons says the inscription by mrs creed were ingenious and accomplished gentlemen charles the eldest and favourite son of the poet was born at charlton wiltshire in 1666 he received a classical education under dr busby his fathers preceptor and was chosen kings scholar in 1680 being elected to trinity college in cambridge he was admitted a member in 1683 it would have been difficult to conceive that the son of dryden should not have attempted poetry but though charles dryden escaped the fate of icarus he was very very far from emulating his fathers soaring flight mr malone has furnished a list of his compositions in latin and english75 about 1692 he went to italy and through the interest of cardinal howard to whom he was related by the mothers side he became chamberlain of the household not as corinna pretends to that remarkably fine gentleman pope clement xi but to pope innocent xii his way to this preferment was smoothed by a pedigree drawn up in latin by his father of the families of dryden and howard which is said to have been deposited in the vatican dryden whose turn for judicial astrology we have noticed had calculated the nativity of his son charles and it would seem that a part of his predictions were fortuitously fulfilled charles however having suffered while at rome by a fall and his health in consequence being much injured his father prognosticated he would begin to recover in the month of september 1697 the issue did no great credit to the prediction for young dryden returned to england in 1698 in the same indifferent state of health as is obvious from the anxious solicitude with which his father always mentions charles in his correspondence upon the poets death charles we have seen administered to his effects on 10th june 1700 lady elizabeth his mother renouncing the succession in the next year granville conferred on him the profits arising from the authors night of an alteration of shakespeares merchant of venice and his liberality to the son of one great bard may be admitted to balance his presumption in manufacturing a new drama out of the labours of another76 upon the 20th august 1704 charles dryden was drowned in an attempt to swim across the thames at datchet near windsor i have degraded into the appendix the romantic narrative of corinna concerning his fathers prediction already mentioned it contains like her account of the funeral of the poet much positive falsehood and gross improbability with some slight scantling of foundation in fact  john dryden the poets second son was born in 1667 or 1668 was admitted a kings scholar in westminster in 1682 and elected to oxford in 1685 here he became a private pupil of the celebrated obadiah walker master of university college a roman catholic it seems probable that young dryden became a convert to that faith before his father his religion making it impossible for him to succeed in england he followed his brother charles to rome where he officiated as his deputy in the popes household john dryden translated the fourteenth satire of juvenal published in his fathers version and wrote a comedy entitled the husband his own cuckold acted in lincolns inn fields in 1696 dryden the father furnishing a prologue and congreve an epilogue in 17001 he made a tour through sicily and malta and his journal was published in 1706 it seems odd that in the whole course of his journal he never mentions his fathers name nor makes the least allusion to his very recent death john dryden the younger died at rome soon after this excursion  erasmus henry drydens third son was born 2d may 1669 and educated in the charterhouse to which he was nominated by charles ii shortly after the publication of absalom and achitophel77 he does not appear to have been at any university probably his religion was the obstacle like his brothers he went to rome and as both his father and mother request his prayers we are to suppose he was originally destined for the church but he became a captain in the popes guards and remained at rome till john dryden his elder brothers death after this event he seems to have returned to england and in 1708 succeeded to the title of baronet as representative of sir erasmus driden the authors grandfather but the estate of canonsashby which should have accompanied the title had been devised by sir robert driden the poets first cousin to edward dryden the eldest son of erasmus the younger brother of the poet thus if the author had lived a few years longer his pecuniary embarrassments would have been embittered by his succeeding to the honours of his family without any means of sustaining the rank they gave him with this edward dryden sir erasmus henry seems to have resided until his death which took place at the family mansion of canonsashby in 1710 edward acted as a manager of his cousins affairs and mr malone sees reason to think from their mode of accounting that sir erasmus henry had like his mother been visited with mental derangement before his death and had resigned into edwards hands the whole management of his concerns thus ended the poets family none of his sons surviving him above ten years the estate of canonsashby became again united to the title in the person of john dryden the surviving brother78  footnotes  1 such i understand is the general purport of some letters of drydens in possession of the dorset family which contain certain particulars rendering them unfit for publication our author himself commemorates dorsets generosity in the essay on satire in the following affecting passage though i must ever acknowledge to the honour of your lordship and the eternal memory of your charity that since this revolution wherein i have patiently suffered the ruin of my small fortune and the loss of that poor subsistence which i had from two kings whom i had served more faithfully than profitably to myself then your lordship was pleased out of no other motive but your own nobleness without any desert of mine or the least solicitation from me to make me a most bountiful present which at that time when i was most in want of it came most seasonably and unexpectedly to my relief that favour my lord is of itself sufficient to bind any grateful man to a perpetual acknowledgment and to all the future service which one of my mean condition can be ever able to perform may the almighty god return it for me

pitied mr malone traces their consanguinity to swifts grandmother elizabeth dryden being the daughter of a brother of sir erasmus driden the poets grandfather so that the dean of st patricks was the son of drydens second cousin which in scotland would even yet be deemed a near relation the passages in prose and verse in which swift reflects on dryden are various he mentions in his best poem the

sufferings to changes of opinion to political controversies and a peaceful consciences cannot be mistaken the piece was probably composed flagrante odio for it occurs in the introduction to the tale of a tub which was written about 1692 these notices may serve to give the learned reader an idea as well as taste of what the whole work is likely to produce wherein i have now altogether circumscribed my thoughts and my studies and if i can bring it to a perfection before i die i shall reckon i have well employed the poor remains of an unfortunate life this indeed is more than i can justly expect from a quill worn to the pith in the service of the state in pros and cons upon popish plots and meal tubs and exclusion bills and passive obedience and addresses of lives and fortunes and prerogative and property and liberty of conscience and letters to a friend from an understanding and a conscience threadbare and ragged with perpetual turning from a head broken in a hundred places by the malignants of the opposite factions and from a body spent with poxes ill cured by trusting to bawds and surgeons who as it afterwards appeared were professed enemies to me and the government and revenged their partys quarrel upon my nose and shins fourscore and eleven pamphlets have i written under three reigns and for the service of six and thirty factions but finding the state has no farther occasion for me and my ink i retire willingly to draw it out into speculations more becoming a philosopher having to my unspeakable comfort passed a long life with a conscience void of offence see appendix vol xviii art dryden and swifted  4 the exact sentence seems to have been a pindaric poet but as swift had tried nothing but pindarics it was nearly if not quite as severe

of abingdon and it contains some pieces addressed to him and to his lady he survived also to compose on the earls death in 1700 the mourning swan an eclogue to his memory in which a shepherd gives the

letters have miscarried for this last year but however he has missed of his design in the dedication though he had prepared the book for it for in every figure of aeneas he has caused him to be drawn like king william with a hooked nose dryden hints to tonson himself his suspicion of this unworthy device desiring him to forward a letter to his son charles but not by post being satisfied that

paradise lost seems to provoke unfounded commonplaces from even the most unexpected sourcesed  16 i confess to have been somewhat liberal in the business of titles having observed the humour of multiplying them to bear great vogue among certain writers whom i exceedingly reverence and indeed it seems not unreasonable that books the children of the brain should have the honour to be christened with variety of names as well as other infants of quality our famous dryden has ventured to proceed a point farther endeavouring to introduce also a multiplicity of godfathers which is an improvement of much more advantage upon a very obvious account it is a pity this admirable invention has not been better cultivated so as to grow by this time into general imitation when such an authority serves it for a precedent nor have my endeavours been wanting to second so useful an example but it seems there is an unhappy expense usually annexed to the calling of a godfather which was clearly out of my head as it is very reasonable to believe where the pinch lay i cannot certainly affirm but having employed a world of thoughts and pains to split my treatise into forty sections and having entreated forty lords of my acquaintance that they would do me the honour to stand they all made it a matter of conscience and sent me their excuses  17 besides the notes on virgil he wrote many single sermons and a metrical version of the psalms and died in 1720  18 he is described as a rake in the pacificator a poem bought by mr luttrell 15th feb 16991700 which gives an account of a supposed battle between the men of wit and men of sense as the poet calls them    mn a renegade from wit came on   and made a false attack and next to none   the hypocrite in sense could not conceal   what pride and want of brains obliged him to reveal   in him the critics ruined by the poet   and virgil gives his testimony to it   the troops of wit were so enraged to see   this priest invade his own fraternity   they sent a party out by silence led   and without answer shot the turncoat dead   the priest the rake the wit strove all in vain   for there alas he lies among the slain   memento

long continued a stranger to tolerable english mr milbourne pitied his hard fate and seeing that several great men had undertaken some episodes of his aeneis without any design of englishing the whole

guilty of the fault they lay to his charge and shown us what we are to expect from them were their names as well settled as his if i had qualifications enough to do it successfully i should advise them to write more naturally delicately and reasonably themselves before they attack mr drydens reputation and to think there is something more necessary to make a man write well than the favour of

play he made   tis so disguised in death nor thinks tis he   that suffers in the mangled tragedy   thus itys first was killed and after dressed   for his own sire the chief invited guest  this gave great offence to the players one of whom powell made a petulant retort which the reader will find in a note upon the epistle itself vol xi  31 milbourne in a note on that passage in the dedication to the aeneidhe who can write well in rhyme may write better in blank verse sayswe shall know that when we see how much better drydens homer will be than his virgil  32  much the same character he gave

with speaking so loftily of it why mr dryden says he sir wl told me the thing himself tis not in rhyme no replied dryden nor would i have done virgil in rhyme if i was to begin it againthis conversation is supposed by mr malone to have been held with sir wilfrid lawson of isell in cumberland  33 see a letter to mrs thomas vol xviii  34 some of these poets to excuse their guilt allege for themselves that the degeneracy of the age makes their lewd way of writing necessary they pretend the auditors will not be pleased unless they are thus entertained from the stage and to please they say is the chief business of the poet but this is by no means a just apology it is not true as was said before that the poets chief business is to please his chief business is to instruct to make mankind wiser and better and in order to this his care should be to please and entertain the audience with all the wit and art he is master of aristotle and horace and all their critics and commentators all men of wit and sense agree that this is the end of poetry but they say it is their profession to write for the stage and that poets must starve if they will not in this way humour the audience the theatre will be as unfrequented as the churches and the poet and the parson equally neglected let the poet then abandon his profession and take up some honest lawful calling where joining industry to his great wit he may soon get above the complaints of poverty so common among these ingenious men and lie under no necessity of prostituting his wit to any such vile purposes as are here censured this willbe a course of life more profitable and honourable to himself and more useful to others and there are among these writers some who think they might have risen to the highest dignities in other professions had they employed their wit in those ways it is a mighty dishonour and reproach to any man that is capable of being useful to the world in any liberal and virtuous profession to lavish out his life and wit in propagating vice and corruption of manners and in battering from the stage the strongest entrenchments and best works of religion and virtue whoever makes this his choice when the other was in his power may he go off the stage unpitied complaining of neglect and poverty the just punishments of his irreligion and folly  35  mr malone conceives that the fables were published before the satire upon wit but he had not this evidence of the contrary before him it is therefore clear that dryden endured a second attack from blackmore before making any reply  36  since scott wrote the colliercongreve controversy has been the subject of wellknown essays by lamb hazlitt leigh hunt and macaulay very recently a fresh and excellent account of colliers book has appeared in ma beljames le public et les hommes de lettres en angleterre au xviiième siecle paris hachette 1881 a remarkable volume to which and to its author i owe muched  37 in his apology for the tale of a tub he points out to the resentment of the clergy those heavy illiterate scribblers prostitute in their reputations vicious in their lives and ruined in their fortunes who to the shame of good sense as well as piety are greedily read merely upon the strength of bold false impious assertions mixed with unmannerly reflections on the priesthood and after no great interval he mentions the passage quoted p 375 in which dryden lestrange and some others i shall not name are levelled at who having spent their lives in faction and apostasies and all manner of vice pretended to be sufferers for loyalty and religion so dryden tells us in one of his prefaces of his merits and sufferings and thanks god that he possesses his soul in patience in other places he talks at the same rate  38 vol xviii  39 thus in a lampoon already quoted footnote 29 section vi    quitting my duller hopes the poor renown    of eton college or a dublin gown   tom brown makes the charge more directly but prithee why so severe always on the priesthood mr bayes what have they merited to pull down your indignation i thought the ridiculing men of that character upon the stage was by this time a topic as much worn out with you

peculiarly tempting to a satirist how is it possible to forgive baxter for the affectation with which he records the enormities of his childhood  though my conscience says he would trouble me when i sinned yet divers sins i was addicted to and oft committed against my conscience which for the warning of others i will here confess to my shame i was much addicted to the excessive gluttonous eating of apples and pears which i think laid the foundation of the imbecility and flatulency of my stomach which caused the bodily calamities of my life to this end and to concur with naughty boys that gloried in evil i have oft gone into other mens orchards and stolen the fruit when i had enough at home there are six other retractions of similar enormities when he concludes these were my sins in my childhood as to which conscience troubled me for a great while before they were overcome baxter was a pious and worthy man but can any one read this confession without thinking of tartuffe who subjected himself to penance for killing a flea with too much anger  42 see vol xviii mr malone thinks tradition has confounded a present made to the poet himself probably of £100 with a legacy

set by dr boyce and in 1749 performed in the drurylane theatre with great success  47 by a letter to mrs steward dated the 11th april 1700 it appears they were then only in his contemplation and the

independently of the extreme improbability of the whole story it is clear from wards account written at the time that lord jefferies who it is pretended interrupted the funeral did in fact largely contribute to it this also appears from a paragraph in a letter from doctor afterwards bishop tanner dated may 6th 1700 and thus given by mr malonemr dryden died a papist if at all a christian mr

always brings out of the country with one however in spite of my bashfulness and appearance i used now and then to thrust myself into wills to have the pleasure of seeing the most celebrated wits of that time who used to resort thither the second time that ever i was there mr dryden was speaking of his own things as he frequently did especially of such as had been lately published if anything of mine is good says he tis my macflecknoe and i value myself the more on it because it is the first piece of ridicule written in heroics lockier overhearing this plucked up his spirit so far as to say in a voice just loud enough to be heard that macflecknoe was a very fine poem but that he had not imagined it to be the first that ever was wrote that way on this dryden turned short upon him as surprised at his interposing asked him how long he had been a dealer in poetry and added with a smilebut pray sir what is it that you did imagine to have been writ so before lockier named boileaus lutrin and tassonis secchia rapita which he had read and knew dryden had borrowed some strokes from each tis true says drydeni had forgot them a little after dryden went out and in going spoke to lockier again and desired him to come to him the next day lockier was highly delighted with the invitation and was well acquainted with him as long as he livedmalone vol i p 481  63 i have often heard says mr george russell that mr dryden dissatisfied and envious at the reputation creech obtained by his translation of lucretius purposely advised him to undertake horace to which he knew him unequal that he might by his ill performance lose the fame he had acquired mr southerne author of oroonoko set me right as to the conduct of mr dryden in this affair affirming that being one evening at mr drydens lodgings in company with mr creech and some other ingenious men mr creech told the company of his design to translate horace from which mr dryden with many arguments dissuaded him as an attempt which his genius was not adapted to and which would risk his losing the good opinion the world had of him by his successful translation of lucretius i thought it proper to acquaint you with this circumstance since it rescues the fame of one of our greatest poets from the imputation of envy and malevolence see also upon this subject a note in vol viii yet jacob tonson told spence that dryden would compliment crowne when a play of his failed but was cold to him if he met with success he used sometimes to say that crowne had some genius but then he always added that his father and crownes mother were very well acquaintedmalone vol i p 500  64 his conversation is thus characterised by a contemporary writer  o sir theres a medium in all things silence and chat are distant enough to have a convenient discourse come between them and thus far i agree with you that the company of the author of absalom and achitophel is more valuable though not so talkative than that of the modern

 if dryden received but a slender share of the gifts of fortune it was amply made up to him in reputation even while a poet militant upon earth he received no ordinary portion of that applause which is too often reserved for the dull cold ear of death he combated it is true but he conquered and in despite of faction civil and religious of penury and the contempt which follows it of degrading patronage and rejected solicitation from 1666 to the year of his death the name of dryden was first in english literature nor was his fame limited to britain of the french literati although boileau1 with unworthy affectation when he heard of the honours paid to the poets remains pretended ignorance even of his name yet rapin the famous critic learned the english language on purpose to read the works of dryden2 sir john shadwell the son of our authors ancient adversary bore an honourable and manly testimony to the general regret among the men of letters at paris for the death of dryden the men of letters here lament the loss of mr dryden very much the honours paid to him have done our countrymen no small service for next to having so considerable a man of our own growth tis a reputation to have known how to value him as patrons very often pass for wits by esteeming those that are so and from another authority we learn that the engraved copies of drydens portrait were bought up with avidity on the continent3  but it was in england where the loss of dryden was chiefly to be felt it is seldom the extent of such a deprivation is understood till it has taken place as the size of an object is best estimated when we see the space void which it had long occupied the men of literature starting as it were from a dream began to heap commemorations panegyrics and elegies the great were as much astonished at their own neglect of such an object of bounty as if the same had never been practised before and expressed as much compunction as it were never to occur again the poets were not silent but their strains only evinced their woful degeneracy from him whom they mourned henry playford a publisher of music collected their effusions into a compilation entitled luctus britannici or the tears of the british muses for the death of john dryden which he published about two months after drydens death4 nine ladies assuming each the character of a muse and clubbing a funeral ode or elegy produced the nine muses of which very rare and very worthless collection i have given a short account in the appendix where the reader will also find an ode on the same subject by oldys which may serve for ample specimen of the poetical lamentations over dryden  the more costly though equally unsubstantial honour of a monument was projected by montague and loud were the acclamations of the poets on his generous forgiveness of past discords with dryden and the munificence of this universal patron but montague never accomplished his purpose if he seriously entertained it pelham duke of newcastle announced the same intention received the panegyric of congreve for having done so and having thus pocketed the applause proceeded no further than montague had done at length pope in some lines which were rather an epitaph on dryden who lay in the vicinity than on rowe over whose tomb they were to be placed5 roused drydens original patron sheffield formerly earl of mulgrave and now duke of buckingham to erect over the grave of his friend the present simple monument which distinguishes it the inscription was comprised in the following wordsj dryden natus 1632 mortuus i maii 1700 joannes sheffield duxx buckinghamiensis posuit 17206  in the school of reformed english poetry of which dryden must be acknowledged as the founder there soon arose disciples not unwilling to be considered as the rivals of their muster addison had his partisans who were desirous to hold him up in this point of view and he himself is said to have taken pleasure with the assistance of steele to depreciate dryden whose fame was defended by pope and congreve no serious invasion of drydens preeminence can be said however to have taken place till pope himself refining upon that structure of versification which our author had first introduced and attending with sedulous diligence to improve every passage to the highest pitch of point and harmony exhibited a new style of composition and claimed at least to share with dryden the sovereignty of parnassus i will not attempt to concentrate what johnson has said upon this interesting comparison  in acquired knowledge the superiority must be allowed to dryden whose education was more scholastic and who before he became an author had been allowed more time for study with better means of information his mind has a larger range and he collects his images and illustrations from a more extensive circumference of science dryden knew more of man in his general nature and pope in his local manners the notions of dryden were formed by comprehensive speculation and those of pope by minute attention there is more dignity in the knowledge of dryden and more certainty in that of pope  poetry was not the sole praise of either for both excelled likewise in prose but pope did not borrow his prose from his predecessor the style of dryden is capricious and varied that of pope is cautious and uniform dryden obeys the motions of his own mind pope constrains his mind to his own rules of composition dryden is sometimes vehement and rapid pope is always smooth uniform and gentle drydens page is a natural field rising into inequalities and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation popes is a velvet lawn shaven by the scythe and levelled by the roller  of genius that power which constitutes a poet that quality without which judgment is cold and knowledge is inert that energy which collects combines amplifies and animates the superiority must with some hesitation be allowed to dryden it is not to be inferred that of this poetical vigour pope had only a little because dryden had more for every other writer since milton must give place to pope and even of dryden it must be said that if he has brighter paragraphs he has not better poems drydens performances were always hasty either excited by some external occasion or extorted by domestic necessity he composed without consideration and published without correction what his mind could supply at call or gather in one excursion was all that he sought and all that he gave the dilatory caution of pope enabled him to condense his sentiments to multiply his images and to accumulate all that study might produce or chance might supply if the flights of dryden therefore are higher pope continues longer on the wing if of drydens fire the blaze is brighter of pope the heat is more regular and constant dryden often surpasses expectation and pope never falls below it dryden is read with frequent astonishment and pope with perpetual delight7  as the eighteenth century advanced the difference between the styles of these celebrated authors became yet more manifest it was then obvious that though popes felicity of expression his beautiful polish of sentiment and the occasional brilliancy of his wit were not easily imitated yet many authors by dint of a good ear and a fluent expression learned to command the unaltered sweetness of his melody which like a favourite tune when descended to hawkers and balladsingers became disgusting as it became common the admirers of poetry then reverted to the brave negligence of drydens versification as to use johnsons simile the eye fatigued with the uniformity of a lawn seeks variety in the uncultivated glade or swelling mountain the preference for which dennis asserting the cause of dryden had raved and thundered in vain began by degrees to be assigned to the elder bard and many a poet sheltered his harsh verses and inequalities under an assertion that he belonged to the school of dryden churchill    who born for the universe narrowed his mind   and to party gave up what was meant for mankind  churchill was one of the first to seek in the macflecknoe the absalom and the hind and panther authority for bitter and personal sarcasm couched in masculine though irregular versification dashed from the pen without revision and admitting occasional rude and flat passages to afford the author a spring to comparative elevation but imitation always approaches to caricature and the powers of churchill have been unable to protect him from the oblivion into which his poems are daily sinking owing to the ephemeral interest of political subjects and his indolent negligence of severe study and regularity to imitate dryden it were well to study his merits without venturing to adopt the negligences and harshness which the hurry of his composition and the comparative rudeness of his age rendered in him excusable at least those who venture to sink as low should be confident of the power of soaring as high for surely it is a rash attempt to dive unless in one conscious of ability to swim while the beauties of dryden may be fairly pointed out as an object of emulation it is the less pleasing but not less necessary duty of his biographer and editor to notice those deficiencies which his high and venerable name may excuse but cannot render proper objects of applause or imitation  so much occasional criticism has been scattered in various places through these volumes that while attempting the consideration of one or two of his distinguishing and preeminent compositions which have been intentionally reserved to illustrate a few pages of general criticism i feel myself free from the difficult and almost contradictory task of drawing my maxims and examples from the extended course of his literary career  my present task is limited to deducing his poetic character from those works which he formed on his last and most approved model the general tone of his genius however influenced the whole course of his publications and upon that however his taste a few preliminary notices may not be misplaced  the distinguishing characteristic of drydens genius seems to have been the power of reasoning and of expressing the result in appropriate language8 this may seem slender praise yet these were the talents that led bacon into the recesses of philosophy and conducted newton to the cabinet of nature the prose works of dryden bear repeated evidence to his philosophical powers his philosophy was not indeed of a formed and systematic character for he is often contented to leave the path of argument which must have conducted him to the fountain of truth and to resort with indolence or indifference to the leaky cisterns which had been hewn out by former critics but where his pride or his taste are interested he shows evidently that it was not want of the power of systematising but of the time and patience necessary to form a system which occasions the discrepancy that we often notice in his critical and philological disquisitions this power of ratiocination of investigating discovering and appreciating that which is really excellent if accompanied with the necessary command of fanciful illustration and elegant expression is the most interesting quality which can be possessed by a poet it must indeed have a share in the composition of everything that is truly estimable in the fine arts as well as in philosophy nothing is so easily attained as the power of presenting the extrinsic qualities of fine painting fine music or fine poetry the beauty of colour and outline the combination of notes the melody of versification may be imitated by artists of mediocrity and many will view hear or peruse their performances without being able positively to discover why they should not since composed according to all the rules afford pleasure equal to those of raphael handel or dryden the deficiency lies in the vivifying spirit which like alcohol may be reduced to the same principle in all though it assumes such varied qualities from the mode in which it is exerted or combined of this power of intellect dryden seems to have possessed almost an exuberant share combined as usual with the faculty of correcting his own conceptions by observing human nature the practical and experimental philosophy as well of poetry as of ethics or physics the early habits of drydens education and poetical studies gave his researches somewhat too much of a metaphysical character and it was a consequence of his mental acuteness that his dramatic personages often philosophised or reasoned when they ought only to have felt the more lofty the fiercer the more ambitious feelings seem also to have been his favourite studies perhaps the analytical mode in which he exercised his studies of human life tended to confine his observation to the more energetic feelings of pride anger ambition and other hightoned passions he that mixes in public life must see enough of these stormy convulsions but the finer and more imperceptible operations of love in its sentimental modifications if the heart of the author does not supply an example from its own feelings cannot easily be studied at the expense of others drydens bosom it must be owned seems to have afforded him no such means of information the licence of his age and perhaps the advanced period at which he commenced his literary career had probably armed him against this more exalted strain of passion the love of the senses he has in many places expressed in as forcible and dignified colouring as the subject could admit but of a mere moral and sentimental passion he seems to have had little idea since he frequently substitutes in its place the absurd unnatural and fictitious refinements of romance in short his love is always in indecorous nakedness or sheathed in the stiff panoply of chivalry but if dryden fails in expressing the milder and more tender passions not only did the stronger feelings of the heart in all its dark or violent workings but the face of natural objects and their operation upon the human mind pass promptly in review at his command external pictures and their corresponding influence on the spectator are equally ready at his summons and though his poetry from the nature of his subjects is in general rather ethic and didactic than narrative of composition than his figures and his landscapes are presented to the mind with the same vivacity as the flow of his reasoning or the acute metaphysical discrimination of his characters  but the powers of observation and of deduction are not the only qualities essential to the poetical character the philosopher may indeed prosecute his experimental researches into the arcana of nature and announce them to the public through the medium of a friendly rédacteur as the legislator of israel obtained permission to speak to the people by the voice of aaron but the poet has no such privilege nay his doom is so far capricious that though he may be possessed of the primary quality of poetical conception to the highest possible extent it is but like a lute without its strings unless he has the subordinate though equally essential power of expressing what he feels and conceives in appropriate and harmonious language with this power drydens poetry was gifted in a degree surpassing in modulated harmony that of all who had preceded him and inferior to none that has since written english verse he first showed that the english language was capable of uniting smoothness and strength the hobbling verses of his predecessors were abandoned even by the lowest versifiers and by the force of his precept and example the meanest lampooners of the year seventeen hundred wrote smoother lines than donne and cowley the chief poets of the earlier half of the seventeenth century what was said of rome adorned by augustus has been by johnson applied to english poetry improved by dryden that he found it of brick and left it of marble this reformation was not merely the effect of an excellent ear and a superlative command of gratifying it by sounding language it was we have seen the effect of close accurate and continued study of the power of the english tongue upon what principles he adopted and continued his system of versification he long meditated to communicate in his projected prosody of english poetry the work however might have been more curious than useful as there would have been some danger of its diverting the attention and misguiding the efforts of poetical adventurers for as it is more easy to be masons than architects we may deprecate an art which might teach the world to value those who can build rhymes without attending to the more essential qualities of poetry strict attention might no doubt discover the principle of drydens versification but it seems no more essential to the analysing his poetry than the principles of mathematics to understanding music although the art necessarily depends on them the extent in which dryden reformed our poetry is most readily proved by an appeal to the ear and dr johnson has forcibly stated that he knew how to choose the flowing and the sonorous words to vary the pauses and adjust the accents to diversify the cadence and yet preserve the smoothness of the metre to vary the english hexameter he established the use of the triplet and alexandrine though ridiculed by swift who vainly thought he had exploded them for ever their force is still acknowledged in classical poetry  of the various kinds of poetry which dryden occasionally practised the drama was that which until the last six years of his life he chiefly relied on for support his style of tragedy we have seen varied with his improved taste perhaps with the change of manners although the heroic drama as we have described it at length in the preceding pages presented the strongest temptation to the exercise of argumentative poetry in sounding rhyme dryden was at length contented to abandon it for the more pure and chaste style of tragedy which professes rather the representation of human beings than the creation of ideal perfection or fantastic and anomalous characters the best of drydens performances in this latter style are unquestionably don sebastian and all for love of these the former is in the poets very best manner exhibiting dramatic persons consisting of such bold and impetuous characters as he delighted to draw well contrasted forcibly marked and engaged in an interesting succession of events to many tempers the scene between sebastian and dorax must appear one of the most moving that ever adorned the british stage of all for love we may say that it is successful in a softer style of painting and that so far as sweet and beautiful versification elegant language and occasional tenderness can make amends for drydens deficiencies in describing the delicacies of sentimental passion they are to be found in abundance in that piece but on these and on the poets other tragedies we have enlarged in our preliminary notices prefixed to each piece  drydens comedies besides being stained with the licence of the age a licence which he seems to use as much from necessity as choice have generally speaking a certain heaviness of character there are many flashes of wit but the author has beaten his flint hard ere he struck them out it is almost essential to the success of a jest that it should at least seem to be extemporaneous if we espy the joke at a distance nay if without seeing it we have the least reason to suspect we are travelling towards one it is astonishing how the perverse obstinacy of our nature delights to refuse it currency when therefore as is often the case in drydens comedies two persons remain on the stage for no obvious purpose but to say good things it is no wonder they receive but little thanks from an ungrateful audience the incidents therefore and the characters ought to be comic but actual jests or bon mots should be rarely introduced and then naturally easily without an appearance of premeditation and bearing a strict conformity to the character of the person who utters them comic situation dryden did not greatly study indeed i hardly recollect any unless in the closing scene of the spanish friar which indicates any peculiar felicity of invention for comic character he is usually contented to paint a generic representative of a certain class of men or women a father dominic for example or a melantha with all the attributes of their calling and manners strongly and divertingly portrayed but without any individuality of character it is probable that with these deficiencies he felt the truth of his own acknowledgment and that he was forced upon composing comedies to gratify the taste of the age while the bent of his genius was otherwise directed  in lyrical poetry dryden must be allowed to have no equal alexanders feast is sufficient to show his supremacy in that brilliant department in this exquisite production he flung from him all the trappings with which his contemporaries had embarrassed the ode the language lofty and striking as the ideas are is equally simple and harmonious without farfetched allusions or epithets or metaphors the story is told as intelligibly as if it had been in the most humble prose the change of tone in the harp of timotheus regulates the measure and the melody and the language of every stanza the hearer while he is led on by the successive changes experiences almost the feelings of the macedonian and his peers nor is the splendid poem disgraced by one word or line unworthy of it unless we join in the severe criticism of dr johnson on the concluding stanzas it is true that the praise of st cecilia is rather abruptly introduced as a conclusion to the account of the feast of alexander and it is also true that the comparison    he raised a mortal to the sky   she drew an angel down  is inaccurate since the feat of timotheus was metaphorical and that of cecilia literal but while we stoop to such criticism we seek for blots in the sun  of drydens other pindarics some as the celebrated ode to the memory of mrs killigrew are mixed with the leaven of cowley others like the threnodia augustalis are occasionally flat and heavy all contain passages of brilliancy and all are thrown into a versification melodious amidst its irregularity we listen for the completion of drydens stanza as for the explication of a difficult passage in music and wild and lost as the sound appears the ear is proportionally gratified by the unexpected ease with which harmony is extracted from discord and confusion  the satirical powers of dryden were of the highest order he draws his arrow to the head and dismisses it straight upon his object of aim in this walk he wrought almost as great a reformation as upon versification in general as will plainly appear if we consider that the satire before drydens time bore the same reference to absalom and achitophel which an ode of cowley bears to alexanders feast butler and his imitators had adopted a metaphysical satire as the poets in the earlier part of the century had created a metaphysical vein of serious poetry9 both required store of learning to supply the perpetual expenditure of extraordinary and farfetched illustration the object of both was to combine and hunt down the strangest and most fanciful analogies and both held the attention of the reader perpetually on the stretch to keep up with the meaning of the author there can be no doubt that this metaphysical vein was much better fitted for the burlesque than the sublime yet the perpetual scintillation of butlers wit is too dazzling to be delightful and we can seldom read far in hudibras without feeling more fatigue than pleasure his fancy is employed with the profusion of a spendthrift by whose eternal round of banqueting his guests are at length rather wearied out than regaled dryden was destined to correct this among other errors of his age to show the difference between burlesque and satire and to teach his successors in that species of assault rather to thrust than to flourish with their weapon for this purpose he avoided the unvaried and unrelieved style of grotesque description and combination which had been fashionable since the satires of cleveland and butler to render the objects of his satire hateful and contemptible he thought it necessary to preserve the lighter shades of character if not for the purpose of softening the portrait at least for that of preserving the likeness while dryden seized and dwelt upon and aggravated all the evil features of his subject he carefully retained just as much of its laudable traits as preserved him from the charge of want of candour and fixed down the resemblance upon the party and thus instead of unmeaning caricatures he presents portraits which cannot be mistaken however unfavourable ideas they may convey of the originals the character of shaftesbury both as achitophel and as drawn in the medal bears peculiar witness to this assertion while other court poets endeavoured to turn the obnoxious statesman into ridicule on account of his personal infirmities and extravagances dryden boldly confers upon him all the praise for talent and for genius that his friends could have claimed and trusts to the force of his satirical expression for working up even these admirable attributes with such a mixture of evil propensities and dangerous qualities that the whole character shall appear dreadful and even hateful but not contemptible but where a character of less note a shadwell or a settle crossed his path the satirist did not lay himself under these restraints but wrote in the language of bitter irony and immeasurable contempt even then however we are less called on to admire the wit of the author than the force and energy of his poetical philippic these are the verses which are made by indignation and no more than theatrical scenes of real passion admit of refined and protracted turns of wit or even the lighter sallies of humour these last ornaments are proper in that horatian satire which rather ridicules the follies of the age than stigmatises the vices of individuals but in this style dryden has made few essays he entered the field as champion of a political party or as defender of his own reputation discriminated his antagonists and applied the scourge with all the vehemence of juvenal as he has himself said of that satirist his provocations were great and he has revenged them tragically this is the more worthy of notice as in the essay on satire dryden gives a decided preference to those nicer and more delicate touches of satire which consist in fine raillery but whatever was the opinion of his cooler moments the poets practice was dictated by the furious partyspirit of the times and the no less keen stimulative of personal resentment it is perhaps to be regretted that so much energy of thought and so much force of expression should have been wasted in anatomising such criminals as shadwell and settle yet we cannot account the amber less precious because they are grubs and flies that are enclosed within it  the fables of dryden are the best examples of his talents as a narrative poet those powers of composition description and narration which must have been called into exercise by the epic muse had his fate allowed him to enlist among her votaries the knights tale the longest and most laboured of chaucers stories possesses a degree of regularity which might satisfy the most severe critic it is true that the honour arising from thence must be assigned to the more ancient bard who had himself drawn his subject from an italian model but the high and decided preference which dryden has given to this story although somewhat censured by trapp enables us to judge how much the poet held an accurate combination of parts and coherence of narrative essentials of epic poetry10 that a classic scholar like trapp should think the plan of the knights tale equal to that of the iliad is a degree of candour not to be hoped for but surely to an unprejudiced reader a story which exhausts in its conclusion all the interest which it has excited in its progress which when terminated leaves no question to be asked no personage undisposed of and no curiosity unsatisfied is abstractedly considered more gratifying than the history of a few weeks of a ten years war commencing long after the siege had begun and ending long before the city was taken of the other tales it can hardly be said that their texture is more ingenious or closely woven than that of ordinary novels or fables but in each of them dryden has displayed the superiority of his genius in selecting for amplification and ornament those passages most susceptible of poetical description the account of the procession of the fairy chivalry in the flower and the leaf the splendid description of the champions who came to assist at the tournament in the knights tale the account of the battle itself its alternations and issueif they cannot be called improvements on chaucer are nevertheless so spirited a transfusion of his ideas into modern verse as almost to claim the merit of originality many passages might be shown in which this praise may be carried still higher and the merit of invention added to that of imitation such is the description of the commencement of the tourney which is almost entirely original and most of the ornaments in the translations from boccacio whose prose fictions demanded more additions from the poet than the exuberant imagery of chaucer to select instances would be endless but every reader of poetry has by heart the description of iphigenia asleep nor are the lines in theodore and honoria11 which describe the approach of the apparition and its effects upon animated and inanimated nature even before it becomes visible less eminent for beauties of the terrific order  while listening to the murmuring leaves he stood more than a mile immersed within the wood at once the wind was laid the whispering sound was dumb a rising earthquake rocked the ground with deeper brown the grove was overspread a sudden horror seized his giddy head and his ears tingled and his colour fled nature was in alarm some danger nigh seemed threatened though unseen to mortal eye  it may be doubted however whether the simplicity of boccacios narrative has not sometimes suffered by the additional decorations of dryden the retort of guiscard to tancreds charge of ingratitude is more sublime in the italian original12 than as diluted by the english poet into five hexameters a worse fault occurs in the whole colouring of sigismondas passion to which dryden has given a coarse and indelicate character which he did not derive from boccacio in like manner the plea used by palamon in his prayer to venus is more nakedly expressed by dryden than by chaucer the former indeed would probably have sheltered himself under the mantle of lucretius but he should have recollected that palamon speaks the language of chivalry and ought not to use an expression of lord herbert to have spoken like a paillard but a cavalier indeed we have before noticed it as the most obvious and most degrading imperfection of drydens poetical imagination that he could not refine that passion which of all others is susceptible either of the purest refinement or of admitting the basest alloy with chaucer drydens task was more easy than with boccacio barrenness was not the fault of the father of english poetry and amid the profusion of images which he presented his imitator had only the task of rejecting or selecting in the sublime description of the temple of mars painted around with all the misfortunes ascribed to the influence of his planet it would be difficult to point out a single idea which is not found in the older poem but dryden has judiciously omitted or softened some degrading and some disgusting circumstances as the cook scalded in spite of his long ladle the swine devouring the cradled infant the pickpurse and other circumstances too grotesque or ludicrous to harmonise with the dreadful group around them some points also of sublimity have escaped the modern poet such is the appropriate and picturesque accompaniment of the statue of mars    a wolf stood before him at his feet   with eyen red and of a man he eat13  in the dialogue or argumentative parts of the poem dryden has frequently improved on his original while he falls something short of him in simple description or in pathetic effect thus the quarrel between arcite and palamon is wrought up with greater energy by dryden than chaucer particularly by the addition of the following lines describing the enmity of the captives against each other    now friends no more nor walking hand in hand   but when they met they made a surly stand   and glared like angry lions as they passed   and wished that every look might be their last  but the modern must yield the palm despite the beauty of his versification to the description of emily by chaucer and may be justly accused of loading the dying speech of arcite with conceits for which his original gave no authority14  when the story is of a light and ludicrous kind as the fable of the cock and fox and the wife of baths tale dryden displays all the humorous expression of his satirical poetry without its personality there is indeed a quaint cervantic gravity in his mode of expressing himself that often glances forth and enlivens what otherwise would be mere dry narrative thus he details certain things which passed    while cynion was endeavouring to be wise  the force of which single word contains both a ludicrous and appropriate picture of the revolution which the force of love was gradually creating in the mind of the poor clown this tone of expression he perhaps borrowed from ariosto and other poets of italian chivalry who are wont ever and anon to raise the mask and smile even at the romantic tale they are themselves telling  leaving these desultory reflections on drydens powers of narrative i cannot but notice that from haste or negligence he has sometimes mistaken the sense of his author into the hands of the champions in the flower and the leaf he has placed bows instead of boughs because the word is in the original spelled bowes and having made the error he immediately devises an explanation of the device which he had mistaken    for bows the strength of brawny arms imply   emblems of valour and of victory  he has in like manner accused chaucer of introducing gallicisms into the english language not aware that french was the language of the court of england not long before chaucers time and that far from introducing french phrases into the english tongue the ancient bard was successfully active in introducing the english as a fashionable dialect instead of the french which had before his time been the only language of polite literature in england other instances might be given of similar oversights which in the situation of dryden are sufficiently pardonable  upon the whole in introducing these romances of boccacio and chaucer to modern readers dryden has necessarily deprived them of some of the charms which they possess for those who have perused them in their original state with a tale or poem by which we have been sincerely interested we connect many feelings independent of those arising from actual poetical merit the delight arising from the whole sanctions nay sanctifies the faulty passages and even actual improvements like supplements to a mutilated statue of antiquity injure our preconceived associations and hurt by their incongruity with our feelings more than they give pleasure by their own excellence but to antiquaries dryden has sufficiently justified himself by declaring his version made for the sake of modern readers who understand sense and poetry as well as the old saxon admirers of chaucer when that poetry and sense are put into words which they can understand let us also grant him that for the beauties which are lost he has substituted many which the original did not afford that in passages of gorgeous description he has added even to the chivalrous splendour of chaucer and has graced with poetical ornament the simplicity of boccacio that if he has failed in tenderness he is never deficient in majesty and that if the heart be sometimes untouched the understanding and fancy are always exercised and delighted  the philosophy of dryden we have already said was that of original and penetrating genius imperfect only when from want of time and of industry he adopted the ideas of others when he should have communed at leisure with his own mind the proofs of his philosophical powers are not to be sought for in any particular poem or disquisition even the religio laici written expressly as a philosophical poem only shows how easily the most powerful mind may entangle itself in sophistical toils of its own weaving for the train of argument there pursued was completed by drydens conversion to the roman catholic faith15 it is therefore in the discussion of incidental subjects in his mode of treating points of controversy in the new lights which he seldom fails to throw upon a controversial subject in his talent of argumentive discussion that we are to look for the character of drydens moral powers his opinions doubtless are often inconsistent and sometimes absolutely contradictory for pressed by the necessity of discussing the object before him he seldom looked back to what he said formerly or forward to what he might be obliged to say in future his sole subject of consideration was to maintain his present point and that by authority by declamation by argument by every means but his philosophical powers are not the less to be estimated because thus irregularly and unphilosophically employed his arguments even in the worst cause bear witness to the energy of his mental conceptions and the skill with which they are stated elucidated enforced and exemplified ever commands our admiration though in the result our reason may reject their influence it must be remembered also to drydens honour that he was the first to hail the dawn of experimental philosophy in physics to gratulate his country on possessing bacon harvey and boyle and to exult over the downfall of the aristotelian tyranny16 had he lived to see a similar revolution commenced in ethics there can be little doubt he would have welcomed it with the same delight or had his leisure and situation permitted him to dedicate his time to investigating moral problems he might himself have led the way to deliverance from error and uncertainty but the dawn of reformation must ever be gradual and the acquisitions even of those calculated to advance it must therefore frequently appear desultory and imperfect the author of the novum organum believed in charms and occult sympathy and dryden in the chimeras of judicial astrology and probably in the jargon of alchemy when these subjects occur in his poetry he dwells on them with a pleasure which shows the command they maintained over his mind much of the astrological knowledge displayed in the knights tale is introduced or at least amplified by dryden and while in the fable of the cock and the fox he ridicules the doctrine of prediction from dreams the inherent qualities of the four complexions17 and other abstruse doctrines of paracelsus and his followers we have good reason to suspect that like many other scoffers he believed in the efficacy and truth of the subject of his ridicule however this shade of credulity may injure drydens character as a philosopher we cannot regret its influence on his poetry collins has thus celebrated fairfax    prevailing poet whose undoubting mind   believed the magic wonders which he sung  nor can there be a doubt that as every work of imagination is tinged with the authors passions and prejudices it must be deep and energetic in proportion to the character of these impressions those superstitious sciences and pursuits which would by mystic rites doctrines and inferences connect us with the invisible world of spirits or guide our daring researches to a knowledge of future events are indeed usually found to cow crush and utterly stupefy understandings of a lower rank but if the mind of a man of acute powers and of warm fancy becomes slightly imbued with the visionary feelings excited by such studies their obscure and undefined influence is ever found to aid the sublimity of his ideas and to give that sombre and serious effect which he can never produce who does not himself feel the awe which it is his object to excite the influence of such a mystic creed is often felt where the cause is concealed for the habits thus acquired are not confined to their own sphere of belief but gradually extend themselves over every adjacent province and perhaps we may not go too far in believing that he who has felt their impression though only in one branch of faith becomes fitted to describe with an air of reality and interest not only kindred subjects but superstitions altogether opposite to his own the religion which dryden finally adopted lent its occasional aid to the solemn colouring of some of his later productions tipon which subject we have elsewhere enlarged at some length18  the occasional poetry of dryden is marked strongly by masculine character the epistles vary with the subject and are light humorous and satirical or grave argumentative and philosophical as the case required in his elegies although they contain touches of true feeling especially where the stronger passions are to be illustrated the poet is often content to substitute reasoning for passion and rather to show us cause why we ought to grieve than to set us the example by grieving himself the inherent defect in drydens composition becomes here peculiarly conspicuous yet we should consider that in composing elegies for the countess of abingdon whom he never saw and for charles ii by whom he had been cruelly neglected and doubtless on many similar occasions dryden could not even pretend to be interested in the mournful subject of his verse but attended with his poem as much in the way of trade as the undertaker on the same occasion came with his sables and his scutcheon the poet may interest himself and his reader even to tears in the fate of a being altogether the creation of his own fancy but hardly by a hired panegyric on a real subject in whom his heart acknowledges no other interest than a fee can give him few of drydens elegiac effusions therefore seem prompted by sincere sorrow that to oldham may be an exception but even there he rather strives to do honour to the talents of his departed friend than to pour out lamentations for his loss of the prologues and epilogues we have spoken fully elsewhere19  some of them are coarsely satirical and others grossly indelicate those spoken at oxford are the most valuable and contain much good criticism and beautiful poetry but the worst of them was probably well worth the petty recompence which the poet received20 the songs and smaller pieces of dryden have smoothness wit and when addressed to ladies gallantry in profusion but are deficient in tenderness they seem to have been composed with great ease thrown together hastily and occasionally nor can we doubt that many of them are now irrecoverably lost mr malone gives us an instance of drydens fluency in extempore composition which was communicated to him by mr walcott conversation one day after dinner at mrs creeds running upon the origin of names mr dryden bowed to the good old lady and spoke extempore the following verses    so much religion in your name doth dwell   your soul must needs with piety excel   thus names like wellwrought pictures drawn of old   their owners nature and their story told   your name but half expresses for in you   belief and practice do together go   my prayers shall be while this short life endures   these may go hand in hand with you and yours   till faith hereafter is in vision drowned   and practice is with endless glory crowned  the translations of dryden form a distinguished part of his poetical labours no author excepting pope has done so much to endenizen the eminent poets of antiquity in this sphere also it was the fate of dryden to become a leading example to future poets and to abrogate laws which had been generally received although they imposed such trammels on translation as to render it hardly intelligible before his distinguished success showed that the object of the translator should be to transfuse the spirit not to copy servilely the very words of his original it had been required that line should be rendered for line and almost word for word it may easily be imagined that by the constraint and inversion which this cramping statute required a poem was barely rendered not latin instead of being made english and that to the mere native reader as the connoisseur complains in the critic the interpreter was sometimes the harder to be understood of the two those who seek examples may find them in the jawbreaking translations of ben jonson and holyday cowley and denham had indeed rebelled against this mode of translation which conveys pretty much the same idea of an original as an imitator would do of the gait of another by studiously stepping after him into every trace which his feet had left upon the sand but they assumed a licence equally faulty and claimed the privilege of writing what might be more properly termed imitations than versions of the classics it was reserved to dryden manfully to claim and vindicate the freedom of a just translation more limited than paraphrase but free from the metaphrastic severity exacted from his predecessors  with these free yet unlicentious principles dryden brought to the task of translation a competent knowledge of the language of the originals with an unbounded command of his own the latter is however by far the most marked characteristic of his translations dryden was not indeed deficient in greek and roman learning but he paused not to weigh and sift those difficult and obscure passages at which the most learned will doubt and hesitate for the correct meaning the same rapidity which marked his own poetry seems to have attended his study of the classics he seldom waited to analyse the sentence he was about to render far less scrupulously to weigh the precise purport and value of every word it contained if he caught the general spirit and meaning of the author and could express it with equal force in english verse he cared not if minute elegancies were lost or the beauties of accurate proportion destroyed or a dubious interpretation hastily adopted on the credit of a scholium he used abundantly the licence he has claimed for a translator to be deficient rather in the language out of which he renders than of that into which he translates if such be but master of the sense of his author dryden argues he may express that sense with eloquence in his own tongue though he understand not the nice turns of the original but without the latter quality he can never arrive at the useful and the delightful without which reading is a penance and fatigue21 with the same spirit of haste dryden if often contented to present to the english reader some modern image which he may at once fully comprehend instead of rendering precisely a classic expression which might require explanation or paraphrase thus the pulchra sicyonia or buskins of sicyon are rendered    diamondbuckles sparkling in their shoes  by a yet more unfortunate adaptation of modern technical phraseology the simple direction of helenus    læva tibi tellus et longo læva pelantur   Æquora circuitu dextrum fage lillus et undas  is translated    tack to the larboard and stand off to sea   veer starboard sea and land  a counsel which i shrewdly suspect would have been unintelligible not only to palinurus but to the best pilot in the british navy22 in the same tone but with more intelligibility if not felicity dryden translates palatia coeli in ovid the louvre of the sky and in the version of the first book of homer talks of the court of jupiter in the phrases used at that of whitehall these expressions proper to modern manners often produce an unfortunate confusion between the age in which the scene is laid and the date of the translation no judicious poet is willing to break the interest of a tale of ancient times by allusions peculiar to his own period but when the translator instead of identifying himself as closely as possible with the original author pretends to such liberty he removes us a third step from the time of action and so confounds the manners of no less than three distinct erasthat in which the scene is laid that in which the poem was written and that finally in which the translation was executed there are passages in drydens Æneid which in the revolution of a few pages transport our ideas from the time of troys siege to that of the court of augustus and thence downward to the reign of william the third of britain  it must be owned at the same time that when the translator places before you not the exact words but the image of the original as the classic author would probably have himself expressed it in english the licence when moderately employed has an infinite charm for those readers for whose use translations are properly written popes homer and drydens virgil can never indeed give exquisite satisfaction to scholars accustomed to study the greek and latin originals the minds of such readers have acquired a classic tone and not merely the ideas and poetical imagery but the manners and habits of the actors have become intimately familiar to them they will not therefore be satisfied with any translation in which these are violated whether for the sake of indolence in the translator or ease to the unlettered reader and perhaps they will be more pleased that a favourite bard should move with less ease and spirit in his new habiliments than that his garments should be cut upon the model of the country to which the stranger is introduced in the former case they will readily make allowance for the imperfection of modern language in the latter they will hardly pardon the sophistication of ancient manners but the mere english reader who finds rigid adherence to antique costume rather embarrassing than pleasing who is prepared to make no sacrifices in order to preserve the true manners of antiquity shocking perhaps to his feelings and prejudices is satisfied that the iliad and Æneid shall lose their antiquarian merit provided they retain that vital spirit and energy which is the soul of poetry in all languages and countries and ages whatsoever he who sits down to drydens translation of virgil with the original text spread before him will be at no loss to point out many passages that are faulty many indifferently understood many imperfectly translated some in which dignity is lost others in which bombast is substituted in its stead but the unabated vigour and spirit of the version more than overbalances these and all its other deficiencies a sedulous scholar might often approach more nearly to the dead letter of virgil and give an exact distinct soberminded idea of the meaning and scope of particular passages trapp pitt and others have done so but the essential spirit of poetry is so volatile that it escapes during such an operation like the life of the poor criminal whom the ancient anatomist is said to have dissected alive in order to ascertain the seat of the soul the carcase indeed is presented to the english reader but the animating vigour is no more it is in this art of communicating the ancient poets ideas with force and energy equal to his own that dryden has so completely exceeded all who have gone before and all who have succeeded him the beautiful and unequalled version of the tale of myrrha in the metamorphoses the whole of the sixth Æneid and many other parts of drydens translations are sufficient had he never written one line of original poetry to vindicate the wellknown panegyric of churchill    here let me bend great dryden at thy shrine   thou dearest name to all the tuneful nine   what if some dull lines in cold order creep   and with his theme the poet seems to sleep   still when his subject rises proud to view   with equal strength the poet rises too   with strong invention noblest vigour fraught   thought still springs up and rises out of thought   numbers ennobling numbers in their course   in varied sweetness flow in varied force   the powers of genius and of judgment join   and the whole art of poetry is thine  we are in this disquisition naturally tempted to inquire whether dryden would have succeeded in his proposed design to translate homer as happily as in his virgil and although he himself more fiery and therefore better suited to his own than that of the roman poet there may be room to question whether in this case he rightly estimated his own talents or rather whether being fully conscious of their extent he was aware of labouring under certain deficiencies of taste which must have been more apparent in a version of the iliad than of the Æneid if a translator has any characteristic and peculiar foible it is surely unfortunate to choose an original who may give peculiar facilities to exhibit them thus even drydens repeated disclamation of puns points and quibbles and all the repentance of his more sober hours was unable so soon as he began to translate ovid to prevent his sliding back into the practice of that false wit with which his earlier productions are imbued hence he has been seduced by the similarity of style to add to the offences of his original and introduce though it needed not points of wit and antithetical prettinesses for which he cannot plead ovids authority for example he makes ajax say of ulysses when surrounded by the trojans    no wonder if he roared that all might hear   his elocution was increased by fear  the latin only bears conclamat socios a little lower    opposui molem clypei texique jacentem  is amplified by a similar witticism    my broad buckler hid him from the foe   even the shield trembled as he lay below  if in translating ovid dryden was tempted by the manner of his original to relapse into a youthful fault which he had solemnly repented of and abjured there is surely room to believe that the simple and almost rude manners described by homer might have seduced him into coarseness both of ideas and expression for which the studied composed and dignified style of the aeneid gave neither opening nor apology that this was a fault which dryden with all his taste never was able to discard might easily be proved from various passages in his translations where the transgression is on his own part altogether gratuitous such is the wellknown version of      ut possessor agelli   diceret hoec mea sunt veteres migrate coloni   nune vidi etc    when the grim captain with a surly tone   cries out pack up ye rascals and be gone   kicked out we set the best face ont we could etc  in translating the most indelicate passage of lucretius dryden has rather enhanced than veiled its indecency the story of iphis in the metamorphoses is much more bluntly told by the english poet than by ovid in short where there was a latitude given for coarseness of description and expression dryden has always too readily laid hold of it the very specimen which he has given us of a version of homer contains many passages in which the antique grecian simplicity is vulgarly and inelegantly rendered the thunderer terms juno    my household curse my lawful plague the spy   of joves designs his other squinting eye  the ambrosial feast of olympus concludes like a tavern revel    drunken at last and drowsy they depart   each to his house adored with laboured art   of the lame architect the thundering god   even he withdrew to rest and had his load   his swimming head to needful sleep applied   and juno lay unheeded by his side  there is reason indeed to think that after the revolution drydens taste was improved in this as in some other respects in his translation of juvenal for example the satire against women coarse as it is is considerably refined and softened from the grossness of the latin poet who has however been lately favoured by a still more elegant and excepting perhaps one or two passages an equally spirited translation by mr gifford of london yet admitting this apology for dryden as fully as we dare from the numerous specimens of indelicacy even in his later translations we are induced to judge it fortunate that homer was reserved for a poet who had not known the age of charles ii and whose inaccuracies and injudicious decorations may be pardoned even by the scholar when he considers the probability that dryden might have slipped into the opposite extreme by converting rude simplicity into indecency or vulgarity the Æneid on the other hand if it restrained drydens poetry to a correct steady and even flight if it damped his energy by its regularity and fettered his excursive imagination by the sobriety of its decorum had the corresponding advantage of holding forth to the translator no temptation to licence and no apology for negligence where the fervency of genius is required dryden has usually equalled his original where peculiar elegance and exact propriety is demanded his version may be sometimes found flat and inaccurate but the mastering spirit of virgil prevails and it is never disgusting or indelicate of all the classical translations we can boast none is so acceptable to the class of readers to whom the learned languages are a clasped book and a sealed fountain and surely it is no moderate praise to say that a work is universally pleasing to those for whose use it is principally intended and to whom only it is absolutely indispensable  the prose of dryden may rank with the best in the english language it is no less of his own formation than his versification is equally spirited and equally harmonious without the lengthened and pedantic sentences of clarendon it is dignified where dignity is becoming and is lively without the accumulation of strained and absurd allusions and metaphors which were unfortunately mistaken for wit by many of the authors contemporaries dryden has been accused of unnecessarily larding his style with gallicisms it must be owned that to comply probably with the humour of charles or from an affectation of the fashionable court dialect the poetlaureate employed such words as fougue fraicheur etc instead of the corresponding expressions in english an affectation which does not appear in our authors later writings but even the learned and excellent sir david dalrymple was led to carry this idea greatly too far nothing says that admirable antiquary distinguishes the genius of the english language so much as its general naturalisation of foreigners dryden in the reign of charles ii printed the following words as pure french newly imported amour billetdoux caprice chagrin conversation doubleentendre embarrassed fatigue figure foible gallant good graces grimace incendiary levée maltreated rallied repartée ridicule tender tour with several others which are now considered as natives marriage à la mode23 but of these words many had been long naturalised in england and with the adjectives derived from them are used by shakespeare and the dramatists of his age24 by their being printed in italics in the play of marriage à la mode dryden only meant to mark that melantha the affected coquette in whose mouth they are placed was to use the french not the vernacular pronunciation it will admit of question whether any single french word has been naturalised upon the sole authority of dryden  although drydens style has nothing obsolete we can occasionally trace a reluctance to abandon an old word or idiom the consequence doubtless of his latter studies in ancient poetry in other respects nothing can be more elegant than the diction of the praises heaped upon his patrons for which he might himself plead the apology he uses for maimbourg who having enemies made himself friends by panegyrics of these lively critical prefaces which when we commence we can never lay aside till we have finished dr johnson has said with equal force and beautythey have not the formality of a settled style in which the first half of the sentence betrays the other the clauses are never balanced nor the periods modelled every word seems to drop by chance though it falls into its proper place nothing is cold or languid the whole is airy animated and vigorous what is little is gay what is great is splendid he may be thought to mention himself too frequently but while he forces himself upon our esteem we cannot refuse him to stand high in his own everything is excused by the play of images and the sprightliness of expression though all is easy nothing is feeble though all seems careless there is nothing harsh and though since his earlier works more than a century has passed they have nothing yet uncouth or obsolete  he who writes much will not easily escape a manner such a recurrence of particular modes as may be easily noted dryden is always another and the same he does not exhibit a second time the same elegancies in the same form nor appears to have any art other than that of expressing with clearness what he thinks with vigour his style could not easily be imitated either seriously or ludicrously for being always equable and always varied it has no prominent or discriminative characters the beauty who is totally free from disproportion of parts and features cannot be ridiculed by an overcharged resemblance  the last paragraph is not to be understood too literally for although dryden never so far copied himself as to fall into what has been quaintly called mannerism yet accurate observation may trace in his works the repetition of some sentiments and illustrations from prose to verse and back again to prose24 in his preface to the Æneid he has enlarged on the difficulty of varying phrases when the same sense returned on the author and surely we must allow full praise to his fluency and command of language when during so long a literary career and in the course of such a variety of miscellaneous productions we can detect in his style so few instances of repetition or selfimitation  the prose of dryden excepting his translations and one or two controversial tracts is entirely dedicated to criticism either general and didactic or defensive and exculpatory there as in other branches of polite learning it was his lot to be a light to his people about the time of the restoration the cultivation of letters was prosecuted in france with some energy but the genius of that lively nation being more fitted for criticism than poetry for drawing rules from what others have done than for writing works which might be themselves standards they were sooner able to produce an accurate table of laws for those intending to write epic poems and tragedies according to the best greek and roman authorities than to exhibit distinguished specimens of success in either department just as they are said to possess the best possible rules for building ships of war although not equally remarkable for their power of fighting them when criticism becomes a pursuit separate from poetry those who follow it are apt to forget that the legitimate ends of the art for which they lay down rules are instruction or delight and that these points being attained by what road soever entitles a poet to claim the prize of successful merit neither did the learned authors of these disquisitions sufficiently attend to the general disposition of mankind which cannot be contented even with the happiest imitations of former excellence but demands novelty as a necessary ingredient for amusement to insist that every epic poem shall have the plan of the iliad and Æneid and every tragedy be fettered by the rules of aristotle resembles the principle of an architect who should build all his houses with the same number of windows and of stories it happened too inevitably that the critics in the plenipotential authority which they exercised often assumed as indispensable requisites of the drama or epopeia circumstances which in the great authorities they quoted were altogether accidental and indifferent these they erected into laws and handed down as essentials to be observed by all succeeding poets although the forms prescribed have often as little to do with the merit and success of the originals from which they are taken as the shape of the drinkingglass with the flavour of the wine which it contains to these encroachments says fielding after some observations to the same purpose time and ignorance the two great supporters of imposture gave authority  and thus many rules for good writing have been established which have not the least foundation in truth or nature and which commonly serve for no other purpose than to curb and restrain genius in the same manner as it would have restrained the dancingmaster had the many excellent treatises on that art laid it down as an essential rule that every man must dance in chains25 it is probable that the tyranny of the french critics fashionable as the literature of that country was with charles and his courtiers would have extended itself over england at the restoration had not a champion so powerful as dryden placed himself in the gap we have mentioned in its place his essay on dramatic poetry the first systematic piece of criticism which our literature has to exhibit in this essay he was accused of entertaining private views of defending some of his own pieces at least of opening the door of the theatre wider and rendering its access more easy for his own selfish convenience allowing this to be true in whole as it may be in part we are as much obliged to dryden for resisting the domination of gallic criticism as we are to the fanatics who repressed the despotism of the crown although they buckled on their armour against white surplices and the cross in baptism the character which dryden has drawn of our english dramatists in the essay and the various prefaces connected with it have unequalled spirit and precision the contrast of ben jonson with shakespeare is peculiarly and strikingly felicitous of the latter portrait dr johnson has said that the editors and admirers of shakespeare in all their emulation of reverence cannot boast of much more than of having diffused and paraphrased this epitome of excellence of having changed drydens gold for baser metal of lower value though of greater bulk while dryden examined discussed admitted or rejected the rules proposed by others he forbore from prudence indolence or a regard for the freedom of parnassus to erect himself into a legislator his doctrines which chiefly respect the intrinsic qualities necessary in poetry are scattered without system of pretence to it over the numerous pages of prefatory and didactic essays with which he enriched his publications it is impossible to read far in any of them without finding some maxim for doing or forbearing which every student of poetry will do well to engrave upon the tablets of his memory but the authors mode of instruction is neither harsh nor dictatorial when his opinion changed as in the case of rhyming tragedies he avows the change with candour and we are enabled the more courageously to follow his guidance when we perceive the readiness with which he retracts his path if he strays into error the gleams of philosophical spirit which so frequently illumine these pages of criticism the lively and appropriate grace of illustration the true and correct expression of the general propositions the simple and unaffected passages in which when led to allude to his personal labours and situation he mingles the feelings of the man with the instructions of the criticunite to render drydens essays the most delightful prose in the english language  the didactic criticism of dryden is necessarily at least naturally mingled with that which he was obliged to pour forth in his own defence and this may be one main cause of its irregular and miscellaneous form what might otherwise have resembled the extended and elevated front of a regular palace is deformed by barriers ramparts and bastions of defence by cottages mean additions and offices necessary for personal accommodation the poet always most in earnest about his immediate task used without ceremony those arguments which suited his present purpose and thereby sometimes supplied his foes with weapons to assail another quarter it also happens frequently if the same allusion may be continued that dryden defends with obstinate despair against the assaults of his foemen a post which in his cooler moments he has condemned as untenable however easily he may yield to internal conviction and to the progress of his own improving taste even these concessions he sedulously informs us are not wrung from him by the assault of his enemies and he often goes out of his road to show that though conscious he was in the wrong he did not stand legally convicted by their arguments to the chequered and inconsistent appearance which these circumstances have given to the criticism of dryden it is an additional objection that through the same cause his studies were partial temporary and irregular his mind was amply stored with acquired knowledge much of it perhaps the fruits of early reading and application but while engaged in the hurry of composition or overcome by the lassitude of continued literary labour he seems frequently to have trusted to the tenacity of his memory and so drawn upon this fund with injudicious liberality without being sufficiently anxious as to accuracy of quotation or even of assertion if on the other hand he felt himself obliged to resort to more profound learning than his own he was at little pains to arrange or digest it or even to examine minutely the information he acquired from hasty perusal of the books he consulted and thus but too often poured it forth in the crude form in which he had himself received it from the french critic or dutch schoolman the scholarship for example displayed in the essay on satire has this raw and illarranged appearance and stuck as it awkwardly is among some of drydens own beautiful and original writing gives like a borrowed and unbecoming garment a mean and inconsistent appearance to the whole disquisition but these occasional imperfections and inaccuracies are marks of the haste with which dryden was compelled to give his productions to the world and cannot deprive him of the praise due to the earliest and most entertaining of english critics  i have thus detailed the life and offered some remarks on the literary character of john dryden who educated in a pedantic taste and a fanatical religion was destined if not to give laws to the stage of england at least to defend its liberties to improve burlesque into satire to free translation from the fetters of verbal metaphrase and exclude it from the licence of paraphrase to teach posterity the powerful and varied poetical harmony of which their language was capable to give an example of the lyric ode of unapproached excellence and to leave to english literature a name second only to those of milton and of shakespeare   footnotes 1 life and works of arthur maynwaring 1715 p 17  2 so says charles blount in the dedication to the religio laici he is
