easy chair by way of introduction   it is not generally known that after fortytwo years of constant use the aged and honored movable which now again finds itself put back in its old place in the rear of harpers magazine was stored in the warehouse of a certain safetydeposit company in the winter of 1892 the event which had then vacated the chair is still so near as to be full of a pathos tenderly personal to all readers of that magazine and may not be lightly mentioned in any travesty of the facts by one who was thought of for the empty place he before putting on the mask and mimic editorial robesfor it was never the real editor who sat in the easy chair except for that brief hour when he took it to pay his deepthought and deepfelt tribute to its last occupantstood with bowed face and uncovered head in that bravest and gentlest presence which while it abode with us here men knew as george william curtis  it was of course in one of the best of the fireproof warehouses that the real editor had the easy chair stored and when the unreal editor went to take it out of storage he found it without trouble in one of those vast rooms where the more valuable furniture and bricàbrac are guarded in a special tutelage if instinct had not taught him he would have known it by its homely fashion which the first unreal editor had suggested when he described it as an old redbacked easy chair that has long been an ornament of our dingy office that unreality was mr donald g mitchell the graceful and gracious ik marvel dear to the old hearts that are still young for his dream life and his reveries of a bachelor and never unreal in anything but his pretence of being the real editor of the magazine in this disguise he feigned that he had a way of throwing himself back in the easy chair and indulging in an easy and careless overlook of the gossiping papers of the day and in such chitchat with chance visitors as kept him informed of the drift of the town talk while it relieved greatly the monotony of his office hours not bent on choosing mere gossip he promised to be on the watch for such topics or incidents as seemed really important and suggestive and to set them down with all that gloss and that happy lack of sequence which make everyday talk so much better than everyday writing  while the actual unreality stood thinking how perfectly the theory and practice of the easy chair for hard upon fifty years had been forecast in these words and while the warehouse agent stood waiting his pleasure the easy chair fetched a long deep sigh sigh one must call the sound but it was rather like that soft complaint of the woody fibres in a table which disembodied spirits are about to visit and which continues to exhale from it till their peculiar vocabulary utters itself in a staccato of muffled taps no one who has heard that sound can mistake it for another and the unreal editor knew at once that he confronted in the easy chair an animate presence  how long have i been here it asked like one wakened from a deep sleep  about eight years said the unreal editor  ah i remember the easy chair murmured and as the unreal editor bent forward to pluck away certain sprays of foliage that clung to its old red back it demanded what is that  some bits of holly and mistletoe  yes the easy chair softly murmured again the last essay he wrote in me was about christmas i have not forgotten one word of it all how it began how it went on and how it ended in the very promise of the year appears the hectic of its decay the question that we have to ask forecasting in these summer days the coming of christmas which already shines afar off is this whether while we praise christmas as a day of general joy we take care to keep it so thackeray describes a little dinner at the timminses a modest couple make themselves miserable and spend all their little earnings in order to give a dinner to people for whom they do not care and who do not care for them christmas is made miserable to the timminses because they feel that they must spend lavishly and buy gifts like their richer neighbors you cannot buy christmas at the shops and a sign of friendly sympathy costs little should not the extravagance of christmas cause every honest man and woman practically to protest by refusing to yield to the extravagance there the easy chair broke off from quoting that was curtis the kind and reasonable mood the righteous conscience incarnate in the studied art the charming literary allusion for the sake of the unliterary lesson the genial philosophy                                not too good    for human natures daily food  the wisdom alike of the closet and the public square the large patience and the undying hopefulness do you think the easy chair said with a searching severity one would not have expected of it that you are fit to take his place  in evasion of this hard question the unreal editor temporized with the effect of not having heard it i believe that he and mr mitchell were the only writers of your papers till mr alden wrote the last  the easy chair responded dryly you forget aldrich  if i do i am the only pebble on the shore of time that does or will retorted the unreal editor but he wrote you for only two months i well remember what a pleasure he had in it and he knew how to make his readers share his pleasure still it was mr mitchell who invented you and it was curtis who characterized you beyond all the rest  for a while said the easy chair with autobiographical relish they wrote me together but it was not long before mr mitchell left off and curtis kept on alone and as you say he incomparably characterized me he had his millennial hopes as well as you in his youth he trusted in a time     when the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe    and the kindly earth shall slumber lapt in universal law  and he never lost that faith as he wrote in one of my best papers the famous paper on brook farm bound fast by the brazen age we can see that the way back to the age of gold lies through justice which will substitute cooperation for competition he expected the world to be made over in the image of heaven some time but meanwhile he was glad to help make it even a little better and pleasanter than he found it he was ready to tighten a loose screw here and there to pour a drop of oil on the rusty machinery to mend a broken wheel he was not above putting a patch on a rift where a whiff of infernal air came up from the bottomless pit  and i also believe in alleviations the unreal editor interrupted i love justice but charity is far better than nothing and it would be abominable not to do all we can because we cannot at once do everything let us have the expedients the ameliorations even the compromises en attendant the millennium let us accept the provisional the makeshift he who came on christmas day and whose mission as every christmas day comes to remind us was the brotherhood the freedom the equality of men did not he warn us against hastily putting new wine into old bottles to get the new bottles ready is slow work that kind of bottle must grow it cannot be made and in the mean time let us keep our latest vintages in the vat till we have some vessel proof against their fermentation i know that the hope of any such vessel is usually mocked as mere optimism but i think optimism is as wise and true as pessimism or is at least as well founded and since the one can no more establish itself as final truth than the other it is better to have optimism that was always the philosophy of the easy chair and i do not know why that should be changed the conditions are not changed  there was a silence which neither the easy chair nor the unreal editor broke for a while then the chair suggested i suppose that there is not much change in christmas at any rate  no said the unreal editor it goes on pretty much as it used the timminses who give tiresome little dinners which they cannot afford to dull people who dont want them are still alive and miserably bent on heaping reluctant beneficiaries with undesired favors and spoiling the simple pleasure of the time with the activities of their fatuous vanity or perhaps you think i ought to bring a hopeful mind even to the timminses  i dont see why not said the easy chair they are not the architects of their own personalities  ah take care take care cried the unreal editor you will be saying next that we are the creatures of our environment that the timminses would be wiser and better if the conditions were not idiotic and pernicious and you know what that comes to  no i am in no danger of that the easy chair retorted the timminses are no such victims of the conditions they are of that vast moderately moneyed class who can perfectly well behave with sense if they will nobody above them or below them asks them to be foolish and wasteful  and just now you were making excuses for them  i said they were not the architects of their own personalities but nevertheless they are masters of themselves they are really free to leave off giving little dinners any day they think so it should be the moralists business to teach them to think so  and that was what curtis gladly made his business the unreal editor somewhat sadly confessed with an unspoken regret for his own difference more than once it had seemed to him in considering that rare nature that he differed from most reformers chiefly in loving the right rather than in hating the wrong in fact in not hating at all but in pitying and accounting for the wrong as an ancient use corrupted into an abuse involuntarily the words of the real editor in that beautiful tribute to the high soul they were praising came to the unreal editors lips and he quoted aloud to the easy chair his love of goodness was a passion he would fain have seen all that was fair and good and he strove to find it so and finding it otherwise he strove to make it so with no heart for satire the discord that fell upon his sensitive ear made itself felt in his dauntless comment upon social shams and falsehoods but he was a lover of peace and  as he was the ideal gentleman the ideal citizen he was also the ideal reformer without eccentricity or exaggeration however high his ideal it never parted company with good sense he never wanted better bread than could be made of wheat but the wheat must be kept good and sound and i may add the unreal editor broke off that he did not hurry the unripe grain to the hopper he would not have sent all the horses at once to the abattoir because they made the city noisy and noisome but would first have waited till there were automobiles enough to supply their place  the easy chair caught at the word automobiles it echoed  ah i forgot how long you have been stored said the unreal editor and he explained as well as he could the new mode of motion and how already with its soft rubber galoshes the automobile had everywhere stolen a march upon the iron heels of the horses in the city avenues  he fancied the easy chair did not understand quite from the intelligent air with which it eagerly quitted the subject  well it said at last this isnt such a bad time to live in after all it appears but for a supreme test of your optimism now what good can you find to say of christmas what sermon could you preach on that hackneyed theme which would please the fancy and gladden the heart of the readers of a christmas number where you should make your first appearance in the easy chair  to himself the unreal editor had to own that this was a poser in his heart he was sick of christmas not of the dear and high event the greatest in the memory of the world which it records and embodies but the stale and wearisome christmas of the christmas presents purchased in rage and bestowed in despair the christmas of christmas fiction the christmas of heavy christmas dinners and indigestions the christmas of all superfluity and surfeit and sentimentality the christmas of the timminses and the tiny tims but while he thought of these by operation of the divine law which renders all things sensible by their opposites he thought of the other kinds of christmas which can never weary or disgust the christmas of the little children and the simplehearted and the poor and suddenly he addressed himself to the easy chair with unexpected and surprising courage  why should that be so very difficult he demanded if you look at it rightly christmas is always full of inspiration and songs as well as sermons will flow from it till time shall be no more the trouble with us is that we think it is for the pleasure of opulent and elderly people for whom there can be no pleasures but only habits they are used to having everything and as joy dwells in novelty it has ceased to be for them in christmas gifts and giving and all manner of christmas conventions but for the young to whom these things are new and for the poor to whom they are rare christmas and christmasing are sources of perennial happiness all that you have to do is to guard yourself from growing rich and from growing old and then the delight of christmas is yours forever it is not difficult it is very simple for even if years and riches come upon you in a literal way you can by a little trying keep yourself young and poor in spirit then you can always rejoice with the innocent and riot with the destitute  i once knew a father the unreal editor continued a most doting and devoted father who when he bent over the beds of his children to bid them goodnight and found them high sorrowful and cloyed as the little ones are apt to be after a hard days pleasure used to bid them think about christmas if he offered this counsel on the night say of the 26th of december and they had to look forward to a whole year before their hopes of consolation could possibly find fruition they had as they afterward confessed to him a sense of fatuity if not of mocking in it even on the fourth of july after the last cracker had been fired and the last roman candle spent they owned that they had never been able to think about christmas to an extent that greatly assuaged their vague regrets it was not till the following thanksgiving that they succeeded in thinking about christmas with anything like the entire cheerfulness expected of them  i dont see any application in this homily said the easy chair or only an application disastrous to your imaginable postulate that christmas is a beneficent and consolatory factor in our lives  that is because you have not allowed me to conclude the unreal editor protested when the easy chair cut in with  there is nothing i would so willingly allow you to do and laughed and shook as if it had been rabelaiss easy chair  the unreal editor thought it best to ignore the untimely attempt at wit the difficulty in this case with both the father and the children was largely temperamental but it was chiefly because of a defect in their way of thinking about christmas it was a very ancient error by no means peculiar to this amiable family and it consisted in thinking about christmas with reference to ones self instead of others  isnt that rather banal the easy chair asked  not at all banal said the unreal editor resisting an impulse to do the easy chair some sort of violence at the same time he made his reflection that if preachers were criticised in that way to their faces there would shortly be very few saints left in the pulpit he gave himself a few moments to recover his temper and then he went on if christmas means anything at all it means anything but ones own pleasure up to the first christmas day the whole world had supposed that it could be happy selfishly and its children still suppose so but there is really no such thing as selfish as personal happiness  tolstoy the easy chair noted  yes tolstoy the unreal editor retorted he more than any other has brought us back to the knowledge of this truth which came into the world with christmas perhaps because he more than any other has tried to think and to live christianity when once you have got this vital truth into your mind the whole universe is luminously filled with the possibilities of impersonal unselfish happiness the joy of living is suddenly expanded to the dimensions of humanity and you can go on taking your pleasure as long as there is one unfriended soul and body in the world  it is well to realize this at all times but it is peculiarly fit to do so at christmastime for it is in this truth that the worship of christ begins now too is the best time to give the divine word form in deed to translate love into charity i do not mean only the material charity that expresses itself in turkeys and plumpuddings for the poor but also that spiritual charity which takes thought how so to amend the sorrowful conditions of civilization that poverty which is the antithesis of fraternity shall abound less and less     now is the time now is the time    now is the hour of golden prime  for asking ones self not how much one has given in goods or moneys during the past year but how much one has given in thought and will to remove forever the wrong and shame of hopeless need and to consider what one may do in the coming year to help put the poor lastingly beyond the need of help  to despair of somehow sometime doing this is to sin against the light of christmas day to confess its ideal a delusion its practice a failure if on no other day of all the three hundred and sixtyfive we must on this day renew our faith in justice which is the highest mercy  the easy chair no longer interrupted and the unreal editor having made his point went on after the manner of preachers when they are also editors to make it over again and to repeat himself pitilessly unsparingly he did not observe that the easy chair had shrunk forward until all its leathern seat was wrinkled and its carven top was bent over its old red back when he stopped at last the warehouse agent asked in whisper  what do you want done with it sir  oh said the unreal editor send it back to franklin square and then with a sudden realization of the fact he softly added dont wake it  there in franklin square still dreaming it was set up in the rear of the magazine where it has become not only the place but the stuff of dreams such as men are made of from month to month ever since its reveries its illusions which some may call deliverances have gone on with more and more a disposition to dramatize themselves it has seemed to the occupant of the easy chair at times as if he had suffered with it some sort of landchange from a sole entity to a multiple personality in which his several selves conversed with one another and came and went unbidden at first after a moment of question whether his imagination was not frequented by the phantoms of delight which in the flesh had formerly filled his place whether the spirits which haunted him in it were not those of mitchell of curtis of aldrich he became satisfied from their multitude and nature that they were the subdivisions of his own ego and as such he has more and more frankly treated them     ii  a year of spring and a life of youth   on one of those fine days which the april of the other year meanly grudged us a poet flown with the acceptance of a quarterpage lyric by the real editor in the study next door came into the place where the easy chair sat rapt in the music of the elevated trains and the vision of the brooklyn bridge towers era la stagione nella quale la rivestita terra più che tutto l altro anno si mostra bella he said without other salutation throwing his soft gray hat on a heap of magazines and newspapers in the corner and finding what perch he could for himself on the windowsill  what is that he of the easy chair gruffly demanded he knew perfectly well but he liked marring the bloom on a fellowcreatures joy by a show of savage ignorance  its the divine beginning of boccaccios fiammetta it is the very soul of spring and it is so inalienably of boccaccios own time and tongue and sun and air that there is no turning it into the language of another period or climate what would you find to thrill you in it was the season in which the reapparelled earth more than in all the other year shows herself fair the rhythm is lost the flow sweet as the first runnings of the maple where the woodpecker has tapped it stiffens into sugar the liquid form is solidified into the cake adulterated with glucose and sold for a cent as the pure vermont product  as he of the easy chair could not deny this he laughed recklessly i understood what your passage from boccaccio meant and why you came in here praising spring in its words you are happy because you have sold a poem probably for more than it is worth but why do you praise spring what do you fellows do it for you know perfectly well that it is the most capricious the most treacherous the most delusive deadly slatternly downatheels milkmaidhanded season of the year without decision of character or fixed principles and with only the vaguest rawgirlish ideals a red nose between crazy smiles and streaming eyes if it did not come at the end of winter when people are glad of any change nobody could endure it and it would be cast neck and crop out of the calendar fancy spring coming at the end of summer it would not be tolerated for a moment with the contrast of its crude formless beauty and the ripe loveliness of august every satisfied sense of happiness secure and established would be insulted by its haphazard promises made only to be broken rather the outraged mortal would say the last tender hours of autumn the first deathfulthrilling snowfall with all the thoughts of life wandering flakelike through the dim airrather these than the recurrence of those impulses and pauses those kisses frozen on the lips those tender rays turning to the lash of sleet across the face of nature no the only advantage spring can claim over her sister seasons is her novelty the only reason she can offer for being the spoiled child of the poets is that nobody but the poets could keep on fancying that there was any longer the least originality in her novelty  the poet attempted to speak in the little stop he of the easy chair made for taking breath but he was not suffered to do so  every atom of originality has been drained from the novelty of spring in the process of the suns and science is rapidly depriving her even of novelty what was once supposed to be the spring grass has been found to be nothing but the fall grass with the green stealing back into the withered blades as for the spring lamb which used to crop the spring grass it is now out of the coldstorage where the spring chicken and the newlaid eggs of yesteryear come from it is said that there are no birds in last years nests but probably a careful examination would discover a plentiful hatch of nestlings which have hibernated in the habitations popularly supposed to be deserted the june before this early spring vegetables are in market throughout the twelvemonth and spring flowers abound at the florists in december and january there is no reason why spring should not be absorbed into winter and summer by some such partition as took place politically in the case of poland like that unhappy kingdom she has abused her independence and become a molestation and discomfort to the annual meteorology as a season she is distinctly a failure being neither one thing nor the other neither hot nor cold a very laodicean her winds were once supposed to be very siccative and peculiarly useful in drying the plaster in new houses but now the contractors put in radiators as soon as the walls are up and the work is done much better as for the germinative force of her suns in these days of intensive farming when electricity is applied to the work once done by them they can claim to have no virtue beyond the suns of july or august which most seeds find effective enough if spring were absorbed into summer the heat of that season would be qualified and its gentler warmth would be extended to autumn which would be prolonged into the winter the rigors of winter would be much abated and the partition of spring among the other seasons would perform the mystic office of the gulf stream in ameliorating our climate besides ridding us of a time of most tedious and annoying suspense and what should we lose by it  the poet seemed not to be answering the easy chair directly but only to be murmuring to himself youth  youth youth the easy chair repeated in exasperation and what is youth  the best thing in the world  for whom is it the best thing  this question seemed to give the poet pause well he said finally with a not very forcible smile for itself  ah there you are he of the easy chair exclaimed but he could not help a forgiving laugh in a way you are right the world belongs to youth and so it ought to be the best thing for itself in it youth is a very curious thing and in that it is like spring especially like the spring we have just been having to our cost it is the only period of life as spring is the only season of the year that has too much time on its hands yet it does not seem to waste time as age does as winter does it keeps doing something all the while the things it does are apparently very futile and superfluous some of them but in the end something has been accomplished after a march of whimsical suns and snows an april of quite fantastical frosts and thaws and a may at least partially of cold mists and parching winds the flowers which the florists have been forcing for the purpose are blooming in the park the grass is green wherever it has not had the roots trodden out of it and a filmy foliage like the soft foulard tissues which the young girls are wearing drips from the trees you can say it is all very painty the verdure too painty but you cannot reject the picture because of this little mannerism of the painter to be sure you miss the sheeted snows and the dreamy weft of leafless twigs against the hard blue sky still now it has come you cannot deny that the spring is pretty or that the fashionable colors which it has introduced are charming it is said that these are so charming that a woman of the worst taste cannot choose amiss among them in spite of her taste her hat comes out a harmonic miracle her gown against all her endeavors flows in an exquisite symphony of the tender audacities of tint with which nature mixes her palette little notes of chiffon of tulle of feather blow all about her this is rather a medley of metaphors to which several arts contribute but you get my meaning in making this appeal he of the easy chair saw in the fixed eye of the poet that remoteness of regard which denotes that your listener has been hearing very little of what you have been saying  yes the poet replied with a long breath you are right about that dreamy weft of leafless twigs against the hard blue sky and i wonder if we quite do justice to the beauty of winter of age we poets when we are so glad to have the spring come  i dont know about winter he of the easy chair said but in an opera which the english lord chamberlain provisionally suppressed out of tenderness for an alliance not eventually or potentially to the advantage of these states mr william gilbert has done his duty to the decline of life where he sings     there is beauty in extreme old age      theres a fascination frantic      in a ruin thats romantic  or at least no one else has said so much for that time of life which another librettist has stigmatized as     bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang  yes i know the poet returned clinging to the thread of thought on which he had cast himself loose but i believe a great deal more could be said for age by the poets if they really tried i am not satisfied of mr gilberts earnestness in the passage you quote from the mikado and i prefer shakespeares bare ruined choirs i dont know but i prefer the hard unflattering portrait which hamlet mockingly draws for polonius and there is something almost caressing in the notion of the lean and slippered pantaloon the worst of it is that we old fellows look so plain to one another i dare say young people dont find us so bad i can remember from my own youth that i thought old men and especially old women rather attractive i am not sure that we elders realize the charm of a perfectly bald head as it presents itself to the eye of youth yet an infants head is often quite bald  yes and so is an egg the easy chair retorted but there is not the same winning appeal in the baldness of the superannuated bird which has evolved from iteagle or nightingale parrot or     manywintered crow that leads the clanging rookery home  tennyson has done his best in showing us venerable in his picture of         the ionian father of the rest    a million wrinkles carved his silver skin      a hundred winters snowed upon his breast  but who would not rather be helen than homer her face launching a thousand ships and burning the topless tower of ilionfairer than the evening air and simply but effectively attired in the beauty of a thousand stars what poet has ever said things like that of an old man even of methuselah  yes the poet sighed i suppose you are partly right meteorology certainly has the advantage of humanity in some things we cannot make much of age here and hereafter we can only conceive of its being turned into youth fancy an eternity of sensibility  no i would rather not he of the easy chair returned sharply besides it is you who are trying to make age out a tolerable even a desirable thing  but i have given it up the poet meekly replied the great thing would be some rearrangement of our mortal conditions so that once a year we could wake from our dream of winter and find ourselves young not merely younger but youngthe genuine article a tree can do that and does it every year until after a hundred years or three hundred or a thousand it dies why should not a man or much more importantly a woman do it i think we are very much scanted in that respect  my dear fellow if you begin faultfinding with creation there will be no end to it it might be answered that in this case you can walk about and a tree cannot you can call upon me and a tree cannot and other things come the trees have not got it all their own way besides imagine the discomforts of a human springtime blowing hot and blowing cold freezing thawing raining and drouthing and never being sure whether we are young or old may or december we should be such nuisances to one another that we should ask the gods to take back their gift and you know very well they cannot  our rejuvenescence would be a matter of temperament not temperature the poet said searching the air hopefully for an idea i have noticed this spring that the isothermal line is as crooked as a railroad on the map of a rival i have been down in new hampshire since i saw you and i found the spring temperamentally as far advanced there as here in new york of course not as far advanced as in union square but quite as far as in central park between boston and portsmouth there were bits of railroad bank that were as green as the sward beside the mall and every now and then there was an enthusiastic maple in the wet lowlands that hung the air as full of color as any maple that reddened the flying landscape when i first got beyond the new york suburbs on my way north at portsmouth the birds were singing the same songs as in the park i could not make out the slightest difference  with the same note of nervous apprehension in them  i did not observe that but they were spring songs certainly  then the easy chair said i would rather my winter were turned into summer or early autumn than spring if there is going to be any change of the mortal conditions i like settled weather the calm of that time of life when the sins and follies have been committed the passions burned themselves out and the ambitions frustrated so that they do not bother the aspirations defeated the hopes brought low then you have some comfort this turmoil of vernal striving makes me tired  yes i see what you mean the poet assented but you cannot have the seasons out of their order in the rearrangement of the mortal conditions you must have spring and you must have summer before you can have autumn  are those the terms then i say winter at once winter is bad enough but i would not go through spring again for anyin winter you can get away from the cold with a good warm book or a sunny picture or a cozy old song or a new play but in spring how will you escape the rawness if you have left off your flannels and let out the furnace no my dear friend we could not stand going back to youth every year the trees can because they have been used to it from the beginning of time but the men could not even the women  at this moment a beatific presence made itself sensible and the easy chair recognized the poets muse who had come for him the poet put the question to her young she said why you and i are always young silly boy get your hat and come over to long island city with me and see the pussywillows along the railroadbanks the mosquitoes are beginning to sing in the ditches already     iii  sclerosis of the tastes   the other day one of those convertible familiars of the easy chair who     change and pass and come again  looked in upon it after some months absence with the effect of having aged considerably in the interval but this was only his latest avatar he was no older as he was no younger than before to support a fresh character he had to put on an appropriate aspect and having at former interviews been a poet a novelist a philosopher a reformer a moralist he was now merely looking the part of a veteran observer of a psychologist grown gray in divining the character of others from his own consciousness  have you ever noticed he began that the first things we get stiff in as we advance in life are our tastes we suppose that it is our joints which feel the premonitions of age and that because we no longer wish to dance or play ball or sprint in college races we are in the earliest stage of that sapless condition when the hinges of the body grind dryly upon one another and we lose a good inch of our stature through shrinkage though the spine still holds us steadfastly upright  well isnt that so the easy chair asked tranquilly  it may be so or it may not be so the veteran observer replied ultimately i dare say it is so but what i wish to enforce is the fact that before you begin to feel the faintest sense of stiffening joints you are allowing yourself to fall into that voluntary senescence which i call getting stiff in the tastes it is something that i think we ought to guard ourselves against as a sort of mental sclerosis which must end fatally long before we have reached the patriarchal age which that unbelieving believer metchnikoff says we can attain if we fight off physical sclerosis he can only negatively teach us how to do this but i maintain we can have each of us in our power the remedy against stiffening tastes  i dont see how the easy chair said more to provoke the sage to explanation than to express dissent  i will teach you how he said if you will allow me to make it a personal matter and use you in illustration  why not use yourself  because that would be egotistical and the prime ingredient of my specific against getting stiff in the tastes is that spiritual grace which is the very antidote the very antithesis of egotism up to a certain point a certain time we are usefully employed in cultivating our tastes in refining them and in defining them we cannot be too strenuous in defining them and as long as we are young the catholicity of youth will preserve us from a bigoted narrowness in æsthetic mattersand i imagine we both understand that we are dealing with thesethe youngest youth has no tastes it has merely appetites all is fish that comes to its net if anything it prefers the gaudier of the finny tribes it is only when it becomes sophisticated that its appetites turn into tastes and it begins to appreciate the flavor of that diseased but pearlbearing species of oyster which we call genius because we have no accurate name for it with the appreciation of this flavor comes the overpowering desire for it the incessant and limitless search for it to the desire for it whole literatures owe their continued existence since except for the universal geniushunger of youth the classics of almost all languages would have perished long ago when indiscriminate and omnivorous youth has explored those vast and mostly lifeless seas it has found that the diseased oyster which bears the pearls is the rarest object in nature but having once formed the taste for it youth will have no other flavor and it is at this moment that its danger of hardening into premature age begins the conceit of having recognized genius takes the form of a bigoted denial of its existence save in the instances recognized this conceit does not admit the possibility of error or omission in the search and it does not allow that the diseased oyster can transmit its pearlbearing qualities and its peculiar flavors so that the attitude of aging youth in the stiffening of its tastes is one of rejection toward all new bivalves or not to be tediously metaphorical books  the veteran observer fell silent at this point and the easy chair seized the occasion to remark yes there is something in what you say but this stiffening of the tastes this sclerosis of the mind is hardly an infectious disease  ah but it is infectious the veteran observer exclaimed rousing himself infectious as far as the victim can possibly make it so he wishes nothing so much as to impart his opinions in all their rigidity to everybody else take your own case for instance  no we would rather not the easy chair interposed  but you must make the sacrifice the veteran observer persisted you will allow that you are extremely opinionated  not at all  well then that you are devoutly conscientious in the tenure of your æsthetic beliefs  something like that yes  and you cannot deny that in times past you have tried your best to make others think with you  it was our duty  well let it pass for that it amounted to an effort to make your mental sclerosis infectious and it was all the worse because in you the stiffening of the tastes had taken the form of aversions rather than preferences you did not so much wish your readers to like your favorite authors as to hate all the others at the time when there was a fad for making lists of the hundred best authors i always wondered that you didnt put forth some such schedule  we had the notion of doing something of the kind the easy chair confessed but we could not think of more than ten or a dozen really firstrate authors and if we had begun to compile a list of the best authors we should have had to leave out most of their works nearly all the classics would have gone by the board what havoc we should have made with the british poets the elizabethan dramatists would mostly have fallen under the ban of our negation to a play if not to a man chaucer but for a few poems is impossible spensers poetry is generally duller than the presidents messages before mr roosevelts time milton is a trial of the spirit in threefourths of his verse wordsworth is only not so bad as byron who thought him so much worse shakespeare himself when he is reverently supposed not to be shakespeare is reading for martyrs dantes science and politics outweigh his poetry a thousandfold and so on through the whole catalogue among the novelists  no dont begin on the novelists every one knows your heresies there and would like to burn you along with the romances which ive no doubt you would still commit to the flames i see you are the bourbon of criticism you have learned nothing and forgotten nothing but why dont you turn your adamantine immutability to some practical account and give the world a list of the hundred worst books  because a hundred books out of the worst would be a drop out of the sea there would remain an immeasurable welter of badness of which we are now happily ignorant and from which we are safe as long as our minds are not turned to it by examples  ah our visitor said i see that you are afraid to confess yourself the popular failure as a critic which you are you are afraid that if you made a list of the hundred worst books you would send the classes to buying them in the most expensive binding and the masses to taking them out of all the public libraries  there is something in what you say the easy chair confessed our popular failure as a critic is notorious it cannot be denied the stamp of our disapproval at one time gave a whole order of fiction a currency that was not less than torrential the flood of romantic novels which passed over the land and which is still to be traced in the tatters of the ragdoll heroes and heroines caught in the memories of readers along its course was undoubtedly the effect of our adverse criticism no we could not in conscience compile and publish a list of the hundred worst books it would be contrary for the reasons you give to public morals  and dont you think the observer said with a socratic subtlety that betrayed itself in his gleaming eye in the joyous hope of seeing his victim fall into the pit that his own admissions had digged for him and dont you think that it would also bring to you the unpleasant consciousness of having stiffened in your tastes  it might up to a certain point we consented but we should prefer to call it confirmed in our convictions wherever we have liked or disliked in literature it has been upon grounds hardly distinguishable from moral grounds bad art is a vice untruth to nature is the eighth of the seven deadly sins a false school in literature is a seminary of crime we are speaking largely of course  it certainly sounds rather tall our friend sarcastically noted and it sounds very familiar  yes we went on all the ascertained veracities are immutable one holds to them or rather they hold to one with an indissoluble tenacity but convictions are in the region of character and are of remote origin in their safety one indulges ones self in expectations in tolerances and these rather increase with the lapse of time we should say that your theory of the stiffening tastes is applicable to the earlier rather than the later middle life we should say that the tastes if they stiffen at the one period limber at the other their forbidding rigidity is succeeded by an acquiescent suppleness one is aware of an involuntary hospitality toward a good many authors whom one would once have turned destitute from the door or with a dole of organized charity mealtickets at the best but in that maturer time one hesitates and possibly ends by asking the stranger in especially if he is young or even if he is merely new and setting before him the cold potato of a qualified approval one says to him you know i dont think you are the real thing quite but taking you on your own ground you are not so bad come you shall have a nights lodging at least and if you improve if you show a tendency to change in the right direction there is no telling but you may be allowed to stay the week but you must not presume you must not take this frosty welcome for an effect of fire from the hearth where we sit with our chosen friends ten to one the stranger does not like this sort of talk and goes his waythe wrong way but at any rate one has shown an open mind a liberal spirit one has proved that one has not stiffened in ones tastes that one can make hopeful allowances in hopeful cases  such as the observer insinuated  such as do not fit the point exactly very likely the case may be that of an old or elderly author it has been only within a year or two that we have formed the taste for an english writer no longer living save in his charming books james payn was a favorite with many in the middle victorian period but it is proof of the flexibility of our tastes that we have only just come to him after shunning anthony trollope for fifty years we came to him almost as with a rush long after our halfcentury was past now james payn is the solace of our autumnal equinox and anthony trollope we read with a constancy and a recurrence surpassed only by our devotion to the truth as it is in the fiction of the divine jane and jane austen herself was not an idol of our first or even our second youth but became the cult of a time when if our tastes had stiffened we could have cared only for the most modern of the naturalists and those preferably of the russian and spanish schools a signal proof of their continued suppleness came but the other day when we acquainted ourselves with the work of the english novelist mr percy white and it was the more signal because we perceived that he had formed himself upon a method of thackerays which recalled that master as the occasional aberrations of payn and trollope recall a manner of him but it is thackerays most artistic method which mr white recalls in his studies of scamps and snobs he allows them as thackeray allows barry lyndon and the rest to tell their own stories and in their unconsciousness of their own natures he finds play for an irony as keen and graphic as anything in fiction he deals with the actual english world and the pleasure he gave us was such as to make us resolve to return to thackerays vision of his own contemporaneous english world at the first opportunity we have not done so yet but after we have fortified ourselves with a course of scott and dickens we are confident of being able to bear up under the heaviesthanded satire of vanity fair as for the luck of barry lyndon and the yellowplush papers and such like they have never ceased to have their prime delight for us but their proportion is quite large enough to survive from any author for any reader as we are often saying it is only in bits that authors survive their resurrection is not by the whole body but here and there a perfecter fragment most of our present likes and dislikes are of the period when you say people begin to stiffen in their tastes we could count the authors by the score who have become our favorites in that period and those we have dropped are almost as many it is not necessary to say who they all are but we may remark that we still read and read and read again the poetry of keats and that we no longer read the poetry of alexander smith but it is through the growth of the truly great upon his mature perception that the aging reader finds novel excellences in them it was only the other day that we picked up hawthornes scarlet letter and realized in it from a chance page or two a sardonic quality of insurpassable subtlety and reach this was something quite new to us in it we had known the terrible pathos of the story its immeasurable tragedy but that deadly quiet pitiless freezing irony of a witness holding himself aloof from its course and losing for that page or two the moralist in the mere observer was a revelation that had come to that time of life in us when you think the tastes stiffen and one refuses new pleasures because they are new  our visitor yawned visibly audibly and what is all this you have been saying you have made yourself out an extraordinary example of what may be done by guarding against the stiffening of the tastes after the end of second youth but have you proved that there is no such danger or was your idea simply to celebrate yourself at moments i fancied something like that  we owned the stroke with an indulgent smile no not exactly that the truth is we have been very much interested by your notionif it was yours which is not altogether probableand we have been turning its light upon our own experience in what we should not so much call selfcelebration as selfexploitation one uses ones self as the stuff for knowledge of others or for the solution of any given problem there is no other way of getting at the answers to the questions  and what is your conclusion as to my notion if it is mine the veteran observer asked with superiority  that there is nothing in it the fact is that the tastes are never so tolerant so liberal so generous so supple as they are at that time of life when they begin according to your notion to stiffen to harden to contract we have in this very period formed a new tasteor taken a new lease of an old onefor reading history which had been dormant all through our first and second youth we expect to see the time when we shall read the elizabethan dramatists with avidity we may not improbably find a delight in statistics there must be a hidden charm in them we may even form a relish for the vagaries of pseudopsychology  at this point we perceived the veteran observer had vanished and that we were talking to ourselves     iv  the practices and precepts of vaudeville   a friend of the easy chair came in the other day after a frost from the magazine editor which had nipped a tender manuscript in its bloom and was received with the easy hospitality we are able to show the rejected from a function involving neither power nor responsibility  ah we breathed sadly at the sight of the wilted offering in the hands of our friend what is it he wont take now  wait till i get my second wind the victim of unrequited literature answered dropping into the easy chair from which the occupant had risen and he sighed pensively i felt so sure i had got him this time he closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the uncomfortably carven top of the easy chair it was perhaps his failure to find rest in it that restored him to animation it is a little thing he murmured on the decline of the vaudeville  the decline of the vaudeville we repeated wrinkling our forehead in grave misgiving then for want of something better we asked do you think that is a very dignified subject for the magazine  why bless my soul the rejected one cried starting somewhat violently forward what is your magazine itself but vaudeville with your contributors all doing their stunts of fiction or poetry or travel or sketches of life or articles of popular science and sociological interest and i dont know what all what are your illustrations but the moving pictures of the kalatechnoscope why he said with inspiration what are you yourself but a species of chaser that comes at the end of the show and helps clear the ground for the next months performance by tiring out the lingering readers  you dont think we suggested youre being rather unpleasant  our friend laughed harshly and we were glad to see him restored to so much cheerfulness at any rate i think the notion is a pretty good fit though if you dont like to wear it i dont insist why should you object to being likened to those poor fellows who come last on the programme at the vaudeville very often they are as good as the others and sometimes when i have determined to get my five hours enjoyment to the last moment before six oclock i have had my reward in something unexpectedly delightful in the work of the chasers i have got into close human relations with them i and the halfdozen brave spirits who have stuck it out with me while the ushers went impatiently about clacking the seats back and picking up the programmes and lost articles under them i have had the same sense of kindly comradery with you and now and then my patience has been rewarded by you just as it has been by the chasers at the vaudeville and ive said so to people ive said youre wrong to put down the magazine the way most of you do before you get to those departments at the end sometimes there are quite good things in them  really said the unreal editor you seem to have had these remarks left over from your visit to the real editor we advise you to go back and repeat them they may cause him to revise his opinion of your contribution  its no use my going back i read finality in his eye before i left him and i feel that no compliment the most fulsome would move him dont turn me out i take it all back about your being a chaser you are the first act on the bill for me i read the magazine like a chinese bookfrom the back i always begin with the easy chair  ah now you are talking we said and we thought it no more than human to ask what is it you have been saying about the vaudeville anyway  the rejected one instantly unfolded his manuscript i will just read  no no we interposed tell us about itgive us the general drift we never can follow anything read to us  the other looked incredulous but he was not master of the situation and he resigned himself to the secondary pleasure of sketching the paper he would so much rather have read  why you know what an inveterate vaudevillegoer i have always been  we nodded we know how you are always trying to get us to neglect the masterpieces of our undying modern dramatists on the legitimate stage and go with you to see the ridiculous stunts you delight in  well it comes to the same thing i am an inveterate vaudevillegoer for the simple reason that i find better acting in the vaudeville and better drama on the whole than you ever get or you generally get on your legitimate stage i dont know why it is so very legitimate i have no doubt but the vaudeville or continuous variety performance is the older the more authentic form of histrionic art before the greek dramatists or the longerwinded sanskrit playwrights or the exquisitely conventionalized chinese and japanese and javanese were heard of it is probable that there were companies of vaudeville artists going about the country and doing the turns that they had invented themselves and getting and giving the joy that comes of voluntary and original work just as they are now and in the palmiest days of the greek tragedy or the roman comedy there were of course variety shows all over athens and rome where you could have got twice the amusement for half the money that you would at the regular theatres while the openly wretched and secretly rebellious actors whom euripides and terence had cast for their parts were going through rôles they would never have chosen themselves the wilding heirs of art at the vaudeville were giving things of their own imagination which they had worked up from some vague inspiration into a sketch of artistic effect no manager had foisted upon them his ideals of what the people wanted none had shaped their performance according to his own notion of histrionics they had each come to him with his or her little specialty that would play fifteen or twenty minutes and had after trying it before him had it rejected or accepted in its entirety then author and actor in one they had each made his or her appeal to the public  there were no hers on the stage in those days we interposed  no matter the rejected contributor retorted there are now and that is the important matter i am coming to the very instant of actuality to the show which i saw yesterday and which i should have brought my paper down to mention if it had been accepted he drew a long breath and said with a dreamy air of retrospect it is all of a charming unity a tradition unbroken from the dawn of civilization when i go to a variety show and drop my ticket into the choppingbox at the door and fastidiously choose my unreserved seat in the best place i can get away from interposing posts and persons and settle down to a long afternoons delight i like to fancy myself a farfetched phantom of the past who used to do the same thing at thebes or nineveh as many thousand years ago as you please i like to think that i too am an unbroken tradition and my pleasure will be such as shaped smiles immemorially gone to dust  we made our reflection that this passage was probably out of the rejected contribution but we did not say anything and our visitor went on  and what a lot of pleasure i did get yesterday for my fifty cents there were twelve stunts on the bill not counting the kalatechnoscope and i got in before the first was over so that i had the immediate advantage of seeing a gifted fellowcreature lightly swinging himself between two chairs which had their outer legs balanced on the tops of caraffes full of water and making no more of the feat than if it were a walk in the park or down fifth avenue how i respected that man what study had gone to the perfection of that act and the others that he equally made nothing of he was simply billed as equilibrist when his name ought to have been blazoned in letters a foot high if they were in any wise to match his merit he was followed by twin sisters who as refined singers and dancers appeared in sweeping confections of white silk with deeply drooping widely spreading white hats and longfringed white parasols heaped with artificial roses and sang a little tropical romance whose burden was     under the bámbootrée  brought in at unexpected intervals they also danced this romance with languid undulations and before you could tell how or why they had disappeared and reappeared in short green skirts and then shorter white skirts with steps and stops appropriate to their costumes but always i am bound to say of the refinement promised i cant tell you in what their refinement consisted but i am sure it was there just as i am sure of the humor of the two brothers who next appeared as singing and dancing comedians of the coon type i know that they sang and they danced and worked sable pleasantries upon one another with the help of the pianist who often helps out the dialogue of the stage in vaudeville they were not so good as the next people a jealous husband and a pretty wife who seized every occasion in the slight drama of the singing lesson and turned it to account in giving their favorite airs i like to have a husband disguise himself as a german maestro and musically make out why his wife is so zealous in studying with him and i do not mind in the least having the sketch close without reason it leaves something to my imagination two of americas leading banjoists charmed me next for after all there is nothing like the banjo if one does not ones self rejoice in its plunking there are others who do and that is enough for my altruistic spirit besides it is americas leading instrument and those who excel upon it appeal to the patriotism which is never really dormant in us its close association with color in our civilization seemed to render it the fitting prelude of the next act which consisted of monologue and songs by a divine creature in lampblack a shirtwaist worn outside his trousers and an exaggerated development of stomach what did he say what did he sing i dont know i only know that it rested the soul and brain that it soothed the conscience and appeased the hungerings of ambition just to sit there and listen to that unalloyed nonsense was better than to sport with amaryllis in the shade or with the tangles of neæras hair or to be the object of a votive dinner or to be forgiven ones sins there is no such complete purgation of care as one gets from the real afroamerican when he is unreal and lures one completely away from life while professing to give his impressions of it you with your brute preferences for literality will not understand this and i suppose you would say i ought to have got a purer and higher joy out of the little passage of drama which followed and i dont know but i did it was nothing but the notion of a hapless halfgrown girl who has run away from the poorhouse for a halfholiday and brings up in the dooryard of an old farmer of the codger type who knew her father and mother she at once sings one doesnt know why oh dear what can the matter be and she takes out of her poor little carpetbag a ragdoll and puts it to sleep with by low baby and the old codger puts the other dolls to sleep nodding his head and kicking his foot out in time and he ends by offering that poor thing a home with him if he had not done it i do not know how i could have borne it for my heart was in my throat with pity and the tears were in my eyes good heavens what simple instruments we men are the falsest note in all hamlet is in those words of his to guildenstern you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass s blood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe guildenstern ought to have said much my lord here is an actor who has been summering in the country and has caught a glimpse of pathetic fact commoner than the dust in the road and has built it up in a bit of drama as artless as a child would fancy and yet it swells your heart and makes you cry your mystery you have no mystery to an honest man it is only fakes and frauds who do not understand the soul the simplest willow whistle is an instrument more complex than man that is what i should have said in guildensterns place if i had had hamlet with me there at the vaudeville show  in the pretty language of the playbill the contributor went on this piece was called a pastoral playlet and i should have been willing to see mandy hawkins over again instead of the seals and sea lions next placarded at the sides of the curtain immediately lifted on them perhaps i have seen too much of seals but i find the range of their accomplishments limited and their impatience for fish and lump sugar too frankly greedy before and after each act their banjoplaying is of a most casual and irrelevant sort they ring bells to be sure in extreme cases they fire small cannon and their feat of balancing large and little balls on their noses is beyond praise but it may be that the difficulties overcome are too obvious in their instances i find myself holding my breath and helping them along too strenuously for my comfort i am always glad when the curtain goes down on them their mere flumping about the stage makes me unhappy but they are not so bad after all as trained dogs they were followed by three artistic european acrobats who compensated and consoled me for the seals by the exquisite ease with which they wrought the impossibilities of their art in the familiar sackcoats and topcoats of every day i really prefer tights and spangles but i will not refuse impossibilities simply because they are performed as our diplomats are instructed to appear at european courts in the ordinary dress of a gentleman it may even add a poignancy to the pleasure i own so reluctantly  there came another pair of singers and dancers and then a trick cyclist but really i cannot stand trick cycling now that plain cycling glory be has so nearly gone out as soon as the cyclist began to make his wheel rear up on its hind leg and carry him round the stage in that posture i went away but i had had enough without counting him though i left the kalatechnoscope with its shivering and shimmering unseen i had had my fill of pleasure rich and pure such as i could have got at no legitimate theatre in town and i came away opulently content  we reflected awhile before we remarked then i dont see what you have to complain of or to write of where does the decline of the vaudeville come in  oh the rejected contributor said with a laugh i forgot that its still so good when compared with the mechanical drama of the legitimate theatre that i dont know whether i can make out a case against it now but i think i can both in quality and quantity i think the change began insidiously to steal upon the variety show with the increasing predominance of short plays since they were short i should not have minded them so much but they were always so bad still i could go out when they came on and return for the tramp magician or the comic musician who played upon joints of stovepipe and the legs of receptionchairs and the like and scratched matches on his two days beard and smoked a plaintive air on a cigarette but when the playlets began following one another in unbroken succession i did not know what to do almost before i was aware of their purpose three of the leading vaudeville houses threw off the mask and gave plays that took up the whole afternoon and though they professed to intersperse the acts with what they called big vaudeville i could not be deceived and i simply stopped going when i want to see a fouract play i will go to the legitimate theatre and see something that i can smell too the influence of the vaudeville has on the whole been so elevating and refining that its audiences cannot stand either the impurity or the imbecility of the fashionable drama but now the vaudeville itself is beginning to decline in quality as well as quantity  not toward immodesty  no not so much that but the fine intellectual superiority of the continuous performance is beginning to suffer contamination from the plays where there are waits between the acts i spoke just now of the tramp magician but i see him no longer at the variety houses the comic musician is of the rarest occurrence during the whole season i have as yet heard no cornet solo on a revolver or a rollingpin the most dangerous acts of the trapeze have been withdrawn the acrobats still abound but it is three long years since i looked upon a coon act with real afroamericans in it or saw a citizen of cincinnati in a fur overcoat keeping a silk hat an open umbrella and a small wad of paper in the air with one hand it is true that the conquest of the vaudeville houses by the fullfledged drama has revived the oldfashioned stock companies in many cases and has so far worked for good but it is a doubtful advantage when compared with the loss of the direct inspiration of the artists who created and performed their stunts  delightful word we dreamily noted how did it originate  oh i dont know its probably a perversion of stint a task or part which is also to be found in the dictionary as stent what does it matter there is the word and there is the thing and both are charming i approve of the stunt because it is always the stuntists own he imagined it he made it and he loves it he seems never to be tired of it even when it is bad and when nobody in the house lends him a hand with it of course when it comes to that it has to go and he with it it has to go when it is good after it has had its day though i dont see why it should go for my part there are stunts i could see endlessly over again and not weary of them can you say as much of any play  gilbert and sullivans operas we suggested  that is true but without the music and even with the music the public wont have them any longer i would like to see the stunt fully developed i should like to have that lovely wilding growth delicately nurtured into drama as limitless and lawless as life itself owing no allegiance to plot submitting to no rule or canon but going gayly on to nothingness as human existence does full of gleaming lights and dark with inconsequent glooms musical merry melancholy mad but neverending as the race itself  you would like a good deal more than you are ever likely to get we said and here we thought it was time to bring our visitor to book again but about the decline of vaudeville  well it isnt grovelling yet in the mire with popular fiction but it is standing still and whatever is standing still is going backward or at least other things are passing it to hold its own the vaudeville must grab something more than its own it must venture into regions yet unexplored it must seize not only the fleeting moments but the enduring moments of experience it should be wise not only to the whims and moods but the passions the feelings the natures of men for it appeals to a public not sophisticated by mistaken ideals of art but instantly responsive to representations of life nothing is lost upon the vaudeville audience not the lightest touch not the airiest shadow of meaning compared with the ordinary audience at the legitimate theatres  then what you wish we concluded is to elevate the vaudeville  the visitor got himself out of the easy chair with something between a groan and a growl you mean to kill it     v  intimations of italian opera   whether pleasure of the first experience is more truly pleasure than that which comes rich in associations from pleasures of the past is a doubt that no hedonistic philosopher seems to have solved yet we should in fact be sorry if any had for in that case we should be without such small occasion as we now have to suggest it in the forefront of a paper which will not finally pass beyond the suggestion when the reader has arrived at our last word we can safely promise him he will still have the misgiving we set out with and will be confirmed in it by the reflection that no pleasure either of the earliest or the latest experience can be unmixed with pain one will be fresher than the other that is all but it is not certain that the surprise will have less of disappointment in it than the unsurprise in the one case the case of youth say there will be the racial disappointment to count with and in the other the case of age there will be the personal disappointment which is probably a lighter thing the racial disappointment is expressed in what used to be called somewhat untranslatably weltschmerz this was peculiarly the appanage of youth being the anticipative melancholy the pensive foreboding distilled from the blighted hopes of former generations of youth mixed with the effervescent blood of the young heart it acted like a subtle poison and eventuated in more or less rhythmical deliriums in cynical excesses of sentiment in extravagances of behavior in effects which commonly passed when the subject himself became ancestor and transmitted his inherited burden of weltschmerz to his posterity the old are sometimes sad on account of the sins and follies they have personally committed and know they will commit again but for pure gloomgloom positive absolute all but palpableyou must go to youth that is not merely the time of disappointment it is in itself disappointment it is not what it expected to be and it finds nothing which confronts it quite if at all responsive to the inward vision the greatest the loveliest things in the world lose their iridescence or dwindle before it the old come to things measurably prepared to see them as they are take them for what they are worth but the young are the prey of impassioned prepossessions which can never be the true measures                                       the disadvantage of an opening like this is that it holds the same quality if not quantity of disappointment as those other sublime things and we earnestly entreat the reader to guard himself against expecting anything considerable from it probably the inexperienced reader has imagined from our weighty prologue something of signal importance to follow but the reader who has been our reader through thick and thin for many years will have known from the first that we were not going to deal with anything more vital say than a few emotions and memories prompted one night of the other winter by hearing one of the oldfashioned italian operas which a more than commonly inspired management had been purveying to an overwagnered public in fact we had a sense that this sort of reader was there with us the night we saw lelisir damore and that it was in his personality we felt and remembered many things which we could have fancied personal only to ourselves  he began to take the affair out of our keeping from the first moment when after passing through the crowd arriving from the snowy street we found our way through the distracted vestibule of the operahouse into the concentred auditorium and hushed ourselves in the presence of the glowing spectacle of the stage ah this is the real thing he whispered and he would not let us at any moment when we could have done so without molesting our neighbors censure the introduction of alpine architecture in the entourage of an italian village piazza it is a village at the foot of the alps probably he said and if not no matter it is as really the thing as all the rest as the chorus of peasants and soldiers of men and women who impartially accompany the orchestra in the differing sentiments of the occasion as the rivals who vie with one another in recitative and aria as the heroine who holds them both in a passion of suspense while she weaves the enchantment of her trills and runs about them as the whole circumstance of the divinely impossible thing which defies nature and triumphs over prostrate probability what does a little swiss gothic matter the thing is always opera and it is always italy i was thinking as we crowded in there from the outside with our lives in our hands through all those trolleys and autos and carriages and cabs and sidewalk ticketbrokers of the first time i saw this piece it was in venice fortyodd years ago and i arrived at the theatre in a gondola slipping to the watergate with a waft of the gondoliers oar that was both impulse and arrest and i was helped up the seaweedy slippery steps by a beggar whom age and sorrow had bowed to just the right angle for supporting my hand on the shoulder he lent it the blackness of the tide was pierced with the red plunge of a few lamps and it gurgled and chuckled as my gondola lurched off and gave way to another and when i got to my boxa box was two florins but i could afford iti looked down on just this scene over a pit full of austrian officers and soldiers and round on a few venetians darkling in the other boxes and halfheartedly enjoying the music it was the most hopeless hour of the austrian occupation and the air was heavy with its oppression and tobacco for the officers smoked between the acts it was only the more intensely italian for that but it was not more italian than this and when i see those impossible people on the stage and hear them sing i breathe an atmosphere that is like the ether beyond the pull of our planet and is as far from all its laws and limitations                                       our friend continued to talk pretty well through the whole interval between the first and second acts and we were careful not to interrupt him for from the literary quality of his diction we fancied him talking for publication and we wished to take note of every turn of his phrase  its astonishing he said how little art needs in order to give the effect of life a touch here and there is enough but art is so conditioned that it has to work against time and space and is obliged to fill up and round out its own body with much stuff that gives no sense of life the realists he went on were only half right  isnt it better to be half right than wrong altogether we interposed  im not sure what i wanted to express is that every now and then i find in very defective art of all kinds that mere look of the real thing which suffices a few words of poetry glance from the prose body of verse and make us forget the prose a moment of dramatic motive carries hours of heavy comic or tragic performance is any piece of sculpture or painting altogether good or isnt the spectator held in the same glamour which involved the artist before he began the work and which it is his supreme achievement to impart so that it shall hide all defects when i read what you wrote the other month or the other year about the vaudeville shows  hush we entreated dont bring those low associations into this high presence  why not it is all the same thing there is no inequality in the region of art and i have seen things on the vaudeville stage which were graced with touches of truth so exquisite so ideally fine that i might have believed i was getting them at first hand and pure from the streetcorner of course the poor fellows who had caught them from life had done their worst to imprison them in false terms to labor them out of shape and build them up in acts where anything less precious would have been lost but they survived all that and gladdened the soul i realized that i should have been making a mistake if i had required any stunt which embodied them to be altogether composed of touches of truth of moments of life we can stand only a very little radium the captured sunshine burns with the fires that heat the summers of the farthest planets and we cannot handle the miraculous substance as if it were mere mineral a touch of truth is perhaps not only all we need but all we can endure in any one example of art  you are lucky if you get so much we said even at a vaudeville show  or at an opera he returned and then the curtain rose on the second act when it fell again he resumed as if he had been interrupted in the middle of a sentence what should you say was the supreme moment of this thing or was the radioactive property the very soul of course it is there where nemorino drinks the elixir and finds himself freed from adina when he bursts into the joyous song of liberation and gives that delightful caper     which signifies indifference indifference    which signifies indifference  and which not uncommonly results from a philter composed entirely of claret when adina advances in the midst of his indifference and breaks into the lyrical lament     neppur mi guarda  she expresses the mystery of the sex which can be best provoked to love by the sense of loss and the vital spark of the opera is kindled the rest is mere incorporative material it has to be in other conditions the soul may be disembodied and we may have knowledge of it without the interposition of anything material but if there are spiritual bodies as there are material bodies still the soul may wrap itself from other souls and emit itself only in gleams but putting all that aside i should like to bet that the germ the vital spark of the opera felt itself life felt itself flame first of all in that exquisite moment of release which nemorinos caper conveys till then it must have been rather blind groping with nothing better in hand than that old wornout notion of a lovephilter what will you bet  we never bet we virtuously replied we are principled against it in all cases where we feel sure of losing though in this case we could never settle it for both composer and librettist are dead  yes isnt it sad that spirits so gay should be gone from a world that needs gayety so much that is probably the worst of death it is so indiscriminate the reader thoughtfully observed  but arent you we asked getting rather far away from the question whether the pleasure of experience isnt greater than the pleasure of inexperiencewhether later operas dont give more joy than the first  was that the question he returned i thought it was whether italian opera was not as much at home in exile as in its native land  well make it that we responded tolerantly  oh no he met us halfway but it naturalizes itself everywhere they have it in st petersburg and in irkutsk for all i know and certainly in calcutta and australia the same as in milan and venice and naples or as here in new york where everything is so much at home or so little its the most universal form of art  is it why more so than sculpture or painting or architecture  our demand gave the reader pause then he said i think it is more immediately universal than the other forms of art these all want time to denationalize themselves it is their nationality which first authorizes them to be but it takes decades centuries sometimes for them to begin their universal life it seems different with operas cavalleria rusticana was as much at home with us in its first year as lelisir damore is now in its sixtieth or seventieth  but it isnt we protested denationalized what can be more intensely italian than an italian opera is anywhere  youre right the reader owned as the reader always must if honest in dealing with the writer it is the operatic audience not the opera which is denationalized when the opera becomes universal we are all italians here tonight i only wish we were in our native land listening to this musical peal of ghostly laughter from the past                                       the reader was silent a moment while the vast house buzzed and murmured and babbled from floor to roof perhaps the general note of the conversation if it could have been tested would have been found voluntary rather than spontaneous but the sound was gay and there could be no question of the splendor of the sight we may decry our own almost as much as we please but there is a point where we must cease to depreciate ourselves even for the sake of evincing our superiority to our possessions we must not undervalue some of them one of these is the metropolitan opera house where the pride of wealth the vanity of fashion the beauty of youth and the taste and love of music fill its mighty cup to the brim in the proportions that they bear to one another in the community wherever else we fail of our ideal there we surely realize it on terms peculiarly our own subjectively the scene is intensely responsive to the new york spirit and objectively it is most expressive of the american character in that certain surface effect of thin brilliancy which remains with the spectator the most memorable expression of its physiognomy  no doubt something like this was in the readers mind when he resumed with a sigh its rather pathetic how much more magnificently italian opera has always been circumstanced in exile than at home it had to emigrate in order to better its fortunes it could soon be better seen if not heard outside of italy than in its native country it was only where it could be purely conventional as well as ideal that it could achieve its greatest triumphs it had to make a hard fight for its primacy among the amusements that flatter the pride as well as charm the sense you remember how the correspondents of mr spectator wrote to him in scorn of the affected taste of the town when the town in london first began to forsake the theatre and to go to the opera  yes they were very severe on the town for pretending to a pleasure imparted in a language it could not understand a word of they had all the reason on their side and they needed it but the opera is independent of reason and the town felt that for its own part it could dispense with reason too the town can always do that it would not go seriously or constantly to english opera though ever so much invited to do so for all the reasons especially the patriotic reasons isnt it strange bytheway how english opera is a fashion while italian opera remains a passion we had it at its best didnt we in the gilbert and sullivan operas which were the most charming things in the world but they charmed only for a while and it may be doubted whether they ever greatly charmed the town the manager of the metropolitan replaces german with italian opera and finds his account in it but could he find his account in it if he put on the mikado instead of lelisir damore if he did so the town would not be here why  the reader did not try to answer at once he seemed to be thinking but perhaps he was not other readers may judge from his reply which when it came was this there seems to be something eternally as well as universally pleasing in italian opera but what the thing is or how much of a thing it is i wouldnt undertake to say possibly the fault of english opera is its actuality it seizes upon a contemporaneous mood or fad and satirizes it but the italian opera at its lightest deals with a principle of human nature and it is never satirical it neednt be for it is as independent of the morals as of the reasons it isnt obliged by the terms of its existence to teach any more than it is obliged to convince its the most absolute thing in the world and from its unnatural height it can stoop at will in moments of enrapturing naturalness without ever losing poise wasnt that delightful where caruso hesitated about his encore and then with a shrug and a waft of his left hand to the house went off in order to come back and give his aria with more effect that was a touch of naturalness not in the scheme of the opera  yes but it was more racial more personal than natural it was delicious but we are not sure we approved of it  ah in italian opera youre not asked to approve youre only desired to enjoy  well then that bit of racial personality was of the effect of actuality and it jarred  perhaps youre right the reader sighed but he added it was charming yes it made itself part of the piece nemorino would have done just as caruso did  at the last fall of the curtain the reader and the writer rose in unison a drop of that full tide of life which ebbed by many channels out of the vast auditorium and in two or three minutes left it dry they stayed in their duplex personality to glance at the silken evanescences from the boxes and then being in the mood for the best society they joined the shining presences in the vestibule where these waited for their carriages and automobiles of this company the interlocutors felt themselves so inseparably part that they could with difficulty externate themselves so far as to observe that it was of the quality of the town which had gone to italian opera from the first  in mr spectators time the town would have been lighted by the smoky torches of linkboys to its chairs now it was called to its electric autos in the blaze of a hundred incandescent bulbs but the difference was not enough to break the tradition there was something in the aspect of that patrician throng as it waited the turn of each which struck the reader and writer jointly as a novel effect from any american crowd but which the writer scarcely dares intimate to the general reader for the general reader is much more than generally a woman and she may not like it perhaps we can keep it from offending by supposing that the fact can be true only of the most elect socially but in any case the fact seemed to be that the men were handsomer than the women they were not only handsomer but they were sweller if we may use a comparative hitherto unachieved in look and even in dress  how this could have happened in a civilization so peculiarly devoted as ours to the evolution of female beauty and style is a question which must be referred to scientific inquiry it does not affect the vast average of womans loveliness and taste among us in ranks below the very highest this remains unquestioned and unquestionable and perhaps in the given instance it was an appearance and not a fact or perhaps the joint spectator was deceived as to the supreme social value of those rapidly dwindling and dissolving groups  the reader and the writer were some time in finding their true level when they issued into the common life of the street and they walked home as much like driving home as they could on the way the reader who was so remotely lost in thought that the writer could scarcely find him made himself heard in a musing suspiration there was something missing can you think what it was  yes certainly there was no ballet  ah to be sure no ballet and there used always to be a ballet you remember the reader said how beatific it always was to have the minor coryphees subside in nebulous ranks on either side of the stage and have the great planetary splendor of the prima ballerina come swiftly floating down the centre to the very footlights beaming right and left ah theres nothing in life now like that radiant moment but even that was eclipsed when she rose on tiptoe and stubbed it down the scene on the points of her slippers with the soles of her feet showing vertical in the act why couldnt we have had that tonight yes we have been cruelly wronged  but you dont give the true measure of our injury you forget that supreme instant when the masterspirit of the ballet comes skipping suddenly forward and leaping into the air with calves that exchange a shimmer of kisses and catches the prima ballerina at the waist and tosses her aloft and when she comes down supports her as she bends this way and that way and all at once stiffens for her bow to the house think of our having been defrauded of that  yes we have been wickedly defrauded the reader was silent for a while and then he said i wonder if anybody except the choreographic composer ever knew what the story of any ballet was were you ever able to follow it  certainly not it is bad enough following the opera all that one wishes to do in one case is to look just as in the other case all one wishes to do is to listen we would as lief try to think out the full meaning of a browning poem in the pleasure it gave us as to mix our joy in the opera or the ballet with any severe question of their purport     vi  the superiority of our inferiors   the satirical reader introduced himself with a gleam in his eye which kindled apprehension in the unreal editors breast and perhaps roused in him a certain guilty selfconsciousness  i didnt know the reader said that you were such a wellappointed arbiter elegantiarum  meaning our little discourse last month on the proper form of addressing letters the editor boldly grappled with the insinuation oh yes etiquette is part of our function we merely hadnt got round to the matter before you liked our remarks  very much our visitor said with the fine irony characteristic of him all the more because i hadnt expected that sort of thing of you what i have expected of you hitherto was something more of the major morality  but the largesized morals did not enter into that scheme we deal at times with the minor morality too if the occasion demands as we have suggested you should not have been surprised to find politeness as well as righteousness advocated or applauded here naturally of course we prefer the largersized morals as questions for discussion had you one of the largersized questions of morality to present  i was thinking it was a largersized question of manners  for example  the experience of one of those transatlantic celebrities who seem to be rather multiplying upon us of late and who come here with a proclamation of their worship of american women ready to present as if in print to the swarming interviewers on the pier and who then proceed to find fault with our civilization on every other point almost before they drive up to their hotels  but isnt that rather an old story  i suppose it is rather old but it always interests us we are never free from that longing for a flattered appearance in the eyes of others which we so seldom achieve this last or next to last celebrityin the early winter it is impossible to fix their swift successionseems to have suffered amaze at the rude behavior of some dairymaids in the milkroom of the lady who was showing the celebrity over her premises i didnt understand the situation very clearly the lady must have been a lady farmer in order to have a milkroom with dairymaids in it but in any case the fact is that when the lady entered with the celebrity the maids remained seated where they were grouped together instead of rising and standing in the presence of their superiors as they would have done in the hemisphere that the celebrity came from  well what came of it  oh nothing it was explained to the celebrity that the maids did not rise because they felt themselves as good as their mistress and her guest and saw no reason for showing them a servile deference that this was the american ideal  in the minds of those swedish irish english polish german or bohemian dairymaids we murmured dreamily and when our reader roused us from our muse with a sharp what we explained of course they were not american dairymaids for it stands to reason that if they were dairymaids they could not be americans or if americans they could not be dairymaids  true our friend assented but all the same you admit that they were behaving from an american ideal  yes  well that ideal is what the celebrity objects to the celebrity doesnt like iton very high grounds  the grounds of social inequality the inferiority of those who work to those who pay and the right of the superiors to the respect of the inferiors  no the politeness due from one class to another  such as lives between classes in europe we suppose well that is very interesting is it of record that the lady and her guest on going into the milkroom where the dairymaids remained rudely seated bowed or nodded to them or said goodday young ladies  no that is not of record  their human quality their human equality being altogether out of the question was probably in no wise recognized why then should they have recognized the human quality of their visitors our satirical reader was silent and we went on there is something very droll in all that we suppose you have often been vexed or even outraged by the ingratitude of the waiter whom you had given a handsome tip over and above the extortionate charge of the house and who gathered up your quarter or halfdollar and slipped it into his pocket without a word or even an inarticulate murmur of thanks  often outraged is no word for it  yes we assented feeling our way delicately has it ever happened that in the exceptional case where the waiter has said thank you very much or the like you have responded with a cordial youre welcome or not at all  certainly not  why not  becausebecausethose are terms of politeness between  our friend hesitated and we interrogatively supplied the word equals there are always difficulties between unequals but try this some day and see what a real gratitude you will get from the waiter it isnt infallible but the chances are he will feel that you have treated him like a man and will do or say something to show his feeling he will give a twitch to your undercoat when he has helped you on with your topcoat which will almost pull you over we have even tried saying you are welcome to a beggar its astonishing how they like it bytheway have you the habit of looking at your waiter when he comes to take your order or do you let him stand facing you without giving him a glance above the lower button of his poor greasy waistcoat  no the theory is that he is part of the mechanism of the establishment  that is the theory but it has its inconveniences we ourselves used to act upon it but often when we found him long in bringing our order we were at a loss which waiter to ask whether it would be ready some time during the evening and occasionally we have blown up the wrong waiter who did not fail to bring us to shame for our error  they do look so confoundedly alike our visitor said thoughtfully  we others look confoundedly alike to them no doubt if they studied us as little as we study them if they ignored us as contemptuously as we do them upon the theory that we too are part of the mechanism the next man would be as likely as we to get our dinner  they are paid to study us our visitor urged  ah paid the intercourse of unequals is a commercial transaction but when the inferiors propose to make it purely so the superiors object they want something to boot something thrown in some show of respect some appearance of gratitude perhaps those dairymaids did not consider that they were paid to stand up when their employer and the visiting celebrity came into the milkroom and so unless they were civilly recognizedwe dont say they werent in this casethey thought they would do some of the ignoring too it is surprising how much the superiors think they ought to get for their money from the inferiors in that commercial transaction for instance they think they buy the right to call their inferiors by their first names but they dont think they sell a similar right with regard to themselves they call them mary and john but they would be surprised and hurt if the butler and waitress addressed them as mary and john yet there is no reason for their surprise do you remember in that entrancing and edifying comedy of arms and the manmr bernard shaws very best as we thinkthe wild bulgarian maid calls the daughter of the house by her christian name but you mustnt do that the mother of the house instructs her why not the girl demands she calls me louka  capital our friend agreed but of course shaw doesnt mean it  you never can tell whether he means a thing or not we think he meant in this case as ibsen means in all cases that you shall look where you stand  our satirist seemed to have lost something of his gayety arent you taking the matter a little too seriously  perhaps but we thought you wanted us to be more serious than we were about addressing letters properly this is the largersized morality the real no 11 sort and you dont like it though you said you expected it of us  oh but i do like it though just at present i hadnt expected it but if youre in earnest you must admit that the lower classes with us are abominably rude now i have the fancyperhaps from living on the continent a good deal in early life where i formed the habitof saying goodmorning to the maid or the butler when i come down but they never seem to like it and i cant get a goodmorning back unless i dig it out of them i dont want them to treat me as a superior i only ask to be treated as an equal  we have heard something like that before but we doubt it what you really want is to have your condescension recognized they feel that if they dont know it besides their manners have been formed by people who dont ask goodmorning from them they are so used to being treated as if they were not there that they cannot realize they are there we have heard city people complain of the wane of civility among country people when they went to them in the summer to get the good of their country air they say that the natives no longer salute them in meeting but we never heard that this happened when they first saluted the natives try passing the time of day with the next farmer you meet on a load of wood and you will find that the oldfashioned civility is still to be had for the asking but it wont be offered without the asking the american who thinks from your dress and address that you dont regard him as an equal will not treat you as one at the risk of a snub and he is right as for domesticsor servants as we insolently call themtheir manners are formed on their masters and are often very bad but they are not always bad we too have had that fancy of yours for saying goodmorning when we come down it doesnt always work but it oftener works than not a friend of ours has tried some such civility at others houses at his hosts house when the door was opened to him arriving for dinner and he was gloomily offered a tiny envelope with the name of the lady he was to take out at first it surprised but when it was imagined to be well meant it was apparently liked in extreme cases it led to note of the weather the second or third time at the same house it established something that would have passed with the hopeful spectator for a human relation of course you cant carry this sort of thing too far you can be kind but you must not give the notion that you do not know your place  ah you draw the line our friend exulted i thought so but where  at the point where you might have the impression that you respected butlers when you merely loved your fellowmen you see the difference  but isnt loving your fellowmen enough why should you respect butlers  to be sure but come to think of it why shouldnt you what is it in domestic employ that degrades that makes us stigmatize it as service as soon as you get outofdoors the case changes you must often have seen ladies fearfully snubbed by their coachmen and as for chauffeurs who may kill you or somebody else at any moment the mental attitude of the average automobilaire toward them must be one of abject deference but there have been some really heroic some almost seraphic efforts to readjust the terms of a relation that seems to have something essentially odious in it in the old times the times of the simple life now passed forever when the daughter of one family lived out in another she ate with the family and shared alike with them she was their help but she became their hindrance when she insisted upon the primitive custom after waiting at table had passed the stage when the dishes were all set down and the commensals did their own stretching heroes and seraphs did their utmost to sweeten and soften the situation but the unkind tendency could not be stayed the daughter of the neighbor who lived out became the hired girl and then she became the waitress especially when she was of neighbors beyond seas and then the game was up those who thought humanely of the predicament and wished to live humanely in it tried one thing and tried another that great soul of hdl one of the noblest and wisest of our economic reformers now gone to the account which any might envy him had a usage which he practised with all guests who came to his table before they sat down he or his wife said looking at the maid who was to serve the dinner this is our friend miss murphy and then the guests were obliged in some sort to join the host and hostess in recognizing the human quality of the attendant it was going rather far but we never heard that any harm came of it some thought it rather odd but most people thought it rather nice  and you advocate the general adoption of such a custom our friend asked getting back to the sarcasm of his opening note suppose a larger dinner a fashionable dinner with half a dozen men waiters that sort of thing might do at the table of a reformer which only the more advanced were invited to but it wouldnt work with the average retarded society woman or clubman  what good thing works with them we retorted spiritedly but no the custom would not be readily adopted even among enlightened thinkers we do not insist upon it the men and the maids might object they might not like knowing the kind of people who are sometimes asked to quite good houses to be sure they are not obliged to recognize them out of the house  but what our friend asked has all this got to do with the question of the decent respect due from domestics as you prefer to call them to their employers  as in that case of the dairymaids which we began with but why was any show of respect due from them was it nominated in the bond that for their four or five dollars a week they were to stand up when their mistress and her company entered the room why in fine should any human being respect another seeing what human beings generally are we may love one another but respect no those maids might and probably did love their mistress but they felt that they could show their love as well sitting down as standing up they would not stand up to show their love for one another  then you think there is some love lost between the master and man or mistress and maid nowadays our beaten antagonist feebly sneered  the masters and mistresses may not but the men and maids may have whole treasures of affection ready to lavish at the first sign of a desire for it they do not say so for they are not very articulate in the mean time the masters and mistresses want more than they have paid for they want honor as well as obedience respect as well as love the sort of thing that money used to buy when it was worth more than it is now well they wont get it they will get it less and less as time goes on whatever the good new times may bring they wont bring back the hypocritical servility of the good old times they  we looked round for our visiting reader but he had faded back into the millions of readers whom we are always addressing in print     vii  unimportance of women in republics   a visitor of the easy chair who seemed to have no conception of his frequency and who was able to supply from his imagination the welcome which his host did not always hurry to offer him found a place for himself on the windowsill among the mistaken mss sent in the delusion that the editor of the chair was the editor of the magazine  i have got a subject for you he said  have you ever heard we retorted of carrying coals to newcastle what made you think we wanted a subject  merely that perfunctory air of so many of your disquisitions i should think you would feel the want yourself your readers all feel it for you  well we can tell you we said that there could be no greater mistake we are turning away subjects from these premises every day they come here hat in hand from morning till night asking to be treated and after dark they form a topic line at our door begging for the merest pittance of a notice for the slightest allusion for the most cursory mention do you know that there are at least two hundred thousand subjects in this town out of a job now if you have got a subject you had better take it to the country press the new york magazines and reviews are overstocked with them the newspapers morning and evening are simply inundated with subjects subjects are turned down every sunday in the pulpits they cannot get standingroom in the theatres why we have just this moment dismissed a subject of the first interest have you heard how at a late suffrage meeting one lady friend of votes for women declared herself an admirer of monarchies because they always gave women more recognition more honor than republics  no i havent our visitor said  well it happened we affirmed but every nook and cranny of our brain was so full of subjects that we simply could not give this a moments consideration and we see that all the other editors in new york were obliged to turn the cold shoulder to it though they must have felt as we did that it was of prime importance  from a position of lounging ease our visitor sat up and began to nurse one of his knees between his clasped hands but if he asked you had been able to consider the subject what should you have said  there are a great many ways of considering a subject like that we replied we might have taken the serious attitude and inquired how far the female mind through the increasing number of angloamerican marriages in our international high life has become honeycombed with monarchism we might have held that the inevitable effect of such marriages was to undermine the republican ideal at the very source of the commonwealths existence and by corrupting the heart of american motherhood must have weakened the fibre of our future citizenship to the point of supinely accepting any usurpation that promised ranks and titles and the splendor of court life  wouldnt you have been rather mixing your metaphors our visitor asked with an air of having followed us over a difficult country  in a cause like that no patriotic publicist would have minded mixing his metaphors he would have felt that the great thing was to keep his motives pure and in treating such a subject our motives would have remained the purest whatever became of our metaphors at the same time this would not have prevented our doing justice to the position taken by that friend of votes for women we should have frankly acknowledged that there was a great deal to be said for it and that republics had hitherto been remiss in not officially acknowledging the social primacy of woman but in fact distinctly inviting her to a back seat in public affairs we should then have appealed to our thoughtful readers to give the matter their most earnest attention and with the conservatism of all serious inquirers we should have urged them to beware of bestowing the suffrage on a class of the community disposed so boldly to own its love of the splendors of the state would it be sage would it be safe to indulge with democratic equality a sex which already had its eyes on the flattering inequality of monarchy perhaps at this point we should digress a little and mention montesquieu whose delightful spirit of laws we have lately been reading we should remind the reader who would like to think he had read him too how montesquieu distinguishes between the principles on which the three sorts of government are founded civic virtue being the base of a republic honor the ruling motive in the subjects of a monarchy and fear the dominant passion in the slaves of a despotism then we should ask whether men were prepared to intrust the reins of government to women when they had received this timely intimation that women were more eager to arrive splendidly than to bring the car of state in safety to the goal how long would it be we should poignantly demand before in passing from the love of civic virtue to the ambition of honor we should sink in the dread of power  our visitor was apparently not so deeply impressed by the treatment of the subject here outlined as we had been intending and expecting he should be he asked after a moment dont you think that would be rather a heavyhanded way of dealing with the matter  oh we returned we have light methods of treating the weightiest questions there is the semiironical vein for instance which you must have noticed a good deal in us and perhaps it would be better suited to the occasion  yes our visitor suggested  yes we repeated in that vein we should question at the start whether any such praise of monarchy had been spoken and then we should suppose it had and begin playfully to consider what the honors and distinctions were that women had enjoyed under monarchy we should make a merit at the start of throwing up the sponge for republics we should own they had never done the statesmanlike qualities of women justice we should glance but always a little mockingly at the position of woman in the greek republics and contrast greatly to the republican disadvantage her place in the democracy of athens with that she held in the monarchy of sparta we should touch upon the fact that the athenian women were not only not in politics but were not even in society except a class which could be only fugitively mentioned and we should freely admit that the spartan women were the heroic inspiration of the men in all the virtues of patriotism at home as well as in the field we should recognize the sort of middle station women held in the roman republic where they were not shut up in the almost oriental seclusion of athenian wives nor invited to a share in competitive athletics like the spartan daughters we should note that if a spartan mother had the habit of bidding her son return with his shield or on it a roman mother expressed a finer sense of her importance in the state when she intimated that it was enough for her to be the parent of the gracchi but we should not insist upon our point which after all would not prove that the decorative quality of women in public life was recognized in rome as it always has been in monarchies and we should recur to the fact that this was the point which had been made against all republics coming down to the italian republics we should have to own that venice with her ducal figurehead had practically a court at which women shone as they do in monarchies while in florence till the medici established themselves in sovereign rule women played scarcely a greater part than in athens it was only with the medici that we began to hear of such distinguished ladies as bianca cappello and in the long commonplace annals of the swiss commonwealth we should be able to recall no female name that lent lustre to any epoch we should contrast this poverty with the riches of the french monarchy adorned with the memories of agnes sorel of diane de poitiers of madame de montespan of madame de pompadour following one another in brilliant succession and sharing not only the glory but the authority of the line of princes whose affections they ruled of course we should have to use an ironical gravity in concealing their real quality and the character of the courts where they flourished and in comparing the womanless obscurity of the english commonwealth with the feminine effulgence of the restoration we should seek a greater effect in our true aim by concealing the name and nature of the ladies who illustrated the court of charles ii  and what would your true aim be our visitor pressed with an unseemly eagerness which we chose to snub by ignoring it  as for the position of women in despotisms we continued we should confess that it seemed to be as ignobly subordinate as that of women in republics they were scarcely more conspicuous than the citizenesses who succeeded in the twilight of the one and indivisible the marquises and comtesses and duchesses of the ancien régime unless they happened as they sometimes did to be the head of the state without going back to the semimythical semiramis we should glance at the characters of cleopatra and certain byzantine usurpresses and with a look askance at the two empresses of russia should arrive at her late imperial majesty of china the poor bad isabella of spain would concern us no more than the great good victoria of england for they were the heads of monarchies and not of despotisms but we should subtly insinuate that the reigns of female sovereigns were nowhere adorned by ladies of the distinction so common as hardly to be distinction in the annals of kings and emperors what famous beauty embellished the court of elizabeth or either mary even annes mrs masham was not a shining personality and her sarah of marlborough was only a brilliant shrew  at this point we should digress a little but we should pursue our inquiry in the same satirical tenor we hope we are not of those moralists who assume a merit in denouncing the international marriages which have brought our women some to think tolerantly and some to think favorably of a monarchy as affording greater scope for their social genius but we should ask with the mockseriousness befitting such a psychological study how it was that while american girls married baronets and viscounts and earls and dukes almost none if any of their brothers married the sisters or daughters of such noblemen it could not be that they were not equally rich and therefore equally acceptable and could it be that they made it a matter of conscience not to marry ladies of title were our men then more patriotic than our women were men naturally more republican than women  this question would bring us to the pass where we should more or less drop the mocking mask we should picture a state of things in which we had actually arrived at a monarchy of our own with a real sovereign and a nobility and a court and the rest of the tradition with a sudden severity we should ask where since they could not all be of the highest rank our women would consent to strike the procession of precedence how with their inborn and inbred notions of the deference due their sex with that pride of womanhood which our republican chivalry has cherished in them they would like when they went to court to stand for hours perhaps while a strong young man or a fat old man or a robust man in the prime of life remained seated in the midst of them would it flatter their hopes of distinction to find the worst scenes of trolleycar or subway transit repeated at the highest social function in the land with not even a hangingstrap to support their weariness their weakness or if we must say it their declining years would the glory of being part of a spectacle testifying in our time to the meanness and rudeness of the past be a compensation for the aching legs and breaking backs under the trailing robes and the nodding plumes of a court dress  that would be a telling stroke our visitor said but wouldnt it be a stroke retold it doesnt seem to me very new  no matter we said the question is not what a thing is but how it is done you asked how we should treat a given subject and we have answered  and is that all you could make of it  by no means as subjects are never exhausted so no subject is ever exhausted we could go on with this indefinitely we could point out that the trouble was with us not too much democracy but too little that womens civic equality with men was perhaps the next step and not the social inequality among persons of both sexes without feeling that it affected our position we would acknowledge that there was now greater justice for women in a monarchy like great britain than in a republic like the united states with shame we would acknowledge it but we would never admit that it was so because of the monarchism of the first or the republicanism of the last we should finally be very earnest with this phase of our subject and we should urge our fair readers to realize that citizenship was a duty as well as a right we should ask them before accepting the suffrage to consider its responsibilities and to study them in the selfsacrificing attitude of their husbands and fathers or the brothers of one another toward the state we should make them observe that the actual citizen was not immediately concerned with the pomps and glories of public life that parties and constituencies were not made up of ones fellowaristocrats but were mostly composed of plebeians very jealous of any show of distinction and that in spite of the displeasures of political association with them there was no present disposition in american men to escape to monarchy from them we cannot we should remind them all be of good family that takes time or has taken it and without good family the chances of social eminence or even prominence are small at courts distinction is more evenly distributed in a democracy like ours everybody has a chance at it to be sure it is not the shining honor bestowed by kings but when we remember how often the royal hand needs washing we must feel that the honor from it may have the shimmer of putrescence this is of course the extreme view of the case and the condition of the royal hand is seldom scrutinized by those who receive or those who witness the honor bestowed but the honor won from ones fellowcitizens is something worth having though it is not expressed in a ribbon or a title such honor it seems probable will soon be the reward of civic virtue in women as well as men and we hope women will not misprize it the great end to be achieved for them by the suffrage is selfgovernment but with this goes the government of others and that is very pleasant the head of our state may be a woman chosen at no fardistant election and though it now seems droll to think of a woman being president it will come in due time to seem no more so than for a woman to be a queen or an empress at any rate we must habituate our minds to the idea we must realize it with the hope it implies that no woman will then care socially to outshine her sister at the most she will be emulous of her in civic virtue the peculiar grace and glory of republics we understand that this is already the case in new zealand and colorado and wyoming it is too soon perhaps to look for the effect of suffrage on the female character in denmark it may be mixed because there the case is complicated by the existence of a king which may contaminate that civic virtue by the honor which is the moving principle in a monarchy and now we turned lightly to our visitor what is the topic you wish us to treat  oh he said rising you have put it quite out of my head ive been so absorbed in what you were saying but may i ask just where in your treatment of the theme your irony ends  where yours begins we neatly responded     viii  having just got home   the air of having just got home from europe was very evident in the friend who came to interview himself with us the other day it was not of course so distinguishing as it would have been in an age of less transatlantic travel but still as we say it was evident and it lent him a superiority which he could not wholly conceal his superiority so involuntary would if he had wished to dissemble have affirmed itself in the english cut of his clothes and in the habit of his tophat which was so newly from a london shop as not yet to have lost the whiteness of its sweatband but his difference from ourselves appeared most in a certain consciousness of novel impressions which presently escaped from him in the critical tone of his remarks  well we said with our accustomed subtlety how do you find your fellowsavages on returning to them after a three months absence  dont ask me yet he answered laying his hat down on a pile of rejected mss delicately so as not to dim the lustre of its nap i am trying to get used to them and i have no doubt i shall succeed in time but i would rather not be hurried in my opinions  you find some relief from the summers accumulation of skyscrapers amid the aching void of our manners we suggested  oh the fresh skyscrapers are not so bad you wont find the english objecting to them half so much as some of our own fellows but you are all right about the aching void of manners that is truly the bottomless pit with us  you think we get worse  i dont say that exactly how could we  it might be difficult  i will tell you what he said after a moments muse there does not seem to be so much an increase of bad manners or no manners as a diffusion the foreigners who come to us in hordes but tolerably civil hordes soon catch the native unmannerliness and are as rude as the best of us especially the younger generations the older people italians czechs poles greeks assyrians or whatever nationalities now compose those hordes remain somewhat in the tradition of their home civility but their children their grandchildren pick up our impoliteness with the first words of our language or our slang which they make their adoptive mothertongue long before they realize that it is slang when they do realize it they still like it better than language and as no manners are easier than manners they prefer the impoliteness they find waiting them here i have no doubt that their morals improve we have morals and to spare they learn to carry pistols instead of knives they shoot instead of stabbing  have you been attacked with any particular type of revolver since your return we inquired caustically  i have been careful not to give offence  then why are you so severe upon your fellowsavages especially the minors of foreign extraction  i was giving the instances which i supposed i was asked for and i am only saying that i have found our manners merely worse quantitatively or in the proportion of our increasing population but this prompt succession of the new americans to the heritage of the old americans is truly grievous they must so soon outnumber us three to one ten to one twenty fifty and they must multiply our incivilities in geometrical ratio at boston where i landed  oh you landed at boston we exclaimed as if this accounted for everything but we were really only trying to gain time if you had landed at new york do you think your sensibilities would have suffered in the same degree we added inconsequently enough we always supposed that boston was exemplary in the matters you are complaining of  and when you interrupted me with a want of breeding which is no doubt national rather than individual i was going on to say that i found much alleviation from a source whose abundant sweetness i had forgotten i moan the sort of caressing irony which has come to be the most characteristic expression of our native kindliness there can be no doubt of our kindliness whatever we americans of the old racesuicidal stock are not we are kind and i think that our expression of our most national mood has acquired a fineness a delicacy with our people of all degrees unknown to any other irony in the world do you remember the house with the green shuttersi can never think of the book without a pang of personal grief for the tooearly death of the authorhow the bitter ironical temper of the scotch villagers is realized well our ironical temper is just the antithesis of that it is all sweetness but it is of the same origin as that of those terrible villagers it comes from that perfect that familiar understanding that penetrating reciprocal intelligence of people who have lived intimately in one anothers lives as people in small communities do we are a small community thrown up large as they say of photographs we are not so much a nation as a family we each of us know just what any other or all others of us intend to the finest shade of meaning by the lightest hint  ah we breathed quite as if we were a character in a novel which had inspired the author with a new phrase now you are becoming interesting should you mind giving a few instances  well that is not so easy but i may say that the friendly ironies began for us as soon as we were out of the more singleminded keeping of the ships stewards who had brought our handbaggage ashore and after extracting the last shilling of tip from us had delivered us over to the keeping of the customs officers it began with the joking tone of the inspectors who surmised that we were not trying to smuggle a great value into the country and with their apologetic regrets for bothering us to open so many trunks they implied that it was all a piece of burlesque which we were bound mutually to carry out for the gratification of a government which enjoyed that kind of thing they indulged this whim so far as to lift out the trays to let the government see that there was nothing dutiable underneath where they touched or lifted the contents with a mocking hand and at times carried the joke so far as to have some of the things removed but they helped put them back with a smile for the odd taste of the government i do not suppose that an exasperating duty was ever so inexasperatingly fulfilled  arent you rather straining to make out a case we have heard of travellers who had a very different experience  at new york yes where we are infected with the foreign singleness more than at boston perhaps a still livelier illustration of our ironical temperament was given me once before when i brought some things into boston there were some swiss pewters which the officers joined me for a moment in trying to make out were more than two hundred years old but failing jocosely levied thirty per cent ad valorem on them and then in the same gay spirit taxed me twenty per cent on a medallion of myself done by an american sculptor who had forgotten to verify an invoice of it before the american consul at the port of shipment  it seems to us we suggested that this was a piece of dead earnest  the fact was earnest our friend maintained but the spirit in which it was realized was that of a brotherly persuasion that i would see the affair in its true light as a joke that was on me it was a joke that cost me thirty dollars  still we fail to see the irony of the transaction  possibly our friend said after a moments muse i am letting my sense of another incident color the general event too widely but before i come to that i wish to allege some proofs of the national irony which i received on two occasions when landing in new york on the first of these occasions the commissioner who came aboard the steamer to take the sworn declaration of the passengers that they were not smugglers recognized my name as that of a wellknown financier who had been abroad for a muchneeded rest and personally welcomed me home in such terms that i felt sure of complete exemption from the duties levied on others when we landed i found that this good friend had looked out for me to the extent of getting me the first inspector and he had guarded my integrity to the extent of committing me to a statement in severalty of the things my family had bought abroad so that i had to pay twentyeight dollars on my daughters excess of the hundred dollars allowed free although my wife was bringing in only seventyfive dollars value and i less than fifty  you mean that you had meant to lump the imports and escape the tax altogether we asked  something like that  and the officers idea of caressing irony was to let you think you could escape equally well by being perfectly candid  something like that  and what was the other occasion  oh it was when i had a letter to the customs officer and he said it would be all right and then furnished me an inspector who opened every piece of my baggage just as if i had been one of the wicked  we could not help laughing and our friend grinned appreciatively and what was that supreme instance of caressing irony which you experienced in boston we pursued  ah there is something i dont think you can question but i didnt experience it i merely observed it we were coming down the stairs to take our hack at the foot of the pier and an elderly lady who was coming down with us found the footing a little insecure the man in charge bade her be careful and then she turned upon him in severe reproof and scolded him well she told him that he ought to have those stairs looked after for otherwise somebody would be killed one of these days well maam he said i shouldnt like that i was in a railroad accident once but i tell you what you do the next time you come over here you just telephone me and ill have these steps fixed or ill tell you you just write me a letter and let me know exactly how you want em fixed and ill see to it myself  that was charming we had to own and it was of an irony truly caressing as you say do you think it was exactly respectful  it was affectionate and i think the lady liked it as much as any of us or as the humorist himself  yes it was just so her own son might have joked her we assented but tell us croesus we continued in the form of socratic dialogue did you find at boston that multiple unmannerliness which you say is apparent from the vast increase of adoptive citizens we have been in the habit of going to boston when we wished to refresh our impression that we had a native country when we wished to find ourselves in the midst of the good old american faces which were sometimes rather arraigning in their expression but not too severe for the welfare of a person imaginably demoralized by a new york sojourn  our friend allowed himself time for reflection i dont think you could do that now with any great hope of success i should say that the predominant face in boston now was some type of irish face you know that the civic affairs of boston are now in the hands of the irish and with reason if the irish are in the majority  in new york it has long been the same without the reason we dreamily suggested  in boston our friend went on without regarding us the catholics outvote the protestants and not because they vote oftener but because there are more of them  and the heavens do not fall  it is not a question of that it is a question of whether the irish are as amiable and civil as the americans now they are on top  we always supposed they were one of the most amiable and civil of the human races surely you found them so  i did at queenstown but at boston i had not the courage to test the fact i would not have liked to try a joke with one of them as i would at queenstown or as i would at boston with an american their faces did not arraign me but they forbade me it was very curious and i may have misread them  oh probably not we lightly mocked they were taking it out of you for ages of english oppression they were making you stand for the black cromwell  oh very likely our friend said in acceptance of our irony because he liked irony so much but all the same i thought it a pity as i think it a pity when i meet a surly italian here who at home would be so sweet and gentle it is somehow our own fault we have spoiled them by our rudeness they think it is american to be as rude as the americans they mistake our incivility for our liberty  there is something in what you say we agreed if you will allow us to be serious they are here in our large free air without the parasites that kept them in bounds in their own original habitat we must invent some sort of culture which shall be constructive and not destructive and will supply the eventual good without the provisional evil  then we must go a great way back and begin with our grandfathers with the ancestors who freed us from great britain but did not free themselves from the illusion that equality resides in incivility and honesty in bluntness that was something they transmitted to us intact so that we are now not only the besthearted but the worstmannered of mankind if our habitual carriage were not rubbertired by irony we should be an intolerable offence if not to the rest of the world at least to ourselves bytheway since i came back i have been reading a curious old book by james fenimore cooper which i understand made a great stir in its day do you know ithome as found  we know it as one may know a book which one has not read it pretty nearly made an end of james fenimore cooper we believe his fellowcountrymen fell on him tooth and nail we didnt take so kindly to criticism in those days as we do now when it merely tickles the fat on our ribs and we respond with the ironic laughter you profess to like so much what is the drift of the book besides the general censure  oh it is the plain dull tale of an american family returning home after a long sojourn in europe so highbred that you want to kill them and so superior to their homekeeping countrymen that vulgarity for vulgarity you much prefer the vulgarity of the americans who have not been away the authors unconsciousness of the vulgarity of his exemplary people is not the only amusing thing in the book they arrive for a short stay in new york before they go to their countryseat somewhere up the state and the sketches of new york society as it was in the third or fourth decade of the nineteenth century are certainly delightful society was then so exactly like what it is now in spirit of course it was very provincial but society is always and everywhere provincial one thing about it then was different from what it is now i mean the attitude of the stayathomes toward the beenabroads they revered them and deferred to them and they called them hajii or travellers in a cant which must have been very common since george william curtis used the same oriental term for his howadji in syria and his nile notes of a howadji  we must read it we said with the readiness of one who never intends to read the book referred to what you say of it is certainly very suggestive but how do you account for the decay of the reverence and deference in which the hajii were once held  well they may have overworked their superiority  or we prompted  the stayathomes may have got onto the beenabroads in a point where we all fail unless we have guarded ourselves very scrupulously  and that is  there is something very vulgarizing for americans in the european atmosphere so that we are apt to come back worsemannered than we went away and vulgarer than the untravelled in so far as it is impoliter to criticise than to be criticised  and is that why your tone has been one of universal praise for your countrymen in the present interview  our friend reached for his hat smoothed a ruffled edge of the crown and blew a speck of dust from it one reasons to a conclusion he said not from it     ix  new york to the homecomers eye   our friend came in with challenge in his eye and though a month had passed we knew as well as if it were only a day that he had come to require of us the meaning in that saying of ours that new york derived her inspiration from the future or would derive it if she ever got it  well he said have you cleared your mind yet sufficiently to pour the day on mine or hadnt you any meaning in what you said ive sometimes suspected it  the truth is that we had not had very much meaning of the sort that you stand and deliver though we were aware of a large vague wisdom in our words but we perceived that our friend had no intention of helping us out and on the whole we thought it best to temporize  in the first place we said we should like to know what impression new york made on you when you arrived here if there was any room left on your soulsurface after the image of boston had been imprinted there  no man is unwilling to expatiate concerning himself even when he is trying to corner a fellowman this principle of human nature perhaps accounts for the frequent failure of thieves to catch thieves in spite of the proverb the pursuit suggests somehow the pleasures of autobiography and while they are reminded of this and that the suspects escape the detectives our friend gladly paused to reply  i wish i could say it was as unbeautiful as it could be but it was wonderful has anybody else ever said that there is no place like it on some accounts i am glad there isnt one place of the kind is enough but what i mean is that i went about all the next day after arriving from boston with europe still in my brain and tried for something suggestive of some other metropolis and failed there was no question of boston of course that was clean out of it after my first glimpse of fifth avenue in taxicabbing hotelward from the grand central station but i tried with berlin and found it a drearier boston with paris and found it a blonder and blither boston with london and found it sombrely irrelevant and incomparable new york is like london only in not being like any other place and it is next to london in magnitude so far so good but the resemblance ends there though new york is oftener rolled in smoke or mist than we willingly allow to londoners both however have an admirable quality which is not beauty one might call the quality picturesque immensity in london and in new york one might call it  he compressed his lips and shut his eyes to a fine line for the greater convenience of mentally visioning  what we impatiently prompted  i was going to say sublimity what do you think of sublimity  we always defend new york against you we accept sublimity how  i was thinking of the drive up or down fifth avenue the newer fifth avenue which has risen in marble and indiana limestone from the brownstone and brick of a former age the augustan fifth avenue which has replaced that old lincolnian fifth avenue you get the effect best from the top of one of the imperial motoromnibuses which have replaced the consular twohorse stages and i should say that there was more sublimity to the block between sixteenth street and sixtieth than in the other measures of the citys extent  illustration fifth avenue at thirtyfourth street  this is very gratifying to us as a fond newyorker but why leave out of the reach of sublimity the region of the skyscrapers and the spacious if specious palatiality of the streets on the upper west side  i dont altogether our friend replied especially i dont leave out the upper west side that has moments of being even beautiful but there is a point beyond which sublimity cannot go and that is about the fifteenth story when you get a group of those skyscrapers all soaring beyond this point you have in an inverted phase the unimpressiveness which taine noted as the real effect of a prospect from the summit of a very lofty mountain the other day i found myself arrested before a shopwindow by a large photograph labelled the heart of new york it was a map of that region of skyscrapers which you seem to think not justly beyond the scope of attributive sublimity it was a horror it set my teeth on edge it made me think of scrapironheaps heights pinnacles of scrapiron dont ask me why scrapiron go and look at that photograph and you will understand below those monstrous cliffs the lower roofs were like broken foothills the streets were chasms gulches gashes it looked as if there had been a conflagration and the houses had been burned into the cellars and the eye sought the nerveracking tangle of pipe and wire which remains among the ruins after a great fire perhaps this was what made me think of scrapironheaps heights pinnacles of it no there was no sublimity there some astronomers have latterly assigned bounds to immensity but the skyscrapers go beyond these bounds they are primordial abnormal  you strain for a phrase we said as if you felt the essential unreality of your censure arent you aware that mediæval florence mediæval siena must have looked with their innumerable towers like our skyscrapered new york they must have looked quite like it  and very ugly it was only when those towers which were devoted to party warfare as ours are devoted to business warfare were levelled that florence became fair and siena superb i should not object to a new york of demolished skyscrapers they would make fine ruins i would like to see them as ruins in fact now i think of it the heart of new york reminded me of the roman forum i wonder i didnt think of that before but if you want sublimity the distinguishing quality of new york as i feel it more and more while i talk of it you must take that stretch of fifth avenue from a motorbus top  but that stretch of fifth avenue abounds in skyscrapers we lamented the mans inconsistency  skyscrapers in subordination yes there is one to every other block there is that supreme skyscraper the flatiron but just as the flatiron since the newspapers have ceased to celebrate its pranks with mens umbrellas and the feathers and flounces and tempestuous petticoats of the women has sunk back into a measurable inconspicuity so all the other tall buildings have somehow harmonized themselves with the prospect and no longer form the barbarous architectural chaos of lower new york i dont object to their being mainly business houses and hotels i think that it is much more respectable than being palaces or warlike eminences guelf or ghibelline and as i ride uptown in my motorbus i thrill with their grandeur and glow with their condescension yes they condescend and although their tall white flanks climb in the distance they seem to sink on nearer approach and amiably decline to disfigure the line of progress or to dwarf the adjacent edifices downtown in the heart of new york poor old trinity looks driven into the ground by the surrounding heights and bulks but along my sublime upper fifth avenue there is spire after spire that does not unduly dwindle but looks as if tenderly reverently protected by the neighboring giants they are very good and kind giants apparently but the acme of the sublimity the quality in which i find my fancy insisting more and more is in those two stately hostelries the gog and magog of that giant company which guard the approach to the park like mighty pillars the posts of vast city gates folded back from them  come we said this is beginning to be something like  in november our friend said taking breath for a fresh spurt of praise there were a good many sympathetic afternoons which lent themselves to motorbus progress up that magnificent avenue and if you mounted to your place on top about three oclock you looked up or down the long vista of blue air till it turned mirk at either vanishingpoint under a sky of measureless cloudlessness that dimness almost smokiness at the closes of the prospect was something unspeakably rich it made me think quite out of relation or relevance of these nobly mystical lines of keats     his soul shall know the sadness of her night    and be among her cloudy trophies hung  we closed our eyes in the attempt to grope after him explain o howadji  i would rather not as you say when you cant he replied but i will come down a little nearer earth if you prefer short of those visionary distances there are features of the prospect either way in which i differently rejoice one thing is the shining black roofs of the cabs moving and pausing like processions of huge turtles up and down the street obeying the gesture of the midstream policemen where they stand at the successive crossings to stay them and floating with the coming and going tides as he drops his inhibitory hand and speeds them in the continuous current that is of course something you get in greater quantity though not such intense quality in a london block but there is something more fluent more mercurially impatient in a new york street jam which our nerves more vividly partake dont ask me to explain i would rather not he said and we submitted  he went on to what seemed an unjustifiable remove from the point nothing has struck me so much after a halfyears absence in this novel revelation of sublimity in new york as the evident increase on the street crowds the city seems to have grown a whole new population and the means of traffic and transportation have been duplicated in response to the demand of the multiplying freights and feet our friend laughed in selfderision as he went on i remember when we first began to have the electric trolleys  trams we believe you call them we insinuated  not when im on this side he retorted and he resumed i used to be afraid to cross the avenues where they ran at certain junctions i particularly took my life in my hand and my courage in both hands where sixth avenue flows into fiftyninth street and at sixth avenue and thirtyfourth street and at dead mans curve he has long been resuscitated on fourteenth street i held my breath till i got over alive and i blessed heaven for my safe passage at fortysecond and twentythird streets and at divers places on third avenue now i regard these interlacing iron currents with no more anxiety than i would so many purling brooks with steppingstones in them to keep my feet from the wet they are like gentle eddiessoft clear slow tideswhere one may pause in the midst at will compared with the deadly expanses of fifth avenue with their rush of all manner of vehicles over the smooth asphalt surface there i stand long at the brink i look for a policeman to guide and guard my steps i crane my neck forward from my coign of vantage and count the cabs the taxicabs the carriages the private automobiles the motorbuses the expresswagons and calculate my chances then i shrink back if it is a corner where there is no policeman to bank the tides up on either hand and lead me over i wait for some bold big team to make the transit of the avenue from the crossstreet and then in its lee i find my way to the other side as for the trolleys i now mock myself of them as thackerays frenchmen were said to say in their peculiar english i wonder if they really did it is the taxicabs that now turn my heart to water it is astonishing how they have multipliedthey have multiplied even beyond the ratio of our selfreduplicating population there are so many already that this morning i read in my paper of a trolleycar striking a horsecab the reporter had written quite unconsciously just as he used to write horseless carriage yes the motorcab is now the type the norm and the horsecab is thethethe  he hesitated for the antithesis and we proposed abnorm  say abnorm it is hideous but i dont know that it is wrong where was i  you had got quite away from the sublimity of new york which upon the whole you seemed to attribute to the tall buildings along fifth avenue we should like you to explain again why if the heart of new york with its skyscrapers made you think of scrapiron the flatiron soothed your lacerated sensibilities  illustration fifth avenue from the top of a motorbus  the flatiron is an incident an accent merely in the mighty music of the avenue a happy discord that makes for harmony it is no longer nefarious or even mischievous now the reporters have got done attributing a malign meteorological influence to it i wish i could say as much for the white marble rocket presently soaring up from the east side of madison square and sinking the beautiful reproduction of the giralda tower in the garden halfway into the ground as i look at this pale yellowish brown imitation of the seville original it has a pathos which i might not make you feel but i would rather not look away from fifth avenue at all it is astonishing how that street has assumed and resumed all the larger and denser life of the other streets certain of the avenues like third and sixth remain immutably and characteristically noisy and ignoble and fifth avenue has not reduced them to insignificance as it has broadway that is now a provincial high street beside its lordlier compeer but i remember when broadway stormed and swarmed with busy life why i remember the partycolored buses which used to thunder up and down and i can fancy some rip van winkle of the interior returning to the remembered terrors and splendors of that mighty thoroughfare and expecting to be killed at every crossingi can fancy such a visitor looking round in wonder at the difference and asking the last decaying survivor of the famous broadway squad what they had done with broadway from the battery to madison square beyond that to be sure there is a mighty flare of electrics blazoning the virtues of the popular beers whiskeys and actresses which might well mislead my elderly revisitor with the belief that broadway was only taken in by day and was set out again after dark in its pristinei think pristine is the word it used to beglory but even by night that special length of broadway lacks the sublimity of fifth avenue as i see it or imagine it from my motorbus top i knew fifth avenue in the lincolnian period of brick and brownstone when it had a quiet exclusive beauty the beauty of the unbroken skyline and the regularity of facade which it has not yet got back and may never get you will get some notion of it still in madison avenue say from twentyeighth to fortysecond streets and perhaps you will think it was dull as well as proud it is proud now but it is certainly not dull there is something of columnar majesty in the lofty flanks of these tall shops and hotels as you approach them which makes you think of some capital decked for a national holiday but in fifth avenue it is always holiday  enough of streets we cried impatiently now what of men what of that heterogeneity for which new york is famous or infamous you noticed the contrasting celtic and pelasgic tribes in boston what of them here with all the tribes of israel lost and found and the sledded polack the czech the hun the german the gaul the gothic and iberian spaniard and the swart stranger from our sister continent to the southward and the islands of the seven seas who so sorely outnumber us  our friend smiled thoughtfully why that is very curious do you know that in fifth avenue the american type seems to have got back its old supremacy it is as if no other would so well suit with that sublimity i have not heard that racesuicide has been pronounced by the courts amenable to our wise state law against felo de se but in the modern fifth avenue it is as if our stirp had suddenly reclaimed its oldtime sovereignty i dont say that there are not other faces other tongues than ours to be seen heard there far from it but i do say it is a sense of the american face the american tongue which prevails once more after long exile in the streets of our own metropolis you find yourself in an american city your native features your native accents have returned in such force from abroad or have thronged here in such multitude from the prospering pittsburgs cincinnatis chicagos st louises and san franciscos of the west that you feel as much at home in fifth avenue as you would in piccadilly or in the champs elysées or on the pincian hill yes it is very curious  perhaps we suggested after a moments reflection it isnt true     x  cheapness of the costliest city on earth   one of my surprises on getting back the more or less imaginary interlocutor who had got back from europe said in his latest visit to the easy chair is the cheapness of the means of living in new york  at this the easy chair certainly sat up stay not a moment howadji we exclaimed in removing our deepseated prepossession that new york is the most expensive place on the planet  but instead of instantly complying our friend fell into a smiling muse from which he broke at last to say i have long been touched by the pathos of a fact which i believe is not yet generally known do you know yourself with the searching knowledge which is called feeling it in your bones that a good many southerners and southerly westerners make this town their summer resort we intimated that want of penetrating statistics which we perceived would gratify him and he went on they put up at our hotels which in the anguish of the solstice they find invitingly vacant as soon as they have registered the clerk recognizes them as colonel or major or judge but gives them the rooms which no amount of family or social prestige could command in the season and there they stay waking each day from unmosquitoed nights to icedmelon mornings until a greater anguish is telegraphed forward by the associated press then they turn their keys in their doors and flit to the neighboring atlantic or the adjacent catskills till the solstice recovers a little and then they return to their hotel and resume their life in the city which they have almost to themselves with its parks and drives and roofgardens and vaudevilles unelbowed by the three or four millions of natives whom we leave behind us when we go to europe or newport or bar harbor or the adirondacks sometimes they take furnished flats along the park and settle into a greater permanency than their hotel sojourn implies they get the flats at about half the rent paid by the lessees who sublet them but i call it pathetic that they should count it joy to come where we should think it misery to stay still everything is comparative and i suppose they are as reasonably happy in new york as i am in my london lodgings in the london season where i sometimes stifle in a heat not so pure and clear as that i have fled from  very well we said dryly you have established the fact that the southerners come here for the summer and live in great luxury but what has that to do with the cheapness of living in new york which you began by boasting  ah i was coming back to that the howadji said with a glow of inspiration i have been imagining in the relation which you do not see that new york can be made the inexpensive exile of its own children as it has been made the summer home of those sympathetic southerners if i can establish the fact of its potential cheapness as i think i can i shall deprive them of some reasons for going abroad though im not sure they will thank me when the reasons for europe are growing fewer and fewer culture can now be acquired almost as advantageously here as there except for the monuments in which we include all ancient and modern masterpieces in the several arts we have no excuse for going to europe and even in these masterpieces europe is coming to us so increasingly in every manner of reproduction that we allege the monuments almost in vain the very ruins of the past are now so accurately copied in various sorts of portable plasticity that we may know them here with nearly the same emotion as on their own ground the education of their daughters which once availed with mothers willing to sacrifice themselves and their husbands to the common good no longer avails the daughters know the far better time they will have at home and refuse to go as far as daughters may and in our civilization this you know is very far but it was always held a prime reason and convincing argument that dresden berlin paris rome and even london were so much cheaper than new york that it was a waste of money to stay at home  well wasnt it we impatiently demanded  i will not say for i neednt as yet there were always at the same time philosophers who contended that if we lived in those capitals as we lived at home they would be dearer than new york but what is really relevant is the question whether new york isnt cheaper now  we thought it had got past a question with you we thought you began by saying that new york is cheaper  i cant believe i was so crude the howadji returned with a fine annoyance that is the conclusion you have characteristically jumped to without looking before you leap i was going to approach the fact much more delicately and i dont know but what by your haste you have shattered my ideal of the conditions but ill own that the great stumblingblock to my belief that the means of living in new york are cheaper than in the european capitals is that the house rents here are so incomparably higher than they are there but i must distinguish and say that i mean flatrents for oddly enough flats are much dearer than houses you can get a very pretty little house in a fair quarter with plenty of light and a good deal of sun for twothirds and sometimes onehalf what you must pay for a flat with the same number of rooms mostly dark or dim and almost never sunny of course a house is more expensive and more difficult to run but even with the cost of the greater service and of the furnace heat the rent does not reach that of a far less wholesome and commodious flat there is one thing to be said in favor of a flat however and that is the women are in favor of it the feminine instinct is averse to stairs the sex likes to be safely housed against burglars and when it must be left alone it desires the security of neighbors however strange the neighbors may be it likes the authority of a janitor the society of an elevatorboy it hates a lower door an area an ashbarrel and a back yard but if it were willing to confront all these inconveniences it is intimately it is osseously convinced that a house is not cheaper than a flat as a matter of fact neither a house nor a flat is cheap enough in new york to bear me out in my theory that new york is no more expensive than those old world cities to aid efficiently in my support i must invoke the prices of provisions which i find by inquiry at several markets on the better avenues have reverted to the genial level of the earlier nineteenhundreds before the cattle combined with the trusts to send them up i wont prosily rehearse the quotations of beef mutton pork poultry and fish they can be had at any dealers on demand and they will be found less on the whole than in london less than in paris less even than in rome they are greater no doubt than the prices in our large western cities but they are twenty per cent less than the prices in boston and in the new england towns which hang upon bostons favor for their marketing i do not know how or why it is that while we wicked newyorkers pay twentyfive cents for our beefsteak these righteous bostonians should have to pay thirty for the same cut and quality here i give twentyeight a pound for my java coffee in the summer i live near an otherwise delightful new hampshire town where i must give thirtyeight it is strange that the siftings of three kingdoms as the rev mr higginson called his fellowpuritans should have come in their greatgrandchildren to a harder fate in this than the bran and shorts and middlings of such harvestings as the fields of ireland and italy of holland and hungary of poland and transylvania and muscovy afford perhaps it is because those siftings have run to such a low percentage of the whole new england population that they must suffer along with the refuse of the millsthe mills of the godsabounding in our city and its dependencies  i dont know how much our housekeepers note the fall of the prices in their monthly bills but in browsing about for my meals as i rather like to do i distinctly see it in the restaurant rates i dont mean the restaurants to which the rich or reckless resort but those modester places which consult the means of the careful middle class to which i belong as you know i live ostensibly at the hotel universe i have a room there and that is my address  we know we derisively murmured so few of our visitors can afford it  i cant afford it myself our friend said but i save a little by breakfasting there and lunching and dining elsewhere or i did till the eggs got so bad that i had to go out for my breakfast too now i get perfect eggs of the day before for half the price that the extortionate hens laying for the universe exact for their last weeks product at a very good broadway hotel which simple strangers from europe think first class i get a combination breakfast of fresh eggs fresh butter and fresh rolls with a pot of blameless souchong or ceylon tea for thirty cents if i plunge to the extent of a baked apple i pay thirtyfive do you remember what you last paid in paris or rome for coffee rolls and butter  a franc fifty we remembered  and in london for the same with eggs you paid one and six didnt you  very likely we assented  well then you begin to see there are several good restaurants quite near that good hotel where i get the same combination breakfast for the same price and if i go to one of those shining halls which you find in a score of places up and down broadway and the side streets i get it for twentyfive cents but though those shining halls glare at you with roofs and walls of stainless tile and glass and tables of polished marble their bill of fare is so inflexibly adjusted to the general demand that i cannot get souchong or ceylon tea for any money i can only get oolong otherwise i must take a cup of their excellent coffee if i wander from my wonted breakfast i can get almost anything in the old american range of dishes for five or ten cents a portion and the quality and quantity are both all i can ask as i have learned upon inquiry the great basal virtues of these places are good eggs and good butter i like to cut from the thick slice of butter under the perfect cube of ice better than to have my butter pawed into balls or cut into shavings as they serve your butter in europe but i prefer having a small table to myself with my hat and overcoat visàvis on the chair opposite as i have it at that good hotel in those shining halls i am elbowed by three others at my polished marble table but if there were more room i should never object to the company it is the good kind cleanly comely american average which is the best company in the world with a more than occasional fine head and faces delicately sculptured by thought and study i address myself fearlessly to the old and young of my own sex without ever a snub such as i might get from the selfrespectful maids or matrons who resort to the shining halls severally or collectively if i ventured upon the same freedom with them i must say that my commensals lunch or dine as wisely as i do for the most part but sometimes i have had to make my tacit criticisms and i am glad that i forbore one night with a friendly young man at my elbow who had just got his order of buttercakes  buttercakes we queried  that is what they call a rich round tumid product of the griddle which they serve very hot and open to close again upon a large lump of butter for two of those cakes and his coffee my unknown friend paid fifteen cents and made a supper after which i should not have needed to break my fast the next morning but he fearlessly consumed it and while he ate he confided that he was of a minor clerical employ in one of the great hotels near by and when i praised our shining hall and its guests he laughed and said he came regularly and he always saw people there who were registered at his hotel they found it good and they found it cheap i suppose you know that new york abounds in tables dhôte of a cheapness unapproached in the european capitals  we said we had heard so at the same time we tried to look as if we always dined somewhere in society but heaven knows whether we succeeded  the combination breakfast is a form of table dhôte and at a very attractive restaurant in a good place i have seen such a breakfastfruit cereal eggs rolls and coffeeoffered for fifteen cents i have never tried it not because i had not the courage but because i thought thirty cents cheap enough those who do not i should still hold worthy of esteem if they ate the fifteencent breakfast i have also seen placarded a business mens lunch for fifteen cents which also i have not tried i am not a business man i make bold to say however that i often go for my lunch or my dinner to a certain italian place on a good avenue which i will not locate more definitely lest you should think me a partner of the enterprise for fifty and sixty cents vino compreso the material is excellent and the treatment is artistic the company of a simple and selfrespectful domesticity which i think it an honor to be part of fathers and mothers of families aunts cousins uncles grandparents i do not deny a merry widow hat here and there but the face under it though often fair and young is not a merry widow face those people all look as kind and harmless as the circle which i used to frequent farther downtown at a fiftycent french table dhôte but with a bouillabaisse added which i should not but for my actual experiences have expected to buy for any money but there are plenty of italian and french tables dhôte for the same price all over town if you venture outside of the latin race you pay dearer and you fare worse unless you go to those shining halls which i have been praising if you go to a german place you get grosser dishes and uncouth manners for more money i do not know why that amiable race should be so dear and rude in its feedingplaces but that is my experience  you wander you wander we exclaimed why should we care for your impressions of german cooking and waiting unless they go to prove or disprove that living in new york is cheaper than in the european capitals  perhaps i was going to say that even those germans are not so dear as they are in the fatherland though rude they do not tend much if at all to tables dhôte but the italians and the french who do serve you a better meal for a lower price than you would get in paris or rome or naples there the prevalent ideal is five francs with neither wine nor coffee included ill allow that the cheap table dhôte is mainly the affair of single men and women and does not merit the consideration ive given it if it helps a young couple to do with one maid or with none instead of two it makes for cheapness of living service is costly and it is greedy and except in large households its diet is the same as the familys so that anything which reduces it is a great saving but the table dhôte which is cheap for one or two is not cheap for more and it is not available if there are children housing and rawprovisioning and serving are the main questions and in europe the first and last are apparently much less expensive marketing is undoubtedly cheaper with us and if you count in what you get with the newness the wholesomeness and handiness of an american flat the rent is not so much greater than that of a european flat with its elementary bareness you could not here unless you descended from the apartment to the tenement hire any quarter where you would not be supplied with hot and cold water with steam heating with a bathroom and all the rest of it  but we said you are showing that we are more comfortably housed than the europeans when you should be treating the fact of relative cheapness  i was coming to that even in the matter of housing  it is too late to come to it in this paper you have now talked three thousand words and that is the limit you must be silent for at least another month  but if i have something important to say at this juncture if i may not care to recur to the subject a month hence if i may have returned to europe by that time  then you can the better verify your statistics but the rule in this place is inflexible three thousand words neither more nor less the wisdom of solomon would be bluepencilled if it ran to more     xi  ways and means of living in new york   the howadji or the hajii us people called his sort in the days of home as found was prompt to the hour when his months absence was up and he began without a moments delay but of course the lion in the way of my thesis that new york is comparatively cheap is the rent the rent of flats or houses in the parts of the town where people of gentle tastes and feelings are willing to live provisions are cheap furnishings of all kinds are cheap service especially when you mainly or wholly dispense with it is cheap for one maid here will do the work of two abroad and if the mistress of the house does her own work she can make the modern appliances her handmaids at no cost whatever it is ridiculous in fact leaving all those beautiful and ingenious helps in housework to the hirelings who work only twice as hard with them for more wages than the hirelings of countries where they dont exist  dont be so breathless we interposed you will only be allowed to talk three thousand words whether you talk fast or slow and you might as well take your ease  that is true the howadji reflected but i am full of my subject and i have the feeling that i am getting more out even if i cant get more in by talking fast the rent question itself he hurried on has been satisfactorily solved of late in the new invention of cooperative housing which you may have heard of  we owned that we had with the light indifference of one whom matters of more money or less did not concern and our friend went on  the plan was invented you know by a group of artists who imagined putting up a large composite dwelling in a street where the cost of land was not absolutely throatcutting and finishing it with tasteful plainness in painted pine and the like but equipping it with every modern convenience in the interest of easier housekeeping the characteristic and imperative fact of each apartment was a vast and lofty studio whose height was elsewhere divided into two floors and so gave abundant livingrooms in little space the proprietorial group may have been ten say but the number of apartments was twice as many and the basic hope was to let the ten other apartments for rents which would carry the expense of the whole and house the owners at little or no cost the curious fact is that this apparently too simplehearted plan worked the philistines as the outsiders may be called liked being near the selfchosen people they liked the large lifegiving studio which imparted light and air to the two floors of its rearward division and they eagerly paid the sustaining rents the fortunate experience of one æsthetic group moved others to like enterprises and now there are eight or ten of these cooperative studio apartmenthouses in different parts of the town  with the same fortunate experience for the owners we queried with suppressed sarcasm  not exactly our friend assented to our intention the successive groups have constantly sought more central more desirable more fashionable situations they have built not better than they knew for that could not be but costlier and they have finished in hard woods with marble halls and marbleized hallboys and the first expense has been much greater but actual disaster has not yet followed perhaps it is too soon we must not be impatient but what has already happened is what happens with other beautiful things that the æsthetic invent it has happened notoriously with all the most lovable and livable summer places which the artists and authors find out and settle themselves cheaply and tastefully in the philistines a people wholly without invention a cuckoo tribe incapable of selfnesting stumble upon those joyous homes by chance or by mistaken invitation they submit meekly enough at first to be subneighbors ruled in all things by the genius of the place but once in they begin to lay their golden eggs in some humble cottage and then they hatch out broods of palatial villas equipped with men and maid servants horses carriages motors yachts and if the original settlers remain it is in a helpless inferiority a broken spirit and an overridden ideal this tragical history is the same at magnolia and at york harbor and at dublin and at bar harbor even at newport itself the cooperative housing of new york is making a like history it is true that the philistines do not come in and dispossess the autochthonic groups these will not sell to them but they have imagined doing on a sophisticated and expensive scale what the æsthetics have done simply and cheaply they are buying the pleasanter sites and are building cooperatively though they have already eliminated the studio and the central principle and they build for the sole occupancy of the owners but the cost of their housing then is such that it puts them out of the range of our inquiry as their riches has already put them beyond the range of our sympathy it still remains for any impecunious group to buy the cheaper lots and build simpler houses on the old studio principle with rents enough to pay the cost of operation and leave the owners merely the interest and taxes with the eventual payment of these also by the tenants some of the studio apartments are equipped with restaurants and the dwellers need only do such light housekeeping as ladies may attempt without disgrace or too much fatigue  or distraction from their duties to society we suggested  it depends upon what you mean by society its a very general and inexact term if you mean formal dinners dances parties receptions and all that the lightest housekeeping would distract from the duties to it but if you mean congenial friends willing to come in for tea in the afternoon or to a simple lunch or not impossibly a dinner light housekeeping is not incompatible with a conscientious recognition of societys claims i think of two ladies sisters one younger and one older than the other who keep house not lightly but in its full weight of all the meals for their father and brother and yet are most gracefully and most acceptably in the sort of society which jane austen says is if not good the best the society of gifted cultivated travelled experienced highprincipled people capable of respecting themselves and respecting their qualities wherever they find them in others these ladies do not pretend to entertain but their table is such that they are never afraid to ask a friend to it in a moment if there is not enough or not good enough one of them conjures something attractive out of the kitchen and you sit down to a banquet the sisters are both of that gentle class of semiinvalids whose presence in our civilization enables us to support the rudeness of the general health they employ æsthetically the beautiful alleviations with which science has rescued domestic drudgery from so much of the primal curse it is a pleasure to see them work it is made so graceful so charming that you can hardly forbear taking hold yourself  but you do forbear we interposed and do you imagine that their example is going to prevail with the great average of impecunious american housewives or sisters or daughters  no they will continue to keep a girl whom they will enslave to the performance of duties which they would be so much better for doing themselves both in body and mind for that doing would develop in them the hospitable soul of those two dear ladies they will be in terror of the casual guest knowing well that they cannot set before him things fit to eat they have no genius for housekeeping which is one with homemaking they do not love it and those ladies do love it in every detail so that their simple flat shines throughout with a lustre which pervades the kitchen and the parlor and the chamber alike it is the onegirl household or the twogirl which makes living costly because it makes living wasteful it is not the luxurious establishments of the rich which are to blame for our banishment to the mythical cheapness of europe  we were not convinced by the eloquence which had overheated our friend and we objected but those ladies you speak of give their whole lives to housekeeping and ought cheapness to be achieved at such an expense  in the first place they dont and if they do what do the onegirl or the twogirl housekeepers give their lives to or for the matter of that the ten or twenty girl housekeepers the ladies of whom i speak have always read the latest book worth reading they have seen the picture which people worth while are talking of they know through that best society which likes a cup of their tea all the æsthetic gossip of the day they are part of the intellectual movement that part which neither the arts nor the letters can afford to ignore they help to make up the polite public whose opinions are the court of final appeal  they strike us we said stubbornly as rather romantic  ah there you are well they are romanticromantic like a gentle poem like an idyllic tale but i deny that they are romanticistic their whole lives deal with realities the everyotherday as well as the everyday realities but the lives of those others who make all life costly by refusing their share of its work dwell in a web of threadbare fictions which never had any color of truth in this country they are trying to imitate poor imitations to copy those vulgar copies of the european ideal which form the societypages contribution to the history of our contemporary civilization  we were so far moved as to say we think we see what you mean and our friend went on  speaking of civilization do you know what a genial change the tearoom is working in our morals and manners there are many interesting phases of its progress among us and not the least interesting of these is its being so largely the enterprise of ladies who must not only save money but must earn money in order to live not cheaply but at all their fearlessness in going to work has often the charm of a patrician past for many of them are southern women who have come to new york to repair their broken fortunes the tearoom has offered itself as a graceful means to this end and they have accepted its conditions which are mainly the more delicate kinds of cookery with those personal and racial touches in which southern women are so expert but there are tearooms managed by western women if i may judge from the accents involuntarily overheard in their talk at the telephone the tea of the tearoom means lunch too and in some places breakfast and dinner or rather supper on much the plan of the several womens exchanges but these are mostly of new england inspiration and operation and their cooking has a northern quality they as well as the tearooms leave something to be desired in cheapness though they might be dearer in some you get tea for fifteen cents in others a no better brew for twentyfive but they are all charmingly peaceful and when at the noon hour they overflow with conversation still there is a prevailing sense of quiet finely qualified by the feminine invention and influence mere men are allowed to frequent these places not only under the protection of women but also quite unchaperoned and when one sees them gently sipping their souchong or oolong and respectfully munching their toasted muffins or their chickenpie one remembers with tender gratitude how recently they would have stood crooking their elbows at deleterious bars and visiting the bowls of cheese and shredded fish and crackers to which their drink freed them while it enslaved them to the witchery of those lurid ladies contributed by art to the evil attractions of such places you see nowhere else ladies depicted with so little on except in the paris salon the new york tearooms are not yet nearly so frequent as in london but i think they are on the average cosier and on the whole i cannot say that they are dearer they really cheapen the midday meal to many who would otherwise make it at hotels and restaurants and so far as they contribute to the spread of the afternoontea habit they actually lessen the cost of living many guests can now be fobbed off with tea who must once have been asked to lunch  but we suggested isnt that cheapness at the cost of shabbiness which no one can really afford  no i dont think so whatever lightens hospitality of its cumbrousness makes for civilization which is really more compatible with a refined frugality than with an unbridled luxury if every àlacarte restaurant in the hotels and out of them could be replaced by tearooms and for the elaborate lunches and dinners of private life the informality and simplicity of the afternoon tea were substituted we should all be healthier wealthier and wiser and i should not be obliged to protract this contention for the superior cheapness of new york  but wait we said there is something just occurs to us if you proved new york the cheapest great city in the world wouldnt it tend to increase our population even beyond the present figure which you once found so deplorable  no i imagine not or rather it would add to our population only those who desire to save instead of those who desire to waste we should increase through the newcomers in virtuous economy and not as now in spendthrift vainglory in the end the effect would be the same for civilization as if we shrank to the size of boston  you will have to explain a little howadji we said if you expect us to understand your very interesting position  why you know he answered with easy superiority that now our great influx is of opulent strangers who have made a good deal of money and of destitute strangers willing to help them live on it the last we neednt take account of they are common to all cities in all ages but the first are as new as any phenomenon can be in a world of such tiresome tautologies as ours they come up from our industrial provinces eager to squander their wealth in the commercial metropolis they throw down their purses as the heroes of old threw down their gantlets for a gage of battle and they challenge the local champions of extortion to take them up it is said that they do not want a seasonable or a beautiful thing they want a costly thing if for instance they are offered a house or an apartment at a rental of ten or fifteen thousand they will not have it they require a rental of fifteen or twenty thousand so that it may be known back home that they are spending that much for rent in new york and the provincial imagination taxed to proportion the cost of their living otherwise to such a sum you may say that it is rather splendid but you cannot deny that it is also stupid  stupid no but barbaric yes we formulated the case it is splendid as barbaric pearls and gold are splendid  but you must allow that nothing could be more mischievous when next we go with our modest incomes against these landlords they suppose that we too want rentals of fifteen thousand whereas we would easily be satisfied with one of fifteen hundred or a thousand the poor fellows fancy is crazed by those prodigals and we must all suffer for their madness the extravagance of the newcomers does not affect the price of provisions so much or of clothes the whole population demands food and raiment within the general means however much it must exceed its means in the cost of shelter the spendthrifts cannot set the pace for such expenditures no matter how much they lavish on their backs and  forbear we cried turning from the danger we have saved you from you will say we suppose that new york would be the cheapest of the great cities if it were not for the cost of shelter  something like that he assented  but as we understand that difficulty is to be solved by cooperative or composite housing  something like that he said again but there was a note of misgiving in his voice  what is the out we asked  there is no out he said with a deep evasive sigh     xii  the quality of boston and the quantity of new york   later in the summer or earlier in the fall than when we saw him newly returned from europe that friend whom the veteran reader will recall as having so brashly offered his impressions of the national complexion and temperament looked in again on the easy chair  well we said do you wish to qualify to hedge to retract people usually do after they have been at home as long as you  but i do not he said he took his former seat but now laid on the heap of rejected mss not the silken cylinder he had so daintily poised there before but a gray fedora that fell carelessly over in lazy curves and hollows i wish to modify by adding the effect of further observation and adjusting it to my first conclusions since i saw you i have been back to boston in fact i have just come from there  we murmured some banality about not knowing a place where one could better come from than boston but he brushed it by without notice  to begin with i wish to add that i was quite wrong in finding the typical boston face now prevalently celtic  you call that adding we satirized  he ignored the poor sneer  my earlier observation was correct enough but it was a result of that custom which peoples the hills the shores and the sister continent in summer with the newenglanders of the past and leaves their capital to those newenglanders of the future dominantly represented by the irish at the time of my second visit the exiles had returned and there were the faces again that instead of simply forbidding me arraigned me and held me guilty till i had proved myself innocent  do you think we suggested that you would find this sort of indictment in them if you had a better conscience  perhaps not and i must own i did not find them so accusing when i could study them in their contemplation of some more important subject than myself one such occasion for philosophizing them distinctly offered itself to my chance witness when an event of the last seriousness had called some hundreds of them together one sees strong faces elsewhere i have seen them assembled especially in england but i have never seen such faces as those boston faces so intense so full of a manly dignity a subdued yet potent personality a consciousness as far as could be from selfconsciousness i found something finely visionary in it all as if i were looking on a piece of multiple portraiture such as you see in those dutch paintings of companies at amsterdam for instance it expressed purity of race continuity of tradition fidelity to ideals such as no other group of faces would now express you might have had the like at rome at athens at florence at amsterdam in their prime possibly in the england of the resurgent parliament though there it would have been mixed with a fanaticism absent in boston you felt that these men no doubt had their limitations but their limitations were lateral not vertical  then why we asked not very relevantly dont you go and live in boston  it wouldnt make me such a bostonian if i did i should want a halfdozen generations behind me for that besides i feel my shortcomings less in new york  you are difficult why not fling yourself into the tide of joy here instead of shivering on the brink in the blast of that east wind which you do not even find regenerative why not forget our inferiority since you cannot forgive it or do you think that by being continually reminded of it we can become as those bostonians are can we reduce ourselves by repenting from four millions to less than one and by narrowing our phylacteries achieve the unlimited bostonian verticality and go as deep and as high  no our friend said good as they are we can only be better by being different we have our own message to the future which we must deliver as soon as we understand it  is it in esperanto  it is at least polyglot but you are taking me too seriously i wished merely to qualify my midsummer impressions of a prevailing celtic boston by my autumnal impressions of a persisting puritanic boston but it is wonderful how that strongly persistent past still characterizes the present in every development even those irish faces which i wouldnt have ventured a joke with were no doubt sobered by it and when the italians shall come forward to replace them it will be with no laughing pulcinello masks but visages as severe as those that first challenged the wilderness of massachusetts bay and made the three hills tremble to their foundations  it seems to us that you are yielding to rhetoric a little arent you we suggested  perhaps i am but you see what i mean and i should like to explain further that i believe the celtic present and the pelasgic future will rule boston in their turn as the puritanic past learned so admirably to rule it by the mild might of irony by the beneficent power which in the man who sees the joke of himself enables him to enter brotherly into the great human joke and be friends with every good and kind thing  could you be a little more explicit  i would rather not for the moment but i should like to make you observe that the boston to be has more to hope and less to fear from the newer americans than this metropolis where these are so much more heterogeneous here salvation must be of the jews among the swarming natives of the east side but in boston there is no reason why the artistic instincts of the celtic and pelasgic successors of the puritans should not unite in that effect of beauty which is an effect of truth and keep boston the first of our cities in good looks as well as good works with us here in new york a civic job has the chance of turning out a city joy but it is a fighting chance in boston there is little doubt of such a job turning out a joy the municipality of boston has had almost the felicity of goldsmithit has touched nothing which it has not adorned wherever its hand has been laid upon nature nature has purred in responsive beauty they used to talk about the made land in boston but half boston is the work of man and it shows what the universe might have been if the bostonians had been taken into the confidence of the creator at the beginning the back bay was only the suggestion of what has since been done and i never go to boston without some new cause for wonder there is no other such charming union of pleasaunce and residence as the fenways the system of parks is a garden of delight and now the state has taken up the work no doubt at the citys suggestion and turning from the land to the water has laid a restraining touch on the tides of the sea which ever since the moon entered on their management have flowed and ebbed through the channel of the charles the state has dammed the river the brine of the ocean no longer enters it but it feeds itself full of sweet water from the springs in the deep bosom of the country the beacon street houses back upon a steadfast expanse as fresh as the constant floods of the great lakes  illustration charles embankment below harvard bridge  and we dare say that it looks as large as lake superior to boston eyes what do they call their dam the charlesea  you may be sure they will call it something tasteful and fit our friend responded in rejection of our feeble mockery charlesea would not be bad but what i wish to make you observe is that all which has yet been done for beauty in boston has been done from the unexhausted instinct of it in the cold heart of puritanism where it burns frore and does the effect of fire as yet the celtic and pelasgic agencies have had no part in advancing the city the first have been content with voting themselves into office and the last with owning their masters outofdoors for the irish are the lords and the italians are the landlords but when these two gifted races with their divinely implanted sense of art shall join forces with the deeply conscienced taste of the puritans what maynt we expect boston to be  and what maynt we expect new york to be on the same terms or say when the celtic and pelasgic and hebraic and slavic elements join with the old batavians in whom the love of the artistic is by right also native come why shouldnt we have a larger boston here  because we are too large our friend retorted undauntedly when graft subtly crept among the nobler motives which created the park system of boston the city could turn for help to the state and get it but could our city get help from our state our city is too big to profit by that help our state too small to render it the commonwealth of massachusetts is creating a new garden of eden on the banks of the charlesea but what is the state of new york doing to emparadise the shores of the hudson  all the better for us perhaps we stubbornly but not very sincerely contended if we have to do our good works ourselves  yes if we do them but shall they remain undone if we dont do them the city of new york is so great that it swings the state of new york the virtues that are in each do not complement one another as the virtues of boston and massachusetts do where shall you find in our house or in our grounds the city and the state joining to an effect of beauty when you come to new york what you see of grandeur is the work of commercialism what you see of grandeur in boston is the work of civic patriotism we hire the arts to build and decorate the homes of business the bostonians inspire them to devote beauty and dignity to the public pleasure and use no our friend concluded with irritating triumph we are too vast too many for the finest work of the civic spirit athens could be beautifulflorence venice genoa werebut rome which hired or enslaved genius to create beautiful palaces temples columns statues could only be immense she could only huddle the lines of greek loveliness into a hideous agglomeration and lose their effect as utterly as if one should multiply greek noses and greek chins greek lips and greek eyes greek brows and greek heads of violet hair in one monstrous visage no he exulted in this mortifying image of our future ugliness when a city passes a certain limit of space and population she adorns herself in vain london the most lovable of the mighty mothers of men has not the charm of paris which if one cannot quite speak of her virgin allure has yet a youth and grace which lend themselves to the fondness of the arts boston is fast becoming of the size of paris but if i have not misread her future she will be careful not to pass it and become as new york is  we were so alarmed by this reasoning that we asked in considerable dismay but what shall we do we could not help growing perhaps we wished to overgrow but is there no such thing as ungrowing when the fair when the sex which we instinctively attribute to cities finds itself too large in its actuality for a directoire ideal there are means there are methods of reduction is there no remedy then for municipal excess of size is there no harmless potion or powder by which a city may lose a thousand inhabitants a day as the superabounding fair loses a pound of beauty is there nothing for new york analogous to rolling on the floor to the straightfront corset to the sugarless starchless diet come you must not deny us all hope how did boston manage to remain so small what elixirs what exercises did she take or use surely she did not do it all by reading and thinking our friend continued somewhat inexorably silent and we pursued do you think that by laying waste our long island suburbs by burning the whole affiliated jersey shore by strangling the bronx as it were in its cradle and by confining ourselves rigidly to our native isle of manhattan we could do something to regain our lost opportunity we should then have the outline of a fish true a nondescript fish but the fish was one of the greek ideals of the female form he was silent still and we gathered courage to press on as it is we are not altogether hideous we doubt whether there are not more beautiful buildings in new york now than there are in boston and as for statues where are the like there of our macmonnies hale of our saintgaudens farragut and sherman of our ward indian hunter  the shaw monument blots them all out our friend relentlessly answered but these are merely details our civic good things are accidental bostons are intentional that is the great the vital difference  it did not occur to us that he was wrong he had so crushed us under foot but with the trodden worms endeavor to turn we made a last appeal and with the skyscraper itself we still expect to do something something stupendously beautiful say that we have lost our skyline what shall we not have of grandeur of titanic loveliness when we have got a skyscraperline  it seemed to us that here was a point which he could not meet and in fact he could only say whether in irony or not i would rather not think  we were silent and upon the reflection to which our silence invited us we found that we would rather not ourselves think of the image we had invoked we preferred to take up the question at another point  well we said in your impressions of bostonian greatness we suppose that you received the effect of her continued supremacy in authors as well as authorship in artists as well as art you did not meet emerson or longfellow or lowell or prescott or holmes or hawthorne or whittier about her streets but surely you met their peers alive and in the flesh  no our friend admitted not at every corner but what i did meet was the effect of those high souls having abode there while on the earth the great boston authors are dead and the great boston artists are worsethey have come to new york they have not even waited to die but whether they have died or whether they have come to new york they have left their inspiration in boston in one sense the place that has known them shall know them no more forever but in another sense it has never ceased to know them i cant say how it is exactly but though you dont see them in boston you feel them but here in new yorkour dear immense slattern motherwho feels anything of the character of her great children who remembers in these streets bryant or poe or hallock or curtis or stoddard or stedman or the other poets who once dwelt in them who remembers even such great editors as greeley or james gordon bennett or godkin or dana what malignant magic what black art is it that reduces us all to one level of forgottenness when we are gone and even before we are gone have those high souls left their inspiration here for common men to breathe the breath of finer and nobler life from i wont abuse the millionaires who are now our only great figures even the millionaires are gone when they go they die and they leave no sign quite as if they were so many painters and poets you can recall some of their names but not easily no if new york has any hold upon the present from the past it isnt in the mystical persistence of such spirits among us  well we retorted hardily we have no need of them it is the high souls of the future which influence us  our friend looked at us as if he thought there might be something in what we said will you explain he asked  some other time we consented     xiii  the whirl of life in our first circles   one of those recurrent selves who frequent the habitat of the easy chair with every effect of exterior identities looked in and said before he sat down and much before he was asked to sit down are you one of those critics of smart or swell society or whatever its called now who despise it because they cant get into it or one of those censors who wont go into it because they despise it  your question we replied seems to be rather offensive but we dont know that its voluntarily so and its certainly interesting on your part will you say what has prompted you just at the moment to accost us with this inquiry before he could answer we hastened to add bytheway what a fine oldfashioned gentlemanly word accost is people used to accost one another a great deal in polite literature seeing her embarrassment from his abrupt and vigorous stare he thus accosted her or embarrassed by his fixed and penetrating regard she timidly accosted him it seems to us that we remember a great many passages like these why has the word gone out it was admirably fitted for such junctures and it was so polished by use that it slipped from the pen without any effort of the brain and  i have no time for idle discussions of a mere literary nature our other self returned i am very full of the subject which i have sprung upon you and which i see you are trying to shirk  not at all we smilingly retorted we will answer you according to your folly without the least reluctance we are not in smart or swell society because we cannot get in but at the same time we would not get in if we could because we despise it too much we wonder we continued speculatively why we always suspect the society satirist of suffering from a social snub it doesnt in the least follow was pope when he invited his sin john to                       leave all meaner things    to low ambition and the pride of kings  goaded to magnanimity by a slight from royalty was mr benson when he came over here from london excluded from the shining first circles of new york and newport which are apparently reflected with such brilliant fidelity in the relentless city and was he wreaking an unworthy resentment in portraying our richly moneyed blueblooded society to the life how are manners ever to be corrected with a smile if the smile is always suspected of being an agonized grin the contortion of the features by the throes of a mortified spirit was george william curtis in his amusing but unsparing potiphar papers  ah now you are shouting our other self exclaimed  your slang is rather antiquated we returned with grave severity but just what do you mean by it in this instance  i mean that manners are never corrected with a smile whether of compassion or of derision the manners that are bad that are silly that are vulgar that are vicious go on unchastened from generation to generation even the good manners dont seem to decay simplicity sincerity kindness dont really go out any more than the other things and fortunately the other things are confined only to a small group in every civilization to the black sheep of the great whitybrown or goldenfleeced human family  what has all this vague optimism to do with the potiphar papers and smart society and george william curtis we brought the intruder sharply to book  a great deal especially the part relating to the continuity of bad manners ive just been reading an extremely clever little book by a new writer called new york society on parade which so far as its basal facts are concerned might have been written by the writer of our best society and the other potiphar papers the temperament varies from book to book mr ralph pulitzer has a neater and lighter touch than george william curtis his book is more compact more directly and distinctly a study and it is less alloyed with the hopes of society reform which could be more reasonably indulged fiftysix years ago do you remember when our best society came out in the eldest putnams magazine that phoenix of monthlies which has since twice risen from its ashes dont pretend that our common memory doesnt run back to the year 1853 we have so many things in common that i cant let you disgrace the firm by any such vain assumption of extreme youth  why should we assume it the easy chair had then been three years firmly on its legs or its rockers and the succession of great spirits now disembodied whom its ease invited were all more or less in mature flesh we remember that paper on our best society vividly and we recall the shock that its facts concerning the upper ten thousand of new york imparted to the innocent or at least the virtuous lower twenty millions inhabiting the rest of the united states do you mean to say that the four hundred of this day are no better than the ten thousand of that has nothing been gained for quality by that prodigious reduction in quantity  on the contrary the folly the vanity the meanness the heartlessness the vulgarity have only been condensed and concentrated if we are to believe mr pulitzer and i dont see why we should doubt him did you say you hadnt seen his very shapely little study it takes with all the unpitying sincerity of a kodak the likeness of our best society in its three most characteristic aspects fullface at dinner threequartersface at the opera and profile at a ball where proud beauty hides its face on the shoulder of haughty commercial or financial youth and moneyed age dips its nose in whatever symbolizes the gascon wine in the paternal library mr pulitzer makes no attempt at dramatizing his persons there is no ambitious mrs potiphar with a longing for fashionable new york worlds to conquer yet with a secret heartache for the love of her country girlhood no good kind sordid potiphar bewildered and bedevilled by the surroundings she creates for him no soft rev cream cheese tenderly respectful of mammon while ritually serving god no factitious ottoman of a kurz pasha laughingly yet sadly observant of us playing at the forms of european society those devices of the satirist belonged to the sentimentalist mood of the thackerayan epoch but it is astonishing how exactly history repeats itself in the facts of the ball in 1910 from the ball of 1852 the motives the personnel almost the matériel the incidents are the same i should think it would amuse mr pulitzer imitating nature from his actual observation to find how essentially his study is the same with that of curtis imitating nature fiftyseven years ago there is more of nature in bulk not in variety to be imitated now but as mr pulitzer studies it in the glass of fashion her mean foolish selfish face is the same he would find in the sketches of the midvictorian satirist all sorts of tender relentings and generous hopes concerning the gay new york of that time which the early edwardian satirist cannot indulge concerning the gay new york of this time it seems as if we had really gone from bad to worse not qualitativelywe couldntbut quantitatively there is more money there are more men more women but otherwise our proud world is the proud world of 1853  you keep saying the same thing with damnable iterance we remarked dont you suppose that outside of new york there is now a vast society as there was then which enjoys itself sweetly kindly harmlessly is there no gentle chicago or kind st louis no pastoral pittsburg no sequestered cincinnati no bucolic boston no friendly philadelphia where the heart that is humble may look for disinterested pleasure in the highsociety functions of the day or night does new york set the pace for all these places and are dinners given there as here not for the delight of the guests but as the dire duty of the hostesses do the inhabitants of those simple sojourns go to the opera to be seen and not to hear do they follow on to balls before the piece is done only to bear the fardels of ignominy heaped upon them by the germans leaders or to see their elders and fatters getting all the beautiful and costly favors while their own young and gracile loveliness is passed slighted by because they give no balls where those cruel captains can hope to shine in the van it seems to us that in our own far primenow wellnigh lost in the mists of antiquitylife was ordered kindlier that dinners and operaparties and dances were given     to bless and never to ban  very likely on the low society level on which our joint life moved our other self replied with his unsparing candor you know we were a country village cityofthesecondclass personality even in the distant epoch painted in the potiphar papers the motives of new york society were the same as now it was not the place where birth and rank and fame relaxed or sported as in europe or where ardent innocence played and feasted as in the incorrupt towns of our interior if curtis once represented it rightly it was the same ridiculous hardworked greedy costly stupid thing which mr pulitzer again represents it  and yet we mused aloud this is the sort of thing which the unthinking multitude who criticise or at least review books are always lamenting that our fiction doesnt deal with why in its emptiness and heaviness its smartness and dulness it would be the death of our poor fiction  well i dont know our counterpart responded if our fiction took it on the human ground and ascertained its inner pathos its real lamentableness it might do a very good thing with those clubmen and society girls and grandes dames but that remains to be seen in the mean time it is very much to have such a study of society as mr pulitzer has given us for the most part it is satire with no pity in it but theres here and there a touch of compassion which moves the more because of its rarity when the author notes that here and there a pretty dear finds herself left with no one to take her out to supper at the ball his few words wring the heart these poor victims of their sex cannot like the men form tables of their own all that each can do is to disappear as swiftly and as secretly as possible hurrying home in humiliation for the present and despair for the future  do such cruel things really happen in our best society we palpitated in an anguish of sympathy  such things and worse our other self responded as when in the german the fair débutante sees the leader advancing toward her with a splendid and costly favor only to have him veer abruptly off to bestow it on some fat elderling who is going to give the next ball but mr pulitzer though he has these spare intimations of pity has none of the sentiment which there is rather a swash of in the potiphar papers its the difference between the midvictorian and the early edwardian point of view both satirists are disillusioned but in the page of curtis there is     the tender grace of a day that is dead  and the soft suffusion of hope for better things while in the page of mr pulitzer there is no such qualification of the disillusion both are enamoured of the beauty of those daughters of mammon and of the distinction of our ironclad youth the athletic wellgroomed welltailored worldlings who hurry uptown from their banks and brokers offices and lawyers offices to the dinners and operaboxes and dances of fashion the girls and women are of a higher average of beauty than any european ballroom could produce the men too are generally well built tall and handsome easily distinguishable from the waiters mr pulitzer assures us  well oughtnt that to console we defied our other self come its a great thing to be easily distinguishable from the waiters when the waiters are so often disappointed remittance men of good english family or the scions of continental nobility we mustnt ask everything  no and apparently the feeding is less gross than it was in curtiss less sophisticated time many of the men seem still to smoke and booze throughout the night with the host in his library but the dancing youth dont get drunk as some of them did at mrs potiphars supper and people dont throw things from their plates under the table  well why do you say then that there is no change for the better in our best society that there is no hope for it  did i say that if i did i will stick to it we must let our best society be as it now imagines itself i dont suppose that in all that gang of beautiful splendid wasteful expensively surfeited people there are more than two or three young men of intellectual prowess or spiritual distinction though there must be some clever and brilliant toadies of the artist variety in fact mr pulitzer says as much outright and it is the hard lot of some of the arts to have to tout for custom among the vulgar ranks of our best society  very well then we said with considerable resolution we must change the popular ideal of the best society we must have a four hundred made up of the most brilliant artists authors doctors professors scientists musicians actors and ministers with their wives daughters and sisters who will walk to one anothers dinners or at worst go by trolley and occupy the cheaper seats at the opera and dance in small and early assemblages and live in sevenroomwithbath flats money must not count at all in the choice of these elect and beautiful natures the question is how shall we get the dense unenlightened masses to regard them as the best society how teach the reporters to run after them and the press to chronicle their entertainments engagements marriages divorces voyages to and from europe and the other facts which now so dazzle the common fancy when it finds them recorded in the society intelligence of the newspapers  yes as general sherman said when he had once advocated the restriction of the suffrage and had been asked how he was going to get the consent of the majority whose votes he meant to take awayyes that is the devil of it  we were silent for a time and then we suggested dont you think that a beginning could be made by those real élite we have decided on refusing to let associate with what now calls itself our best society  but hasnt our soidisant best society already made that beginning for its betters by excluding them our other self responded  there is something in what you say we reluctantly assented but by no means everything the beginning you speak of has been made at the wrong end the true beginning of society reform must be made by the moral æsthetic and intellectual superiors of fashionable society as we now have it the grandes dames must be somehow persuaded that to be really swell really smart or whatever the last word for the thing is they must search whos who in new york for men and women of the most brilliant promise and performance and invite them they must not search the banks and brokers offices and lawyers offices for their dancingmen but the studios the editorialrooms the dramatic agencies the pulpits for the most gifted young artists assignment men interviewers actors and preachers and apply to the laborunions for the cleverest and handsomest artisans they must look up the most beautiful and intelligent girlstudents of all the arts and sciences and department stores for cultivated and attractive salesladies then when all such people have received cards to dinners or dances it will only remain for them to have previous engagements and the true beginning is made come you cant say the thing is impossible  not impossible no our complementary self replied but difficult     xiv  the magazine muse   two aging if not aged poets one much better if not much older than the other were talking of the muse as she was in their day and of the muse as she is in this at the end their common mind was that she was a far more facile muse formerly than she is now in other words as the elder and better poet put it they both decided that many many pieces of verse are written in these times and hidden away in the multitude of the magazines which in those times would have won general recognition if not reputation for the authors they would have been remembered from month to month and their verses copied into the newspapers from the two or three periodicals then published and if they were not enabled to retire upon their incomes they would have been in the enjoyment of a general attention beyond anything money can buy at the present day this conclusion was the handsomer in the two poets because they had nothing to gain and something to lose by it if their opinion should ever become known it was in a sort the confession of equality and perhaps even inferiority which people do not make unless they are obliged to it in any case but these poets were generous even beyond their unenvious tribe and the younger with a rashness which his years measurably excused set about verifying his conviction in a practical way perhaps the only practical way  he asked his publishers to get him all the american magazines published and has the homekeeping reader any notion of the vastness of the sea on which this poet had embarked in his daring exploration his publishers sent him a list of some eightytwo monthly periodicals in all kinds which when he had begged them to confine it to the literary kind the æsthetic kind only amounted to some fifty by far the greater number of these he found were published in new york but two were from philadelphia one from boston one from indianapolis and one even from chicago two were from the pacific slope generally that is to say in this city there are issued every month about fortyfive magazines devoted to belleslettres of varying degrees of excellence not always connoted by their varying prices most of them are of the tencent variety and are worth in most cases ten cents and in a few cases twentyfive or thirtyfive cents quite like those which ask such sums for themselves the cheapest are not offensive to the eye altogether as they lie closed on the dealers counter though when you open them you find them sometimes printed on paper of the woodpulp woodpulpy sort and very loathly to the touch others of the cheapest present their literature on paper apparently as good as that of the dearest and as it is not always money which buys literary value especially from the beginners in literature there seemed every reason for the poet to hope that there would be as good poetry in the one sort as in the other in his generous animation he hoped to find some good poetry on the woodpulp paper just as in the golden age he might have found it carved by amorous shepherds on the bark of trees  he promised himself a great and noble pleasure from his verification of the opinion he shared with that elder and better poet and if his delight must be mixed with a certain feeling of reserved superiority it could hardly be less a delight for that reason in turning critic the friendliest critic he could not meet these dear and fair young poets on their own level but he could at least keep from them and from himself as much as possible the fact that he was looking down on them all the magazines before him were for the month of january and though it was possible that they might have shown a certain exhaustion from their extraordinary efforts in their christmas numbers still there was a chance of the overflow of riches from those numbers which would trim the balance and give them at least the average poetic value at this point however it ought to be confessed that the poet or critic was never so willing a reader as writer of occasional verse and it cannot be denied that there was some girding up of the loins for him before the grapple with that halfhundred of magazines though he took them at their weakest point might they not be too much for him  he fetched a long breath and opened first that magazine clarum et venerabile nomen from which he might reasonably expect the greatest surprises of merit in the verse there were only two pieces and neither seemed to him of the oldtime quality but neither was such as he would himself have perhaps rejected if he had been editor then he plunged at the heap and in a fifteencent magazine of recent renown he found among five poems a good straight piece of realistic characterization which did much to cheer him in this a little piece of two stanzas the author had got at the heart of a good deal of america in another cheap magazine professing to be devoted wholly to stories he hoped for a breathingspace and was tasked by nothing less familiar than swifts versification of a wellknown maxim of la rouchefoucauld in a tencent magazine which is too easily the best of that sort he found two pieces of uncommon worth which opened the way so promisingly indeed for happier fortunes that he was not as much surprised as he might later have been in finding five poems all good in one of the four greater or at least dearer magazines one of these pieces was excellent landscape and another a capital nature piece if a third was somewhat strained it was also rather strong and a fourth had the quiet which it is hard to know from repose two poems in another of the highpriced magazines were noticeable one for sound poetic thinking and the other as very truthfully pathetic the two in a cheap magazine by two kentucky poets a song and a landscape were one genuinely a song and the other a charming communion with nature in a pair of periodicals devoted to outdoor life on the tamer or wilder scale there were three poems one celebrating the delights of a winter camp which he found simple true in feeling and informal in phrasing another full of the joy of a country ride very songy very blithe and original and a third a study of scenery which it realized to the minds eye with some straining in the wording but much felicity in the imagining a midwestern magazine had an excellent piece by a poet of noted name who failed to observe that his poem ended a stanza sooner than he did in a periodical devoted to short stories or abandoned to them there were two good pieces one of them delicately yet distinctly reproducing certain poetic aspects of new york and giving the sense of a fresh talent where the critic would hardly have looked for them in a magazine of professed fashion and avowed smartness he came upon three pieces one sweet and fine one wise and good one fresh and well turned a newer periodical rather going in for literary quality had one fine piece with a pretty surprise in it and another touched with imaginative observation  the researches of the critic carried him far into the night or at least hours beyond his bedtime and in the dreamy mood in which he finally pursued them he was more interested in certain psychological conditions of his own than in many of the verses together with a mounting aversion to the work he noted a growing strength for it he could dispatch a dozen poems in almost as many minutes and not slight them either but he no longer jumped to his work he was aware of trying to cheat himself in it of pretending that the brief space between titles in the table of contents which naturally implied a poem sometimes really indicated a short bit of prose he would run his eye hastily over an index and seek to miss rather than find the word poem repeated after a title and when this ruse succeeded he would go back to the poem he had skipped with the utmost unwillingness if his behavior was sinful he was duly punished for it in the case of a magazine which he took up well toward midnight rejoicing to come upon no visible sign of poetry in it but his glance fell to a grouping of titles in a smallprint paragraph at the bottom of the page and he perceived on close inspection that these were all poems and that there were eighteen of them  he calculated roughly that he had read from eightyfive to a hundred poems before he finished after a while he ceased to take accurate count as he went on but a subsequent review of the magazines showed that his guess was reasonably correct from this review it appeared that the greater number of the magazines published two poems in each month while several published but one and several five or seven or four another remarkable fact was that the one or two in the more selfdenying were as bad as the whole five or seven or nine or eighteen of those which had more freely indulged themselves in verse yet another singular feature of the inquiry was that one woman had a poem in five or six of the magazines and stranger yet always a good poem so that no editor would have been justified in refusing it there was a pretty frequent recurrence of names in the titlepages and mostly these names were a warrant of quality but not always of the authors best quality the authorship was rather equally divided between the sexes and the poets were both young and old or as old as poets ever can be  when the explorer had returned from the search which covered apparently a great stretch of time but really of space he took his notes and went with them to that elder friend of his whose generous enthusiasm had prompted his inquiry together they looked them over and discussed the points evolved then what is your conclusion the elder of the two demanded do you still think i was right or have you come to a different opinion  oh how should i safely confess that i am of a different opinion you would easily forgive me but what would all those hundred poets whom i thought not so promising as you believed do to my next book especially what would the poetesses  there is something in that but you need not be explicit if you differ with me you can generalize what on the whole was the impression you got had none of the pieces what we call distinction for want of a better word or a clearer idea  i understand no i should say not one though here and there one nearly had itso nearly that i held my breath from not being quite sure but on the other hand i should say that there was a good deal of excellence if you know what that means  i can imagine the elder poet said it is another subterfuge what do you really intend  why that the level was pretty high never so high as the sky but sometimes as high as the skyscraper there was an occasional tallness the effect i think of straining to be higher than the thought or the feeling warranted and some of the things had a great deal of naturalness  come that isnt so bad  but naturalness can be carried to a point where it becomes affectation this happened in some cases where i thought i was going to have some pleasure of the simplicity but found at last that the simplicity was a pose sometimes there was a great air of being untrammelled but there is such a thing as being informal and there is such a thing as being unmannerly  yes  i think that in the endeavor to escape from convention our poets have lost the wish for elegance which was a prime charm of the golden age technically as well as emotionally they let themselves loose too much and the people of the golden age never let themselves loose there is too much nature in them which is to say not enough for after all in her little æsthetic attempts nature is very modest  the elder poet brought the younger sharply to book now you are wandering explain again  why when you and i were youngyou were always and always will be young  none of that  it seemed to me that we wished to be as careful of the form as the most formal of our poetic forebears and that we would not let the smallest irregularity escape us in our study to make the form perfect we cut out the tall word we restrained the straining we tried to keep the wording within the bounds of the dictionary we wished for beauty in our work so much that our very roughness was the effect of hammering the grain we left was where we had used the file to produce it  was it and you say that with these new fellows it isnt so  well what do you say to such a word as dankening which occurred in a very good landscape  one such word in a hundred poems  one such word in a million would have been too many it made me feel that they would all have liked to say dankening or something of the sort and in the new poets on other occasions i have found faulty syntax bad rhymes limping feet the editors are to blame for that when it happens the editor who printed dankening was more to blame than the poet who wrote it and loved the other ugly word above all his other vocables the elder poet was silent and the other took fresh courage yes i say it you were wrong in your praise of the present magazine verse at the cost of that in our day when we were commencing poets the young or younger reputations were those of stedman of bayard taylor of the stoddards of aldrich of celia thaxter of rose terry of harriet prescott of bret harte of charles warren stoddard of the piatts of fitz james obrien of fitzhugh ludlow of a dozen more whom the best of the newest moderns cannot rival these were all delicate and devoted and indefatigable artists and lovers of form it cannot do the later generation any good to equal them with ours  there is something in what you say the elder poet was silent for a time then he asked out of the hundred poems you read in your fifty magazines how many did you say were what you would call good  his junior counted up and reported about twentyfour  well dont you call that pretty fair in a hundred i do reflect that these were all the magazines of one month and it is probable that there will be as many good poems in the magazines of every month in the year that will give us two hundred and eightyeight good poems during 1907 before the first decade of the new century is ended we shall have had eleven hundred and fiftytwo good magazine poems do you suppose that as many good magazine poems were written during the last four years of the first decade of the eighteenth century can you name as many yourself  certainly not nobody remembers the magazine poems of that time and nobody will remember the poems of the four years ending the present decade  do you mean to say that not one of them is worth remembering  the younger poet paused a moment then he said with the air of a crossexamined witness under advice of counsel i decline to answer     xv  comparative luxuries of travel   on a night well toward its noon many years ago a friend of the easy chair so close as to be at the same time its worst enemy was walking wearily up and down in the station at portland maine and wondering if the time for his train to start would ever come and if the time did come whether his train would really take advantage of that opportunity to leave portland it was of course a night train and of course he had engaged a lower berth in the sleepingcar there are certain things that come by nature with the comfortable classes to which the friend of the easy chair belonged he would no more have thought of travelling in one of the empty day coaches sidetracked in the station than he would have thought of going by stage as he could remember doing in his boyhood he stopped beside the cars and considered their potential passengers with amaze and compassion he laughed at the notion of his being himself one of them and when he turned his back on them he was arrested by the sight of an elderly pair looking from the vantage of the platform into the interior of a lighted pullman parlorcar which for reasons of its own was waiting in luminous detachment apart from the day coaches there was something engaging in the gentle humility of the elderly pair who peered into the long brilliant saloon with an effect not so much of ignorance as of inexperience they were apparently not so rustic as they were what another friend of the easy chair calls villaginous and they seemed not of the commonest uninformed villaginosity but of general intelligence such as comes of reading and thinking of many modern things which one has never seen as the eavesdropper presently made out from a colloquy unrestrained by consciousness of him they had never seen a parlorcar before except perhaps as it flashed by their meek little home depot with the rest of some express train that never stopped there  it is splendid john the woman said holding by the mans arm while she leaned forward to the window which she tiptoed to reach with her eager eyes  i guess its all of that the man consented sadly  i presume we shant ever go in one she suggested  not likely he owned in the same discouraged tone  they were both silent for a time then the woman said with a deep hopeless aspiration dear i wish i could see inside one once  the man said nothing and if he shared her bold ambition he made no sign  the eavesdropper faltered near their kind backs wishing for something more from them which should give their souls away but they remained silently standing there and he did not somehow feel authorized to make them reflect that if the car was lighted up it must be open and that the friendly porter somewhere within would not mind letting them look through it under his eye perhaps they did reflect and the woman was trying to embolden the man to the hardy venture in the end they did not attempt it but they turned away with another sigh from the woman which found its echo in the eavesdroppers heart doubtless if they had penetrated that splendid interior without having paid for seats it would in some fine mystical sort have pauperized them it would have corrupted them they would have wished after that always to travel in such cars when clearly they could not afford it very possibly it might have led to their moral if not financial ruin so he tried to still his bosoms ache but he could never quite forget that gentle pair with their unrequited longing and the other day they came almost the first thing into his mind when he read that a great german steamship company had some thoughts of putting on a train of pullman cars from the port of arrival to the mercantile metropolis which was the real end of their ships voyages he thought whimsically perversely how little difference it would make to that pair how little to those measureless most whose journeys shall end in heaven where pullman passengers or even passengers by the ordinary european firstclass cars may be only too glad to meet them he gave a looser rein to his thoughts and considered how very little the ordinary necessities of life such as pullman cars and taxicabs and electric radiators and nonstorage chickens and unsalted butter concern the great mass of the saints who would find them the rarest luxuries and could hardly be imagined coveting them and then from this wild revery he fell to asking himself whether a pullman train would be such a great advance or advantage over the oldfashioned european firstclass carriages in which he had been so long content to travel with the native nobility selfbrought to book on this point he had to own that he had once had moments of thinking in a german secondclass car that he would not change to an american pullman if he could for even less than a third more money he recalled a pleasant run from crewe to edinburgh in a thirdclass english car when he never once thought of a pullman car except to think it was no better to be sure this was after twothirds of his thirdclass fellowpassengers had got out and he was left to the sole enjoyment of twothirds of the seats it is the luxury of space which your more money buys you in england where no one much lower than a duke or a prime minister now goes first class for a long haul for short hauls it is different and on the continent it is altogether different there you are often uncomfortably crowded in the firstclass carriages and doubtless would be in a pullman if there were any so that if you are wise or only well informed you will give the guard a shilling to telegraph before leaving london and get you a number on the rapide from calais to paris  it is astonishing how quickly knowledge of any such advisable precaution spreads among even such arrogantly stupid people as firstclass passengers ordinarily are by the time a certain train had started for dover with that friend of the easy chairs already mentioned every soul in his firstclass compartment had telegraphed ahead and when they arrived in calais the earliest englishman who got past the customs ran ahead and filled the racks of the carriage with his handbaggage so that the latest frenchman was obliged to jump up and down and scream and perhaps swear in his strange tongue before he could find room for his valise and then calm down and show himself the sweetest and civilest of men and especially the obedient humble servant of the englishman who had now made a merit of making way for his bag  at this point the fable teaches that money will not buy everything in european travel though some americans imagine it will it will not for instance buy comfort or decency though it will secure privacy in a french sleeper between paris and marseilles either way for an augmentation of fortyfive francs or nine dollars on the price of a firstclass ticket it will buy you a berth in a small pen which you must share with another animal and be tossed hither and yon night long as in the berth of a bermuda steamer secondclass passengers in france or italy cannot buy a berth in a sleeper for any money and they may go hang or stand for all the international sleepingcar company cares and this suggests the question whether in our own free and equal land the passengers in the ordinary day coaches are ever invited by the first call or the last to share the hospitalities of our diningcars or are these restricted to the proud stomachs of the pullman passengers  no no the privacy of a french sleepingcar is all very well but for decency give our friend a good oldfashioned pullman sleeper at a third the money with its curtains swaying with the motion of the car and muting the longdrawn louddrawn breathing of the serried sleepers behind them to be sure in the morning when stooping backs begin to round the curtains out and halfshod feet to thrust into the narrow gangway between them the effect is of a familiarity an intimacy but so much trust so much brotherly kindness goes with it all that you could not call it indecency though certainly you could not claim it privacy it only proves as that friend of ours was saying that money cannot buy everything and that if you expect the pullman parlorcars to be an improvement on the german firstclass cars you will be disappointed probably firstclass cars vary much all over europe even secondclass cars do in austria they are not nearly so good as in germany and in italypoor dear italythey are worse still that is because the enemies of socialism say the roads are state roads or because the friends of socialism say the expropriated companies have dumped their wornout rollingstock on the commonwealth which must bear the shame of it with the stranger between these clashing claims we will not put our blade all we say is that italian railroad travel is as bad as heart could wishthe heart that loves italy and holds dear the memory of the days when there were few railroads if any there and one still went by diligence or vettura the only absolutely good railroad travel is in england where the corridor car imagined from the pullman has realized the most exacting ideal of the traveller of any class in the matter of diningcars we have stood still having attained perfection at a bound while the english diner has shot ahead in simplicity and quality of refection with us a dollar buys more dinner than you wish or like with them three shillings pay for an elegant sufficiency and a tip of sixpence purchases an explicit gratitude from the waiter which a quarter is often helpless to win from his dark antitype with us the lunch served on the steamer train from london to liverpool leaves the swollen mistimed dinner on the boston express  but what about that 5 pm breakfast which you got no longer ago than last september on the express between salisbury and exeter our friend exults to ask and we condescend to answer with forced candor  yes that was rather droll no englishman would dream of ordering afternoon tea consisting of chops boiled potatoes and a pot of souchong and if we chose to do so we took a serious chance but starvation will drive one to anything we had had nothing to eat since leaving salisbury three hours before and in the english air this is truly famine besides the amiable agent who came to our compartment for our order pledged his word that those potatoes should be ready in twenty minutes and so they were and so were the chops and so of course was the tea what he had failed to specify was that the diningcar had been left by divers defections at the junctions passed the last car in our train and that it was now straining at its leash in wild leaps and bounds one reached it by passing through more corridor cars than there are pullmans and day coaches in a westbound lake shore train and when one arrived one reeled and flounced into ones seat by such athletics as one uses in a bermuda steamer or did use in the old fifteenhundredton kind crossing the gulf stream when once comparatively secure in ones chair the combat with the lunch began mrs siddons would have been at home there for there was nothing for it but to stab the potatoes and all ones cunning of fence was needed to hold ones own with the chops but how delicious they were how the first mealed and the last melted in the mouth and the tea when once poured from the dizzy height at which the pot had to be held and the wild whirl in which the cup had to be caught to the lips how it cheered without inebriating and how the spirit rose to meet it the waiter dancing and swaying like any ships steward served the stray americans with as much respectful gravity as if they had been countyfamily english and he had been for generations in their service he did not deprecate the capers of the car but only casually owned that when it happened to be the last in the train it did pitch about a bit sir  no england is the only country where you can get the whole worth of your money in railroad travel and the welltodo sinner can enjoy the comfort which must be his advance recompense in this world for the happiness he cannot warrantably count upon in the next that steamer train of pullmans in germany will never contest the palm with the english corridor train nor will our palatial porterless depots vie with the simplest of these english wayside stations where the soft endearments of the railway servants penetrate to the very interior of the arriving strangers compartment and relieve him of all anxiety for his handbaggage then the cloakroom that refuge of temporary sojourn where his baggage remains in the porters charge till it is put back into the train who will contend that our parcels windows with their high counters fencing the depositor from the grim youths standing like receiving and paying tellers within compare with the english cloakroom its very name descends from the balls and assemblies of the past and graces the public enjoyment of its convenience with something of the courtesy and dignity of the exclusive pleasures of the upper classes it brings to one sense a vision of white shoulders bent over trim maids slippering slim feet and to another the faint proud odors of flowers that withered a hundred years ago  but what vain concession is this to the outworn ideals of a state and a condition justly superseded how far we have got from that gentle pair with whom we began peering into the parlorcar in portland maine to such as they it will matter little whether pullman cars are or are not put on that steamer train in north germany a great danger is that the vast horde of americans who travel will forget the immeasurable majority who remain at home and will lose in their sophistication the heavenglimpsing american point of view it is very precious that point of view and the foreigner who wins it is a happier man than the native who purseproudly puts it away when we part with the daily habit of trolleys and begin to think in cabs and taxicabs when we pass the line of honest day coaches and buy a seat in the parlorcar when we turn from pie or baked beans and coffee at the refreshmentcounter and keep our hunger for the table dhôte of the diningcar when we buy a room in the steamboat in disdain of the berth that comes with our ticket when we refuse to be one of four or even two in the cabin of the simpler steamers and will not go abroad on any vessel of less than twenty or thirty thousand tons with small separate tables and tuxedos in the saloon when we forsake the clothingstore with its democratic misfit for all figures and order our suits in london then we begin to barter away our birthright of republican simplicity and there is soon nothing for us but a coronet by marriage in the family or a quartersection of public land in northwestern canada  there has been altogether too much talk some of it we contritely own has been ours of the comparative comforts and discomforts of life for the bettertodo in europe and america in the demand for pullman trains between our port of arrival and the end of our journey when we go to the continent for a muchneeded rest we are apt to forget the fellowcitizens whom we saw across the impassable barrier dividing our first class from them on the steamer and who will find the secondclass german cars quite good enough for them and better than our day coaches at home if we cannot remember these then let us remember those for whom pullmans are not good enough and who spurn the dust of our summer ways in their automobiles and leave the parlorcars to our lowerclass vulgarity such people take their automobiles to europe with them and would not use that possible pullman train if they found it waiting for them at the port of arrival in germany what is the use it will soon not be an affair of automobiles but of aeroplanes at the ports of european arrival and a pullman train will look sadly strange and old to the debarking passengers no one will want to take it as no one would now want to take a bicycle or even a bicycle built for two these things are all comparative there is nothing positive nothing ultimate in the luxuries the splendors of life soon the last word in them takes on a vulgarity of accent and distinction turns from them with sick and scornful looks averse and listens for the            airy tongues that syllable mens names    on sands and shores and desert wildernesses  simplicity at the furthest possible remove from all complexity will be the next wordthe word that follows the last the womans word     xvi  qualities without defects   they had got to that point in their walk and talk where the talk might be best carried forward by arresting the walk and they sat down on a bench of the ramble in central park and provisionally watched a man feeding a squirrel with peanuts the squirrel had climbed up the leg of the mans trousers and over the promontory above and the man was holding very still flattered by the squirrels confidence and anxious not to frighten it away by any untoward movement if the squirrel had been a child bestowing its first intelligent favors upon him the man could not have been prouder he was an old fellow one of many who pamper the corrupt rodents of the park and reduce them from their native independence to something like the condition of those pauper wards of the nation on our indian reservations to whom a blurred image of the chase offers itself at stated intervals in the slaughter of the governments dole of beefcattle  the friend to whom this imperfect parallel occurred recalled his thoughts from it and said with single reference to the man and the squirrel i suppose thats an expression of the sort of thing weve been talking about kindness to animals is an impulse isnt it of the natural piety embracing the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man  illustration the mall central park  i dont think its quite so modern as that formulation the other friend questioned i was thinking it was very eighteenthcentury part of the universal humanitarian movement of the time when the master began to ask himself whether the slave was not also a man and a brother and the philanthropist visited the frightful prisons of the day and remembered those in bonds as bound with them  yes you may say that the first allowed but benevolence toward dumb creatures originated very much further back than the eighteenth century there was st francis of assisi you know who preached to the birds didnt he and walter von der vogelweide who pensioned them and several animalscats crocodiles cows and the likeenjoyed a good deal of consideration among the egyptians the serpent used to have a pretty good time as a popular religion and what about the stoics they were rather kind to animals werent they why should plinys doves have come down to us in mosaic if he cultivated them solely for the sake of broiled squabs its true that the modern roman before the extension of the spca to his city used his horse cruelly upon the perfectly unquestionable ground that the poor beast was not a christian  i dont remember about the stoics exactly the second friend mused aloud and the first let this go though they both understood that very likely he not only did not remember but had never known they had so many virtues that they must have been kind to brutes but i taste something more cowperian more wordsworthian than marcusaurelian in our own kindness these poets taught me so far as i could learn not to                      enter on my list of friends the man    who needlessly sets foot upon a worm  and     never to mix my pleasure or my pride    with sorrow of the meanest thing that breathes  yes but i dont like giving up the stoics we may have to come back to their ground if things keep on going the way they have gone for the last generation the stoics had a high ideal of duty its hard to see that the christian ideal is higher though they taught themselves to be proudly good and we if we may still say we when we say christians are always trying to teach ourselves to be humbly good  what do you mean the second of the friends demanded by coming back to their ground  why the first responded picking up a twig that opportunely dropped at his feet and getting out his knife to whittle it i suppose they were the first agnostics and we who dont so much deny the deity as ignore him  i see the second answered sadly but arent you throwing up the sponge for faith rather prematurely the power of believing has a tremendous vitality i heard a catholic once say to a protestant friend you know the church has outlived schisms much older than yours and inside of protestantism as well as catholicism there is a tremendous power of revival we have seen it often after an age of unbelief an age of belief is rather certain to follow  well well im willing im no more agnostic than you are i should be glad of an age of faith for the rest to my soul if for no other reason i was harking back to the stoics not only because they were good to animals if they were good but because they seemed to have the same barren devotion to duty which has survived my faith as well as my creed but why if i neither expect happiness nor dread misery should i still care to do my duty and i certainly always do  what always  well nearly always  the friends laughed together and the first said what a pity the gilbertian humor has gone out so you cant adapt it to a daily need any longer without the risk of not being followed  the other sighed nearly everything goes out except duty if that went out i dont think i should have much pleasure in life  no you would be dead without the hope of resurrection if there is anything comes direct from the creative force from     la somma sapienza e il primo amore  it is the sense of duty the moral law within us which kant divined as unmistakably delivered from god to man i use the old terminology  dont apologize it still serves our turn i dont know that anything else serves it yet and you make me think of what dear old md ctold me shortly after his wife died he had wished when they both owned that the end was near to suggest some comfort in the hope of another life to clutch at that straw to save his drowning soul but she stopped him she said there is nothing but duty the duty we have wished to do and tried to do  the friends were silent in the pathos of the fact and then the first said i suppose we all wish to do our duty even when we dont try or dont try hard enough  the other conjectured perhaps after all its a question of strength wickedness is weakness  that formula wont always serve still it will serve in a good many cases possibly most it wont do to preach it though  no we must cultivate strength of character i wonder how  well your stoics  my stoics  anybodys stoicsdid it by selfdenial when they saw a pleasure coming their way they sidestepped it they went round the corner and let it go by while they recruited their energies then when they saw a duty coming they stepped out and did it  it seems very simple but arent you rather cynical  thats what people call one when one puts ethics picturesquely but perhaps ive rather overdone it about the stoics perhaps they wouldnt have refused to enjoy a pleasure at their own expense at their cost in some sort of suffering to themselves they really seem to have invented the christian ideal of duty  and a very good thing it may be all that will be left of christianity in the end if the christian hope of reward goes as the christian fear of punishment has gone it seems to have been all there was of it in the beginning  the second of the friends said at this i dont know that i should go so far as that  the first returned well i dont know that i should ask you i dont know that i go that far myself he said and then they laughed together again  the man who was feeding the squirrel seemed to have exhausted his stock of peanuts and he went away after some hesitation the squirrel came toward the two friends and examined their countenances with a beady greedy eye he was really glutted with peanuts and had buried the last where he would forget it after having packed it down in the ground with his paws  no no the first of the friends said to the squirrel we are on the way back to being stoics and practising the more selfdenying virtues you wont get any peanuts out of us for one thing we havent got any  theres a boy the second friend dreamily suggested down by the boathouse with a basketful  but i am teaching this animal selfdenial he will be a nobler squirrel all the rest of his life for not having the peanuts he couldnt get thats like what i always try to feel in my own case its what i call characterbuilding get along  the squirrel to which the last words were addressed considered a moment then it got along after having inspected the whittlings at the feet of the friends to decide whether they were edible  i thought the second of the friends said that your humanity included kindness to animals  i am acting for this animals best good i dont say but that if the peanutboy had come by with his basket i shouldnt have yielded to my natural weakness and given the little brute a paper of them to bury he seems to have been rather a saving squirrelwhen he was gorged  the mellow sunlight of the november day came down through the tattered foliage and threw the shadows of the friends on the path where they sat with their soft hats pulled over their foreheads they were silent so long that when the second of them resumed their conversation he had to ask where were we  cultivating force of character in squirrels  i thought we had got by that  then we had come round to ourselves again  something like that the first friend reluctantly allowed  what a vicious circle it seems to me that our first duty if thats what you mean is to get rid of ourselves  whom should we have left other people we mustnt pamper their egotism in chastising our own we must use a great deal of caution in doing our duty if i really loved that squirrel if i were truly kind to animals if i studied their best good as disagreeable friends say they study ours i should go after him and give him a hickorynut that would wear down his teeth as nature intended civilization is undermining the health of squirrels by feeding them peanuts which allow their teeth to overgrow  that is true isnt it doing something of the same sort in other ways for all of us if i hadnt lost my teeth so long ago im sure i should feel them piercing from one jaw to another in their inordinate development its duty that keeps down the overgrowths that luxury incites bytheway what set you thinking so severely about duty this beautiful sunday morning the neglected duty of going to church  ah i call going to church a pleasure no i suppose it was an effect a reverberation of the tumult of my struggle to vote for the right man on tuesday when i knew that i was throwing my vote away if i did vote for him  but you voted for him  the first friend nodded  which man was it  whats the use he was beaten     that is all you know or need to know  of course he was beaten if it was your duty to vote for him the second friend mused how patient the creator must be with the result of his counsel to his creatures he keeps on communing commanding if we are to believe kant it is his one certain way to affirm and corroborate himself without his perpetual message to the human conscience he does not recognizably exist and yet more than half the time his mandate sends us to certain defeat to certain death its enough to make one go in for the other side of course we have to suppose that the same voice which intimates duty to us intimates duty to them  and that they would like to obey it if they could consistently with other interests and obligations  yes they juggle with their sense of it they pretend that the voice does not mean exactly what it says they get out of it that way  and the great vital difference between ourselves and them is that we promptly and explicitly obey it we dont palter with it in the slightest we dont bandy words with our sovereign as doctor johnson said i wonder the speaker added with the briskness of one to whom a vivid thought suddenly occurs how it would work if one went and did exactly the contrary of what was intimated to the human conscience  thats not a new idea there are people who habitually do so or rather to whom an inverted moral law is delivered  you mean the people who beat you at the polls last tuesday  no i mean the people in the asylums some of them they are said to hear the voice that bids us do right commanding them to do wrong thou shalt kill they hear it say thou shalt steal thou shalt bear false witness thou shalt commit adultery thou shalt not honor thy father and thy mother and so on through the decalogue with the inhibition thrown off or put on as the case may be  how very hideous the second friend exclaimed its like an emanation from the pit i mean the pit that used to be its been abolished  and a very good thing the noises from it went far to drown the voice of god and bewildered some men so that they did not rightly know what the voice was saying now when people hear a voice bidding them do evil we know what to do with them  and you think that the fellows who outvoted you on tuesday heard the same voice that you heard and they disobeyed it  ah its hard to say we havent got to the bottom of such things yet perhaps they disobeyed the voice provisionally expecting to make a satisfactory explanation later on or perhaps they had put their civic consciences in the keeping of others who gave them an official interpretation of the command with instructions not to take it literally  thats very interesting the second friend said then its your idea that no one really prefers to do wrong  not outside of the asylums and even there they can plead authority no no no in a world pretty full of evil there isnt any purely voluntary evil among the sane when the wicked as we call them do wrong it is provisionally only they mean to do right presently and make it up with the heavenly powers as long as an evildoer lives he means to cease some time to do evil he may put it off too long or until he becomes ethically unsound you know swedenborg found that the last state of sinners was insanity  dreadful  but ive always thought very few reached that state theres this curious thing about it all we are not only ethically prompted by that inner voice we are æsthetically prompted its a matter of taste as well as of conduct too the virtues are so clean the vices so repulsively dirty justice is beautifully symmetrical injustice is so shapeless so unbalanced truth is such a pure line falsehood is so out of drawing the iniquities make you uncomfortable the arts deny them  the second friend drew a long breath then i dont see why there are so many  well the first friend suggested there seems to be a difficulty some say that they have to be employed as antitheses we cant get on without them at least at this stage of the proceedings perhaps we shall advance so far that we shall be able to use historical or accomplished evil for the contrasts by which we shall know actual good  i dont see how you make that out  why there are already some regions of the globe where the summer does not require the antithesis of winter for its consciousness perhaps in the moral world there will yet be a condition in which right shall not need to contrast itself with wrong we are still meteorologically very imperfect  and how do you expect to bring the condition about by our always doing our duty  well we shant by not doing it     xvii  a wasted opportunity   the easy chair saw at once that its friend was full of improving conversation and it let him begin without the least attempt to stay him anything of the kind in fact would have been a provocation to greater circumstance in him he said  it was christmas eve and i dont know whether he arrived by chance or design at a time when the heart is supposed to be softest and the mind openest its a time when unless you look out you will believe anything people tell you and do anything they ask you i must say i was prepossessed by his appearance he was fair and slender and he looked about thirtyfive years old and when he said at once that he would not deceive me but would confess that he was just out of the penitentiary of a neighboring state where he had been serving a two years sentence i could have taken him in my arms even if he had not pretended that he had the same surname as myself i should have known him for a brother and though i suspected that he was wrong in supposing that his surname was at all like mine i was glad that he had sent it in and so piqued my curiosity that i had him shown up instead of having my pampered menial spurn him from my door as i might if he had said his name was brown jones or robinson  we dare say you have your selfjustification we put in at this point but you must own that it doesnt appear in what you are saying as a good citizen with the true interests of the poor at heart you would certainly have had your pampered menial spurn him from your door his being of your name or claiming to be so had nothing to do with his merit or want of it  oh i acknowledge that and ill own that there was something in his case as he stated it that appealed to my fancy even more than his community of surname appealed to my family affection he said he was a scotchman which i am not and that he had got a job on a cattlesteamer to work his way back to his native port the steamer would sail on monday and it was now friday night and the question which he hesitated which he intimated in terms so tacit that i should not call them an expression of it was how he was to live till monday  he left the calculation entirely to me which he might not have done if he had known what a poor head i had for figures and i entered into it with a reluctance which he politely ignored i had some quite new twodollar notes in my pocketbook the crisp sort which rustle in fiction when people take them out to succor the unfortunate or bribe the dishonest and i thought i would give him one if i could make it go round for him till his steamer sailed i was rather sorry for its being fresh but i had no old shabby or dirty notes such as one gives to cases of dire need you know  no we dont know we so seldom give paper at all we prefer to give copper  well that is right one ought to give copper if the need is very pressing if not so pressing one gives small silver and so on up but here was an instance which involved a more extended application of alms you know i told him while i was doing my sum in mental arithmetic there are the mills hotels where you can get a bed for twentyfive cents i dont remember whether they throw in breakfast or not i felt a certain squalor in my attitude which was not relieved by the air of gentle patience with which he listened my poor namesake if not kinsman we were both at least sons of adam he looked not only gentle but refined i made my reflection that this was probably the effect of being shut up for two years where the winds were not allowed to visit him roughly and the reflection strengthened me to say i think two dollars will tide you over till monday i cant say whether he thought so too but he did not say he did not think so he left it quite to me and i found another mathematical difficulty there were three nights lodging to be paid for and then he would have a dollar and a quarter for food i often spend as much as that on a single lunch including a quarter to the waiter and i wouldnt have liked making it pay for three days board but i didnt say so i left the question entirely to him and he said nothing  in fact he was engaged in searching himself for credentials first in one pocket and then in another but he found nothing better than a pawnticket which he offered me whats this i asked my overcoat he said and i noted that he had borrowed a dollar and a half on it i did not like that it seemed to me that he was taking unfair advantage of me and i said oh i think you can get along without your overcoat im glad to think now that it hadnt begun to snow yet and that i had no prescience of the blizzardwhat the papers fondly called the baby blizzard such a pretty fancy of theirswhich was to begin the next afternoon wasnt making the faintest threat from the moonlit sky then he said its rather cold but i ignored his position at the same time i gave him a quarter  that was magnificent but it was not political economy we commented you should have held to your irrefutable argument that he could get along without his overcoat you should have told him that he would not need it on shipboard  well do you know our friend said i really did tell him something like that and it didnt seem to convince him though it made me ashamed i suppose i was thinking how he could keep close to the readingroom fire and i did not trouble to realize that he would not be asked to draw up his chair when he came in from looking after the cattle  it would have been an idle compliment anyway we said you cant draw up the readingroom chairs on shipboard theyre riveted down  i remembered afterward but still i was determined not to take his overcoat out of pawn and he must have seen it in my eye he put back his pawnticket and did not try to produce any other credentials i had noticed that the ticket did not bear the surname we enjoyed in common i said to myself that the name of smith which it did bear must be the euphemism of many who didnt wish to identify themselves with their poverty even to a pawnbroker but i said to him here and i pulled open my table drawer and took from it a small envelope full of english coins which i had been left stranded with on several returns from europe the inhuman stewards had failed to relieve me of them and as i always vow when i have got through our customs that i will never go to europe again i had often wondered what i should do with those coins i now took out the largest and handsomest of them do you know what that is yes he said its two shillings and sixpencewhat we call a halfcrown his promptness restored my faith in him i saw that he must be what he said undoubtedly he had been in the penitentiary very likely our name was the same an emotion of kinship stirred in my heart here i said and i handed him the coin it did not seem so bad as giving him more american money they can change that on the ship for you i guess you can manage now till monday and my confidence in providence diffused such a genial warmth through my steamheated apartment that i forgot all about his overcoat i wish i could forget about it now  we felt that we ought to say something to comfort a man who owned his excess of beneficence oh you mustnt mind giving him so much money we cant always remember our duty to cut the unfortunate as close as we ought another time you will do better come cheer up  our friend did not seem entirely consoled by our amiability in fact he seemed not to notice it he heaved a great sigh in resuming he appeared to think i was hinting that it was time for him to go for he got up from the lounge where i had thoughtlessly had the decency to make him sit down and went out into the hall thanking me as i followed him to the door i was sorry to let him go he had interested me somehow beyond anything particularly appealing in his personality in fact his personality was rather null than otherwise as far as that asserted any claim such a mere man and brother before he put his hand on my doorknob a belated curiosity stirred in me which i tried as delicately as i could to appease was your trouble something about thei was going to say the ladies but that seemed too mawkish and i boldly outed withwomen oh no he said meekly it was just cloth a piece of cloth breaking and entering i led on well not exactly butit came to grand larceny and i might have fancied a touch of mounting selfrespect in his confession of a considerable offence  i didnt know exactly what to say so i let myself off with a little philosophy well you see it didnt pay exactly oh no he said sadly enough and he went out  our friend was silent at this point and we felt that we ought to improve the occasion in his behalf well there you lost a great opportunity you ought to have rubbed it in you ought to have made him reflect upon the utter folly of his crime you ought to have made him realize that for a ridiculous value of forty or fifty or seventyfive dollars he had risked the loss of his liberty for two years and not only his liberty but his labor for he had come out of the penitentiary after two years of hard work as destitute as he went in he had not even the piece of cloth to show for it all yes you lost a great opportunity  our friend rose from the dejected posture in which he had been sitting and blazed outwe have no milder word for itblazed out in a sort of fiery torrent which made us recoil yes i lost that great opportunity and i lost a greater still i lost the opportunity of telling that miserable man that thief for thief and robber for robber the state which had imprisoned him for two years and then cast him out again without a cent of pay for the wages he had been earning all that dreadful time was a worse thief and a worse robber than he i ought to have told him that in so far as he had been cheated of his wages by the law he was the victim the martyr of an atrocious survival of barbarism oh i have thought of it since with shame and sorrow i was sending him out into the cold that was gathering for the baby blizzard without the hope of his overcoat but since then i have comforted myself by considering how small my crime was compared with that of the state which had thrown him destitute upon the world after the two years labor it had stolen from him at the lowest rate of wages for unskilled labor it owed him at least a thousand dollars or with half subtracted for board and lodging five hundred it was his delinquent debtor in that sum and it had let him loose to prey upon society in my person because it had defrauded him of the money he had earned  but our dear friend we entreated dont you realize that this theft this robbery this fraud as you call it was part of the sanative punishment which the state had inflicted upon him  and you dont think two years prison two years slavery was sanative enough without the denial of his just compensation  we perceived that it would be useless to argue with a man in this truculent mood and we silently forbore to urge that the vision of destitution which the criminal must have before his eyes advancing hand in hand with liberty to meet him at the end of his term when his prison gates opened into the world which would not feed or shelter or clothe or in any wise employ him would be a powerful deterrent from future crime and act as one of the most efficient agencies of virtue which the ingenuity of the law has ever invented but our silence did not wholly avail us for our poor misguided friend went on to say  suppose he had a wife and childrenhe may have had several of both for all i knowdependent on him would it have been particularly sanative for them to be deprived of his earnings too  we cannot answer these sophistries we were exasperated into replying all that we can say is that anything elseanything like what you call justice to the criminal the prisonerwould disrupt society and we felt that disrupt was a word which must carry conviction to the densest understanding it really appeared to do so in this case for our friend went away without more words leaving behind him a manuscript which we mentally rejected while seeing our way to use the material in it for the present essay it is the wellknown custom of editors to employ in this way the ideas of rejected contributors  a few days later we met our friend and as we strolled beside him in the maniacal hubbub of the new york streets so favorable to philosophic communion we said well have you met your namesake since you came to his rescue against the robber state or did he really sail on the cattlesteamer as he said he was going to do  our friend gave a vague embarrassed laugh he didnt sail exactly at least not on that particular steamer the fact is i have just parted from him at my own doorthe outside of it it appears that the authorities of that particular line wished to take advantage of him by requiring him to pay down a sum of money as a guarantee of good faith and that he refused to do sonot having the money for one reason i did not understand the situation exactly but this was not essential to his purpose which made itself evident through a good deal of irrelevant discourse since i had seen him society had emulated the state in the practice of a truly sanative attitude toward him at the place where he went to have his halfcrown changed into american money they would only give him forty cents for it but he was afterward assured by an acquaintance that the current rate was sixty cents in fact a halfcrown is worth a little more  well what can you expect of moneychangers we returned consolingly and what is going to become of your unhappy beneficiary now  why according to his report fortune has smiled or halfsmiled as the novelists say upon him he has found a berth on another line of cattlesteamers where they dont require a deposit as a guarantee of good faith in fact the head steward has taken a liking to him and he is going out as one of the tablestewards instead of one of the herdsmen im not sure that herdsmen is what they call them  we laughed sardonically and do you believe he is really going  our friend sighed heavily well i dont believe hes coming back i only gave him the loose change i had in my pocket and i dont think it will support him so handsomely to the end of the week that he will wish to call upon me for more  we were both silent just as the characters are in a novel till the author can think what to make them say next then we asked and you still think he had been in the penitentiary  i dont see why he should have said so if he wasnt  well then we retorted bitterly again like a character in fiction you have lost another great opportunity not a moral opportunity this time but an æsthetic opportunity you could have got him to tell you all about his life in prison and perhaps his whole career leading up to it and you could have made something interesting of it you might have written a picaresque novel or a picaresque short story anyway  our friend allowed with a mortified air it was rather a break  you threw away the chance of a lifetime namesakes who have been in jail dont turn up every day in his intimate relation to you he would have opened up he would have poured out his whole heart to you think of the material you have lost  we thought of it ourselves and with mounting exasperation when we reflected that he would probably have put it into his paper and when we reflected that we could have given so much more color to our essay we could not endure it well goodday we said coldly we are going down this way  our friend shook hands lingeringly absently then he came to himself with a mocking laugh well perhaps he wasnt after all what he said     xviii  a nieces literary advice to her uncle   a veteran novelist who was also an intimate friend of the easy chairs sat before his desk pensively supporting his cheek in his left hand while his right toyed with the pen from which for the moment at least fiction refused to flow his greatniece who seemed such a contradiction in terms being as little and vivid personally as she was nominally large and stately opened the door and advanced upon him  do i disturb you uncle she asked she did not call him greatuncle because that she rightly said was ridiculous and now as part of the informality she went on without waiting for him to answer because you know you wanted me to tell you what i thought of your last story and ive just read it  oh yes the veteran novelist assented brightly hiding his struggle to recall which story it was well  well she said firmly but kindly you want me to be frank with you dont you  by all means my dear its very good of you to read my story by this time he had with the help of the rather lean volume into which his publishers had expanded a longshort story and which she now held intensely clasped to her breast really remembered  not at all she said she sat down very elastically in the chair on the other side of his desk and as she talked she accented each of her emotions by a spring from the cushioned seat in the first place she said with the effect of coming directly to business i suppose you know yourself that it couldnt be called virile  no he returned what is virile  well i cant explain precisely but its something that all the critics say of a book that is very strong dont you know and masterful and relentless and makes you feel as if somebody had taken you by the throat and shakes you up awfully and seems to throw you into the air and trample you under foot  good heavens my dear the veteran novelist exclaimed i hope im a gentleman even when im writing a novel  your being a gentleman has nothing to do with it uncle she said severely for she thought she perceived a disposition in the veteran novelist to shuffle you cant be virile and at the same time remember that you are a gentleman lots of women write virile books  ladies the novelist asked  dont i say that has nothing to do with it if you wish to grip the readers attention you must let yourself go whether youre a gentleman or a lady of course she relented your books very idyllic and delightful and all that but she resumed severely do you think an honest critic could say there was not a dull page in it from cover to cover  the novelist sighed im sure i dont know they seem to say itin the passages quoted in the advertisementsof all the books published except mine he added sadly  well we will pass that point his greatniece relented again i didnt intend to wound your feelings uncle  oh you havent i suppose i am a little too easygoing at times  yes that is it one cant say dull but too easygoing no faithful critic could begin a notice of your book with such a passage as have you read it no then hop skip and jump and get it dont wait to find your hat or drink your coffee march its going like the wind and you must kite if you want one of the first edition of fifty thousand now that his greatniece ended fondly is what i should like every critic to say of your book uncle  the veteran novelist reflected for a moment then he said more spiritedly i dont believe i should my dear  then you must thats all but thats a small thing what i really wonder at is that with all your experience you are not more of a stylist  stylist  yes i dont believe theres an epigram in your book from beginning to end thats the reason the critics dont quote any brilliant sentences from it and the publishers cant advertise it properly it makes me mad to find the girls repeating other authors sayings and i never catch a word from a book of yours though youve been writing more than a century  not quite so long my dear i think though very very long but just what do you mean by style  well you ought to say even the simplest things in a distinguished way and here all through i find you saying the most distinguished things in the simplest way but i wont worry you about things that are not vital ill allow for the sake of argument that you cant have virility if you remember that you are a gentleman even when you are writing fiction but you can have passion why dont you  dont i i thought  not a speck of itnot a single speck its rather a delicate point and i dont exactly know how to put it but if you want me to be frank i must she looked at her greatuncle and he nodded encouragement i dont believe theres a single place where he crushes her to his heart or presses his lips to hers in a long kiss he kisses her cheek once but i dont call that anything why in lots of the books nowadays the girls themselves cling to the men in a close embrace or put their mouths tenderly to theirswell of course it sounds rather disgusting but in your own earlier books im sure theres more of itof passion isnt there think  the veteran novelist tried to think to tell you the truth my dear i cant remember i hope there was and there always will be love and true love in my novelsthe kind that sometimes ends in happy marriage but is always rather shy of showing itself off to the reader in caresses of any kind i think passion can be intimated and is better so than brutally stated if you have a lot of hugging and kissing  uncle  how are your lovers different from those poor things in the park that make you ashamed as you pass them  the police ought to put a stop to it they are perfectly disgraceful  and they ought to put a stop to it in the novels its not only indecent but its highly insanitary nice people dont want you to kiss their children nowadays and yet they expect us novelists to supply them with passion of the most demonstrative sort in our fiction among the japanese who are now one of the great worldpowers kissing is quite unknown in real life i dont know the japanese fiction very well but i doubt whether theres a single kiss or double in it i believe that a novel full of intense passion could be written without the help of one embrace from beginning to end  uncle the girl vividly exclaimed why dont you do it it would be the greatest success just give them the wink somehow at the startjust hint that there was the greatest kind of passion going on all the time and never once showing itself and the girls would be raving about it why dont you do it uncle you know i do so want you for once to write the most popular book of the month  i want to do it myself my dear but as to my writing a book full of suppressed passion thats a story in itself  tell it she entreated  the easy chair wouldnt give me room for it but ill tell you something else when i was a boy i had a knack at versing which came rather in anticipation of the subjects to use it on i exhausted spring and morning and snow and memory and the whole range of mythological topics and then i had my knack lying idle i observed that there was one subject that the other poets found inexhaustible but somehow i felt myself disqualified for treating it how could i sing of love when i had never been in love for i didnt count those youthful affairs when i was only in the third reader and the first part of the arithmetic i went about trying to be in love as a matter of business but i couldnt manage it suddenly it managed itself and then i found myself worse disqualified than ever i didnt want to mention it either to myself or to her much less to the world at large it seemed a little too personal  oh uncle how funny you are  do you think so i didnt think it much fun then and i dont now once i didnt know what love was and now ive forgotten  no such thing uncle you write about it beautifully even if youre not very virile or epigrammatic or passionate i wont let you say so  well then my dear if i havent forgotten im not interested you see i know so much more about it than my lovers do i cant take their point of view any longer to tell you the truth i dont care a rap whether they get married or not in that story there that youve been reading i got awfully tired of the girl she was such a fool and the fellow was a perfect donkey  but he was the dearest donkey in the world i wanted to hshake hands with him and i wanted to kissyes kissher she was such a lovable fool  youre very kind to say so my dear but you cant keep on making delightful idiots go down with the public that was what i was thinking when you came in and found me looking so dismal i had stopped in the middle of a most exciting scene because i had discovered that i was poking fun at my lovers  and here i the girl lamented didnt take the slightest notice but began on you with the harshest criticisms  i didnt mind i dare say it was for my good  im sure i meant it so uncle and what are you going to do about it  well i must get a new point of view  yes  i must change my ground altogether i cant pretend any longer to be the contemporary of my lovers or to have the least sympathy with their hopes and fears if i were to be perfectly honest with them i should tell them perhaps that disappointed love was the best thing that could happen to either of them but if they insisted on happiness that a good broken engagement promised more of it than anything else i could think of  that is true the girl sighed there are a great many unhappy marriages of course people would say it was rather pessimistic wouldnt they  people will say anything one mustnt mind them but now ill tell you what ive been thinking all the time weve been talking  well i knew you were not thinking of my nonsense  it was very good nonsense as nonsense goes my dear what ive been thinking is that i must still have the love interest in my books and have it the main interest but i must treat it from the vantageground of age it must be something i look back upon and a little down upon  i see what you mean the girl dissentingly assented  i must be in the whole secretthe secret not merely of my lovers love but the secret of love itself i must know and i must subtly intimate that it doesnt really matter to anybody how their affair turns out for in a few years twenty or thirty years its a thousand to one that they wont care anything about it themselves i must maintain the attitude of the sage dealing not unkindly but truthfully with the situation  it would be rather sad the girl murmured but one likes sad things  when one is young one does when one is old one likes true things but of course my lovestories would be only for those who have outlived love i ought to be fair with my readers and forewarn them that my story was not for the young the hopeful the happy  the girl jumped to her feet and stood magnificent uncle its grand  he rose too what is he faltered  the idea dont you see you can have the publisher announce it as a story for the disillusioned the wretched and the despairing and that would make every girl want it for thats what every girl thinks she is and they would talk to the men about it and then they would want it and it would be the book of the month dont say another word oh you dear in spite of the insanitary nature of the action she caught her uncle round the neck and kissed him on his bald spot and ran out of the room she opened the door to call back dont lose a single minute begin it now  but the veteran novelist sank again into his chair in the posture in which she had surprised him     xix  a search for celebrity   we lately received a publication which has interested us somewhat out of proportion to its size it is called the way into print but it does not treat as the reader might rashly suppose of the best method of getting your name into the newspapers either as a lady who is giving a dinner to thirteen otherwise unknown persons or is making a comingout tea for her débutante daughter or had a box full of expensively confectioned friends at the opera or the vaudeville or is going to read a paper at a womans club or is in any sort figuring in the thousand and one modern phases of publicity it does not even advise her guests or hearers how to appear among those present or those who were invited and did not come or those who would not have come if they had been invited its scope is far more restricted yet its plane is infinitely higher its reach incomparably further the print which it proposes to lead the way into is that print where the elect who were once few and are now many are making the corridors of time resound to their footsteps as poets essayists humorists or other literary forms of immortality their procession which from the point of the impartial spectator has been looking more and more like a cakewalk in these later years is so increasingly the attraction of youngeyed ambition that nothing interests a very large class of people more than advice for the means of joining it and it is this advice which the publication in point supplies supplies we must say with as much good sense and good feeling as is consistent with an office which does not seem so dignified as we could wish  inevitably the adviser must now and then stoop to the folly of the aspirant inevitably he must use that folly from time to time with wholesome severity but he does not feel himself equal to the work unaided our sudden national expansion through the irresistible force of our imaginative work into an intellectual worldpower has thrust a responsibility upon the veterans of a simpler time which they may not shirk and the author of the way into print calls upon them to share his task he is not satisfied with the interesting chapters contributed by younger authors who are in the act of winning their spurs but he appeals to those established in the public recognition to do their part in aiding us to hold our conquest through the instruction and discipline of those who must take their places when they put their armor off he does this by means of a letter almost an open letter addressed personally to each veteran by means of the substitution of his typewritten name for that of some other veteran but not differenced in the terms of the ensuing appeal to his kindness or his conscience he puts himself upon a broad humanitarian ground and asks that the typewritten author who he assumes is prominently before the public shall answer certain questions to which the appellant owns that he has already received hundreds of replies  by an odd mischance one of his halfopen letters found its way to the easy chair and although that judgmentseat felt relieved from the sense of anything like a lonely prominence before the public by the very multitude of those similarly consulted it did not remain as easy as it would have liked under the erring attribution of prominence yet to have refused to help in so good a work would not have been in its nature and it lost as little time as possible in summoning a real author of prominence to consider the problems so baffling to a mere editorial effigy for as we ought to explain the de facto editor is to be found in the study next door and never in the easy chair the author prominently before the public came at once for that kind of author has very little to do and is only too happy to respond to calls like that of the friend of rising authorship most of his time is spent at symposiums imagined by the sunday editions of the newspapers to consider decide the question whether figpaste is truly a healthfood or whether in view of a recent colossal gift for educational purposes the product of the standard oil company was the midnight oil which shakespeare had in mind when he spoke of the scholar wasting it or something of that kind his mind is whetted to the sharpest edge by its employment with these problems and is in prime condition for such simple practical inquiries as those proposed by the letter we had received but of course he put on an air of great hurry and spoke of the different poems novels essays and sketches which he had laid aside to oblige us and begged us to get down to business at once  we wish nothing better than to do so we said to humor him for we know you are a very busy man and we will not keep you a moment longer than is absolutely necessary would you like to have all the questions at once or would you rather study them one after another  he said he thought he could better give an undivided mind to each if he had them one at a time and so we began with the first  1 would you advise the young storywriter to study the old masters in literature or the stories in the current magazines in order to meet the demands of the current editors  will you read that again the author prominently before the public demanded but when we had read it a second time it seemed only to plunge him deeper into despair he clutched his revered head with both hands and but for an opportune baldness would probably have torn his hair he murmured huskily do you think you have got it right  we avoided the response sure thing by an appropriate circumlocution and then he thundered back how innatureis a young writer to forecast the demands of current editors if an editor is worth his salthis attic salthe does not know himself what he wants except by the eternal yearning of the editorial soul for something new and good if he has any other demands he is not a current editor he is a stagnant editor is it possible that there is a superstition to the contrary  apparently  then that would account for many things but go on  go on yourself you have not answered the question  oh by all means the author sardonically answered if the current editor has demands beyond freshness and goodness let the young writer avoid the masters in literature and study the stories in the current magazines  you are not treating the matter seriously we expostulated  yes i amseriously sadly even tragically i could not have imagined a condition of things so bad even with the results all round us let us have the second question of your correspondent  here it is 2 has the unknown writer an equal chance with the wellknown author provided his work is up to the standard of the latters  of the lattersof the lattersof the latters our friend whispered the phrase to himself before he groaned out what a frightful locution really really it is more than i can bear  for the cause you ought to bear anything what do you really think  why if the formers work is as good as the latters why isnt the formers chance as good if the current editors demands are for the same kind in the formers case as in the latters if the latters aim is to meet the imaginary demands of the stagnant editor then the formers work ought to be as attractive as the latters ha ha ha  he laughed wildly and in order to recall him to himself we read the third question 3 which is the more acceptablea welltold story with a weak plot or a poorly told story with a strong plot  oh but that is a conundrum pure and simple the author protested it is a poor parody on the old endman pleasantry would you rather be as foolish as you look or look as foolish as you are you are making it up  we assure you we are not it is no more a conundrum than the others come question  well in the first place i should like to know what a plot is something that has occurred to you primarily as an effect from your experience or observation or something you have carpentered out of the old stuff of your reading with a wooden hero and heroine reciprocally dying for each other and a wooden villain trying to foil them  you had better ask a current editor or a stagnant do you confess yourself posed by this plain problem do you give it up  for the present perhaps i may gather light from the next question  then here it is 4 what do you consider the primary weakness in the average stories or verses of the old writers  oh that is easy the same as in the average stories and verses of the younger writersabsence of mind  are you sure you are not shirking cannot you give a categorical answersomething that will really help some younger writer to take the place which you are now more or less fraudulently holding the younger writers will cheerfully allow that the trouble is absence of mind but what line of reading would you suggest which would turn this into presence of mind  there is none except to have themselves newly ancestored presence of mind as well as absence of mind is something derived you cannot acquire it  we think you might be a little less sardonic now here is the next problem 5 what are the successful authors necessary qualifications in the matters of natural ability education life as he sees it and lives it technical training etc  this will be the death of me the prominent author lamented couldnt i skip that one  it seems to cover some of the most important points we do not think your selfrespect will allow you to skip it at any rate make an effort to answer it  thus challenged the prominent author pulled himself together oh he said sadly which of us knows whether he has natural ability or not and what is education and what is life as one sees it and what is technical training do these poor young fellows think that one is tall or short by taking thought it is the same as that it seems to me or if you prefer a mystical solution i should say if you have a longing from your earliest consciousness to write poetry or fiction and cannot keep from doing it for any long time together you are possibly born with a gift for it but this may be altogether a mistake it may be the effect of your early and incessant scribblings on the minds of spectators wholly incompetent to judge of your abilities such as your fond parents this must rather often happen if we can judge from what ninetenths of what is called literature is composed of if your longing to write is the real thing or is not still education will not help or hinder you in doing it no man was ever yet taught any art he may be taught a trade and that is what most of the versing and prosing is i suppose if you have the gift you will technically train yourself that is you will learn how to be simple and clear and honest charm you will have got from your greatgrandfather or greatgrandmother and life which is only another sort of school will not qualify you to depict life but if you do not want to depict life you will perhaps be able to meet the demands of what our friend calls the current editors  here the prominent author rose but we stayed him with a gesture there is another question the last 6 do you care to convey any hints or suggestions gleaned from your personal experiences in the climb to success that may make easier the gaining of the heights for the beginner  the prominent author roared with laughter read that again but when we had done so he became grave even sorrowful is it really true then as we seem to see that there is a large body of young people taking up literature as a business the thing that all my life i have fondly dreamed was an art dear and almost holy are they going into it for the money there is in it and am i in my prominencemore or less fraudulent as you sayan incentive to them to persevere in their enterprises is that what one has to come to after a life of conscientious devotion toan ideal come old friend say it isnt so bad as that it is thenthe prominent author paused and sank weakly into the chair from which he had risenperhaps i have been dreaming all these years but in my dream it seems to me that everything outside of myself which seemed to hinder me has really helped me there has been no obstacle in my way which if i were at the bottom of the hill where i might very rightfully be i would have removed i am glad that the climb to success as your friend calls it has been hard and long and i bless god for my difficulties and backsets all of them sometimes they seemed cruel they filled me with despair and shame but there was not one that did not make me stronger and fitter for my work if i was fit for it you know very well that in this art of ours we need all the strength we can get from our overthrows there is no training that can ever make the true artists work easy to him and if he is a true artist he will suspect everything easily done as ill done what comes hard and slow and hopelessly that is the thing which when we look at it we find is the thing that was worth doing i had my downs with my ups and when i was beginning the downs outnumbered the ups ten to one for one manuscript accepted and after the days of many years printed i had a dozen rejected and rejected without delay but every such rejection helped me in some cases i had to swallow the bitter dose and own that the editor was right but the bitter was wholesome in other cases i knew that he was wrong and then i set my teeth and took my courage in both hands and tried and tried with that rejected manuscript till the divinely appointed editor owned that i was right but these are the commonplaces of literary biography i dont brag of them and i have always tried to keep my head in such shape that even defeat has not swelled it beyond the no 7 i began with why should i be so wicked as to help another and a younger man over the bad places if i could only gain his confidence i should like to tell him that these are the places that will strengthen his heart for the climb but if he has a weak heart he had better try some other road there i have given you all the hints and suggestions from my experience that i can think of and now let me go  once more he rose and once more we stayed him yes we said no doubt you think you have spoken honestly and faithfully but you have addressed yourself to the wrong audience you have spoken to artists born and selfmade but artists can always manage without help your help was invoked in behalf of artisans of adventurers of speculators what was wanted of you was a formula for the fabrication of gold bricks which would meet the demands of current dealers in that sort of wares  but if i have never made gold bricks myself or not knowingly  ah that is what you say but do you suppose anybody will believe you  the prominent author put on the hat which he flattered himself was a no 7 but which we could plainly see was a no 12 and said with an air of patronizing compassion you have sat here so long in your cushioned comfort looking out on the publishing world that you have become corrupt cynical pessimistic     xx  practical immortality on earth   the talk at a dinner given by the easy chair to some of its most valued friends was of the life after death and it will not surprise any experienced observer to learn that the talk went on amid much unserious chatter with laughing irrelevancies more appropriate to the pouring of champagne and the changing of plates than to the very solemn affair in hand it may not really have been so very solemn nobody at table took the topic much to heart apparently the women some of them affected an earnest attention but were not uncheerful others frankly talked of other things some at the farther end of the table asked what a given speaker was saying the men did not in some cases conceal that they were bored  no the first speaker said after weighing the pros and cons for my part i dont desire it when i am through here i dont ask to begin again elsewhere  and you dont expect to his closest listener inquired  and i dont expect to  it is curious the closest listener went on how much our beliefs are governed by our wishes in this matter when we are young and are still hungering for things to happen we have a strong faith in immortality when we are older and the whole round of things except death has happened we think it very likely we shall not live again it seems to be the same with peoples the new peoples believe the old peoples doubt it occurs to very very few men to be convinced as a friend of mine has been convinced against the grain of the reality of the life after death i will not say by what means he was convinced for that is not pertinent but he was fully convinced and he said to me personally i would rather not live again but it seems that people do the facts are too many the proofs i have had are irresistible and i have had to give way to them in spite of my wish to reject them  yes the first speaker said that is certainly an uncommon experience you think that if i were perfectly honest i should envy him his experience well then honestly i dont  no the other rejoined i dont know that i accuse your sincerity but may i ask what are your personal objections to immortality  it wouldnt be easy to say if i could have had my way i would not have been at all speaking selfishly as we always do when we speak truly i have not had a great deal of happiness though i have had a good deal of fun but things seem to wear out i like to laugh and i have laughed in my time consumedly but i find that the laugh goes out of the specific instances of laughability just as grieving goes out of grief the thing that at the first and third time amused me enormously leaves me sad at the fourth or at least unmoved you see i cant trust immortality to be permanently interesting the reasonable chances are that in the lapse of a few æons i should find eternity hanging heavy on my hands but it isnt that exactly and it would be hard to say what my objection to immortality exactly is it would be simpler to say what it really is it is personal temperamental congenital i was born i suspect an indifferentist as far as this life is concerned and as to another life i have an acquired antipathy  that is curious but not incredible and of course not inconceivable the closest listener assented  im not so sure of that a light skirmisher broke his silence for the first time do you mean to say he asked of the first speaker that you would not mind being found dead in your bed tomorrow morning and that you would rather like it if that were actually the end of you  the first speaker nodded his head over the glass he had just emptied and having swallowed its contents hastily replied precisely  then you have already at your age evolved that instinct of death which metchnikoff in his strange book thinks the race will come to when men begin living rightly and go living on to a hundred and fifty years or more as they once did  who is metchnikoff and what is the name of his strange book the light skirmisher cut in  hes the successor of pasteur in the pasteur institute at paris and his book is called the nature of man  that blighting book one of the women who had caught on to the drift of the talk contributed this anguished suspiration  blighting is it blighting the first speaker parleyed  dont you call it blighting she returned to be told not only that you are the descendant of an anthropoid apewe had got used to thatbut of an anthropoid ape gone wrong  sort of simian degenerate the light skirmisher formulated the case we are merely apes in error  the closest listener put this playfulness by what seems to me a fundamental error of that book is its constant implication of a constant fear of death i can very well imagine or i can easily allow that we are badly made and that there are all sorts of disharmonies as metchnikoff calls them in us but my own experience is that we are not all the time thinking about death and dreading it either in earlier or later life and that elderly people think less about it if anything than younger people his contention for an average life four or five times longer than the present average life seems to be based upon an obscure sense of the right of a man to satisfy that instinct of life here on earth which science forbids him to believe he shall satisfy hereafter  well i suppose the first speaker said that metchnikoff may err in his premises through a temperamental disharmony of russian nature rather than of less specific human nature the great russian authors seem to recognize that perpetual dread of death in themselves and their readers which we dont recognize in ourselves or our occidental friends and neighbors other people dont think of death so much as he supposes and when they do they dont dread it so much but i think he is still more interestingly wrong in supposing that the young are less afraid of death than the old because they risk their lives more readily that is not from indifference to death it is from inexperience of life they havent learned yet the dangers which beset it and the old have that is all  i dont know but youre right the first speaker said and i couldnt see the logic of metchnikoffs position in regard to the instinct of death which he expects us to develop after we have lived say a hundred and thirty or forty years so that at a hundred and fifty we shall be glad to go and shall not want anything but death after we die the apparent line of his argument is that in youth we have not the instinct of life so strongly but that we willingly risk life then until we live to a hundred and thirty or forty or so we have the instinct of life so strongly that we are anxious to shun death lastly the instinct of death grows in us and we are eager to lay down life i dont see how or why this should be as a matter of fact children dread death far more than men who are not yet old enough to have developed the instinct of it still its a fascinating and suggestive book  but not enough so to console us for the precious hope of living again which it takes away so pitilessly said the woman who had followed the talk  is that such a very precious hope the first speaker asked  i know you pretend not she said but i dont believe you  then you think that the dying who almost universally make a good end are buoyed up by that hope  i dont see why they shouldnt be i know its the custom for scientific people to say that the resignation of the dying is merely part of the general sinking and so is just physical but they cant prove that else why should persons who are condemned to death be just as much resigned to it as the sick and even more exalted  ah the light skirmisher put in some of the scientific people dispose of that point very simply they say its selfhypnotism  well but they cant prove that either she retorted then she went on besides the dying are not almost universally willing to die sometimes they are very unwilling and they seem to be unwilling because they have no hope of living again why wouldnt it be just as reasonable to suppose that we could evolve the instinct of death by believing in the life hereafter as by living here a hundred and fifty years for the present its as easy to do the one as the other  but not for the future the first speaker said as you suggest it may be just as reasonable to think we can evolve the instinct of death by faith as by longevity but it isnt as scientific  what m metchnikoff wants is the scientific certaintywhich we can have only by beginning to live a century and a half apiecethat the coming man will not be afraid to die this of course was from the light skirmisher  the woman contended the coming man may be scientifically resigned if he prefers but the going man the gone man was rapturously ready to die in untold thousands of martyrdoms because he believed that he should live again  the first speaker smiled compassionately and perhaps also a little patronizingly im not sure that you have met the point exactly metchnikoff denies on the basis of scientific knowledge that it is possible for a man being dead to live again in those two extremely interesting chapters of his which treat of the religious remedies and the philosophical remedies for the disharmonies of the human constitution he is quite as unsparing of the sages as of the saints the christians and the buddhists fare no worse than plato and the stoics the last are no less unscientific than the first in his view and no less fallacious what he asks is not that we shall be resigned or enraptured in view of death but that we shall physically desire it when we are tired of living just as we physically desire sleep when we are tired of waking  and to that end the light skirmisher said he asks nothing but that we shall live a hundred and fifty years  no he asks that we shall live such natural lives that we shall die natural deaths which are voluntary deaths he contends that most of us now die accidental and violent deaths  the woman who had caught on demanded why does he think we could live a century and a half  from analogies in the lives of other animals and from the facts of our constitution he instances the remarkable cases of longevity recorded in the bible  i think hes very inconsistent his pursuer continued the bible says men lived anywhere from a hundred to nine hundred years and he thinks it quite possible the bible says that men live after death and he thinks thats impossible  well have you ever met a man who had lived after death the first speaker asked  no have you ever met a man two hundred years old if it comes to undeniable proof there is far more proof of ghosts than of bicentenarians  very well then i get out of it by saying that i dont believe in either  and leave metchnikoff in the lurch the light skirmisher reproached him you dont believe in the instinct of death and i was just going to begin living to a hundred and fifty and dying voluntarily by leaving off cheese now i will take some of the gorgonzola  everybody laughed but the first speaker and the woman who had caught on they both looked rather grave and the closest listener left off laughing soonest  we cant be too grateful to science for its devotion to truth but isnt it possible for it to overlook one kind of truth in looking for another isnt it imaginable that when a certain anthropoid ape went wrong and blundered into a man he also blundered into a soul and as a slight compensation for having involuntarily degenerated from his anthropoid ancestor came into the birthright of eternal life  its imaginable the first speaker granted but science leaves imagining things to religion and philosophy  ah thats just where youre mistaken the woman who had caught on exclaimed science does nothing but imagine things  well not quite the light skirmisher mocked  she persisted unheeding first the suggestion from the mystical somewherethe same where probably that music and pictures and poetry come from then the hypothesis then the proof then the established fact established till some new scientist comes along and knocks it over  it would be very interesting if some one would proceed hypothetically concerning the soul and its immortality as the scientific people do in their inquiries concerning the origin of man electricity disease and the rest  yes the light skirmisher agreed why doesnt some fellow bet himself that he has an undying soul and then go on to accumulate the proofs the others seemed now to have touched bottom in the discussion and he launched a random inquiry upon the general silence bytheway i wonder why women are so much more anxious to live again than men as a general thing  because they dont feel one of them at table ventured that they have had a fair chance here  oh i thought maybe they felt that they hadnt had their say  is it quite certain the closest listener asked that they are more anxious to live again than men he looked round at the ladies present and at first none of them answered perhaps because they feared the men would think them weak if they owned to a greater longing than themselves for immortality  finally the woman who had caught on said i dont know whether its so or not and i dont think it matters but i dont mind saying that i long to live again i am not ashamed of it i dont think very much of myself but im interested in living thenshe dropped her voice a littlethere are some i should like to see again i have known peoplecharactersnaturesthat i cant believe are wasted and those that were dear to us and that we have lost  she stopped and the first speaker now looked at her with a compassion unalloyed by patronage and did not ask as he might what has all that to do with it  in fact a sympathetic silence possessed the whole company it was broken at last by the closest listeners saying after all i dont know that metchnikoffs book is so very blighting its certainly a very important book and it produces a reaction which may be wholesome or unwholesome as you choose to think and no matter what we believe we must respect the honesty of the scientific attitude in regard to a matter that has been too much abandoned to the emotions perhaps in all seriousness i wish some scientific man would apply the scientific method to finding out the soul as youhe turned to the light skirmishersuggest why shouldnt it be investigated  upon this invitation the light skirmisher tried to imagine some psychological experiments which should bear a certain analogy to those of the physicists but he failed to keep the level of his suggestion  as i said the closest listener remarked he produces a secondary state of revolt which is desirable for in that state we begin to inquire not only where we stand but where he stands  and what is your conclusion as to his place in the inquiry  that it isnt different from yours or mine really we all share the illusion of the race from the beginning that somehow our opinion of the matter affects its reality i should distinguish so far as to say that we think we believe and he thinks he knows for my own part i have the impression that he has helped my belief  the light skirmisher made a desperate effort to retrieve himself then a few more books like his would restore the age of faith     xxi  around a rainyday fire   a number of the easy chairs friends were sitting round the fire in the library of a countryhouse the room was large and full of a soft flattering light the fire was freshly kindled and flashed and crackled with a young vivacity letting its rays frolic over the serried bindings on the shelves the glazed pictures on the walls the cups of afterluncheon coffee in the hands of the people and the tall jugs and pots in the tray left standing on the library table it was summer but a cold rain was falling forbiddingly without no one else could come and no one could wish to go the conditions all favored a just selfesteem and a sense of providential preference in the accidental assemblage of those people at that time and place  the talk was rather naturally though not necessarily of books and one of the people was noting that children seemed to like short stories because their minds had not the strength to keep the facts of a whole book the effort tired them and they gave it up not because a book did not interest them but because it exhausted their little powers they were good for a leap or a dash or a short flight in literature even very high literature but they had not really the force for anything covering greater time and space  another declared this very suggestive and declared it in such a way that the whole company perceived he had something behind his words and besought him to say what he meant he did so as well as he could after protesting that it was not very novel or if so perhaps not very important and if it was important perhaps it was not true they said they would take the chances and then he said that it was merely a notion which had occurred to him at the moment concerning the new reading of the new reading public whether it might not be all juvenile literature adapted in mature terms to people of physical adolescence but of undeveloped thinking and feeling not really feebleminded youth but æsthetically and intellectually children who might presently grow into the power of enjoying and digesting food for men byandby they might gather fortitude for pleasure in real literature in fiction which should not be a travesty of the old fairytales or stories of adventures among giants and robbers and pirates or fables with human beings speaking from the motives and passions of animals he mentioned fiction he said because the new reading of the new reading public seemed to be nearly altogether fiction  all this had so much the effect of philosophical analysis that those comfortable people were lulled into selfapproving assent and putting themselves altogether apart from the new reading public they begged him to say what he meant he answered that there was nothing more phenomenal in the modern american life and he paid a pretty tribute to their ignorance in owning that he was not surprised they knew nothing of that public he promised that he would try to define it and he began by remarking that it seemed to be largely composed of the kind of persons who at the theatre audibly interpret the action to one another the present company must have heard them  his listeners again assented was the new reading public drawn from the theatregoing or more definitely speaking the matinée class  there was something odd there the philosopher returned the matinée class was as large as ever larger while the new reading public perfectly interchangeable with it in its intellectual pleasure and experiences had suddenly outnumbered it a thousandfold the popular novel and the popular play were so entirely of one fibre and texture and so easily convertible that a new novel was scarcely in every ones breadtrough before it was on the boards of all the theatres this led some to believe that we were experiencing a revival of the drama and that if we kept on having authors who sold half a million copies we could not help having a shakespeare byandby he must follow  one of those listening asked but how had these people begun so instantaneously to form themselves into this new innumerable reading public if they were of that quality of mind which requires the translation of an unmistakable meaning from the players to the playgoers they must find themselves helpless when grappling in solitude with the sense of a book why did not they go increasingly to the theatre instead of turning so overwhelmingly to the printed word  the philosopher replied that they had not now begun to do this but only seemed to have begun since there really was no beginning in anything the readers had always been in the immense majority because they could read anywhere and they could see plays only in the cities and towns if the theatre were universal undoubtedly they would prefer plays because a play makes far less draft upon the mental capacities or energies than the silliest book and what seemed their effort to interpret it to one another might very well be the exchange of their delight in it the books they preferred were of the nature of poor plays full of easy things to understand cheap common incidents obvious motives and vulgar passions such as had been used a thousand times over in literature they were fitted for the new reading public for this reason the constant repetition of the same characters events scenes plots gave their infantile minds the pleasure which children find in having a story told over and over in exactly the same terms the new reading public would rebel against any variance just as children do  the most of the company silently acquiesced or at least were silent but one of them made the speaker observe that he had not told them what this innumerable unreasoning multitude had read before the present plague of handsome empty foolish duodecimos had infested everybodys breadtrough  the philosopher said the actual interior form of nonliterary literature was an effect of the thin spread of our literary culture and outwardly was the effect of the thick spread of our material prosperity the dollarandahalf novel of today was the dime novel of yesterday in an avatar which left its essence unchanged it was even worse for it was less sincerely and forcibly written and it could not be so quickly worn out and thrown away its beauty of paper print and binding gave it a claim to regard which could not be ignored and established for it a sort of right to lie upon the table and then stand upon the shelf where it seemed to relate itself to genuine literature and to be of the same race and lineage as for this vast new reading public it was the vast old reading public with more means in its pocket of satisfying its crude childish taste its head was the same empty head  there was a sort of dreadful finality in this and for a while no one spoke then some one tried in vain to turn the subject while the philosopher smiled upon the desolation he had made and then one of that sex which when satisfied of the truth likes to have its sense of satisfaction ache through the increase of conviction asked him why the english reading public which must be so much more cultivated than our new reading public seemed to like the same sort of puerile effects in works of imagination the stirring incidents the wellworn plots the primitive passions and the robustious incentives he owned the fact but he contended that the fact though interesting was not so mysterious as it appeared at first sight it could be explained that the english had never taken the imagination very seriously and that in their dense close civilization packed tight with social political and material interests they asked of the imagination chiefly excitement and amusement they had not turned to it for edification or instruction for that thrill of solemn joy which comes of vital truth profoundly seen and clearly shown for this reason when all europe besides turned her face to the light some decades ago in the pages of the great prose poets who made the age illustrious england preferred the smoky links and dancing campfires which had pleased her immature fancy and kept herself well in the twilight of the old ideal of imagination as the mother of unrealities there could be no doubt the philosopher thought that the recrudescence which her best wits recognized as the effects of this perversity was the origin of the preposterous fiction which we now feed to the new reading public and which we think must somehow be right because it was hers and is ours and has the sanction of race and tradition  it was not he continued a thing to shed the tear of unavailing regret for though it was not a transitory phase or a state of transition for the condition that now existed had always existed the new reading public was larger than ever before not merely because there was a fresh demand for reading but because more people were lettered and moneyed and leisured and did not know what otherwise to do with themselves it was quite simple and the fact was less to be regretted in itself than for an indirect result which might be feared from it he paused at this in order to be asked what this result was and being promptly asked he went on  it was he said the degradation of authorship as a calling in the popular regard he owned that in the past authorship had enjoyed too much honor in the reverence and affection of the world not always indeed but at certain times as long as authors were the clients and dependents of the great they could not have been the objects of a general interest or honor they had then passed the stage when the simple poet or storyteller was wont to                          sit upon the ground    and tell sad stories of the deaths of kings  to wondering and admiring circles of simple listeners and they had not yet come to that hour of authorship when it reverted to the peasantry now turned people and threw itself upon the peoples generous acceptance and recognition for bread and fame but when that hour came it brought with it the honor of a reverent and persistent curiosity concerning literature and the literary life which the philosopher said he was afraid could not survive the actual superabundance of authors and the transformation of the novelist into the artisan there seemed he pursued a fixed formula for the manufacture of a work of fiction to be studied and practised like any other literature was degraded from an art to a poor sort of science in the practical application of which thousands were seen prospering for the immense output of our press represented the industry of hundreds and thousands a book was concocted according to a patent recipe advertised and sold like any other nostrum and perhaps the time was already here when it was no longer more creditable to be known as the author of a popular novel than as the author of a popular medicine a painkiller a soothing syrup a vegetable compound a horse liniment or a germicide was it possible he asked for a reader of the last book selling a hundred thousand copies to stand in the loving or thrilling awe of the author that we used to feel for longfellow and tennyson for emerson and carlyle for hawthorne and george eliot for irving and scott or for any of their great elders or youngers he repeated that perhaps authorship had worked its worshippers too hard but there was no doubt that their worship was a genuine devotion for at least a hundred and fifty years it had been eagerly offered in a full acceptance of the schiller superstition that at the sharing of the earth the poet representing authorship had been so much preoccupied with higher things that he had left the fleshpots and the loaves and fishes to others and was to be compensated with a share of the divine honors paid to jove himself from goethe to carlyle what a long roll of gods demigods and demisemigods it was it might have been bad for the deities and the philosopher rather thought it was but burning incense on the different shrines was an excellent thing for the votaries and kept them out of all sorts of mischiefs low pleasures and vain amusements whether that was really so or not the doubt remained whether authorship was not now a creed outworn did tender maids and virtuous matrons still cherish the hope of some day meeting their literary idols in the flesh did generous youth aspire to see them merely at a distance and did doting sires teach their children that it was an epochmaking event when a great poet or novelist visited the country or when they passed afar did they whip some favored boy as the father of benvenuto cellini whipped him at sight of a salamander in the fire that he might not forget the prodigy now that the earth had been divided over again and the poet in his actual guise of novelist had richly shared in its goods with the farmer the noble the merchant and the abbot was it necessary or even fair that he should be the guest of heaven in other words now that every successful author could keep his automobile did any one want his autograph  in the silence that fell upon the company at these words the ticking of the clock under its classic pediment on the mantel was painfully audible and had the effect of intimating that time now had its innings and eternity was altogether out of it several minutes seemed to pass before any one had the courage to ask whether the degradation of authorship was not partially the result of the stand taken by the naturalists in zola who scorned the name of art for his calling and aspired to that of science the hardy adventurer who suggested this possibility said that it was difficult to imagine the soul stirred to the same high passion by the botanist the astronomer the geologist the electrician or even the entomologist as in former times by the poet the humorist the novelist or the playwright if the fictionist of whatever sort had succeeded in identifying himself with the scientist he must leave the enjoyment of divine honors to the pianist the farcecomedian the portraitpainter the emotional actor and the architect who still deigned to practise an art  the philosopher smiled and owned that this was very interesting and opened up a fresh field of inquiry the first question there was whether the imaginative author were not rather to blame for not having gone far enough in the scientific direction in the right scientific fashion than for having taken that course at all the famous reproach of poetry made by huxley that it was mostly sensual caterwauling might well have given the singer pause in striking the sympathetic catgut of his lyre perhaps the strings were metallic but no matter the reproach had a justice in it that must have stung and made the lyrist wish to be an atomic theorist at any cost in fact at that very moment science had as it were caught the bread out of fictions mouth and usurped the highest functions of imagination in almost every direction of its recent advance it had made believe that such and such a thing was so and then proceeded to prove it to this method we owed not only the possession of our present happy abundance of microbes in every sort but our knowledge of the universe in almost every respect science no longer waited for the apple to fall before inferring a law of gravitation but went about with a stick knocking fruit off every bough in the hope that something suggestive would come of it on makebelieves of all kinds it based the edifices of all kinds of eternal veracities it behooved poetry or fiction which was radically the same to return to its earliest and simplest devices if it would find itself in the embrace of science and practise the makebeliefs of its infancy out of so many there were chances of some coming true if they were carried far enough and long enough in fact the hypothetical method of science had apparently been used in the art of advertising the works in which the appetite of the new reading public was flattered the publishers had hypothesized from the fact of a population of seventy millions the existence of an immense body of raw coarse minds untouched by taste or intelligence and boldly addressed the new fiction to it as in many suppositions of science their guess proved true  then why the hardy listener who had spoken before inquired was not makebelieve the right method for the author if it was the right method for the scientist and the publisher why should not the novelist hypothesize cases hitherto unknown to experience and then go on by persistent study to find them true it seemed to this inquirer that the mistake of fiction when it refused longer to be called an art and wished to be known as a science was in taking up the obsolescent scientific methods and in accumulating facts or human documents and deducing a case from them instead of boldly supposing a case as the new science did and then looking about for occurrences to verify it  the philosopher said exactly this was the very thing he was contending for the documents should be collected in support of the hypothesis the hypothesis should not be based on documents already collected first the inference then the fact was not that the new scientific way it looked like it and it seemed as if the favorite literature of the new reading public were quite in the spirit of the new science its bold events its prodigious characters its incredible motives were not they quite of the nature of the fearless conjecture which imagined long and short electric waves and then spread a mesh of wire to intercept them and seize their message  the hardy inquirer demanded then if so why despise the literature of the new reading public why despise the new reading public anyway  the philosopher responded that he despised nothing not even a thing so unphilosophical as modern science he merely wished his interpellant to observe again that the unification of the literary spirit and the scientific spirit was degrading the literary man to the level of the scientific man he thought this was bad for the small remnant of mankind who in default of their former idolatry might take to the worship of themselves now however bad a writer might be it was always well for the reader to believe him better than himself if we had not been brought up in this superstition what would have become of the classics of all tongues but for this what was to prevent the present company from making a clearance of threefourths of the surrounding shelves and feeding that dying flame on the hearth  at this the host who had been keeping himself in a modest abeyance came forward and put some sticks on the fire he said he would like to see any one touch his bindings which seemed to be his notion of books nobody minded him but one of those dutyolators who abound in a certain sex asked the philosopher what he thought we ought to do for the maintenance of authorworship among us  he answered he had not thought of that his mind had been fixed upon the fact of its decay but perhaps something could be done by looking up the author whose book had sold least during the season and asking him candidly whether he would not like to be paid the divine honors now going begging from one big seller to another for the decay of authorworship must be as much from the indifference of the authors as from the irreverence of the readers if such a lowselling author did not seem to regard it as rather invidious then pay him the divine honors it might be a wholesome and stimulating example but perhaps we should afterward have the demigod on our hands something might be safelier done by writing as with the present company and inquiring into the present condition of polite learning this would keep the sacred flame alive and give us the comfort of refined association in an exquisite moment of joy from the sense of our superiority to other people that after all was the great thing  the company drew a little closer round the fire the rain beat upon the panes and the wind swept the wet leaves against them while each exhaled a sigh of aspiration not unmixed with a soft regret     xxii  the advantages of quotational criticism   the talk round the easy chair one day was of that strange passion for reading which has of late possessed the public and the contagion or infection by which it has passed to hundreds of thousands who never read before and then the talk was of how this prodigious force might be controlled and turned in the right way not suffered to run to waste like water over the dam but directed into channels pouring upon wheels that turn the mills of the gods or something like that there were of course a great many words in fact talk is composed of words and the people at that luncheon were there for talking as well as eating and they did not mind how many words they used but the sum of their words was the hope after a due season of despair that the present passion for reading might be made to eventuate in more civilization than it seemed to be doing if it could be brought back to good literature supposing it was ever there in great strength and the question was how to do this  one of the company said he had lately been reading a good many books of leigh hunts and after everybody had interrupted with delightful perfectly charming and the like he went on to observe that one of the chief merits of hunt seemed to be his aptness in quotation that he remarked was almost a lost art with critics who had got to thinking that they could tell better what an author was than the author himself could like every other power disused the power of apt quotation had died and there were very few critics now who knew how to quote not one knew as hunt or lamb or hazlitt or the least of the great quotational school of critics knew these had perhaps overworked their gift and might have been justly accused as they certainly were accused of misleading the reader and making him think that the poets whose best they quoted putting the finest lines in italics so that they could not be missed were as good throughout as in the passages given it was this sense of having abused innocence or ignorance which led to the present reaction in criticism no doubt and yet the present reaction was an error suppose that the poets whose best was given by quotation were not altogether as good as that the critics never pretended they were they were merely showing how very good these poets could be and at the same time offering a delicate pleasure to the reader who could not complain that his digestion was overtaxed by the choice morsels if his pleasure in them prompted him to go to the entire poet quoted in the hope of rioting gluttonously upon him the reader was rightly served in one sense in another he was certainly not misserved or his time wasted it would be hard for him to prove that he could have employed it more profitably  everybody more or less now sat up and he who had the eye and ear of the table went on to remark that he had not meant to make a defence of the extinct school of quotational criticism what he really meant to do was to suggest a way out of the present situation in which the new multitude of voracious readers were grossly feeding upon such intellectual husks as swine would not eat and imagining themselves nourished by their fodder there might be some person present who could improve upon his suggestion but his notion as he conceived it was that something might be done in the line of quotational criticism to restore the great poets to the public favor for he understood that good authors were now proportionately less read than they once were he thought that a pity and the rest of the company joined in asking him how he proposed to employ the quotational method for his purpose  in answering he said that he would not go outside of the english classics and he would for the present deal only with the greatest of these he took it for granted that those listening were all agreed that mankind would be advantaged in their minds or manners by a more or less familiar acquaintance with chaucer spenser shakespeare milton dryden pope cowper burns byron wordsworth coleridge shelley keats tennyson and browning he himself did not mind adding scott to the list whose poetry he found much better than his prose to bring about an acquaintance which might very profitably ripen into intimacy he would have each of these poets treated in the whole measure of his work as many or most of them had been topically or partially treated by the quotational critics some one here made him observe that he was laying out rather a large piece of work and to this he answered not at all the work had been already done asked then somewhat derisively why it need be done over again he explained with a modesty and patience which restored him to the regard he had lost by the derision all had impartially united in it that though the work had already been done there needed some slight additions to it which would easily fit it to his purpose he was not thinking of going in for one of those dreadful series of books which seemed the dismay alike of publisher and reader and required rewriting of matter more than enough rewritten in fact he said that for his purpose the writing was done fully and probably better than it could be done again and it was only the reading and quoting that demanded editorial attention  another said he did not see how that could be and the inventor of the brave scheme which was still in petto said that he would try to show him we had he contended only too great riches in the criticisms of the poets open to our choice but suppose we took spenser and let lowell introduce him to us there would be needed a very brief biographical note and then some able hand to intersperse the criticism with passages from spenser or with amplifications of the existing quotations such as would give a full notion of the poets scope and quality the story of each of his poems could be given in a few words where the poems themselves could not be given even in part and with the constant help of the critic the reader could be possessed of a luminous idea of the poet such as he probably could not get by going to him direct though this was not to be deprecated but encouraged after the preparatory acquaintance the explanatory and illustrative passages could be interpolated in the text of the criticism without interrupting the critic and something for spenser might thus be done on the scale of what addison did for milton it was known how those successive papers in the spectator had rehabilitated one of the greatest english poets or rather rehabilitated the english public and restored the poet and the public to each other they formed almost an ideal body of criticism and if they did not embody all that the reader need know of milton they embodied so much that he could no longer feel himself ignorant of milton in fact they possessed him of a high degree of miltonian culture which was what one wanted to have with respect to any poet they might be extended with still greater quotation and if something more yet were needed the essay on milton which made macaulays reputation might be employed as a vessel to catch the overrunnings of the precious ichor  who could not wish to know the poetry of keats as we already knew his life through the matchless essay of lowell that might be filled out with the most striking passages of his poetry simply let in at appropriate places without breaking the flow of that high discourse and forming a rich accompaniment which could leave no reader unpleasured or uninstructed the passages given from the poet need not be relevant to the text of the critic they might be quite irrelevant and serve the imaginable end still better for instance some passages might be given in the teeth of the critic and made to gainsay what he had been saying this would probably send the reader if he was very much perplexed to the poet himself which was the imaginable end he might be disappointed one way or he might be disappointed the other way but in the mean while he would have passed his time and he would have instructed if he had not amused himself  it would be very interesting to take such a criticism as that of lowell on dryden and give not only the fine things from him but the things that counted for the critic in his interesting contention that dryden failed of being a prime poet because of the great weight of prose in him and very good prose or as the critic charmingly put it he had wings that helped him run along the ground but did not enable him to fly it would be most valuable for us to see how dryden was a great literary man but not one of the greatest poets and yet must be ranked as a great poet if the balance inclined now toward this opinion and now against it very possibly the reader would find himself impelled to turn to the poets work and again the imaginable end would be served  a listener here asked why the talker went chiefly to lowell for the illustration of his theory and was frankly answered for the same reason that he had first alluded to leigh hunt because he had lately been reading him it was not because he had not read any other criticism or not that he entirely admired lowells in fact he often found fault with that lowell was too much a poet to be a perfect critic he was no more the greatest sort of critic than dryden was the greatest sort of poet to turn his figure round he had wings that lifted him into the air when he ought to be running along the ground  the company laughed civilly at this piece of luck and then they asked civilly still if leigh hunt had not done for a great many poets just what he was proposing to have done what about the treatment of the poets and the quotations from them in the volumes on wit and humor imagination and fancy a jar of honey from mount hybla and the rest the talker owned that there was a great deal about these which was to his purpose but upon the whole the criticism was too desultory and fragmentary and the quotation was illustrative rather than representative and so far it was illusory he had a notion that hunts stories from the italian poets were rather more in the line he would have followed but he had not read these since he was a boy and he was not prepared to answer for them  one of the company said that she had read those italian poets in leigh hunts version of them when she was a girl and it had had the effect of making her think she had read the poets themselves and she had not since read directly dante petrarch ariosto or tasso she regarded that as an irreparable injury and she doubted whether if the great english poets could be introduced in that manner very many people would pursue their acquaintance for themselves they would think they were familiar with them already  yes the talker assented if that were the scheme but it was not or at least it was only part of the scheme the scheme was to give the everincreasing multitude of readers a chance to know something of the best literature if they chose to pursue the acquaintance very good if they chose not to pursue the acquaintance still very good they could not have made it at all without being somewhat refined and enlightened he felt very much about it as he felt about seeing europe which some people left unseen because they could not give all the time to it they would like he always said to such people go if they could only be gone a month a day in rome or london or paris was a treasure such as a lifetime at home could not lay up an hour of venice or florence was precious a moment of milan or verona of siena or mantua was beyond price so you could not know a great poet so little as not to be enriched by him a look from a beautiful woman or a witty word from a wise one distinguished and embellished the life into which it fell so that it could never afterward be so common as it was before  why it was asked from a silence in which all the ladies tried to think whether the speaker had her in mind or not and whether he ought really to be so personal why could not mr morleys english men of letters series be used to carry out the scheme proposed and its proposer said he had nothing to say against that except perhaps that the frames might be too much for the pictures he would rather choose a critical essay as he had intimated for the frame of each picture in this sort of thing we had an endless choice both new and old if he had any preference it would be for the olderfashioned critics like hazlitt or perhaps like de quincey he was not sure speaking without the book whether de quincey treated authors so much as topics but he had the sense of wonderful things in him about the eighteenthcentury poets things that made you think you knew them and that yet made you burn to be on the same intimate terms with them as de quincey himself  his method of knowing the poets through the critics the sympathetic critics who were the only real critics would have the advantage of acquainting the reader with the critics as well as the poets the critics got a good deal of ingratitude from the reader generally and perhaps in their character of mere reviewers they got no more than they merited but in their friendly function of ushers to the good things even the best things in the authors they were studying they had a claim upon him which he could not requite too generously they acted the part of real friends and in the high company where the reader found himself strange and alone they hospitably made him at home above all other kinds of writers they made one feel that he was uttering the good things they said of course for the young reader there was the danger of his continuing always to think their thoughts in their terms but there were also great chances that he would begin byandby to think his own thoughts in terms of his own  the more quotational the critics were the better for himself the speaker said that he liked that old custom of printing the very finest things in italics when it came to citing corroborative passages it had not only the charm of the rococo the pathos of a bygone fashion but it was of the greatest use no one is the worse for having a great beauty pointed out in the author one is reading or reading from sometimes one does not see the given beauty at first and then he has the pleasure of puzzling it out sometimes he never sees it and then his life is sublimed with an insoluble conundrum sometimes still he sees what the critic means and disagrees with him in this case he is not likely to go to the end of his journey without finding a critic whom he agrees with about the passage in question  after all however it was asked by one that had not spoken before with that fine air of saying a novel thing which people put on who have not spoken before would not the superficial knowledge of the poets imparted by quotational criticism result in a sort of pseudoculture which would be rather worse than nothing a kind of intellectual plated ware or æsthetic nearsilk  the talker said he thought not and that he had already touched upon some such point in what he had said about going to europe for a few months he offered the opinion that there was no such thing as pseudoculture there was culture or there was not and the reader of a quotational criticism if he enjoyed the quotations became so far cultivated it could not be said that he knew the poets treated of but neither could it be said that he was quite ignorant of them as a matter of fact he did know them in a fashion through a mind larger and clearer than his own  for this reason the talker favored the reading of criticism especially the kind of criticism that quoted he would even go so far as to say that there was no just and honest criticism without quotation the critic was bound to make out his case or else abdicate his function and he could not make out his case either for or against an author without calling him to testify therefore he was in favor of quotational criticism for fairness sake as well as for his pleasure and it was for the extension of it that he now contended he was not sure that he wished to send the reader to the authors quoted in all cases the reader could get through the passages cited a pretty good notion of the authors quality and as for their quantity that was often made up of commonplaces or worse in the case of the old poets and most of the english classics there was a great deal of filth which the reader would be better for not taking into his mind and which the most copiously quotational critics would hardly offer him if any one said that without the filth one could not get a fair idea of those authors he should be disposed to distinguish and to say that without the filth one could not get a fair idea of their age but of themselves yes their beauty and their greatness were personal to them even their dulness might be so but their foulness was what had come off on them from living at periods when manners were foul     xxiii  reading for a grandfather   a young girl much respected by the easy chair who had always had the real good of her grandfather at heart wished to make him a christmas present befitting his years and agreeable to his tastes she thought only to dismiss them for their banality of a box of the finest cigars of a soft flannel dressinggown a bath robe of turkish towelling embroidered by herself of a velvet jacket and of a pair of house shoes she decided against some of these things because he did not smoke because he never took off his walking coat and shoes till he went to bed and because he had an old bath robe made him by her grandmother very short and very scant according to her notion at the chance moments when she had surprised him in it from which neither love nor money could part him the others she rejected for the reason already assigned little or nothing remained then but to give him books and she was glad that she was forced to this conclusion because when she reflected she realized that his reading seemed to be very much neglected or at least without any lift of imagination or any quality of modernity in it as far as she had observed he read the same old things over and over again and did not know at all what was now going on in the great world of literature she herself was a famous reader and an authority about books with other girls and with the young men who asked her across the afternoon teacups whether she had seen this or that new book and scrabbled round in choosing between cream and lemon to hide the fact that they had not seen it themselves she was therefore exactly the person to select a little library of the latest reading for an old gentleman who was so behind the times as her grandfather but before she plunged into the mad vortex of new publications she thought she would delicately find out his preferences or if he had none would try to inspire him with a curiosity concerning these or those new books  now grandfather she began you know i always give you a christmas present  yes my dear the old gentleman patiently assented i know you do you are very thoughtful  not at all if there is anything i hate it is being thoughtful what i like is being spontaneous  well then my dear i dont mind saying you are very spontaneous  and i detest surprises if any one wishes to make a lasting enemy of me let him surprise me so i am going to tell you now what i am going to give you do you like that  i like everything you do my child  well this time you will like it better than ever i am going to give you books and in order not to disappoint you by giving you books that you have read before i want to catechise you a little shall you mind it  oh no but im afraid you wont find me very frank  i shall make you be if you are not frank there is no fun in not surprising you or in not giving you books that you have read  there is something in that her grandfather assented but now instead of finding out what i have read or what i like why not tell me what i ought to read and to like i think i have seen a vast deal of advice to girls about their reading why shouldnt the girls turn the tables and advise their elders i often feel the need of advice from girls on all sorts of subjects and you would find me very grateful i believe  the girls eyes sparkled and then softened toward this docile ancestor do you really mean it grandfather it would be fun if you did  but i should want it to be serious my dear i should be glad if your good counsel could include the whole conduct of life for i am sensible sometimes of a tendency to be silly and wicked which i am sure you could help me to combat  oh grandfather said the girl tenderly you know that isnt true  well admit for the sake of argument that it isnt my difficulty in regard to reading remains and there you certainly could help me at moments it seems to me that i have come to the end of my line  the old gentlemans voice fell and she could no longer suspect him of joking so she began why what have you been reading last  well my dear i have been looking into the spectator a little  the london spectator jim says they have it at the club and he swears by it but i mean what books and thats a weekly newspaper or a kind of review isnt it  the spectator i mean was a london newspaper and it was a kind of review but it was a daily is it possible that youve never heard of it the young girl shook her head thoughtfully regretfully but upon the whole not anxiously she was not afraid that any important thing in literature had escaped her but youve heard of addison and steele and pope and swift  oh yes we had them at school when we were reading henry esmond they all came into that and i remember now colonel esmond wrote a number of the spectator for a surprise to beatrix but i thought it was all a makeup  and you dont know about sir roger de coverley  of course i do its what the english call the virginia reel but why do you ask i thought we were talking about your reading i dont see how you could get an old file of a daily newspaper but if it amuses you is it so amusing  its charming but after one has read it as often as i have one begins to know it a little too well  yes and what else have you been reading  well leigh hunt a little lately he continues the old essayist tradition and he is gently delightful  never heard of him the girl frankly declared  he was a poet too and he wrote the story of riminiabout paolo and francesca you know  oh there youre away off grandfather mr philips wrote about them and that horrid dannunzio why duse gave dannunzios play last winter what are you thinking of  perhaps i am wandering a little the grandfather meekly submitted and the girl had to make him go on  do you read poetry a great deal she asked and she thought if his taste was mainly for poetry it would simplify the difficulty of choosing the books for her present  well im rather returning to it ive been looking into crabbe of late and i have found him full of a quaint charm  crabbe i never heard of him she owned as boldly as before for if he had been worth hearing of she knew that she would have heard of him dont you like kipling  yes when he is not noisy i think i prefer william watson among your very modern moderns  why is he living yet i thought he wrote ten or fifteen years ago you dont call him modern you like stevenson dont you hes a great stylist everybody says he is and so is george meredith you must like him  hes a great intellect but a little of him goes almost as long a way as a little of browning i think i prefer henry james  oh yes hes just coming up hes the one that has distinction but the people who write like him are a great deal more popular they have all his distinction and they dont tax your mind so much but dont lets get off on novelists or theres no end to it who are really your favorite poets  well i read shakespeare rather often and i read dante by fits and starts and i do not mind milton from time to time i like wordsworth and i like keats a great deal better every now and then i take up cowper with pleasure and i have found myself going back to pope with real relish and byron yes byron but i shouldnt advise your reading don juan  thats an opera isnt it what they call don giovanni i never heard of any such poem  that shows how careful you have been of your reading  oh we read everything nowadaysif its up to date and if don juan had been you may be sure i would have heard of it i suppose you like tennyson and longfellow and emerson and those old poets  are they old they used to be so new yes i like them and i like whittier and some things of bryants  at the last two names the girl looked vague but she said oh yes i suppose so and i suppose you like the old dramatists  some of themmarlowe and beaumont and fletcher a few of their plays but i cant stand most of the elizabethans i cant stand ben jonson at all  oh yesrasselas i cant stand him either grandfather im quite with you about ben jonson too much johnson you know  the grandfather looked rather blank too different johnsons i think my dear but perhaps you didnt mean the elizabethans perhaps you mean the dramatists of the other johnsons time well i like sheridan pretty well though his wit strikes me as mechanical and i really prefer goldsmith in his case i prefer his vicar of wakefield and his poems to his plays plays are not very easy reading unless they are the very best shakespeares are the only plays that one wants to read  the young girl held up her charming chin with the air of keeping it above water too deep for her and ibsen she suggested i hope you despise ibsen as much as i do hes clear gone out now thank goodness dont you think ghosts was horrid  its dreadful my dear but i shouldnt say it was horrid no i dont despise ibsen and i have found mr pineros plays good reading  oh the girl said getting her foot on the ground the gay lord quex miss vanbrugh was great in that but now dont get off on the theatre grandfather or there will be no end to it which of the old old poetsbefore burns or shelley evendo you like  well when i was a boy i read chaucer and liked him very much and the other day when i was looking over leigh hunts essays i found a number of them about chaucer with long wellchosen extracts and i dont know when ive found greater pleasure in poetry if i must have a favorite among the old poets i will take chaucer of course spenser is rather more modern  yes but i cant bear his agnosticism can you and i hate metaphysics anyway  the grandfather looked bewildered then he said now im afraid we are getting too much spenser  the girl went off at a tangent dont you just love mr gillette in sherlock holmes theres a play i should think you would like to read they say theres a novel been made out of it i wish i could get hold of it for you well go on grandfather  no my dear its for you to go on but dont you think youve catechised me sufficiently about my reading you must find it very oldfashioned  no not at all i like old things myself the girls are always laughing at me because i read george eliot and dickens and thackeray and charles reade and wilkie collins and those back numbers but i should say if i said anything that you were rather deficient in fiction grandfather you seem to have read everything but novels  is that so i was afraid i had read nothing but novels i  tell me what novels you have read she broke in upon him imperatively the ones you consider the greatest  the grandfather had to think it is rather a long listso long that im ashamed of it perhaps id better mention only the very greatest like don quixote and gil blas and wilhelm meister and the vicar of wakefield and clarissa harlowe and emma and pride and prejudice and the bride of lammermoor and i promessi sposi and belinda and frankenstein and chartreuse de parme and césar birotteau and the last days of pompeii and david copperfield and pendennis and the scarlet letter and blithedale romance and the cloister and the hearth and middlemarch and smoke and fathers and sons and a nest of nobles and war and peace and anna karénina and resurrection and dona perfecta and marta y maria and i malavoglia and the return of the native and lassomoir and madame bovary and the awkward age and the grandissimesand most of the other books of the same authors of course ive read many more perhaps as great as these that i cant think of at the moment  the young girl listened in a vain effort to follow her agile ancestor in and out of the labyrinths of his favorite fiction most of which she did not recognize by the names he gave and some of which she believed to be very shocking in a vague association of it with deeply moralized denunciatory criticisms which she had read of the books or the authors upon the whole she was rather pained by the confession which his reading formed for her grandfather and she felt more than ever the necessity of undertaking his education or at least his reform in respect to it she was glad now that she had decided to give him books for a christmas present for there was no time like christmas for good resolutions and if her grandfather was ever going to turn over a new leaf this was the very hour to help him do it  she smiled very sweetly upon him so as not to alarm him too much and said she had never been so much interested as in knowing what books he really liked but as he had read all those he named  oh dozens of times he broke in  then perhaps he would leave it to her to choose an entirely new list for him so that he could have something freshly entertaining she did not like to say more edifying for fear of hurting his feelings and taking his silence for consent she went up and kissed him on his bald head and ran away to take the matter under immediate advisement her notion then was to look over several lists of the worlds best hundred books which she had been keeping by her but when she came to compare them she found that they contained most of the books he had mentioned besides many others it would never do to give him any one of these libraries of the best hundred books for this reason and for the reason that a hundred books would cost more of her grandfathers money than she felt justified in spending on him at a season when she had to make so many other presents  just when she was at her wits end a sudden inspiration seized her she pinned on her hat and put on her new winter jacket and went out and bought the last number of the bookworm at the end of this periodical she had often got suggestions for her own reading and she was sure that she should find there the means of helping her poor grandfather to a better taste in literature than he seemed to have so she took the different letters from chicago san francisco denver cincinnati new orleans cleveland buffalo boston philadelphia and uptown and downtown in new york giving the bestselling books of the month in all those places and compiled an eclectic list from them which she gave to her bookseller with orders to get them as nearly of the same sizes and colors as possible he followed her instructions with a great deal of taste and allowed her twentyfive per cent off which she applied toward a weddingpresent she would have to give shortly in this way she was able to provide her grandfather for the new year with reading that everybody was talking about and that brought him up to date with a round turn     xxiv  some moments with the muse   among the many letters which the easy chair has received after its conference on the state of poetry one of most decided note was from a writer confessing herself of the contraryminded i love some children but not childhood in general merely because it is childhood so i love some poems rather than poetry in general just because it is poetry i object to the tinkle i object to the poetic license which performs a germanic divorce between subject and verb so that instead of a complete thought which can be mastered before another is set before the brain there is a twist in the grammatical sequence that requires a conscious effort of will to keep the original thread the world is too busy to do this reading must be a relaxation not a study when poetry conforms in its mental tone to the spirit of the times when it reflects the life and more or less the common thought of the day then more of the common people will read it  there were other things in this letter which seemed to us of so much importance that we submitted it as a whole to a womans club of our acquaintance the nine ladies composing the club were not all literary but they were all of æsthetic pursuits and together they brought a good deal of culture to bear on the main points of the letter they were not quite of one mind but they were so far agreed that what they had to say might be fairly regarded as a consensus of opinion we will not attempt to report their remarks at any lengththey ran to all lengthsbut in offering a résumé of what they variously said to a sole effect we will do what we can to further the cause they joined in defending  the musesfor we will no longer conceal that this womans club was composed of the tuneful nineacknowledged that there was a great deal in what their contraryminded sister said they did not blame her one bit for the way she felt they would have felt just so themselves in her place but being as it were professionally dedicated to the beautiful in all its established forms they thought themselves bound to direct her attention to one or two aspects of the case which she had apparently overlooked they were only sorry that she was not there to take her own part and they confessed in her behalf that it was ridiculous for poetry to turn the language upside down and to take it apart and put it together wrongend to as it did if anybody spoke the language so or in prose wrote it so they would certainly be a fool but the muses wished the sister to observe that every art existed by its convention or by what in the moral world ibsen would call its lifelie if you looked at it from the colloquial standpoint music was the absurdest thing in the world in the orchestral part of an opera for instance there were more repetitions than in the scolding of the worst kind of shrew and if you were to go about singing what you had to say and singing it over and over and stretching it out by runs and trills or even expressing yourself in recitativo secco it would simply set people wild in painting it was worse if anything you had to make believe that things two inches high were lifesize and that there were relief and distance where there was nothing but a flat canvas and that colors which were really like nothing in nature were natural as for sculpture it was too laughable for anything whether you took it in basreliefs with persons stuck onto walls half or threequarters out or in groups with people in eternal action or in single figures standing on one leg or holding out arms that would drop off if they were not supported by stone pegs or sitting down outdoors bareheaded where they would take their deaths of cold or get sunstruck or lay up rheumatism to beat the band in the rain and snow and often without a stitch of clothes on  all this and more the muses freely conceded to the position of the contraryminded correspondent of the easy chair and having behaved so handsomely they felt justified in adding that her demand seemed to them perfectly preposterous it was the very essence and office of poetry not to conform to the mental tone and spirit of the times and though it might very well reflect the life it must not reflect the common thought of the day upon pain of vulgarizing and annulling itself poetry was static in its nature and its business was the interpretation of enduring beauty and eternal veracity if it stooped in submission to any such expectation as that expressed and dedicated itself to the crude vaticination of the transitory emotions and opinions it had better turn journalism at once it had its law and its law was distinction of ideal and elevation of tendency no matter what material it dealt with it might deal with the commonest the cheapest material but always in such a way as to dignify and beautify the material  concerning the first point that modern poetry was wrong to indulge all those inversions those translocations those ground and lofty syntactical tumblings which have mainly constituted poetic license the ladies again relented and allowed that there was much to say for what our correspondent said in fact they agreed or agreed as nearly as nine ladies could that it was perhaps time that poetry should as it certainly might write itself straightforwardly with the verb in its true english place and the adjective walking soberly before the noun shunning those silly elisions like neer and oer and above all avoiding the weak and loathly omission of the definite article of the tinkle by which they supposed the contraryminded sister meant the rhyme they said they could very well remember when there was no such thing in poetry their native greek had got on perfectly well without it and even those poets at secondhand the romans they observed that though dante used it shakespeare did not and milton did not in their greatest works and a good half of the time the firstrate moderns managed very well with blank verse  the easy chair did not like to dissent from these ladies both because they were really great authorities and because it is always best to agree with ladies when you can besides it would not have seemed quite the thing when they were inclining to this favorable view of their sisters contrarymindedness to take sides against her in short the easy chair reserved its misgivings for some such very intimate occasion as this when it could impart them without wounding the susceptibilities of others or risking a painful snub for itself but it appeared to the chair that the muses did not go quite far enough in justifying the convention or the lifelie by which poetry as a form existed they could easily have proved that much of the mystical charm which differences poetry from prose resides in its license its syntactical acrobatics its affectations of diction its elisions its rhymes as a man inverting his head and looking at the landscape between his legs gets an entirely new effect on the familiar prospect so literature forsaking the wonted grammatical attitudes really achieves something richly strange by the novel and surprising postures permissible in verse the phrases the lines the stanzas which the ear keeps lingering in its porches loath to let them depart are usually full of these licenses they have a witchery which could be as little proved as denied and when any poet proposes to forego them and adhere rigidly to the law of prose in his rhythm he practises a loyalty which is a sort of treason to his calling and will go far toward undoing him  while the ladies of that club were talking some such thoughts as these were in our mind suggested by summerlong reading of a dear delightful poet altogether neglected in these days who deserves to be known again wherever reality is prized or simplicity is loved it is proof indeed how shallow was all the debate about realism and romanticism that the poetic tales of george crabbe were never once alleged in witness of the charm which truth to condition and character has in whatever form but once long before that ineffectual clamor arose he was valued as he should be still edmund burke was the first to understand his purpose and appreciate his work he helped the poet not only with praises but with pounds till he could get upon his feet he introduced crabbes verse to his great friends to doctor johnson who perceived at once that he would go far to sir joshua reynolds who felt the brotherartist in him to the lord chancellor thurlow whose oaths were harder than his heart toward the fearlessy fearful young singer the sympathy and admiration of the highest and the best followed him through his long life to his death the great mr fox loved him and his rhyme and wished his tales to be read to him on the bed he never left alive earl grey lord holland and the brilliant canning wrote him letters of cordial acclaim walter scott the generous the magnanimous hailed him brother and would always have his books by him none of his poems appeared without the warmest welcome the most discriminating and applausive criticism from jeffrey the first critic of his long day  crabbe had not only this exquisitely intelligent hearing but he was accepted on his own terms as a poet who saw so much beauty in simple and common life that he could not help painting it he painted it in pieces of matchless fidelity to the fact with nothing of flattery but everything of charm in the likeness his work is the enduring witness of persons circumstances customs experiences utterly passed from the actual world but recognizably true with every sincere reader these tales of village life in england a hundred years ago are of an absolute directness and frankness they blink nothing of the sordid the mean the vicious the wicked in that life from which they rarely rise in some glimpse of the state of the neighboring gentry and yet they abound in beauty that consoles and encourages they are full of keen analysis sly wit kindly humor and of a satire too conscientious to bear the name of pathos of compassion of reverence while in unaffected singleness of ideal they are unsurpassed  will our contraryminded correspondent believe that these studies these finished pictures which so perfectly reflect the common life  of the day are full of the license the tinkle the german divorce of verb and subject the twisted grammatical sequence which her soul abhors in verse crabbe chose for his vehicle the heroic couplet in which english poetry had jogtrotted ever since the time of pope as it often had before and he made it go as like popes couplet as he could with the same cæsura the same antithetical balance the same feats of rhetoric the same inversions and the same closes of the sense in each couplet the most artificial and the most natural poets were at one in their literary convention yet such was the freshness of crabbes impulse such his divine authority to deal with material unemployed in english poetry before that you forget all the affectations of the outward convention or remember them only for a pleasure in the quaintness of their use for his purposes how imperishable anyway is the interest of things important to the spirit the fancy and how largely does this interest lie in the freshness of the mind bringing itself to the things how little in the novelty of the things the demand for strangeness in the things themselves is the demand of the sophisticated mind the mind which has lost its simplicity in the process of continuing unenlightened it is this demand which betrays the mediocre mind of the anglosaxon race the sophistication of the english mind and the obfuscation which is sophistication at secondhand of the american mind the nonimaginative person is nowhere so much at home as in a voluntary exile and this may be why it was sometime said that travel is the fools paradise for such a person to realize anything the terms are that he shall go abroad either into an alien scene or into a period of the past then he can begin to have some pleasure he must first of all get away from himself and he is not to be blamed for that any one else would wish to get away from him his exaction is not a test of merit it is merely the clew to a psychological situation which is neither so novel nor so important as to require of our hardworked civilization the production of an order of more inspired criticism than it has worried along with hitherto     xxv  a normal hero and heroine out of work   they sat together on a bench in the park far enough apart to distinguish themselves from the many other pairs who were but too obviously lovers it could not be said quite that these two were actually lovers but there was an air of passionate provisionality over and around them a light such as in springtime seems to enfold the tree before it takes the positive color of bud or blossom and with an eye for literary material that had rarely failed him he of the easy chair perceived that they were a hero and heroine of a kind which he instantly felt it a great pity he should not have met oftener in fiction of late as he looked at them he was more and more penetrated by a delicate pathos in the fact that such as he saw them they belonged in their fine sort to the great host of the unemployed no one else might have seen it but he saw with that inner eye of his which compassion suffused but did not obscure that they were out of a job and he was not surprised when he heard the young girl fetch a muted sigh and then say no they dont want us any more i dont understand why it is very strange but it is perfectly certain  yes theres no doubt of that the young man returned in a despair tinged with resentment  she was very pretty and he was handsome and they were both tastefully dressed with a due deference to fashion yet with a personal qualification of the cut and color of their clothes which if it promised more than it could fulfil in some ways implied a modest selfrespect better than the arrogance of great social success or worldly splendor she could have been the only daughter of a widowed father in moderate circumstances or an orphan brought up by a careful aunt or a duteous sister in a large family of girls with whom she shared the shelter of a wisely ordered if somewhat crowded home or she could have been a serious student of any of the various arts and sciences which girls study now in an independence compatible with true beauty of behavior he might have been a young lawyer or doctor or business man or a painter or architect or a professor in some college or a minister in charge of his first parish what struck the observer in them and pleased him was that they seemed of that finer american average which is the best and rightly seen the most interesting phase of civilized life yet known  i sometimes think the girl resumed in the silence of her companion that i made a mistake in my origin or my early education its a great disadvantage in fiction nowadays for a girl to speak grammatically as i always do without any trace of accent or dialect of course if i had been highborn or lowborn in the olden times somewhere or other i shouldnt have to be looking for a place now or if i had been unhappily married or divorced or merely separated from my husband the storywriters would have had some use for me but i have tried always to be good and nice and ladylike and i havent been in a short story for ages  is it so bad as that the young man asked sadly  quite if i could only have had something askew in my heredity i know lots of authoresses who would have jumped at me i cant do anything wildly adventurous in the middle ages or the revolutionary period because im so afraid but i know that in the course of modern life ive always been fairly equal to emergencies and i dont believe that i should fail in case of trouble or that if it came to poverty i should be ashamed to share the deprivations that fell to my lot i dont think im very selfish i would be willing to stay in town all summer if an author wanted me and i know i could make it interesting for his readers i could marry an english nobleman if it was really necessary and if i didnt like to live in england because i was fond of my own country i believe i could get him to stay here half the time with me and that would appeal to a large class i dont know whether i would care to be rescued a great deal it would depend upon what it was from but i could stand a great deal of pain if need be and i hope that if it came to anything like right or wrong i should act conscientiously in society i shouldnt mind any amount of dancing or dining or teaing and i should be willing to take my part in the lighter athletics but she ended as she began with a sigh im not wanted  yes i see what you mean the young man said with a thoughtful knot between his brows im not wanted myself at present in the short stories but in the last dozen or so where i had an engagement i certainly didnt meet you and it is pleasant to be paired off in a story with a heroine who has the instincts and habits of a lady of course a hero is only something in an authors fancy and ive no right to be exacting but it does go against me to love a girl who ropes cattle or a woman who has a past or a husband or something of the kind i always do my best for the author but i cant forget that im a gentleman and its difficult to win a heroine when the very idea of her makes you shudder i sometimes wonder how the authors would like it themselves if they had to do what they expect of us in that way theyre generally very decent fellows good husbands and fathers who have married ladylike girls and wouldnt think of associating with a shady or ignorant person  the authoresses are quite as inconsistent the professional heroine rejoined they wouldnt speak to the kind of young men whom they expect a heroine to be passionately in love with they must know how very oddly a girl feels about people who are outside of the world shes been brought up in it isnt enough that a man should be very noble at heart and do grand things or save your life every now and then or be masterful and use his giant will to make you in love with him i dont see why they cant let one have now and then the kind of husbands they get for themselves for my part i should like always to give my heart to a normal sensible wellbred conscientious agreeable man who could offer me a pleasant homei wouldnt mind the suburbs and i could work with him and work for him till i droppedthe kind of man that the real world seems to be so full of ive never had a fair chance to show what was in me ive always been placed in such a false position now i have no position at all not even a false one  her companion was silent for a while then he said yes they all seem authors and authoresses both to lose sight of the fact that the constitution of our society is more picturesque more dramatic more poetical than any in the world we can have the play of all the passions and emotions in ordinary innocent lovemaking that other peoples can have only on the worst conditions and yet the storywriters wont avail themselves of the beauty that lies next to their hands they go abroad for impossible circumstances or they want to bewitch ours with the chemistry of all sorts of eccentric characters exaggerated incentives morbid propensities pathological conditions or diseased psychology as i said before i know im only a creature of the storytellers fancy and a creature out of work at that but i believe i was imagined in a good momentim sure you wereand i should like an engagement in an honest wholesome situation i think i could do creditable work in it  i know you could the heroine rejoined fervently almost tenderly so that it seemed to the listener there was an involuntary rapprochement of their shadowy substances on the bench where they floated in a sitting posture i dont want to be greedy i believe in living and letting live i think the abnormal has just as good a right to be in the stories as the normal but why shut the normal out altogether what i should like to ask the shortstory writers is whether they and their readers are so bored with themselves and the people they know in the real world that they have no use for anything like its average in their fiction its impossible for us to change  i shouldnt wish you to change the hero said so fondly that the witness trembled for something more demonstrative  thank you but what i mean is couldnt they change a little couldnt they give us another trial theyve been using the abnormal in some shape or other so long that i should think they would find a hero and heroine who simply fell in love at a dance or a dinner or in a houseparty or at a picnic and worked out their characters to each other through the natural worry and difficulty and pleasure and happiness till they got marrieda relief from well the other thing im sure if they offered me the chance i could make myself attractive to their readers and i believe i should have the charm of novelty  you would have more than the charm of novelty the hero said and the witness trembled again for the convenances which one so often sees offended on the benches in the park but then he remembered that these young people were avowedly nice and that they were morally incapable of misbehavior and for a time at least i believe youi believe we for i must necessarily be engaged with youwould succeed the difficulty would be to get the notion of our employment to the authors it was on the listeners tongue to say that he thought he could manage that when the hero arrested him with the sad misgiving but they would say we were commonplace and that would kill the chance of our ever having a run  a tremendous longing filled the witness a potent desire to rescue this engaging pair from the dismay into which they fell at the fatal word no no he conjured them not commonplace a judicious paragraph anticipative of your reappearance could be arranged in which you could be hailed as the normal hero and heroine and greeted as a grateful relief from the hackneyed freaks and deformities of the prevalent short story or the impassioned paperdoll pattern of the mediæval men and maidens or the spotted and battered figures of the studies in morbid analysis which pass for fiction in the magazines we must get that luminous word normal before the reading public at once and you will be rightly seen in its benign ray and recognized from the startyes in advance of the startfor what you are types of the loveliness of our average life the fairest blossoms of that faith in human nature which has flourished here into the most beautiful and glorious civilization of all times with us the average life is enchanting the normal is the exquisite have patience have courage your time is coming again  it seemed to him that the gentle shapes wavered in his vehement breath and he could not realize that in their alien realm they could not have heard a word he uttered they remained dreamily silent as if he had not spoken and then the heroine said perhaps we shall have to wait for a new school of shortstory writers before we can get back into the magazines some beginner must see in us what has always pleased the likeness to himself or herself the truth to nature the loyalty to the american ideal of happiness he will find that we easily and probably end well and that were a consolation and refuge for readers who can take heart from our happy dénouements when they see a family resemblance in us and can reasonably hope that if they follow our examples they will share our blessings authors cant really enjoy themselves in the company of those degenerates as i call them theyre mostly as young and rightprincipled and wellbehaved as ourselves and if they could get to know us we should be the best of friends they would realize that there was plenty of harmless fun as well as love in the world and that there was lots of goodluck  like ours now with no work and no prospect of it he returned in his refusal to be persuaded yet ready to be comforted  having set out on that road she would not turn back she persisted like any woman who is contraried no matter how far she ends from her first position yes like ours now for this is probably the dark hour before the dawn we must wait  and perish in the mean time  oh we shall not perish she responded heroinically its not for nothing that we are immortal and as she spoke she passed her translucent hand through his arm and rising they drifted off together and left the emissary of the easy chair watching them till they mixed with the mists under the trees in the perspective of the mall     other essays     i  autumn in the country and city   in the morning the trees stood perfectly still yellow yellowishgreen crimson russet not a pulse of air stirred their stricken foliage but the leaves left the spray and dripped silently vertically down with a faint ticking sound they fell like the tears of a grief which is too inward for any other outward sign an absent grief almost selfforgetful byandby softly very softly as nature does things when she emulates the best art and shuns the showiness and noisiness of the secondbest the wind crept in from the leaden sea which turned iron under it corrugated iron then the trees began to bend and writhe and sigh and moan and their leaves flew through the air and blew and scuttled over the grass and in an hour all the boughs were bare the summer which had been living till then and dying was now dead  that was the reason why certain people who had been living with it and seemed dying in it were now in a manner dead with it so that their ghosts were glad to get back to town where the ghosts of thousands and hundreds of thousands of others were hustling in the streets and the trolleys and subways and elevateds and shops and factories and offices and making believe to be much more alive than they were in the country yet the town the haunt of those harassed and hurried spectres who are not without their illusory hilarity their phantasmal happiness has a charm which we of the easy chair always feel on first returning to it in the autumn and which the representative of the family we are imagining finds rather an impassioned pleasure in he came on to new york while the others lingered in a dim bostonian limbo and he amused himself very well in a shadowy sort looking at those other shades who had arrived in like sort or different and were there together with him in those fine days just preceding the election after which the season broke in tears again and the autumn advanced another step toward winter  there is no moment of the new york year which is more characteristic of it than that midautumnal moment which the summer and the winter are equally far from midmay is very well and the weather then is perfect but that is a moment pierced with the unrest of going or getting ready to go away the call of the eld in europe or the call of the wild in newport has already depopulated our streets of what is richest and naturally best in our city life the shops indeed show a fevered activity in the nearrichest and nearbest who are providing for their summer wants at mountain or seashore but the theatres are closing like fading flowers and shedding their chorusgirls on every outward breeze the tables dhôte express a relaxed enterprise in the nonchalance of the management and service the hotels yawn wearily from their hollow rooms the greengroceries try to mask the barrenness of their windows in a show of tropic or semitropic fruits the provisionmen merely disgust with their retarded displays of butchers meats and poultry  illustration broadway at night  but with what a difference the midautumn of the town welcomes its returners ghosts we have called them mainly to humor a figure we began with but they are ghosts rather in the meaning of revenants which is a good meaning enough they must be a very aged or very stupid sort of revenants if their palingenetic substance does not thrill at the first nightly vision of broadway of that fairy flare of electric lights advertising whiskeys and actresses and beers and luring the beholder into a hundred hotels and theatres and restaurants it is now past the hour of roofgardens with their songs and dances but the vaudeville is in full bloom and the playhouses are blossoming in the bills of their new comedies and operas and burlesques the pavements are filled but not yet crowded with people going to dinner at the tables dhôte the shop windows glitter and shine and promise a delight for the morrow which the morrow may or may not realize  but as yet the town is not replete to choking as it will be later when those who fancy they constitute the town have got back to it from their europes their newports their bar harbors their lenoxes their tuxedos weary of scorning delights and living laborious days in that round of intellectual and moral events duly celebrated in the society news of the sunday papers fifth avenue abounds in automobiles but does not yet superabound you do not quite take your life in your hand in crossing the street at those corners where there is no policemans hand to put it in everywhere are cars carts carriages and the motorist whirs through the intersecting streets and round the corners bent on suicide or homicide and the kind old trolleys and hansoms that once seemed so threatening have almost become so many arks of safety from the furious machines replacing them but a few short years ago the passer on the avenue could pride himself on a count of twenty automobiles in his walk from murray hill to the plaza now he can easily number hundreds without an emotion of selfapproval  but their abundance is only provisional a mere forecast of the superabundance to come all things are provisional all sights all sounds and this forms the peculiar charm of the hour its haunting and winning charm if you take the omnibustop to be trundled whiningly up to one of the farther eastside entrances of the park and then dismount and walk back to the plaza through it you are even more keenly aware of the suspensive quality of the time the summer which you left for dead by mountain or seashore stirs with lingering consciousness in the bland air of the great pleasance many leaves are yet green on the trees and where they are not green and not there they are gay on the grass under the trees there are birds not to be sure singing but cheerfully chirping and there are occasional blazons of courageous flowers the benches beside the walks which the northern blasts will soon sweep bare are still kept by the lovers and loafers who have frequented them ever since the spring and by the nurses who cumber the footway before them with their perambulators the fat squirrels waddle over the asphalt and cock the impudent eye of the sturdy beggar at the passer whom they suspect of latent peanuts it is high carnival of the children with hoops and balls it is the supreme moment of the saddledonkeys in the bypaths and the carriagegoats in the mall and of the rowboats on the ponds which presently will be withdrawn for their secret hibernation where no man can find them out when the first snow flies even while it is yet poising for flight in the dim pits of air all these delights will have vanished and the winter which will claim the city for its own through a good four months will be upon it  always come back therefore if you must come at all about the beginning of november and if you can manage to take in election day and especially election night it will not be a bad notion new york has five saturnalia every year new years night decoration day fourth of july election night and thanksgiving and not the least of these is election night if it is a right first tuesday of november the daytime wind will be veering from west to south and back sun and cloud will equally share the hours between them and a not unnatural quiet as of political passions hushed under the blanket of the australian ballot will prevail the streets will be rather emptied than filled and the litter of straw and scrappaper and the ordure and other filth of the great slattern town will blow agreeably about under your feet and into your eyes and teeth but with the falling of the night there will be a rise of the urban spirits the sidewalks will thicken with citizens of all ages and sexes and nations and if you will then seek some large centre for the cinematographic dissemination of the election news you will find yourself one of a multitude gloating on the scenes of comedy and tragedy thrown up on the canvas to stay your impatience for the returns along the curbstones are stationed wagons for the sale of the wind and string instruments whose raw harsh discords of whistling and twanging will begin with the sight of the vote from the first precinct meantime policemen nervously fondling their clubs in their hands hang upon the fringes of the crowd which is yet so goodnatured that it seems to have no impulse but to lift children on its shoulders and put pretty girls before it and caress old women and cripples into favorable positions so that they may see better you will wish to leave it before the clubbing begins and either go home to the slumbers which the whistling and twanging will duly attend or join the diners going into or coming out of the restaurants or the throngs strolling down into the fairy realms of broadway under the flare of the whiskeys and the actresses  at such a time it is best to be young but it is not so very bad to be old for the charm of the hour the air and the place is such that even the heart of age must rise a little at it what the night may really be if it is not positively raining you do not know or need to know those soft lamps overhead which might alike seem let garlanding down from the vault above or flowering up from the gulfs below out of a still greater pyrotechnic richness supply the defect if there is any of moon and stars only the air is actual the air of the new york night which is as different from that of the london night as from that of the paris night or for all we know the st petersburg night at times we have fancied in its early autumnal tones something florentine something venetian but after all it is not quite either even when the tones of these are crudest it is the subtlest the most penetrating expression of the new york temperament but what that is who shall say that mystic air is haunted little from the past for properly speaking there never was a city so unhistorical in temperament a record of civic corruption running back to the first servants of the dutch companies does not constitute municipal history and our part in national events from the time we felt the stirrings of national consciousness has not been glorious as these have not been impressive of new yorks present at any given moment you wish to say in her patientimpatient slang forget it forget it there remains only the future from which she can derive that temperamental effect in her night air but again what that is who shall say if any one were so daring he might say it was confidence modified by anxiety a rash expectation of luck derived from immunity for past transgression the hopes of youth shot with youths despairs not sweet innocent youth but youth knowing and experienced though not unwilling to shun evil because of the bad morrow it sometimes brings no other city under the sun we doubt is so expressive of that youth that modern youth able agile eager audacious not the youth of the poets but the youth of the true the grim realists  illustration electionnight crowds  something a faint faint consciousness of this visits even the sad heart of age on any new york night when it is not raining too hard and one thinks only of getting indoors where all nights are alike but mostly it comes when the autumn is dreaming toward winter in that interlude of the seasons which we call indian summer it is a stretch of time which we have handsomely bestowed upon our aborigines in compensation for the four seasons we have taken from them like some of those reservations which we have left them in lieu of the immeasurable lands we have alienated it used to be longer than it is now it used to be several weeks long in the sense of childhood it was almost months it is still qualitatively the same and it is more than any other time expressive of the new york temperament perhaps because we have honored in the civic ideal the polity of our indian predecessors and in tammany and its recurrently triumphant braves have kept their memory green but if this is not so the spiritual fact remains and under the sky of the election night you feel new york as you do in no other hour the sense extends through the other autumn nights till that night sure to come when the pensive weather breaks in tears and the next day it rains and rains and the streets stream with the flood and the dull air reeks with a sort of inner steam hot close and sticky as a brother a brother whose wants are many and whose resources are few the morning after the storm there will be a keen thrill in the air keen but wholesome and bracing as a good resolution and not necessarily more lasting the asphalt has been washed as clean as a renovated conscience and the city presses forward again to the future in which alone it has its being with the gay confidence of a sinner who has forgiven himself his sins and is no longer sorry for them  after that interlude when the streets of the advanced vaudeville which we know as new york begin again and continue till the chasers come in late may there will be many other sorts of weather but none so characteristic of her there will be the sort of weather toward the end of january when really it seems as if nothing else could console him for the intolerable freezing and thawing the snow upon snow the rain upon rain the winds that soak him and the winds that shrivel him and the suns that mock him from a subtropic sky through subarctic air we foresee him then settling into his armchair while the wind whistles as naturally as the wind in the theatre around the angles of his lofty flat and drives the snow of the shredded paper through the air or beats it in soft clots against the pane he turns our page and as he catches our vague drift before yielding himself wholly to its allure he questions as readers like to do whether the writer is altogether right in his contention that the midautumnal moment is the most characteristic moment of the new york year is not the midwinter moment yet more characteristic he conjures up in the rich content of his indoor remoteness the vision of the vile street below his flat banked high with the garnered heaps of filthy snow which alternately freeze and thaw which the rain does not wash nor the wind blow away and which the shreddedpaper flakes are now drifting higher he sees the footpassers struggling under their umbrellas toward the avenues where the reluctant trolleys pause jarringly for them and the elevated trains roar along the trestle overhead where the saloon winks a wicked eye on every corner where the signs of the whiskeys and actresses flare through the thickened night and the cab tilts and rocks across the trolley rails and the crowds of hotelsojourners seek the shelter of the theatres and all is bleak and wet and squalid in more respectful vision he beholds the darkened mansions of the richest and best who have already fled the scene of their brief winter revel and are forcing the spring in their floridas their egypts their rivieras he himself remains midway between the last fall and the next spring and perhaps he decides against the writer as the perverse reader sometimes will and holds that this hour of suspense and misgiving is the supreme the duodecimal hour of the metropolitan dial he may be right who knows new yorks hours are all characteristic and the hour whose mystical quality we have been trying to intimate is already past and we must wait another year before we can put it to the test again wait till the trees once more stand perfectly still yellow yellowishgreen crimson russet and the wind comes up and blows them bare and yet another summer is dead and the mourners the ghosts the revenants have once more returned to town     ii  personal and epistolary addresses   a constant reader of the easy chair has come to it with a difficulty which at the generous christmastide we hope his fellowreaders will join us in helping solve they may if they like regard it as a merry jest of the patron saint of the day a sort of riddle thrown upon the table at the general feast for each to try his wits upon     across the walnuts and the wine  how this puzzled spirit has asked shall i address a friend of mine who besides being a person of civil condition with a right to the respect that we like to show people of standing in directing our letters to them has the distinction of being a doctor of philosophy of letters and of laws by the vote of several great universities shall i greet him as say smythe johnes esq or dr smythe johnes or smythe johnes phd littd lld or simply mr smythe johnes  decidedly we should answer to begin with not mr smythe johnes if you wish to keep the finest bloom on your friendship with any man who knows the world he will much prefer being addressed simply smythe johnes with his street and number for he feels himself classed by your mr smythe johnes with all those mr smythe johneses whom he loves and honors in their quality of tradesmen and workingmen but does not hold of quite the same social rank as himself after our revolt in essentials from the english in the eighteenth century we are now conforming more and more in the twentieth to their usages in nonessentials and the english always write smythe johnes esq or dr smythe johnes or the like unless mr smythe johnes is in trade or below it they indeed sometimes carry their scruple so far that they will address him as mr smythe johnes at his place of business and smythe johnes esq at his private residence  the english who like their taffy thick and slab and who if one of them happens to be the earl of tolloller are not richly enough satisfied to be so accosted by letter but exact some such address as the right honorable the earl of tolloller all like distinctions in their taffy and are offended if you give them a commoner sort than they think their due but the americans who pretend to a manlier selfrespect had once pretty generally decided upon mr smythe johnes as the right direction for his letters they argued that esquire was the proper address for lawyers apparently because lawyers are so commonly called squire in the simpler life in the disuse of the older form of armiger they forgot that inter arma silent leges and that esquire was logically as unfit for lawyers as for civil doctors divines or mediciners he of the easy chair when an editor long ago yielded to the prevalent american misrendering for a time and indiscriminately addressed all his contributors as mr one of them the most liberal of them in principle bore the ignominy for about a year and then he protested after that the young editor he was then almost as young as any one now writing deathless fiction indiscriminately addressed his contributors as esq yet he had an abiding sense of the absurdity in directing letters to john g whittier esq for if the poet was truly a friend and an abhorrer of war he could not be hailed armiger without something like insult  with doctors of divinity the question is not so vexing or vexed but it is said that of late a lion is rising in the way of rightly addressing doctors of medicine if you wish to be attended by a physician who pays all visits after nightfall in evening dress it is said that you are now to write smythe johnes md esq and not dr smythe johnes as formerly in england the source of all our ceremonial woes you cannot call a surgeon doctor without offence he is mr smythe johnes when spoken to but whether he is mr smythe johnes through the post heaven knows  it is a thousand pities that when we cut ourselves off from that troubled source politically we did not dam it up in all the things of etiquette we indeed struck for freedom and sense at the very highest point and began at once to write george washington president as we still write william h taft president the chief magistrate is offered no taffy in our nation or perhaps the word president is held to be taffy enough and to spare for only the governor of massachusetts is legally even so much as excellency yet by usage you are expected to address all ambassadors and ministers as excellencies and all persons in public office from members of congress and of the cabinet down to the lowest legislative or judicial functionaries as honorables this simplifies the task of directing envelopes to them and if a man once holds military rank in any peace establishment he makes life a little easier for his correspondents by remaining general or captain or admiral or commander you cannot mister him and you cannot esquire him and there is therefore no question as to what you shall superscribe him  a score of years ago two friends now alas both doctors of philosophy of letters and of laws agreed to superscribe their letters simply smythe johnes and johnes smythe respectively without any vain prefix or affix they kept up this good custom till in process of time they went to europe for prolonged sojourns and there corrupted their manners so that when they came home they began addressing each other as esq and have done so ever since neither is any the better for the honors they exchange on the envelopes they do not look at and doubtless if mankind could be brought to the renunciation of the vain prefixes and affixes which these friends once disused the race would be none the worse for it but all the better one prints mr smythe johnes on ones visitingcard because it passes through the hands of a menial who is not to be supposed for a moment to announce plain smythe johnes but it is the united states postoffice which delivers the letters of smythe johnes and they can suffer no contamination from a service which conveys the letters of plain william h taft to him with merely the explanatory affix of president lest they should go to some other william h taft  undoubtedly the address of a person by the name with which he was christened can convey no shadow of disrespect the society of friends understood this from the beginning and they felt that they were wanting in no essential civility when they refused namehonor as well as hathonor to all and every they remained covered in the highest presences and addressed each by his christian name without conveying slight so that a king and queen of england who had once questioned whether they could suffer themselves to be called thy majesty instead of your majesty by certain quakers found it no derogation of their dignity to be saluted as friend george and friend charlotte the signory of the proudest republic in the world held that their family names were of sufficiency to which titles could add nothing and the venetian who called himself loredano or gradenigo or morosini or renier or rezzonico did not ask to be called differently in our own day a lady of the ancient and splendid family of the peruzzi in florence denied that the title of count existed in it or need exist ognuno può essere conte peruzzi no any one may be a count but not a peruzzi in like manner such names as lincoln and franklin and washington and grant and longfellow and bryant could have gained nothing by mr before them or esq after them doctor socrates or doctor seneca would not have descended to us in higher regard with the help of these titles and rearadmiral themistocles or majorgeneral epaminondas could not have had greater glory from the survival of parchments so directed to them  the venetian nobles who disdained titles came in process of time to be saluted as illustrissimo but in process of time this address when used orally began to shed its syllables till illustrissimo became lustrissimo and then strissimo and at last striss when perhaps the family name again sufficed so with us doctor has familiarly become doc and captain cap until one might rather have no title at all mr itself is a grotesque malformation of a better word and miss is a silly shortening of the fine form of mistress this pronounced misses can hardly add dignity to the name of the lady addressed though doubtless it cannot be disused till we are all of the society of friends the popular necessity has resulted in the vulgar vocative use of lady but the same use of gentleman has not even a vulgar success though it is not unknown you may say with your hand on the bellstrap step lively lady but you cannot say step lively gentleman and the fine old vocative sir is quite obsolete we ourselves remember it on the tongues of two elderly men who greeted each other with sir and sir when they met and step lively sir might convey the same delicate regard from the trolley conductor as step lively lady sir might look very well on the back of a letter smythe johnes sir would on some accounts be preferable to smythe johnes esq and oddly enough it would be less archaic  such of our readers as have dined with the late queen or the present king of england will recall how much it eased the yoke of ceremony to say to the sovereign yes maam or yes sir as the use is instead of your majesty but to others you cannot say yes maam or yes sir unless you are in that station of life to which you would be very sorry it had pleased god to call you yet these forms seem undeniably fit when used by the young to their elders if the difference of years is great enough  the difficulty remains however you cannot as yet write on an envelope smythe johnes sir or mary johnes lady and in view of this fact we find ourselves no nearer the solution of our constant readers difficulty than we were at first the socialists who wish to simplify themselves and others would address mr johnes as comrade smythe johnes but could they address mrs johnes as comradess we fancy not besides comrade suggests arms and bloodshed which is hardly the meaning of the red flag of brotherhood and at the best comrade looks affected and sounds even more so friend would be better but orally on the lips of nonquakers it has an effect of patronage though no one could rightly feel slight in a letter addressed to him as friend smythe johnes  it is wonderful to consider how the ancients apparently got on without the use of any sort of prefix or affix to their names on the roll of parchment or fold of papyrus addressed to them for all we know cæsar was simply c julius cæsar to his correspondents and pericles was yet more simply pericles to the least of his fellowcitizens these historical personages may have had the number of their houses inscribed on their letters or pericles might have had son of xanthippus added to his name for purposes of identification but apparently he managed quite as well as our presidents without anything equivalent to excellency or hon or mr or esq to be sure with the decline of     the glory that was greece    and the grandeur that was rome  namehonors crept in more and more it was then not only politer but much safer to address your petition to the divine domitian or to the divine nero than to greet those emperors by the mere given names which were not yet christian probably it would not have been enough to add cæsar to the last name though cæsar seems to have finally served the turn of esq for all the right that the emperors had to bear it in the eastern empire we are not ready to say what was the correct style for imperial dignitaries but among the sovereigns who divided the roman state and inherited its splendor some rulers came to be sacred majesties though this is still a sensible remove from divine  however our present difficulty is with that vast average who in common parlance are mr and mrs smythe johnes how shall they be styled on the backs of their letters how shall mrs smythe johnes especially in signing herself mary johnes indicate that she is not miss mary but mrs smythe johnes when she is left a widow how soon does she cease to be mrs smythe johnes and become mrs mary is it requisite to write in the case of any literary doctorate smythe johnes lld or littd or phd or is it sufficient to write dr before his name in the case of a divine do you put rev dr before the name or rev before it and dd after it these are important questions or if they are not important they are at least interesting among the vast mass of unceremonied or call it unmannered americans the receiver of a letter probably knows no better than the sender how it should be addressed but in the rarer case in which he does know his selfrespect or his selflove is wounded if it is misaddressed it is something like having your name misspelled though of course not so bad as that quite and every one would be glad to avoid the chance of it  the matter is very delicate and can hardly be managed by legislation as it was on the point of our pen to suggest it should be the first french republic one and indivisible decreed a really charming form of address which could be used without offence to the selflove or the selfrespect of any one citoyen for all men and citoyenne for all women was absolutely tasteful modest and dignified but some things though they are such kindred things cannot be done as well as others the same imaginative commonwealth invented a decimal chronology and a new era very handy and very clear but the old week of seven days came back and replaced the week of ten days and the year of our lord resumed the place of the year of the republic as monsieur and madame returned victorious over citoyen and citoyenne yet the reform of weights and measures when once established continued and spread from france to most other countriesto nearly all indeed less stupid than great britain and the united statesso that the whole civilized world now counts in grammes and metres what can be the fine difference here is a pretty inquiry for the psychologist who has an opportunity to prove himself practically useful is it that grammes and metres are less personal than weekdays and addresses that can hardly be or else the society of friends could not have so absolutely substituted first day and second day etc for the old heathen names of our weekdays and could not have successfully refused all namehonor whatsoever in addressing their fellowmortals  but titles have come back fulltide in the third french republic one and indivisible so that anybody may wear them though the oldest nobility are officially and legally known only by their christian and family names without any prefix this is practically returning to citoyen and citoyenne and it almost gives us the courage to suggest the experiment of citizen and citizenne as a proper address on the letters of american republicans the matter might be referred to a board something like that of the simplified spelling board though we should not like to be included in a committee whose members must be prepared to take their lives in their hands or short of death to suffer every manner of shame at the hands of our journalists and their correspondents short of the adoption of citizen and citizenne we have no choice but to address one another by our given names and surnames merely unless we prefer to remain in our present confusion of mr and esq in a very little while we dare say no lady or gentleman would mind being so addressed on his or her letters but perhaps some men and women might now that we no longer use pets names so much except among the very highest of our noblesse where there are still jimmies and mamies we believe plain gladys smythe or reginald johnes would be the usual superscription such an address could bring no discomfort to the recipient a beautiful word very proper in this connection and if it could once be generally adopted it would save a great deal of anxiety the ladys condition could be indicated by the suffix spinster in the case of her being single if married the initials of her husbands given names could be added     iii  dressing for hotel dinner   among the high excitements of a recent winter in new york was one of such convulsive intensity that in the nature of things it could not last very long it affected the feminine temperament of our public with hysterical violence but left the community the calmer for its throes and gently if somewhat pensively smiling in a permanent ignorance of the event no outside observer would now be able to say offhand whether a certain eminent innkeeper had or had not had his way with his customers in the matter not only of what they should eat or drink but what they should wear when dining in a place which has been described as supplying exclusiveness to the lower classes it is not even certain just how a crucial case was brought to the notice of this authority what is certain is that his instant judgment was that no white male citizen frequenting his proud tavern should sit at dinner there unless clothed in a dresscoat or at least in the smokingjacket known to us as a tuxedo at breakfast or at luncheon probably the guest the paying guest could sufficiently shine in the reflected glory of the lustrous evening wear of the waiters no sooner was the innkeepers judgment rendered than a keen thrill of resentment or at least amusement ran through the general breast from every quarter the reporters hastened to verify the fact at firsthand and then to submit it to the keeper of every other eminent inn or eatinghouse in the city and learn his usage and opinion these to a man disavowed any such hardandfast rule though their paying guests were ordinarily gentlemen of such polite habits as to be incapable of dining in anything but a dresscoat or a tuxedo yet their inns and eatinghouses were not barred against those who chose to dine in a frock or cutaway or even a sacque it is possible that the managers imagined themselves acquiring merit with that large body of our vulgar who demand exclusiveness by their avowal of a fine indifference or an enlightened tolerance in the matter but at this distance of time no one can confidently say how the incident was closed with respect to the preeminent innkeeper and his proud tavern whether the wayfarer forced by the conditions of travel upon the company of the exclusive vulgar may now dine there in the public banquetinghall in his daytime raiment or must take his evening meal in his room with a penalty in the form of an extra charge for service nowise appears  what is apparent from the whole affair is that the old ideal of ones inn as a place where one shall take ones ease has perished in the evolution of the magnificent american hotel which we have been maliciously seeking to minify in the image of its old world germ one may take ones ease in ones hotel only if one is dressed to the mind of the hotelkeeper or perhaps finally the head waiter but what is more important still is that probably the vast multitude of the moneyed vulgar whose exclusiveness is supplied to them in such a place dictate tacitly at least the draconian policy of the management no innkeeper or head waiter no matter of how patrician an experience or prejudice would imagine a measure of such hardship to wayfarers willing to pay for the simple comfort of their ancestors at the same rate as their commensals stiffly shining in the clothes of convention the management might have its conception of what a hotel diningroom should look like with an unbroken array of gentlemen in black dresscoats and ladies in white shoulders all feeding as superbly as if they were not paying for their dinners or as if they had been severally asked for the pleasure of their company two weeks before and the picture would doubtless be marred by figures of people in cutaways and high necks to a degree intolerable to the artistic sense but it is altogether impossible that the management would exact a conformity to the general effect which was not desired by the vast majority of its paying guests what might well have seemed a break on the part of the preeminent innkeeper when he cited as a precedent for his decision the practice of the highest hotels in london was really no break but a stroke of the finest juridical acumen nothing could have gone further with the vast majority of his paying guests than some such authority for they could wish nothing so much in the exclusiveness supplied them as the example of the real characters in the social drama which they were impersonating they had the stage and the scenery they had spared no expense in their costuming they had anxiously studied their parts and for the space of their dinnerhour they had the right to the effect of aristocratic society which they were seeking unmarred by one discordant note after that hour let it be a cramped stall in the orchestra of another theatre or let it be an early bed in a cell of their colossal columbary yet they would have had their dinnerhour when they shone primarily just like the paying guests in the finest english hotel and secondarily just like the nonpaying guests at the innumerable dinners of the nobility and gentry in a thousand private houses in london  our aim is always high and they would be right to aim at nothing lower than this in their amateur dramatics but here we have a question which we have been holding back by main force from the beginning and which now persists in precipitating itself in our peaceful page it is a question which merits wider and closer study than we can give it and it will we hope find an answer such as we cannot supply in the wisdom of the reader it presented itself to the mind of eugenio in a recent experience of his at a famous seaside resort which does not remit its charm even in the heart of winter and which with the first tremor of the opening spring allures the dweller among the skyscrapers and the subways with an irresistible appeal we need not further specify the place but it is necessary to add that it draws not only the jaded or sated newyorker but the more eager and animated average of welltodo people from every part of their country who have got bored out with their happy homes and want a few days or a few weeks change one may not perhaps meet a single distinguished figure on its famous promenade or at least more distinguished than ones own with the best will in the world to find such figures eugenio could count but three or four a tall alert correct man or two an electly fashioned perfectly setup dominant woman or so whose bearing expressed the supremacy of a set in some unquestionable world but there was obvious riches aplenty and aplenty of the kind wholesomeness of the good true intelligent and heavenbound virtue of what we must begin to call our middle class offensive as the necessity may be here and there the effect of champagne in the hair which deceived no one but the wearer was to be noted here and there highrolling a presence with the effect of something more than champagne in the face loomed in the perspective through the haze of a costly cigar but by far immensely far the greater number of his fellowfrequenters of the charming promenade were simple domestic wellmeaning americans like eugenio himself of a varying simplicity indeed but always of a simplicity they were the stuff with which his fancy he never presumed to call it his imagination had hitherto delighted to play fondly shaping out of the collective material those lineaments and expressions which he hoped contained a composite likeness of his american day and generation the whole situation was most propitious and yet he found himself moving through it without one of the impulses which had been almost lifelong with him as if in some strange paralysis some obsession by a demon of indifference unknown before he was bereft of the will to realize these familiar protagonists of his plain dramas he knew them of course he knew them all too well but he had not the wish to fit the likest of them with phrases to costume them for their several parts to fit them into the places in the unambitious action where they had so often contributed to the modest but inevitable catastrophe  the experience repeated itself till he began to take himself by the collar and shake himself in the dismay of a wild conjecture what had befallen him had he gone along young eager interested delighted with his kind for half a century of æsthetic consciousness and now had he suddenly lapsed into the weariness and apathy of old age it is always short of ninety too soon for that and eugenio was not yet quite ninety was his mind then prematurely affected but was not this question itself proof that his mind was still importunately active if that was so why did not he still wish to make his phrases about his like to reproduce their effect in composite portraiture eugenio fell into a state so low that nothing but the confession of his perplexity could help him out and the friend to whom he owned his mystifying his all but appalling experience did not fail him in his extremity no he wrote back it is not that you have seen all these people and that they offer no novel types for observation but even more that they illustrate the great fact that in the course of the last twenty years society in america has reached its goal has arrived and is creating no new types on the contrary it is obliterating some of the best which were clearly marked and is becoming more and more one rich dead level of mediocrity broken here and there by solitary eminences some of which are genuine some only false peaks without solid rock foundations  such a view of his case must be immediately and immensely consoling but it was even more precious to eugenio for the suggestion from which his fancynever imaginationbegan to play forward with the vivacity of that of a youth of sixty instead of a middleaged man of eightyfive if all this were trueand its truth shone the more distinctly from a ground of potential dissentwas not there the stuff in the actual conditions from which a finer artist than he could ever hope to be now that the first glow of his prime was past might fashion an image of our decadence or our arrest so grandly so perfectly dull and uninteresting that it would fix all the afterages with the sovereign authority of a masterpiece here he tremblingly glowed to realize was opportunity not for him indeed but for some more modern more divinely inspired lover of the mediocre to eternize our typelessness and establish himself among the manymillioned heirs of fame it had been easyhow easy it had beento catch the likeness of those formative times in which he had lived and wrought but the triumph and the reward of the new artist would be in proportion to the difficulty of seizing the rich selfsatisfied ambitionless sordid commonplace of a society wishing to be shut up in a steamheated electriclighted palace and fed fat in its exclusiveness with the inexhaustible inventions of an overpaid chef true the strong simple days of the young republic when men forgot themselves in the struggle with the wild continent were past true the years were gone when the tremendous adventure of tearing from her heart the iron and the gold which were to bind her in lasting subjection gave to fiction industrial heroes fierce and bold as those of classic fable or mediæval romance but there remained the days of the years which shall apparently have no end but shall abound forever in an inexhaustible wealth of the sort wishing not so much to rise itself as to keep down and out all suggestion of the life from which it sprang  the sort of type which would represent this condition would be vainly sought in any exceptionally opulent citizen of that world he would have if nothing else the distinction of his unmeasured millions which would form a poetry however sordid the note of the world we mean is indistinction and the protagonist of the fiction seeking to portray its fads and characters must not have more than two or three millions at the most he or better she were better perhaps with only a million or a million and a half or enough to live handsomely in eminent inns either at home or abroad with that sort of insolent halfknowledge to which culture is contemptible which can feel the theatre but not literature which has passed from the horse to the automobile which has its moral and material yacht cruising all social coasts and making port in none where there is not a hotel or cottage life as empty and exclusive as its own even in trying to understate the sort one overstates it nothing could be more untrue to its reality than the accentuation of traits which in the arrivals of society elsewhere and elsewhen have marked the ultimation of the bourgeois spirit say that the puritan the pilgrim the cavalier and the merchant adventurer have come and gone say that the revolutionist patriot the pioneer and the backwoodsman and the noble savage have come and gone say that the slaveholder and the slave and the abolitionist and the civil warrior have come and gone say that the miner the rancher the cowboy and the sardonically humorous frontiersman have come and gone say that the simplehearted hardworking modest genial homemakers have come and gone say that the captain of industry has come and gone and the worldwide financier is going what remains for actualityloving art to mould into shapes of perdurable beauty obviously only the immeasurable mass of a prosperity sunken in a selfsatisfaction unstirred by conscience and unmoved by desire but is that a reason why art should despair rather it is a reason why it should rejoice in an opportunity occurring not more than once in the ages to seize the likeness and express the significance of arrival the arrival of a whole civilization to do this art must refine and rerefine upon itself it must use methods of unapproached delicacy of unimagined subtlety and celerity it is easy enough to catch the look of the patrician in the upper air of the plebeian underfoot but to render the image of a worldbourgeoisie compacted in characters of undeniable verisimilitude that will be difficult but it will be possible and the success will be of an effulgence such as has never yet taken the eyes of wonder  we should not be disposed to deny the artist dedicated to this high achievement by his love of the material not less than by his peculiar gift the range of a liberal idealism we would not have him bound by any precedent or any selfimposed law of literality if he should see his work as a mighty historical picture or series of such pictures we should not gainsay him his conception or bind him rather to any genre result we ourselves have been evolving here the notion of some large allegory which should bear the relation to all other allegories that bartholdis colossus of liberty bears to all other statues and which should carry forward the story and the hero or the heroine to some such supreme moment as that when amid the approving emotion of an immense hotel diningroom all in décolletée and frac paré the old simplelived american wearing a sackcoat and a colored shirt shall be led out between the eminent innkeeper and the head waiter and delivered over to the police to be conducted in ignominy to the nearest italian table dhôte the national character on the broad level of equality which fiction once delighted to paint no longer exists but if a deeper a richer a more enduring monotony replaces it we have no fear but some genius will arrive and impart the effect of the society which has arrived     iv  the counsel of literary age to literary youth   as eugeniowe will call him eugenio a fine impersonal namegrew older and became rightfully or wrongfully more and more widely known for his writings he found himself increasingly the subject of appeal from young writers who wished in their turn to become rightfully or wrongfully more and more widely known this is not indeed stating the case with the precision which we like his correspondents were young enough already but they were sometimes not yet writers they had only the ambition to be writers our loose formulation of the fact however will cover all its meaning and we will let it go that they were young writers for whether they were or not they all wished to know one thing namely how he did it  what they asked in varying turns was his secret his recipe for making the kind of literature which had made him famous they did stint their phrase and they said famous that always caused eugenio to blush at first with shame and then with pleasure whatever ones modesty one likes to be called famous and eugenios pleasure in their flatteries was so much greater than his shame that he thought only how to return them the pleasure unmixed with the shame his heart went out to those generous youths who sometimes confessed themselves still in their teens and often of the sex which is commonly most effective with the fancy while still in its teens it seemed such a very little thing to show them the way to do what he had done and while disclaiming any merit for it to say why it was the best possible way if they had grouped him with other widely known writers in their admiration he never imagined directing his correspondents to those others methods he said to himself that he did not understand them and at bottom he felt that it would have been better taste in the generous youths to have left them out of the question  in the end he never answered his correspondents in the handsome way he had fancied generally he did not answer them at all or if he did he put them off with some such cheap excuse as advising them to be sure they had something to say and then to say it as simply and clearly as they could he knew very well that this was begging the question that the question was how to be artistic graceful charming and whatever else they said he himself was if he was aware of not being all that he was aware also of having tried to be it of having sought from the beginning to captivate the readers fancy as well as convince his reason he had never been satisfied with being plain and direct he had constantly wished to amuse as well as edify and following the line of beauty as that of the least resistance had been his practice if not his precept if he counselled his correspondents otherwise he would be uncandid and when he had imagined putting them off in that fashion he was more ashamed than he had been with their praise  yet upon reflection he perceived that what they asked was impossible if ever he had a formula he had lost it he was no longer in his own secret if ever he had been all that he could have said with perfect honesty would have been that he had never found any royal road to literature that to his experience there was not even a common highway that there were only byways private paths over other peoples grounds easements beaten out by feet that had passed before and giving by a subsequent overgrowth of turf or brambles a deceitful sense of discovery to the latestcomer  his correspondents would not have liked that he knew that what they wanted was his measure of the old success in some new way which they could feel their own after it had been shown them but the only secret that he was still in was the very open one of working hard at whatever he had in hand and this he suspected they would have scorned sharing with him he could have said that if you want to keep three or five balls in the air at once you must learn how by practising but they knew that as well as he what they asked was being enabled to do it themselves from his having practised  the perception of this fact made eugenio very sad and he asked himself if the willingness to arrive only after you had got there had gone out of the world and left nothing but the ambition to be at this point or that without the trouble of having reached it he smiled as he recalled the stock criticism of the connoisseur in the vicar of wakefield that the picture would have been better if the painter had taken more pains but he did not smile gayly there seemed to him a sum of pathetic wisdom in the saying which might well weigh down the blithest spirit it had occurred to him in connection with an old essay of hazlitts which he had been reading on the comparative methods of english and french painters in their work the essayist held almost literally that the french pictures were better because the french painters had taken more pains and taken especial pains in the least interesting parts of their pictures he was dealing more specifically with copying but his words applied to the respective schools in their highest work and he could only save his patriotic pride so far as he might by saying courage is pure will without regard to consequences and this the english have in perfection poetry is our element for the essence of poetry is will and passion the english fail as a people in the fine arts namely because the end with them absorbs the means  eugenio knew nothing practically and very little theoretically of painting but it appeared to him that what hazlitt said was of equal force with respect to the fine art of literature and that in his own american field the english race failed as far as it had failed for the same reason as that given by hazlitt for its failure in painting in his mind he went further than hazlitt or came short of him in refusing the consolation of our races superiority in poetry because it was will and passion as far as they had excelled in that it was because they had tried hard and not neglected the means for the end where they had excelled most it was quite imaginable that the poem would still have been better if the poet had taken more pains in the case of prose he thought we failed of the end because we were impatient of the means and as elderly men will he accused the present of being more hasty and indifferent to form than the past he recalled the time when he was apprentice in the art in which he could not yet call himself a master workman and thought how he tried to make what he did beautiful and fashioned his work with tireless pains after some high model perhaps the young writers of this time were striving as earnestly but he could not see it or thought he could not he fancied their eyes dazzled by the images of easy success instead of taken with the glory of a thing beautifully done he remembered with fond emotion how once his soul had glowed over some cunningst pattern of excelling nature and had been filled with longing to learn from it the art of surprising some other mood or aspect of nature and making that loveliness or grandeur his own he had talked with other youths who were trying at the same time to do good work and he remembered that they too were trying in the same way and now long after he fancied that their difference from the youth of the present day was in their willingness to strive for perfection in the means and to let the end take care of itself the end could no more justify bad means in æsthetics than in ethics in fact without the carefully studied means there could be no artistic result if it was true that the young writers of the present expected a high result from hurried or neglected processes they could have only the results that eugenio saw around him if they admired these and were coming to him for the secret of achieving them they were coming to the wrong shop  yet he did not harshly blame them he remembered how he too when he had been impatient of the means had once fancied postponing them to the end that was in the days which were mainly filled for him with the business of writing fiction and when the climax of his story seemed always threatening to hide itself from him or to elude his grasp there were times when it changed to some other end or took a different significance from that it had primarily had then he had said to himself that if he could only write the end first or boldly block it out as it first presented itself and afterward go back and write in the events and characters leading up to it he would have an effect glorified by all the fervor of his primal inspiration but he never did that or even tried to do it perhaps when he came to consider it more carefully it appeared impossible perhaps it approved itself ridiculous without experiment his work of art such as it was was a growth from all his thinking and feeling about it and without that it could no more eventuate in a climax than a tree could ripen fruit without the preliminaries of striking its roots into the ground coming of the age to bear and then some springtime budding putting out leaves breaking into blossom and setting its young apples or whatever else it was going to bear the fruit it bore would be according to its kind and he might have been mistakenly expecting to grow peaches from an apple stock when he was surprised to find apples on it or the end of his novel turning out other than he had forecast it  in literature the readers affair is with results but the authors with processes eugenio had realized this more and more distinctly and as he now reflected on the appeals of those fond young correspondents of his it occurred to him that their confusion as to literary methods and manners lay in their being still readers so largely and so little authors as yet they were dealing with the end in their mistaken minds and not with the means as they supposed the successes which dazzled them might very well have been written backward in some such fashion as he had once imagined for the end was the main thing with them and was the end of the story as well as the end of the book but the true story never ends the close of the book is simply the point at which the author has stopped and if he has stopped wisely the reader takes up the tale and goes on with it in his own mind  as for the variance of the close from the forecast of it eugenio was less and less dismayed by that when in the course of time he looked more closely at his own life and the lives of other men only on some spiritual terms was there the fulfilment of forecast in them and the more art resembled life the less responsive it was to any hardandfast design he perceived that to find the result changing from the purpose might very well be a proof of vitality in it an evidence of unconscious insight the sort of inspiration that comes to crown faithful work with unimagined beauty he looked round at the great works of literary art and he believed that he saw in them the escape from implicit obedience to a first intention only in the inferior things the mechanical things could he discern obedience in something supreme like hamlet say there was everything to make him think that the processes had educated shakespeare as to the true nature of his sublime endeavor and had fixed the terms of its close probably the playwright started with the notion of making hamlet promptly kill his stepfather rescue ophelia from the attempt to climb out over the stream on a willow branch forgive his erring mother as more sinned against than sinning welcome laertes back to denmark and with the ghost of his father blessing the whole group and polonius with his arm in a sling severely but not fatally wounded form the sort of stage picture as the curtain went down that has sent audiences home dissolved in happy tears from so many theatres but shakespeare being a dramatist as well as a playwright learned from hamlet himself that hamlet could not end as he had meant him to end hamlet in fact could not really end at all and in the sort of anticlimax in which the tragedy closes he must rise from death another and a truer ghost than the buried majesty of denmark and walk the world forever  could eugenio however advise his youthful correspondents to work so reckless of their original conceptions as shakespeare had probably done the question was serious it put him upon his conscience and he decided that at the most he could not do more than urge them with all the earnestness of his nature to write their hamlets from the beginning forward and never from the ending backward even in their own minds he saw that if he were to answer them collectively and he certainly did not intend to answer them severally he must say that their only hope of producing an effective whole was through indefatigable work upon every part make each smallest detail beautiful and despise none because it seemed to perform a poor and lowly office in the assemblage of the parts let these youths be sure that they could not know the meaning of any design from imagining it but only from expressing it and that the true result could come only from the process they could not hope to outdo shakespeare and foreknow their respective hamlets they must slowly make their hamlets acquaintance by living with them  if eugenios correspondents were dashed by this hard saying he thought he might raise their spirits by adding that they would find compensation for their slow arduous toil in particulars from a fact which he had noted in his own case a thing well done looks always very much better in the retrospect than could have been hoped a good piece of work would smile radiantly upon them when it was accomplished besides after a certain experience in doing they would learn that the greatest happiness which could come to them from their work would be through the perfecting of details this would make their performance a succession of little victories which alone could constitute the great ultimate triumph  but style but style they might return what about style that was one of the miracles we asked you the sleight of and are you going to say nothing about that or did you mean style in your talk about perfecting details do you want us to take infinite pains in acquiring a style  by no means eugenio was prepared to declare in the event of this comeback do not think about style if you do your work well patiently faithfully truly style will infallibly be added unto you that is the one thing you must not try for if you try for style you will be like a man thinking about his clothes or his manners you will be selfconscious which is the fatal opposite of being yourself you will be yourself when you are lost in your work and then you will come into the only style that is proper to you the beauty and the grace that any sort of workman has in the exercise of his craft you will then have without seeking it your own swing of phrase your own turn of expression your own diction and these will be your style by which every reader will know you but if you have a manner which you have borrowed or imitated people will see that it is secondhand and no better than something shopworn or cast off besides style is a thing that has been grossly overvalued in the general appraisal of literary qualities the stylists are not the greatest artists the supreme artists who would think of shakespeare as a stylist or tolstoy or dante  eugenio thought he could count upon a vanity in his correspondents so dense as not to be pierced by any irony in fact it could not be said that though he felt the pathos of their appeals he greatly respected the motives which actuated them in writing to him they themselves respected their motives because they did not know them as he did but probably they did not pity themselves so much as he pitied them he realized that they turned to him from a literary remoteness which they did not realize and it was very natural that they should turn for help outside their circumstance but eugenio had not lived to his age without learning that many natural impulses are mistaken if not wrong he reflected sadly that those faroff solitaries could alone burst their circumstance and find their way out of it he perceived that they could do this only by their own devout and constant toil in the line of their aspiration but would it avail to tell them so  one of the knowledges of a period of life which we will call the riper maturity is that we need all the accumulated vigilance of the past to secure us from the everbesetting dangers of the present the dangers of indolence of slovenly performance of indistinct vision of weakening conscience in our work we need every atom of force every particle of the stored electricity of youth to keep us going in later years while we are still young we are aware of an environing and pervading censure coming from the rivalry the envy the generous emulation the approval the disapproval the love the hate of all those who witness our endeavor no smallest slip no slightest defect will be lost upon this censure equally useful whether sympathetic or antipathetic but as we grow old we are sensible of a relaxing a lifting a withdrawal of the environing and pervading censure we have become the objects of a compassionate toleration or a contemptuous indifference it no longer matters greatly to the world whether we do our work well or ill but if we love our work as we ought till we die it should matter more than ever to us whether we do it well or ill we have come to the most perilous days of our years when we are tempted not so much to slight our work as to spare our nerves in which the stored electricity is lower and scanter than it was and to let a present feeble performance blight the fame of strenuous achievements in the past we may then make our choice of two thingsstop working stop going cease to move to existor gather at each successive effort whatever remains of habit of conscience of native force and put it into effect till our work which we have not dropped drops us  should eugenio address these hard sayings to his appealing his palpitating correspondents he found himself on the point of telling them that of all the accumulated energies which could avail them when they came of his age or were coming of it there was none that would count for so much as the force of habit and what could be more banal than that it would not save it from banality if he explained that he meant the habit of loving the very best one can do and doing that and not something less it would still be banal to say that now in their youth was the only time they would have to form the habit of tirelessly doing their best at every point and that they could not buy or beg or borrow such a habit for the simple reason that nobody who had it could sell or give or lend it  besides as eugenio very well perceived his correspondents were not only young now but were always intending to be so he remembered how it used to be with himself and that was how it used to be he saw abundance of old or older people about him but he himself instinctively expected to live on and on without getting older and to hive up honey from experience without the beeswax which alone they seemed to have stored from the opening flowers of the past yet in due course of time he found himself an old or older man simply through living on and on and not dying earlier upon the whole he liked it and would not have gone back and died earlier if he could but he felt that it would be useless trying to convince his youthful correspondents that whether they liked it or not they too would grow old or older if they lived how then teach them by precept if they would not learn by universal example that unless they were to be very miserable old men and even miserable old women they must have the habit of work how instruct them further that unless they had the habit of good work patient faithful fine work the habit which no one can buy beg or borrow because no one can sell give or lend it they were worse than idle cumberers of the earth with no excuse for being above it  if he had set out to do that they might have retorted upon him that he was making a petty personal matter of art which was not only so much longer than life but so much wider deeper and higher in this event he saw that he would have nothing for it but to confirm his correspondents in their disappointment with him by declaring that art was a personal matter and that though longer it was not wider deeper or higher than life and could not be it might be mysterious in being personal but it was not necessarily petty it would be great if the artist was so but not otherwise it could be fine on no other terms there was a theory and an appearance that it existed somehow apart from the artist and that it made him but the fact was he made it partly wittingly partly unwittingly and it had no being except in his achievement the power of imagining a work of art was the gift of nature as being long or short dark or fair was the concern of him it was given to was how after he found it out to make the most of his gift it had no power to make much or little of him if he cherished it and served it when he had made sure of it by fulfilling the law that its possession imposed then it would rise up in something he had done and call him master  but how could eugenio make such thingsso true and yet so selfcontradictory so mutually repellentclear to these simplehearted young correspondents of his the more he thought of the matter the more he resolved to do nothing about it     v  the unsatisfactoriness of unfriendly criticism   it was the experience of eugenio that the criticisms of his books when they were unfriendly presented a varying offence rather than a cumulative offence as the years wore on the criticisms of ones books are always hard to bear if they are unfavorable but he thought that displeasure for displeasure the earlier refusal to allow him certain merits was less displeasing than the later consent to take these merits for granted to be taken for granted in any wise is to be limited it is tantamount to having it said of one that yes one has those virtues but one has no others it comes also to saying that one has of course the defects of ones virtues though eugenio noted that when certain defects of his were taken for granted it did not so distinctly and immediately follow that he was supposed to have the virtues of these  now eugenios theory of himself was that he was not limited and that if he modestly stopped short of infinity it was because he chose he had a feeling of always breaking new ground and he did not like being told that he was tilling the old glebe and harvesting the same crops or that in the little gardenground where he let his fancy play he was culling flowers of such familiar tint and scent that they seemed to be the very flowers he had picked thirty or forty years before what made it harder to endure suggestion of this sort was that in his feeling of always breaking new ground there was an inner sense or fear or doubt that perhaps it was not really virgin soil he was turning up but merely the sod of fields which had lain fallow a year or two or had possibly been cropped the season before  the misgiving was forced upon him by certain appearances in the work of other veteran authors when he took up the last book of some lifelong favorite no matter how great a master he knew him still to be he could not help seeing that the poor old master was repeating himself though he would not have phrased the case in such brutal terms then the chill wonder how long he could hope to escape the like fate pierced him and for a moment he could not silence the question whether it might not have already befallen him in another moment he knew better and was justly aggrieved with the next reviewer who took things in him for granted quite as offensively if they were merits as if they were defects it was vital to him to be always breaking new ground and if at times it seemed to him that he had turned this or that furrow before he said to himself that it was merely one of those intimations of preexistence which are always teasing us here with the sense of experience in circumstances absolutely novel and he hoped that no one else would notice the coincidence  he was indeed tolerably safe from the chance for it is one of the conditions of literary criticism that the reviewers shall be nearly always young persons they if they alone are capable of the cruelties they sometimes practise are alone capable of the enthusiasms which supply publishers with quotable passages for their advertisements and which lift authors hearts in pride and joy it is to their advantage that they generally bring to the present work of a veteran author an ignorance of all that he has done before and have the zest for it which the performance of a novice inspires they know he is not a novice of course and they recognize his book as that of a veteran but they necessarily treat it as representative of his authorship of course if it is his twentieth or thirtieth book or his fortieth or fiftieth it is merely one of a long series which fully represents him even these collectively represent him inadequately as long as he is adding to them if he has the habit like eugenio of always breaking new ground the reviewer however is probably much newer than the ground which the established author breaks in his last book and coming to it in his generous ignorance which he has to conceal under a mask of smiling omniscience he condemns or praises it without reference to the work which has gone before it and which it is merely part of though of course it has entirety enough of a sort to stand alone if the author has broken ground in the direction of a new type of heroine the reviewer by the conditions of his calling is all but obliged to say that here is one of those enchanting girls whom the author in question has endeared to generations of readers or one of those tedious prudes for whom his name is a synonyme if after many psychological romances the author has stepped down to the level of actual life he is praised or blamed for the vital or servile naturalism of his work or if the contrary is the case he has to read of himself as doing something habitual and entirely characteristic of him in vain so far as that acute young critic is concerned has he broken new ground but if he has with much compunction consciously turned his furrows in a field tilled before he stands a fair chance of being hailed at the outset of a new career  he cannot openly complain and if he could the critic cannot help being what he is if the critic were older and more versed in the veteran author he might not like him so well and he could not at any rate bring the fresh interest to his work which the young reviewer brings what eugenio would really wish would be to have each successive book of his given for review to some lifelong admirer some dear and faithful friend all the better for not being an acquaintance who had liked him from the beginning and was intimately versed in all his work such a critic would know that eugenio was always breaking new ground and that he was never more true to this inherent tendency than when he seemed to be ploughing the same old furrows in the same old fields such a critic would be alert to detect those fine differences of situation which distinguish a later from an earlier predicament he would note with unfailing perspicacity the shades of variance which constitute florindo an essentially novel character when presented under the name of lindoro or floribella a fresh delight when she reappears as doralinda even when he could not deny that these persons were in themselves one and the same he would be able to make the reader observe that the new light thrown upon them by the authors everrenascent art revealed in familiar creations traits of mind and charms of spirit unimagined before he would insist that if not new they were newer because being more fully ascertained they were truer he would boldly recur to the personages in eugenios former books whom they reminded one of and studying them in contrast would convince the reader that the increasing purpose of the author in the treatment of the wellknown types had been to reveal the infinite variety of character which lay hid in each and every human type  some such reviewer eugenio thought all journals pretending to literary authority ought to keep on their staff for the comfort of veteran authors and for the dispensation of that more delicate and sympathetic justice which their case required it might be well enough to use a pair of ordinary steelyards or even hayscales in weighing out the rewards and punishments of younger authors but some such sensitive balance as only the sympathetic nerves of equal years and if possible equal intelligence could adjust ought to be used in ascertaining the merits of a veteran author  in his frankest selfconsciousness eugenio did not say a veteran author like himself and he did not insist exclusively upon a veteran critic for his behoof there were times when he thought that a young critic coming in the glow of adolescence and the freshness of knowledge won from the recent study of all his works might be better fitted to appreciate the qualities of the latest he quite rejected the notion when it came to business with which he had sometimes played of an author reviewing his own books and this apart from his sense of its immodesty in the course of his experience he had known of but one really great author who had done this and then had done it upon the invitation of an editor of rare if somewhat wilful perspicacity who invited the author to do it on the ground that no one else could do it so well but though he would not have liked to be his own reviewer because it was not seemly he chiefly feared that if put upon his honor as he would be in such a case he must deal with his work so damagingly as to leave little or nothing of it he might make the reputation of a great critic but in doing execution upon his own shortcomings he might be the means of destroying himself as a great author  after all authors are not the selfsatisfied generation they must often seem to the public which has tried to spoil them with praise there is much in doing a thing which makes a man modest in regard to the way he has done it even if he knows that he has done it well if the testimony of all his faculties is to that effect there is somehow the lurking sense that it was not he who really did it but that there is a power to turn matthew arnolds phrase to our use not ourselves that works for beauty as well as righteousness and that it was this mystical force which wrought through him to the exquisite result if you come to the secondbest results to the gold so alloyed that you may confidently stamp it your own do you wish to proclaim it the precious metal without alloy do you wish to declare that it is to all intents and purposes quite as good as pure gold or even better do you hold yourself quit of the duty of saying that it is secondbest that it is something mixed with copper or nickel and of the value of oroide say you cannot bring yourself to this extreme of candor and what right then have you to recognize that something else is fine gold when it is really so ought not you to feign that it is only about thirteen carats when it is actually eighteen  considerations like these always stayed eugenio when it came to the point of deciding whether he would care to be his own reviewer but the desire to be adequately reviewed still remained with him a fond longing amid repeated disappointments an author often feels that he has got too much praise though he never has got all he wants why dont they clap doctor holmes once whimsically demanded speaking of his audiences in those simple early days when he went about lecturing like emerson and alcott and other saints and sages of new england do they think i cant stand it why dont they give me three times three i can stand it very well an author may sometimes think he is fulsomely praised and may even feel a sort of disgust for the slab adulation trowelled upon him but his admirer need not fear being accused of insincerity he may confidently count upon being regarded as a fine fellow who has at worst gone wrong in the right direction it ought therefore to be a very simple matter to content a veteran author in the article of criticism but somehow it is not  perhaps the trouble is in the nature of criticism which unwillingly enough no doubt assumes to be and to do more than it can its convention is that it is an examination of a book and a report upon its qualities but it is not such a report and it cannot be in the limits assigned it which are the only tolerable limits with the reader the author would not mind if the critics report were physically commensurate with his book but of course the reader could not stand that and generous as they are other authors might complain sometimes as it is they think that any one of their number who gets something like a good report from a critic is getting more than his deserts yet authors though a difficult are not an impossible generation few of them would allow that they are even unreasonable with regard to criticism and they would probably hail any improvement in its theories and methods with gratitude  as criticism cannot be an adequate report upon the qualities of a book even a book which has not been examined why should it assume to do more than talk about it and talk all the better for being merely tentative and altogether unfinal nobody can really be authoritative concerning anything for there is no one whose wisdom will not be disputed by others of the wise the best way then might be for a reviewer to go round collecting sentiment and opinion about the book he means to talk of and then to give as many qualifying varieties of impression as the general unhandsomeness of human nature will allow him to give when they differ from his own impression on the terms of the old and still accepted convention of criticism eugenio had himself done a vast deal of reviewing an amount of it in fact that he could not consider without amaze and in all this reviewing he had not once satisfied himself with his work never once had he written a criticism which seemed to him adequate or more than an approximation to justice even when he had most carefully almost prayerfully examined the work he reported upon he was aware of writing from this mood or that of feeling hampered by editorial conditions of becoming impatient or jaded and finally employing the hayscales when he ought to have used the delicate balances with which one weighs out lifegiving elixirs or deadly poisons but he used to imagine that if he could have put himself in the attitude of easy discussion or light comment instead of the judicial pose he felt obliged to take he could have administered a far finer and more generous measure of justice in these moments he used to wonder whether something stated and organized in the way of intelligent talk about books might not be substituted for the conventional verdicts and sentences of the courts of criticism  in this notion he proceeded upon a principle evolved from his own experience in fields far from the flinty and sterile ranges of criticism he had not only done much reviewing in those days but he had already written much in the kinds which he could not in his modesty bring himself to call creative though he did not mind others calling it so whatever had been the shortcomings of the conventional reports upon his work it was his glad experience that nothing he said or meant not the slightest intention or airiest intimation in his books was ever wholly lost somewhere some one somehow had caught it liked it remembered it and had by a happy inspiration written him of it it might be diffident it might be confident of his pleasure in the recognition  such recognition was always more precious than the reports of the conventional critics though if these were favorable the author was glad of them as of any good that the gods gave but what struck eugenio was that such recognition was the real the very the vital criticism and that if it could be evoked in behalf of others in its sincerity it might be helpful to the cause of literature far beyond anything that the courts of criticism could do or effect in its behalf after all as he said to himself an author wrote for his readers and not for his critics for pleasure and not for judgment and if he could be assured publicly as he sometimes was assured privately that nothing he did was lost he might be encouraged to keep on doing his best why indeed should not there be a critical journal embodying in a species of fragrant bouquet the flowers of thought and emotion springing up in the brains and bosoms of readers responsive to the influence of a new book such readers would have only to suppose themselves addressing the author direct and the thing could be done it might be done in another way by the authors contributing the praises privately sent him in a time when personal letters to authors are constantly quoted in advertisements this might not seem so immodest as in some earlier literary condition  in the mean time the question of what shall be done for veteran authors who are always breaking new ground still remains and it is complicated by a fact of psychological import for the reader as well as the author what first gives an author his hold upon the reader is not the novelty of his theme but a pleasing it may be a painfully pleasing quality which in its peculiar variation must be called his personal quality it is the sense of this in each of his successive books which deepens his hold upon the reader and not the style or the characters or the intrigue as long as this personal quality delights he is new whether he breaks new ground or not or he is newly welcome with his own generation with the readers who began young with him and have grown old with him he is always safe but there is danger for him with the readers who begin young with him after he has grown old it is they who find his tales twice told and himself hackneyed unless they have been trained to like his personal quality by their elders this might be difficult but it is not impossible and ought not it to be the glad the grateful care of such elders     vi  the fickleness of age   all forms of literature probably hold a great deal more meaning than people commonly get out of them but prose may be likened to a cup which one can easily see to the bottom of though it is often deeper and fuller than it looks while verse is the fount through which thought and feeling continually bubble from the heart of things the sources that underlie all life may be finding vent in a rhyme where the poet imagined he was breathing some little superficial vein of his own but in the reader he may unawares have reached the wells of inmost passion and given them release the reader may himself live with a certain verse and be aware of it now and then merely as a teasing iterance that     from some odd corner of the mind    beats time to nothing in the brain  but suddenly some experience or perhaps the exfoliation of the outer self through the falling away of the withered years shall open to him its vital and cosmical significance he shall know then that it is not an idle whisper of song but a message to his soul from the senate where the immortals gather in secular counsel and muse the wisdom of all the centuries since humanity came to its earliest consciousness the bearer of the message may not have known it in the translation which it wears to the receiver each must read it in his own tongue and read meaning into it perhaps it always takes two to make a poet and singer and listener are the twin spheres that form one star  a valued correspondent of ours one of those whose letters are oftener than we should like to own fraught with the suggestion of our most fortunate inspirations believes himself to have been recently the confidant of the inner sense of certain lines in a familiar poem of longfellows its refrain had from the first reading chanted in the outer chamber of his ear but suddenly the other day it sang to his soul with a newly realized purport in the words     a boys will is the winds will    and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts  the words are as the poet promptly declares the burden of a lapland song which is haunting his memory still which murmurs and whispers still which is singing and saying still which is mournful and sweet and fitful and fatal and strange and beautiful yet he seems not to have known as our friend now thinks he himself knows that they express a difference unrecognized hitherto between youth and age and rightfully attribute to the young a steadfastness and persistence in objects and ideals formerly supposed the distinguishing qualities of the old in other words they have precipitated into his consciousness a truth unwittingly held in solution by both the poets in their verse or if it was conveyed to him by their sensible connivance he is the first who has been made its repository or if he cannot claim an exclusive property in the revelation it is now his in his turn by that sad right of seniority whose advantages are not ours till there are few or none left to contest them with us one has not been promoted to them because of any merit or achievement one has simply lived into them and how much of one has died in the process of survival the lines speak to our friends age a language which his youth could not have understood and it is because he is no longer young that he perceives how long the thoughts of youth were and how brief the thoughts of age  he had always fancied that his later years should be a time of repose in the faiths loves and joys through which he realized himself but nothing apparently was farther from the fact such length of thoughts as he had such abiding pleasures such persistent hopes were from his youth and the later sort were as the leaves of the tree to the tree itself he put them forth at the beginning of an epoch a season and they dropped from him at the close in as great bitterness as is consonant with his temperament he has asked us why youth should ever have been deemed fickle and age constant when so precisely the contrary is true youth he owns is indeed full of vain endeavors and of enterprises that come to nothing but it is far more fixed than age in its aspirations his aspirations change now with such rapidity that they seem different not only from year to year but from month to month from day to day he has not merely discarded his old ideals he loathes them he used to like going out to dinner above all things and he was fond of lunches even of afternoon teas but in a day in an hour such delights became wearinesses and vexations of spirit formerly he enjoyed travel with all its necessary concomitants it amused him to check his baggage and depart from stations to arrive at hotels and settle himself in new rooms the very domiciliation in sleepingcars or the domestication in diners had a charm which was apparently perennial a trip in a riverboat was rapture an ocean voyage was ecstasy the succession of strange faces new minds was an unfailing interest and there was no occurrence in or out of the ordinary which did not give him release from self and form a true recreation the theatre does not amuse him now though the time has been and lately for the curtain when it rose on a play new or old to lift his spirit with it and to hold him entranced till its fall as for the circus he once rejoiced in all its feats performing elephants could not bore him nor acts of horsemanship stale its infinite variety but the time has come abruptly when the smell of the sawdust or the odor of the trodden weed mixed with the aroma of icecold lemonade is a stench in his nostrils  these changes of ideal have occurred not through the failure of any powers that he can note in himself but as part of the great change from youth to age which he thinks is far greater morally than physically he is still fairly strong he has not lost his appetite or the teeth to gratify it he can walk his miles always rather two than ten and rest refreshed from them except that he does not like to kill things he could trudge the whole day through fields and woods with his gun on his shoulder though he does not golf and cannot know whether or no it would bore him he likes to wield the axe and the scythe in the groves and meadows of his summer place when he stretches himself on the breast of the mother alike of flesh and grass it is with a delicious sense of her restorative powers and no fear of rheumatism if he rests a little longer than he once used he is much more rested when he rises from his repose  his body rejoices still in its experiences but not his soul it is not interested it does not care to have known its experiences or wish to repeat them for this reason he thinks that it is his spirit which is superannuated while its muddy vesture of decay is in very tolerable repair his natural man is still comparatively young and lives on in the long long thoughts of youth but his supernatural man has aged with certain moral effects which alarm his doubts of the pleasures he once predicated of eternity if it is going to be like this with me he says to himself and shrinks from supplying the responsive clause of his conditional  but mainly his mind turns upon itself in contemplation of its earthly metamorphoses in which it hardly knows itself for the mind of the same man its apprehensions are for the time when having exhausted all the differences it shall care for none but meanwhile it is interested in noting the absurdity of that conventional view of age as the period of fixed ideals it may be the period of fixed habits of those helpless iterances which imply no intentions or purposes but it is not the period in which the mind continues in this or that desire and strives for its fulfilment the same poet who sang at second hand those words of the lapland song     the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts  erred to our friends sense in singing of     the young heart hot and restless    and the old subdued and slow  he believes the reverse would rightly characterize the heart of youth and the heart of age age is not slow in its mental motions it is hurried and anxious with that awful mystical apprehension of the swiftcoming moment when time shall be no more and nothing but eternity shall be left it is not subdued its heart is hot with rebellion against the inevitable but for youth there is no inevitable there is no conclusion no catastrophe which it may not hope to escape and so it is patient of chances it is glad of them its heart is not restless it is quite at peace in the bosom which is secure of all the time there is  our friend believes that a variety of popular superstitions will fall at the recognition of the truth in this matter and none more finally than that which attributes to the junior partner the unhappiness of those marriages in which youth and crabbed age try to live together in such hazardous unions the junior partner is for some unexplained reason of the sex which has the repute of a generic fickleness as well as the supposed volatility of its fewer years probably repute wrongs it as much in one respect as in the other but our friend contends only for greater justice to it in the last in the light that he has come into he holds that where such unions are unhappy though they may have been formed with a fair appearance of affection it is the senior partner who is to blame if blame may ever be attached to involuntary change it is the senior partner who has wearied first of the companionship and wished for release with the impatience natural to age this is intolerant of the annoyances which seem inherent in every union of the kind and impatient of those differences of temperament which tell far more than any disparities of age and which exist even where there are no such disparities the intolerance the impatience is not more characteristic of the husband where he is the elder than of the wife in the much fewer instances of her seniority in the unions where two old people join their faltering destinies the risks of unhappiness are logically doubled and our friend holds it a grotesque folly to expect anything else of marriages in which two lovers disappointed of each other in their youth attempt to repair the loss in their age where any such survive into later life with the passion of earlier life still rife in their hearts he argues that they had much better remain as they are for in such a belated union as they aspire to the chances are overwhelmingly against them  very probably like other discoverers he is too much impressed with the value of his divination it is something that at any rate can appeal for recognition only to the aged or the aging with these we could imagine it bringing a certain consolation a relief from vain regret an acquittal from selfaccusation if one has suddenly changed for no apparent reason one must be glad to find a reason in the constitution of things and to attribute ones fickleness to ones time of life youths errors have possibly been too much condoned upon grounds where age could more justly base its defence it may be more reckless than age but it is not nearly so rash it keeps thinking its long long thoughts and questioning the conclusions to which age eagerly hobbles or hurls itself from its crutches youth is deliberate for it has plenty of time while as our friend notes age has little but eternity before it not youth but age leaps from lifes trolley while it is still in motion or after mismeasuring the time and space limps impatiently before it and is rolled under its fender you may see physical proof of this difference our friend insists in the behavior of two people one young and one old at any streetcrossing and why should so many old ladies fall on the stairs but that they are apt to precipitate themselves wildly from landings where young girls linger to dream yet one dream more before they glide slowly down to greet the young men who would willingly wait years for them  the distrust of eternity at which our friend hints is perhaps the painfulest of his newly discovered differences between youth and age resting so serenely as it does in practically unlimited time with ideals and desires which scarcely vary from year to year youth has no fears of infinity it is not afraid but it shall have abundant occupation in the æons before it or that its emotions or volitions shall first be exhausted its blithe notion of immortality is that it is immortal youth it has no conception of age and could not imagine an eternity of accomplished facts it is perhaps for this reason that doubt of immortality never really comes to youth one of the few things which our friend still believes is that every sceptic who deals honestly with his only history must be aware of an hour almost a moment of waning youth when the vague potentiality of disbelief became a living doubt thenceforward to abide with him till death resolve it endless notbeing is unthinkable before that time as after it endless being is unthinkable yet this unthinkable endless being is all that is left to age and it is in the notion of it alone that age can get back to the long long thoughts in which is surcease from unrest our old friend may accuse us of proposing the most impossible of paradoxes when we invite him to take refuge from his whirling ideals not in an unavailing endeavor to renew the conditions of youth in time but in the forecast of youth in eternity we think that the error of his impatience his despair with the state he has come to here is largely if not wholly through his failure to realize that he is not going to wake up old in some other being but young and that the capacity of long long thoughts will be renewed in him with the renewal of his life the restlessness of age its fickleness its volatility is the expression of immense fatigue it tosses from side to side and tries for this and that like a sick man from sheer weakness or rather if the reader prefers another image it is like some hapless wild thing caught by rising floods on a height of land which they must soon submerge and running incessantly hither and thither as the water more narrowly hems it in  undoubtedly the mutability of age in its ideals has been increased of late by the restriction of human hope to the years which remain few and brief to the longest earthly life by the sciences which provisionally darken counsel when these shall have penetrated to a point where they can discern the light they will pour the day on the dim orbs of age and illumine the future with new hope then doubting age can enter into the rest now forbidden it and take its repose between illimitable horizons in the long long thoughts of eternal youth we speak here in behalf of the sceptic the agnostic few for the many who have not lost their hope because they have never lost their faith doubtless all the trouble of change which disquiets our friend will seem something temperamental merely and not something essential or inseparable from human nature their thoughts have remained long their ideals steadfast because they have not lost the most precious jewel of their youththe star of trust and hope which     flames in the forehead of the morning sky  these are the most enviable of their kind and there are signs that their turn may be coming once more in the primacy to which their numbers have always entitled them only the other day we were reading a paper by a man of that science which deals with life on strictly physical lines and drawing from it an immense consolation because it reaffirmed that the soul has not only its old excuse for being in the unthinkability of an automatic universe and the necessity of an intentional first cause but with evolution in the regard of some scientists tottering on its throne and natural selection entering the twilight into which the elder pagan deities have vanished is newly warranted in claiming existence as that indestructible lifeproperty or organizing power which characterizes kind through kind from everlasting to everlasting in this consolation we seemed well on our way back to the encounter of a human spirit such as used to be rapt to heaven or cast into hell for very disproportionate merits or demerits but we were supported for the meeting by the probability that in the fortunate event the spirit would be found issuing from all the clouds of superstition and when it was reconstituted in the universal belief that the time with eternity in its train would have returned for fitly hailing it in the apostrophe of the addisonian cato     but thou shalt flourish in immortal youth    unhurt amidst the war of elements    the wreck of matter and the crush of worlds     vii  the renewal of inspiration   there comes a time in the experience of perhaps every stated purveyor of intellectual food when the stock he has long been drawing upon seems finally exhausted there is not a grain left in the barns where he had garnered up the harvests of the past there is not a head of wheat to be found in the fields where he had always been able to glean something if he shakes the tree of knowledge in the hope of a nut to crack or a frozenthaw to munch nothing comes down but a shower of withered leaves his condition is what in the parlance of his vocation he calls being out of a subject and it is what may happen to him equally whether he is preaching twice a sunday from the pulpit or writing leaders every day for a prominent journal or merely contributing a monthly essay to a magazine as the day or hour or moment approaches when he must give forth something from his destitution he envies the hungriest of his auditors or readers who do not yet know that there is nothing in him to appease their famine there is only the barren will to give which only a miracle can transform into a vitalizing bounty  yet is not this miracle always wrought when did a pulpit ever fail of a sermon or a journal of a leading article or a magazine of its stated essay the fact might argue the very contrary of the appearance and convince the desperate purveyor that what he mistook for hopeless need was choice which mocked him with a myriad alternatives from cover to cover the scripture is full of texts every day brings forth its increase of incident the moral and social and æsthetical world is open on every side to polite inquiry and teems with inspiring suggestion if ever the preacher or editor or essayist fancies he has exhausted these resources he may well pause and ask whether it is not himself that he has exhausted there may be wanting the eye to see the riches which lie near or far rather than the riches which are always inviting the eye  a curious trait of the psychology of this matter is that it is oftener the young eye than the old which lacks the visual force when eugenio was beginning author and used to talk with other adolescent immortals of the joyful and sorrowful mysteries of their high calling the dearth of subjects was the cause of much misgiving and even despair among them upon a certain occasion one of that divine company so much diviner than any of the sort now made bold to affirm i feel that i have got my technique perfect i believe that my poetic art will stand the test of any experiment in the handling of verse and now all that i want is a subject it seemed a great hardship to the others and they felt it the more keenly because every one of them was more or less in the same case they might have none of them so frankly owned their fitness for their work as the one who had spoken but they were all as deeply aware of it and if any subject had appeared above the horizon there could have been no question among them except as to which should first mount his winged steed and ride it down it did not occur to any of them that the want of a subject was the defect of their art and that until they were equipped with the eye that never fails to see occasion for song all round the heavens they were not yet the champions of poetry which they fancied themselves he who had uttered their common belief sufficiently proved afterward in the range of things he did that he had ultimately come into possession of the highest of the poetic gifts the poetic vision of life and that he had completed his art at a point where it had been most imperfect before when he supposed it so perfect as soon as he ceased looking for subjects which were mainly the conventional themes of verse the real and vital subjects began looking for him  eugenio himself on his lower level had something of the same experience when he first began those inventions in prose which long seemed to him worthy of the best that his kindest friends said of them he had great trouble in contriving facts sufficiently wonderful for the characters who were to deal with them and characters high and noble enough to deal with the great and exalted facts on one hand or the other his scheme was always giving out the mirage of fancy which painted itself so alluringly before him faded on his advance and left him planted heavyfooted in the desert sands in other words he was always getting out of a subject in the intervals between his last fiction and his next when his friends supposed he was purposely letting his mind lie fallow and perhaps willingly acquiesced in the rest they were sharing with him he was really in an anguish of inquiry for something on which to employ his powers he was in a state of excruciating activity of which the incessant agitation of the atoms in the physical world is but a faint image his repose was the mask of violent vibrations of volcanic emotions which required months to clear themselves in the realization of some ideal altogether disproportioned to the expenditure of energy which had been tacitly taking place at these periods it seemed to him that his lot had been cast in a world where he was himself about the only interesting fact and from which every attractive subject had been removed before he came into it  he could never tell just how or when all this changed and a little ray very faint and thin at first stole in upon his darkness and broadened to an effulgence which showed his narrow circle a boundless universe thronged with the most available passions interests motives situations catastrophes and dénouements and characters eagerly fitting themselves with the most appropriate circumstances as nearly as he could make out his liberation to this delightful cosmos took place through his gradual perception that human nature was of a vast equality in the important things and had its difference only in trifles he had but to take other men in the same liberal spirit that he took himself to find them all heroes he had but to take women at their own estimate to find them all heroines if not divinely beautiful then interesting fascinating irresistibly better than beautiful the situation was something like this it will not do to give away his whole secret but the reader needs only a hint in order to understand how in his new mind eugenio was overwhelmed with subjects  after this illumination of his the only anxiety he had was concerning his ability to produce all the masterpieces he felt himself capable of in the short time allotted to the longestlived writer he was aware of a duty to the material he had discovered and this indeed sometimes weighed upon him however he took courage from the hope that others would seize his point of view and be able to carry on the work of producing masterpieces indefinitely they could never use up all the subjects any more than men can exhaust the elements of the aluminium which abound in every piece of the common earth but in their constant reliance upon everyday life as the true and only source of surprise and delight in art they could never be in the terrible despair which had afflicted him from time to time before his illumination  doubtless there is an overruling providence in this matter which we may not distrust without accusing the order which has not yet failed in the due succession of the seasons and the days and nights while we are saying it is never going to rain it rains or when it seems as if nature were finally frozen up a thaw begins when we feel that the dark will not end the dawn is already streaking the east if the preacher thinks that the old texts are no longer applicable to life there is suddenly reported an outbreak of vice in the city which puts him in mind of sodom and gomorrah or the opportune flight of a defaulter furnishes material for a homily which searches the consciences of half the congregation with the words of the commandment against stealing the journalist wakes in heavyeyed despair but he finds from the papers on his breakfasttable that there has been a revolution in south america or that the socialists have been doing something in belgium almost too bad even for socialists as the capitalists imagine them and his heart rises again even the poor magazine essayist who has lived through the long month in dread of the hour when his copy shall be due is not forbidden his reprieve he may not have anything to say but he certainly has something to say it about the world is always as interesting today as it was yesterday and probably tomorrow will not be so dull as it promises  one reason for the disability of the essayist as distinguished from the preacher or the journalist is that he does not give himself range enough expecting to keep scrupulously to one subject he cannot put his hand on a theme which he is sure will hold out under him to the end once it was not so the essayists of antiquity were the most vagariously garrulous people imaginable there was not one of them who to our small acquaintance with them kept to his proposition or ended anywhere in sight of it aristotle epictetus marcus aurelius plutarch they talk of anything but the matter in hand after mentioning it and when you come down to the moderns for instance to such a modern as montaigne you find him wandering all over the place he has no sooner stated his subject than he begins to talk about something else it reminds him like lincoln of a story which has nothing to do with it and that story reminds him of another and so on till the original thesis is left flapping in the breeze somewhere at the vanishingpoint in the tortuous perspective and vainly signalling the essayist back it was the same or nearly the same with the english essayists quite down to the beginning of the last century when they began to cease being the writers in the spectator the guardian the tatler the rambler and the rest contrived to keep a loose allegiance to the stated topic because they treated it so very briefly and were explicitly off to something else in the next page or two with a fresh text but if we come to such delightful masters of the art as lamb and leigh hunt and de quincey and hazlitt it will not be easy opening at any chance point to make out what they are talking about they are apparently talking about everything else in the world but the business they started with but they are always talking delightfully and that is the great matter with any sort of talker  when the reviewers began to supplant the essayists they were even more contemptuously indifferent to the obligations of constancy their text was nominally some book but almost as soon as they had named it they shut it and went off on the subject of it perhaps or perhaps not it was for the most part lucky for the author that they did so for their main affair with the author was to cuff him soundly for his ignorance and impudence and then leave him and not return to him except for a few supplementary cuffs at the close just to show that they had not forgotten him macaulay was a notorious offender in this sort though why do we say offender was not he always delightful he was and he is though we no longer think him a fine critic and he meant to be just or as just as any one could be with a man whom one differed from in the early victorian period  but macaulay certainly did not keep harking back to his text if ever he returned to it at all his instinct was that a preachers concern was with his text but not an essayists or a reviewers and he was right enough the essayist certainly has no such obligation or necessity his reader can leave him at any moment unless he is very interesting and it does not matter where they part company in fact it might be argued that the modern fidelity to its subject is one of the chief evidences or causes of the essays decay the essayist tries to make a mechanical conscience perform the duty of that fine spiritual freedom in which the essay once had its highest effect with the reader and in his dull loyalty to the stated thesis he is superficial as well as tiresome  the true subject is not one subject only but many it is like that pungent bulb whose odorous energy increases with exfoliation and remains a potent fragrance in the air after the bulb has substantially ceased to be under the fingers the error of the modern essayist is to suppose that he can ever have a single subject in hand he has a score he has a hundred as his elders and betters all know and what he mistakes for his destitution is really his superfluity if he will be honest as he may with difficulty be must not he recognize that what seems a search for one theme is a hesitation between many pressing forward for his choice if he will make this admission we believe he will be nearer the fact and he will be a much more respectable figure than he could feel himself in blindly fumbling about for a single thesis life is never and in nothing the famine perhaps that we imagine it much more probably it is a surfeit and what we suppose are the pangs of hunger are really the miseries of repletion more people are suffering from too much than from too little especially are the good things here in a demoralizing profusion ask any large employer of labor and he will tell you that what ails the workingclasses is an excess of pianos and buggies and operaboxes ask any workman what ails his employer and he will say that it is the ownership of the earth with a mortgage on planetary space both are probably right or at least one is as right as the other  when we have with difficulty made our selection from the divine redundancy of the ideal world and so far as we could have reduced ourselves to the penury of a sole possession why do not we turn our eyes to the example of nature in not only bringing forth a hundred or a thousand fold of the kind of seed planted but in accompanying its growth with that of an endless variety of other plants all coming to bear in a like profusion observe that wise husbandwoman this is not the contradiction in terms it seems how when her business is apparently a hay harvest she mingles myriads of daisies and milkweed and wild carrot and redtop with the grass and lets her fancy riot all round the meadow in a broidery of blackberries and asters and dogroses and goldenrod she never works without playing and she plays even while man is workingplays so graciously and winningly that it takes the heart with joy who has ever looked upon an oldworld wheatfield where poppies and vetches are frolicking among the ears and begrudged nature her pastime no one we will venture but the owner of the field who is perhaps also too much of a philosopher to grieve over it in the ideal world it is much the same there too art having chosen a kind brings it to bear with all the other kinds which have been lurking in the unconscious soil of the mind and only waiting tilth for any purpose before springing up in company with the selected seed this is what makes the poets and novelists and dramatists so much more profitable reading than the moralists from whom indeed has the vital wisdom of the race been garnered not from those hard ethical masters who have sought to narrow culture to the business of growing precepts but from the genial teachers who have inculcated amusement and breathed into the unwary mind some inspiration which escaped as unconsciously from themselves which philosopher or sage of them all has instructed mankind a hundredth part as much as shakespeare who supposed himself to be merely providing diversion for the patrons of the globe theatre  it follows if not directly then a long way about from what we have been saying that the real artist is never at a loss for a subject his trouble is too many themes not too few and having chosen among them his error will be in an iron sequence rather than in a desultory progression he is to arrive if at all laden with the spoil of the wayside and bringing with him the odor of the wild flowers carpeting or roofing the bypaths if he is a little bothered by the flowering brambles which have affectionately caught at him in his course that does not greatly matter or at least it is better than coming back to his startingpoint in boots covered with the mud of the highroad or coat powdered with its dust the sauntering ease the excursive delays will be natural to the poet or the novelist who is born to them but the essayist must in a manner make them his own if he would be an artist and survive among the masters which there has been some doubt of his doing it should be his care to shun every appearance of continuity only in the practice of the fitful the capricious the desultory can he hope to emulate the effects of the creative with any other ideal he cannot hope to be fit company for the high minds who have furnished mankind with quotations but for the prevalence of the qualities which we have been urging the essayist to cultivate in the essays of bacon it is not probable that any one would ever have fancied that bacon wrote shakespeare     viii  the summer sojourn of florindo and lindora   at the moment of this writing everybody is hurrying into the country eager to escape the horrors of summer in the city at the moment when it becomes that reading we hope for everybody will be hurrying into the city eager to escape the horrors of summer in the country at either moment the experiences of florindo and lindora should have a certain interest  florindo and lindora are a married pair still comparatively happy after forty years of wedded life who have spent the part or the whole of each hot season out of town sometimes in the hills sometimes by the sea sometimes in europe their acquaintance with either form of sojourn if not exhaustive is so comprehensive that it might be cited as encyclopædic  the first season or so they did not think of shutting up their house in the city or doing more than taking the latter part of august a trip to niagara or saratoga or cape may or lake george or some of those simple oldfashioned resorts whose mere mention brings a sense of preexistence with a thrill of fond regret to the age which can no longer be described as middle and is perhaps flattered by the epithet of threequartering no doubt people go to those places yet but florindo and lindora have not been to any of them for so many summers that they can hardly realize them as still open for them they were closed in the earliest of the eighteenseventies  after that say the third summer of their marriage it appeared to lindora essential to take board somewhere for the whole summer at such an easy distance that florindo could run up or down or out every saturday afternoon and stay sunday with her and the children for there had now begun to be children who could not teethe in town and for whom the abundance of pure milk small fruits and fresh vegetables promised with the shade and safety of the farm was really requisite she kept the house in town still open as before or rather halfopen for she left only the cook in it to care for her husband and do the family wash sent to and fro by express while she took the second girl with her as maid in the first days of september when the most enterprising of the fresh vegetables were beginning to appear on the table and the mosquitoes were going and the smell of old potatoes in the cellar and rats in the walls was airing out and she was getting used to the peculiar undulations of her bed she took the little teethers back to town with her and when she found her husband in the comfortable dimensions of their own house with melons and berries and tender steak and rich cream such as never comes on pure milk and hot and cold baths and no flies she could not help feeling that he had been very selfish now she understood at least why he never failed on monday morning to wake in time for the stage to carry him to the station and she said no more farmboard for her if she knew it  in those idyllic days while they were making their way and counting the cost of every step as if it were the proverbial first step the next step for lindora was a large boardinghouse for the summer she tried it first in the country and she tried it next at the seaside with the same number of feet of piazza in both cases and with no distinct difference except in the price it was always dearer at the seaside but if it had been better she should not have thought it so dear yet as it was dearer she could not help thinking it was better and there was the beach for the teethers to dig in and there was an effect of superior fashion in the gossipers on the piazza one to every three of the three hundred feet of the piazza rocking and talking and guessing at the yachts in the offing and then bathing and coming out to lie on the sand and dry their hair  at the farm she had paid seven dollars a week for herself and halfprice for the children at the country boardinghouse she had paid ten for herself and again halfprice for the children at the seaside boardinghouse the rate for her was fourteen dollars and nine for the children and the maid everybody on the piazza said it was very cheap but to lindora it was so dear that she decided for florindo that they could not go on keeping the house open and the cook in it just for him as the expressage on the wash took away all the saving in that if she allowed him to sleep in the house he could pick up his meals for much less than they now cost they must not burn their candle at both ends he must put out his end there was reason in this because now florindo was sometimes kept so late at business that he could not get the last train saturday night for the beach and he missed the sunday with his family on which she counted so much thinking these things over during the ensuing winter she began to divine toward spring that the only thing for the teethers and the true way for florindo was for her to get away from the city to a good distance where there would be a real change of air and that a moderate hotel in the white mountains or the adirondacks was the only hopeful guess at their problem if florindo could not come for sunday when they were off only an hour or two it would be no worse for them to be seven or eight hours off florindo agreed the more easily because he had now joined a club where he got his meals as comfortably as at home and quite as economically counting in the cook he could get a room also at the club and if they shut the house altogether and had it wired by the burglarinsurance company they would be cutting off a frightful drain  it was therefore in the interest of clearly ascertained economy that lindora took her brood with her to a white mountain hotel where she made a merit of getting board for seventeen dollars and a half a week when so many were paying twenty and twentyfive florindo came up twice during the summer and stayed a fortnight each time and fished and said that it had been a complete rest on the way back to town lindora stopped for october in one of those nice springandfall places where you put in the halfseason which is so unwholesome in the city after a long summer in the country and afterward she always did this fortunately florindo was prospering and he could afford the increased cost of this method of saving the system was practised with great success for four or five years and then suddenly it failed  lindora was tired of always going to the same place sick and tired and as far as she could see all those mountainplaces were the same places she could get no good of the air if she bored herself the nice people did not go to hotels so much now anyway and the children were dreadful no fit associates for the teethers who had long ceased to teethe but needed a summer outing as much as ever a series of seasons followed when the married pair did not know where to go in the person of the partner who represented them and they had each spring a controversy vividly resembling a quarrel but which was really not a quarrel because the dear knew that if it were not for the children lindora would only be too glad never to leave their own house winter or summer but just to stick there year out and year in then at least she could look a little after florindo who had lived so much at the club that he had fairly forgotten he had a wife and children the trouble was all with florindo anyway he cared more for his business than his family much if he did not he could have managed somehow to spend the summers with them other men did it and ran down once a month or once a fortnight to put things in shape and then came back  sleeping on a midnight view of her hard case lindora woke one morning with an inspiration it might not be too much to call it a revelation she wondered at herself she was ashamed of herself for not having thought of it before europe of course was the only solution once in europe you need not worry about where to go for you could go anywhere europe was everywhere and you had your choice of the swiss mountains where every breath made another person of you or the italian lakes with their glorious scenery or the english lakes with their literary associations or scheveningen and all holland or Étretât or ostend or any of those thousands of german baths where you could get over whatever you had and the children could pick up languages with tutors and the life was so amusing going to europe was excuse enough in itself for florindo to leave his business and if he could not be gone more than one summer he could place her and the children out there till their health and education were completed and they could all return home when it was time for the girls to think of coming out and the boys of going to college  florindo as she expected had not a reasonable word to say against a scheme that must commend itself to any reasonable man in fact he scarcely opposed it he said he had begun to feel a little run down and he had just been going to propose europe himself as the true solution she gladly gave him credit for the idea and said he had the most inventive mind she ever heard of she agreed without a murmur to the particular german baths which the doctor said would be best for him because she just knew that the waters would be good for all of them and when he had taken his cure the family made his aftercure with him and they had the greatest fun after the aftercure in travelling about germany they got as far down as the italian lakes in the early autumn and by the time florindo had to go back the rest were comfortably settled in paris for the winter  as a solution europe was perfect but it was not perpetual after three years the bottom seemed to fall out as florindo phrased it and the family came home to face the old fearful problem of where to spend the summer lindora knew where not to spend it but her wisdom ended there and when a friend who was going to europe offered them her furnished cottage at a merely nominal rent lindora took it because she could not think of anything else they all found it so charming that after that summer she never would think again of hotels or any manner of boarding they hired cottages at rents not so nominal as at first but not so very extravagant if you had not to keep the city rent going too and it finally seemed best to buy a cottage and stop the leak of the rent however small it was lindora did not count the interest on the purchasemoney or the taxes or the repairs or the winter caretaking  she was now living and is still living as most of her contemporaries and social equals are living not quite free of care but free of tiresome associations cramped rooms bad beds and bad food with an environment which you can perfectly control if you are willing to pay the price the situation is ideal to those without and if not ideal to those within it is nevertheless the best way of spending the hot season known to competitive civilization what is most interesting to the student of that civilization is the surprisingly short time in which it has been evolved half a century ago it was known only to some of the richest people a few very old and opulent families in new york had countryplaces on the hudson in boston the same class had summer houses at nahant or in pepperell the wealthy planters of the south came north to the hotels of saratoga lake george and niagara whither the vast majority of the fashionable northern people also resorted in the west it was the custom to leave home for a summer trip up the lakes or down the st lawrence but this was the custom only for the very sophisticated and even now in the west people do not summer outside of their winter homes to at all the same extent as in the east  the experience of florindo and lindora is easily parallelable in that of innumerable other married pairs of american race who were the primitive joke of the paragrapher and the caricaturist when the day of farmboarding began though the sun of that day has long set for florindo and lindora it seems to be still at the zenith for most young couples beginning life on their forgotten terms and the joke holds in its pristine freshness with the lowlier satirists who hunt the city boarder in the country and the seaside boardinghouses the florindos and the lindoras of a little greater age and better fortune abound in the summer hotels at the beaches and in the mountains though at the more worldly wateringplaces the cottagers have killed off the hotels as the graphic parlance has it the hotels nowhere perhaps flourish in their old vigor except for a brief six weeks when they are fairly full they languish along the rivers among the hills and even by the shores of the mournful and misty atlantic  the summer cottage in fine is what florindo and lindora have typically come to in so many cases that it may be regarded as the typical experience of the easily circumstanced american of the east if not of the west the slightest relaxation of the pressure of narrow domestic things seems to indicate it and the reader would probably be astonished to find what great numbers of people who are comparatively poor have summer cottages though the cottage in most cases is perhaps as much below the dignity of a real cottage as the sumptuous villas of newport are above it summer cottages with the great average of those who have them began in the slightest and simplest of shanties progressing toward those simulacra of houses aptly called shells and gradually arriving at picturesque structures prettily decorated with all the modern conveniences in which one may spend twothirds of the year and more of ones income than one has a quiet conscience in  it would not be so bad if one could live in them simply as lindora proposed doing when she made florindo buy hers for her but the graces of life cannot be had for nothing or anything like nothing and when you have a charming cottage and are living on city terms in it you have the wish to have people see you doing it this ambition leads to endless and rather aimless hospitality so that some lindoras have been known after keeping a private hotel in their cottages for a series of summers to shut them or let them and go abroad for a muchneeded rest leaving their florindos to their clubs as in the days of their youth or even allowing them to live in their own houses with their cooks  nothing in this world it seems is quite what we want it to be we ourselves are not all that we could wish and whatever shape our summering takes the crumpled roseleaf is there to disturb our repose the only people who have no crumpled roseleaves under them are those who have no repose but stay striving on amid the heat of the city while the prey of the crumpled roseleaf is suffering among the hills or by the sea those homekeeping sybarites composing seveneighths of our urban populations immune from the anguish of the roseleaf form themselves the pang of its victims in certain extreme cases the thought of them poisons the pure air and hums about the sleepless restseeker in the resorts where there are no mosquitoes there are florindos there are lindoras so sensitively conscienced that in the most picturesque the most prettily appointed and thoroughly convenienced cottages they cannot forget their fellowmortals in the summer hotels in the boardinghouses by sea or shore in the farms where they have small fruits fresh vegetables and abundance of milk and eggs yes they even remember those distant relations who toil and swelter in the offices the shops the streets the sewers and they are not without an unavailing shame for their own goodfortune  but is it really their goodfortune they would not exchange it for the better fortune of the homekeepers and yet it seems worse than that of people less voluntarily circumstanced there is nothing left for florindo and lindora to try except spending the summer on a yacht which they see many other florindos and lindoras doing even these gay voyagers or gay anchorers for they seem most of the time to be moored in safe harbors do not appear altogether to like their lot or to be so constantly contented with it but that they are always coming off in boats to dine at the neighboring hotels doubtless a yacht has a crumpled roseleaf under it and possibly the keelless hull of the houseboat feels the irk of a folded petal somewhere  florindo and lindora are not spoiled she is sure of that in her own case for she has never been unreasonably exacting of circumstance she has always tried to be more comfortable than she found herself but that is the condition of progress and it is from the perpetual endeavor for the amelioration of circumstance that civilization springs the fault may be with florindo in some way that she cannot see but it is certainly not with her and if it is not with him then it is with the summer which is a season so unreasonable that it will not allow itself to be satisfactorily disposed of in town it is intolerable in the mountains it is sultry by day and all but freezing by night at the seaside it is cold and wet or dry and cold there are flies and mosquitoes everywhere but in europe and with the bottom once out of europe you cannot go there without dropping through in lindoras experience the summer has had the deceitful effect of owning its riddle read at each new conjecture but having exhausted all her practical guesses she finds the summer still the mute inexorable sphinx for which neither farmboard boardinghouses hotels european sojourn nor cottaging is the true answer  sometimes florindo or lindora is out of all patience with the summer and in a despair which she is careful to share with florindo as far as she can make him a partner of it but as it is his business to provide the means of each new condition and hers to prove it impossible he is not apt to give way so fully as she he tells her that their trouble is that they have always endeavored to escape an ordeal which if frankly borne might not have been so bad and he has tried to make her believe that some of the best times he has had in summer have been when he was too busy to think about it she retorts that she is busy too from morning till night without finding the least relief from the summer ordeal or forgetting it a single moment  the other day he came home from the club with a beaming face and told her that he had just heard of a place where the summer was properly disposed of and she said that they would go there at once she did not care where it was  well i dont know he answered there would have to be two opinions i believe  why she demanded sharply where is it  in the other world fanshawe the swedenborgian was telling me about it in one of the celestial heavensthere seem to be seven of themit appears that all the four seasons are absorbed into one as all the different ages are absorbed into a sort of second youth this sole season is neither hot nor cold but has the quality of a perpetual springtime how would you like that  lindora was too vexed with him to make any answer and he was sorry he too felt the trouble of the summer more than he would allow and he would willingly have got away from it if he could lindoras impatience with it amused him but it is doubtful if in the moment of his greatest amusement with her impatience he had any glimpse of that law of the universal life by which no human creature is permitted to escape a due share of the responsibilities and burdens of the common lot or realized that to seek escape from them is a species of immorality which is unfailingly punished like any other sin in and from itself     ix  to have the honor of meeting   as the winter deepens and darkens the people who have time and money to waste and who are always seeking opportunities for squandering both find none so gracious and graceful as giving dinners to other people who have time and money to waste the prime condition of such dinners is that neither host nor guest shall need them the presence of a person who actually wanted meat and drink would imply certain insuperable disqualifications the guest must have the habit of dining with the accumulated indifference to dinners and the inveterate inability to deal peptically with them which result from the habit of them your true diner must be well on in middle life for though the young may eat and drink together and apparently dine it is of the gray head difficultly bowed over the successive courses and the full form of third youth straining its silken calyx and bursting all too richly out above it that the vision presents itself when one thinks of dinners and diners  after all the exclusions are made dinner is still a theme so large that one poor easy chair paper could not compass it or do more than attach itself here and there to its expanse in fact it was only one kind of dinner we had in mind at the beginning and that was the larger or smaller public dinner there the process of exclusion is carried yet a step further and the guests are all men and for the most part elderly men the exceptional public dinners where women are asked need not be counted and at other public dinners they do not seem eager to throng the galleries where they are handsomely privileged to sit looking down among the sculptured and frescoed arabesques on the sea of bald heads and shirtfronts that surge about the tables below and showing like dim décolleté angels to the bleared vision raised to them from the floor as they are not expected to appear till the smoking and speaking have begun they grow fainter and fainter through the clouds of tobacco and oratory and it is never known to the diners whether they abuse the chary hospitality of coffee and ices offered them in their skyey height where from time to time the sympathetic ear may hear them softly gasping gently coughing  it is a pity that none of these witnesses of a large public dinner has recorded her birdseye impression of it at the interesting moment when their presence is suffered or desired all those gray or bald heads and all those bulging shirtfronts must look alike at the first glance and it can be only to carefuler scrutiny that certain distinctions of projecting whiskers and mustaches pronounce themselves the various figures lax or stiff in their repletion must more or less repeat one another and the pudgy hands resting heavily on the tables edges or planted on their owners thighs must seem of a very characterless monotony the poor old fellows ranked in serried sameness at the tables slanted or curved from the dais where the chairman and the speakers sit must have one effect of wishing themselves at home in bed  what do they really think of it those angels leaning over and looking down on it does it strike them with envy with admiration does it seem one of the last effects of a high and noble civilization to their finer female sense what is the appeal of that evanescing spectacle as the noise of the cheering and the laughing and the clapping of hands rises to them at some more rocketlike explosion of oratory is the oratory mainly of the same quality to those supernal intelligences as the fading spectacle none of them has said and we may have still the hope that the whole affair may have seemed to them the splendid and graceful ceremonial which it appears in the illustrations of the next days papers  the speaking is perhaps not always so good as it seems to the mellowed tolerance of the listener when it begins after all those courses of meat and drink but not perhaps always so bad as he thinks it when the morning following he wakes high sorrowful and cloyed and has not yet read the reports of it in confidence however it may be owned that it is apt rather to be bad than good if what has led up to it has softened the critical edge of the listener it has not sharpened the critical edge of the speaker and they meet on the common ground where any platitude passes where a farrago of funny stories serves the purpose of coherent humor where any feeble flash of wit lights up the obscurity as with an electric radiance where any slightest trickle or rinsing of sentiment refreshes the burning forehead and the parching tongue like a gush of genuine poetry the mere reputation of the speaker goes a great way almost the whole way and especially if he is a comic speaker he might rise up and sit down without a word and yet leave his hearers the sense of having been richly amused if he does more if he really says something droll no matter how much below the average of the give and take of common talk the listeners gratitude is frantic it is so eager it so outruns utterance that it is not strange the afterdinner speech should be the favorite field of the fakehumorist who reaps a full and everripened harvest in it and prospers on to a celebrity for brilliancy which there is little danger of his ever forfeiting so long as he keeps there  the fakehumorous speaker has an easier career than even the fakeeloquent speaker yet at any given dinner the orator who passes out mere elocution to his hearers has a success almost as instant and splendid as his clowning brother it is amazing what things people will applaud when they have the courage of one anothers ineptitude they will listen after dinner to anything but reason they prefer also the old speakers to new ones they like the familiar taps of humor of eloquence if they have tasted the brew before they know what they are going to get the note of their mood is tolerance but tolerance of the accustomed the expected not tolerance of the novel the surprising they wish to be at rest and what taxes their minds molests their intellectual repose they do not wish to climb any great heights to reach the level of the orator perhaps after all they are difficult in their torpidity  the oratory seems to vary less throughout any given dinner than from dinner to dinner and it seems better or worse according as the dinner is occasional or personal the occasional dinner is in observance of some notable event as the landing of the pilgrims or the surrender of cornwallis or the invention of gunpowder or the discovery of america its nature invites the orator to a great range of talk he may browse at large in all the fields of verbiage without seeming to break bounds it rests with him of course to decide whether he will talk too long for the danger that he may do so cannot be guarded from the outside the only good afterdinner speaker is the man who likes to speak and the man who likes to speak is always apt to speak too much the hapless wretch whom the chairman drags to his feet in a cold perspiration of despair and who blunders through half a dozen mismated sentences leaving out whatever he meant to say is not to be feared he is to be pitied from the bottom of ones soul but the man whose words come actively to the support of his thoughts and whose last word suggests to him another thought he is the speaker to be feared and yet not feared the worst of all there is another speaker more dreadful still who thinks as little standing as sitting and whose words come reluctantly but who keeps on and on in the vain hope of being able to say something before he stops and so cannot stop  the speaking at the occasional dinner however is much more in the control of the chairman than the speaking at the personal dinner the old fashion of toasts is pretty well past but the chairman still appoints more or less the subject of the speaker he calls up he may say if the dinner is in honor of the invention of gunpowder we have with us tonight a distinguished soldier who has burned a good deal of gunpowder in his time and i am sure we should all like to hear from general jones something of his experience with the new smokeless explosives or if it is the discovery of america they are commemorating he may call to his feet some representatively venerable citizen with a wellearned compliment to his antiquity and the humorous suggestion that he was personally knowing to the landing of columbus then general jones or the venerable citizen will treat at his pleasure of any subject under heaven after having made his manners to that given him by the chairman and professed his unfitness to handle it  at the personal dinner the speaker must in decency stick for a while at least to his text which is always the high achievement of the honored guest in law letters medicine arms drainage drygoods poultryfarming or whatever he must not at once turn his back on the honored guest and talk of other things and when sometimes he does so it seems rude  the menu laid before the diner at this sort of dinner may report a variety of food for the others but for the honored guest the sole course is taffy with plenty of drawn butter in a lordly dish the honored guest is put up beside the chairman with his mouth propped open for the taffy and before the end he is streaming drawn butter from every limb the chairman has poured it over him with a generous ladle in his opening speech and each speaker bathes him with it anew from the lordly dish the several speakers try to surpass one another in the application searching out some corner or crevice of his personality which has escaped the previous orators and filling it up to overflowing the listeners exult with them in their discoveries and roar at each triumph of the sort it is apparently a proof of brilliant intuition when a speaker seizes upon some forgotten point in the honored guests character or career and drenches it with drawn butter  to what good end do men so flatter and befool one of their harmless fellows what is there in the nature of literary or agricultural achievement which justifies the outrage of his modest sense of inadequacy it is a preposterous performance but it does not reach the climax of its absurdity till the honored guest rises with his mouth filled with taffy and dripping drawn butter all over the place proceeds to ladle out from the lordly dish restored to its place before the chairman a portion for each of the preceding speakers he may not feel quite like doing it in their fierce rivalry of adulation some of them in order to give fresh flavor to the taffy may have mingled a little vinegar with it one may have said that the bantams of the honored guest were not perhaps as small as some other bantams but that the colossal size of his shanghais was beyond parallel another may have hinted for the purpose of superiorly praising his masterly treatment of the pip that the diet of his hens was not such as to impart to their eggs the last exquisite flavor demanded by the pampered palate of the epicure another yet may have admitted that the honored guest had not successfully grappled with the great question of how to make hens lay every workingday of the year and he may have done this in order to heighten his grand climax that the man who teaches a hen to lay an egg with two yolks where she laid eggs of but one yolk before is a greater benefactor to the human race than all the inventors of all the missiles of modern warfare such a poultryfarmer he may have declared preparatory to taking his seat amid thunders of applause is to other poultryfarmers what the poet who makes the songs of a people is to the boss who makes their laws this sentiment may have been met with a furore of acceptance all the other guests leaning forward to look at the honored guest and concentrate their applause upon him as they clapped and cheered and one fine fellow springing to his feet and shouting heres to the man who made twoyolk eggs grow where oneyolk eggs grew before  yet these artfully studied qualifications of the cloying sweet may have been all of the taste of wormwood to the honored guest who cared nothing for his easy triumph with shanghais and the pip and these twoyolk eggs but prided himself on his bantams and his henfood and was clinging to the hope that his discoveries in the higher education would teach hens to observe the legal holidays if they could not be taught to lay on every workingday and was trusting to keep his measure of failure a secret from the world it would not do however to betray anything of his vexation that would be ungracious and ungrateful and so he must render back taffy for taffy drawn butter for drawn butter till the whole place sticks and reeks with it  of course the readerespecially if he has never been asked to a personal dinner of this sortwill be saying that the fault is not with the solemnity or its nature but with the taste of those who conduct the ceremony he will no doubt be thinking that if he were ever made the object of such a solemnity or the chairman or the least of the speakers he would manage differently very likely he will allege the example of the greeks as we have it recorded in the accounts of the banquet offered to themistocles after the battle of salamis and the supper given to Æschylus on the hundredth performance of the oedipus of sophocles  the supper has always been considered rather a refinement upon the banquet in taste as it was offered to the venerable poet not upon the occasion of any achievement of his own but in recognition of the prolonged triumph of his brother dramatist in which it was assumed that he would feel a generous interest the banquet to themistocles was more in the nature of a public rejoicing for it celebrated a victory due as much to the valor of all the greeks as to the genius of the admiral and it could therefore be made more directly a compliment to him even under these circumstances however the guest of the evening occupied an inconspicuous place at the reporters table while he was represented on the chairmans right by the bust of poseidon hastily modelled for the occasion by praxiteles and dedicated to themistocles who was a plain man but whose portrait even if he had been handsome it was thought would not have looked well in such a position at a time when portraitstatuary was unknown the only direct allusion to him was in the opening toast the dewey of our day which was drunk sitting the guests rising from their recumbent postures in honor of it the chairmans opening address was almost wholly a plea for the enlargement of the athenian navy the implication that the republic had been saved in spite of its inefficient armament was accepted as the finest possible compliment to the guest of the evening the note of all the other speeches was their exquisite impersonality they got further and further from the occasion of the evening until the effort of demosthenes closed the speaking with a scathing denunciation of the machine politicians who had involved the athenians in a war with persia to further the interests of sparta it was held that this was the noblest tribute which could be paid to the genius of the man who had brought them safely out of it as the company broke up diogenes with his lantern approached themistocles who was giving the reporters copies of the speech he had not been asked to deliver and after examining his countenance with a sigh of disappointment accompanied him home as far as his own tub athens at that time being imperfectly lighted and the reform government having not yet replaced the street names wantonly obliterated under the régime of the thirty tyrants  at the supper to Æschylus the tablets of the menu were inscribed with verses from the elder poet ingeniously chosen for their imaginable reference to the masterpiece of the younger whose modesty was delicately spared at every point it was a question whether the committee managing the affair had not perhaps gone too far in giving the supper while sophocles was away from athens staging the piece at corinth but there was no division of opinion as to the taste with which some of the details had been studied it was considered a stroke of inspiration to have on the speakers left where sophocles would have sat if he had been present at a supper given to Æschylus the sitting figure of melpomene crowned with rosemary for remembrance no allusion was made to Æschylus during the evening after his health had been proposed by the chairman and drunk in silence but a great and exquisite surprise was reserved for him in the matter of the speeches that followed by prior agreement among the speakers they were all ostensibly devoted to the examination of the oedipus and the other dramas of sophocles which in his absence were very frankly dealt with but the unsparing criticism of their defects was made implicitly to take the character of appreciation of the Æschylus tragedies whose good points were all turned to the light without open mention of them this afforded the aged poet an opportunity of magnanimously defending his younger confrère and he rose to the occasion beaming as some one said from head to foot and oozing selfsatisfaction at every pore he could not put from him the compliments not ostensibly directed at him but he could and did take up the criticisms of the sophoclean drama point by point and refute them in the interest of literature with a masterly elimination of himself and his own part in it a roman gentleman present remarked that he had seen nothing like it for sincere deprecation since cæsar had refused the thriceoffered crown on the lupercal and the effect was that intended throughoutthe supreme honor of Æschylus in the guise of a tribute to sophocles the note of the whole affair was struck by the comic poet aristophanes whom the chairman called upon to make the closing speech of the evening and who merely sat up long enough to quote the old attic proverb gentlemen there are many ways to kill a dog besides choking him to death with butter and then lay down again amid shrieks of merriment from the whole company  there is perhaps a middle course between the american and athenian ways of recognizing achievement in the arts or interests or of commemorating great public events this would probably derive from each certain advantages or at least the ancient might temper the modern world to a little more restraint than it now practises in the celebration of private worth especially the public events may be more safely allowed to take care of themselves though it is to be questioned whether it is well for any people to make overmuch of themselves they cannot do it without making themselves ridiculous and perhaps making themselves sick of what little real glory there is in any given affair they will have got that so inextricably mixed up with the vainglory that they will have to reject the one to free themselves from the humiliating memory of the other  there is nothing that so certainly turns to shame in the retrospect as vainglory and this is what the personal dinner is chiefly supposed to inspire in the victim of it if he is at all honest with himself and he probably is before he can have done anything worthy of notice he knows perfectly well that he has not merited all if any of the fond flatteries with which he is heaped as he sits helpless with meat and drink and suffers under them with the fatuous smile which we all have seen and which some of us have worn but as the flatterers keep coming on and on each with his garland of tuberoses or sunflowers he begins to think that there must be some fire where there is so much smoke and to feel the glow of the flame which he is not able exactly to locate he burns in sympathy with his ardent votaries he becomes inevitably a partner in his own apotheosis it is the office of the sad cold morrow and the sadder and colder aftermorrows to undo this illusion to compress his head to the measure of his hat to remove the drawn butter from his soul  they may never wholly succeed but this is not probable and it is not against a permanent folie des grandeurs that we need seek to guard the victim of a personal dinner we have indeed so much faith in the ultimate discretion of the race that we should be quite willing to intrust the remarkable man himself with the office of giving himself a public dinner when he felt that his work merited signal recognition in this way the whole affair could be kept within bounds he could strike the note he could set the pace in his opening address and having appointed the speakers with a full knowledge of their honesty and subordination he could trust the speeches to be sane and temperate in calling the speakers successively up he could protest against anything that seemed excessive eulogy in the words already spoken and could invite a more modest estimate of his qualities and achievements in the speeches to follow     x  a day at bronx park   in the beginning of the season which is called silly in the world of journalism because the outer vacuity then responds to the inner and the empty brain vainly interrogates the empty environment for something to write of two friends of the easy chair offered to spend a holiday in search of material for a paper the only conditions they made were that the easy chair should not exact material of weight or importance but should gratefully accept whatever they brought back to it and make the most of it on these terms they set out on their labor of love                                       by the time the sun had quitted the face of the vast apartmenthouse on which the day habitually broke and had gone about its business of lighting and heating the city roofs and streets the holiday companions were well on their way up the third avenue elevated toward that region of the bronx which in all their new york years they had never yet visited they exulted at each stop and start of the train in the long succession of streets which followed so fast upon one another that the guards gave up trying to call them out as a hundredandsomany and simply said fiftyfifth and sixtysixth and seventyseventh street this slight of their duty to the public comported agreeably with the slipshod effectiveness of the whole apparatus of the new york life the rows and rows of shops the rows and rows of flats the rows and rows of back yards with miles of wash flying in the soft may wind which probably the people in the open car ahead felt almost a gale  when the train got as far as the composite ugliness of the ships and tugs and drawbridges of harlem river the companions accepted the ensemble as picturesqueness and did not require beauty of it once they did get beauty in a certain civic building which fronted the track and let fall a double stairway from its level in a way to recall the spanish steps and to get itself likened to the trinità de monti at rome  it was of course like that only in their fond remembrance but this was not the only roman quality in their cup of pleasure that day and they did not care to inquire whether it was merely the flavoring extract of fancy or was a genuine infusion from the italian sky overhead the classic architectural forms the loosely straggling grass the flowering woods the rapture of the birds the stretches of the river the tumbling rapids which so delicately intoxicated them there was a certain fountain gave a peculiar authenticity to their pleasure as of some assurance blown in the bottle from which their joydraught was poured nowhere else but in rome could they have imagined such a group of bronze men and maidens and webfooted horses struggling so bravely so aimlessly except to show their figures in a shallow bowl from which the water spilled so unstintedly over white marble brims beginning to paint themselves palely green  at the end of their glad day this fountain came last of the things that made bronx park such a paradise for eight hours though it might have been their first delight if they had taken one way about instead of another in their tour of the large easy pleasance but suddenly at halfpast eleven they found themselves ravenously hungry and demanded to be driven to the best restaurant by the shortest way that the mild youth whom they fell to at once inside the park gate could find  he had the very horse he ought to have hadold weary infirm decently hiding its disabilities under a blanket and when this was stripped away confessing them in a start so reluctant that they had to be explained as the stiffness natural to any young strong and fresh horse from resting too long it did in fact become more animated as time went on and perhaps it began to take an interest in the landscape left so charmingly wild wherever it could be it apparently liked being alive there with its fares kindred spirits who could appreciate the privacy of a bland monday after the popular outing of the day before almost nobody else was in the park for a time they noted only a young fellow with a shut book in his hand taking his way up a woody slope and fading into a green shadow but presently they came to a grassy point running down to the road where under a tree there was a young mother sitting with an open book in her lap and a little way from her outstretched little foot her baby asleep in the smallest of gocartsthe collapsible sort that you can fold and carry in the cars and then unfold for use when you come to the right place the baby had a white sunbonnet and a thick fringe of her strawcolored hair came out over her forehead under it and when the companions smiled together at the baby and the horse intelligently faltered the young mother fluttered the idle leaves of her book with her hand and smiled back at them and took the credit of the little one not unkindly yet proudly they said it was all as nice as it could be and they were still so content in her and her baby that when they had to drive out of the park to cross a street to the section where the restaurant and the menagerie were they waited deferentially for a long long funeral to get by they felt pity for the bereaved and then admiration for people who could afford to have so many carriages and they made their driver ask the mounted policeman whose funeral it was he addressed the policeman by name and the companions felt included in the circle of an acquaintance where a good deal of domesticity seemed to prevail the policeman would not join in the conjecture that it was some distinguished person he did not give his reasons and the pair began to fret at their delay and mentally to hurry that poor unknown undergroundso short is our patience with the dead when at last their driver went up round the endless queue of hacks it suddenly came to an end and they were again in the park and among the cages and pens and ranges of the animals in the midst of which their own restaurant appeared an italian band of mandolins and guitars was already at noonday softly murmuring and whimpering in the corner of the veranda where the tables were set and they got an amiable old waiter whose fault it was not if springlamb matures so early in the summer of its brief term as to seem lastfalllamb there is no good reason either to suppose he did not really believe in the pease but why will pease that know they have been the whole winter in the can pretend to be just out of the pod doubtless it is for every implication that all vegetation is of one ichor with humanity but the waiter was honester than the pease he telephoned for two wheeled chairs and then said he had countermanded them because they would be half an hour coming but again he telephoned for by this time the pair had learned that they might drive into the zoological grounds but not drive round them and they saw from the window the sun smoking hot on the asphalt paths their feet must press  illustration zoÖlogical gardens bronx park  while the chairs lingered on the way they went to get what comfort they could from the bears whose house was near at hand they might well have learned patience here from a bear trying to cope with a mocking cask in a pool he pushed it under the water with his paw and held it hard down when he turned away as if that cask were done for there it was bobbing about on the surface and he had to down it again and hold it under till life seemed extinct at last he gave it up and left it floating in triumph but one could infer with what perseverance he would renew the struggle presently  there might have been too many bears but this was the fault of all their fellowcaptives except perhaps the elephants one cannot really have enough of elephants and one would have liked a whole herd of giraffes and a whole troop of gnus would not have glutted ones pleasure in their goatfaces cowheads horsetails and pigfeet but why so many snakes of a kind why such a multiplicity of crocodiles why even more than one of that special pattern of mexican iguana which looked as if cut out of zinc and painted a dull paris green why above all so many small mammals  small mammals was the favorite phrase of the friendly colored chairman who by this time had appeared with an oldsoldier comrade and was pushing the companions about from house to house and cage to cage small mammals he warned them were of an offensive odor and he was right but he was proud of them and of such scientific knowledge of them as he had the old soldier did not pretend to have any such knowledge he fell into a natural subordination and let his colored superior lead the way mostly though he asserted the principle that this is a white mans country by pushing first to the lions house instead of going to the flyingcage as his dark comrade instructed him  it was his sole revolt but what we hear the reader asking is the flyingcage we have not come to that yet we are lingering still at the lions house where two of the most amiable lions in the world smilingly illustrate the effect of civilization in such of their savage species as are born in the genial captivity of bronx park we are staying a moment in the cool stone stable of the elephants and the rhinoceroses and the hippopotamuses we are fondly clinging to the wires of the cages where the hermitthrushes snatched from their loved solitude and mixed with an indiscriminate company of bolder birds tune their angelic notes only in a tentative staccato we are standing rapt before the awful bellbird ringing his sharp unchanging unceasing peal as unconscious of us as if he had us in the heart of his tropical forest we are waiting for the mighty blue brazilian macaw to catch our names and syllable them to the shrieking shrilling snarling society of parrots trapezing and acrobating about him we are even stopping to see the white peahen wearing her heart out and her tail out against her imprisoning wires we are delaying to let the flyingcage burst upon us in the unrivalled immensity promised that is we are doing all this in the personalities of those holiday companions who generously found the cage as wide and high as their chairmen wished and gratefully gloated upon its pelicans and storks and cranes and swans and wild geese and woodducks and curlews and seapigeons and gulls and whatever other waterfowl soars and swims it was well they felt to have had this kept for the last with its great lesson of a communistic captivity in which all nations of men might be cooped together in amity and equality instead of being as now shut up each in his own cell of need and fear  not having come in an automobile the companions were forced by an invidious regulation to find their carriage outside the gate of the concourse but neither the horse nor the driver seemed to feel the slight of the discrimination they started off to complete the round of the park with all their morning cheerfulness and more for they had now added several dollars to their tariff of charges by the delay of their fares and they might well be gayer their fares did not refuse to share their mood and when they crossed the bronx and came into the region of the walks and drives they were even gayer than their horse and man these were more used to the smooth level of the river where it stretched itself out between its meadowy shores and mirrored the blue heaven rough with dusky white clouds in its bosom they could not feel as their fares did the novelty in the beauty of that hollow that wide grassy cup by which they drove bathed in the flowery and blossomy sweetness that filled it to its woodbordered brim  but what is the use of counting one by one the joys of a day so richly jewelled with delight rather let us heap them at once in the readers lap and not try to part the recurrence of the levelbranched dogwoods in bloom the sunny and the shadowy reaches of the woods still in the silken filminess of their fresh young leaves the grass springing slenderly tenderly on the unmown slopes of the roadsides or giving up its life in spicy sweetness from the scythe the gardeners pausing from their leisurely employ and once in the person of their foreman touching their hats to the companions the wistariagarlanded cottage of the keeper of the estate now ceded to the city the gothic stable of the former proprietor looking like a gothic chapel in its dell the stone mansion on its height opening to curiosity a vague collection of minerals and recalling with its dim hardwood interior the ineffectual state of a time already further outdated than any colonial prime the old snuffmill of the founders hard by the dam breaking into foam in the valley below the rustic bridge crossing from shore to shore with steelengraving figures leaning on its parapet and other steelengraving presences by the waters brink  the supreme charm is that you are so free to all things in that generous park that you may touch them and test them by every sense that you may stray among the trees and lie down upon the grass and possess yourself indiscriminately of them quite as if they were your own  they are indeed yours in the nobler sense of public proprietorship which will one day no doubt supersede all private ownership you have your share of the lands and waters the birds in the cages and the beasts from the lions and elephants in their palaces and the giraffes freely browsing and grazing in their paddock down to the smallest of the small mammals giving their odor in their pens you have as much right as another to the sculptures all handcarved as your colored chairman will repeatedly tell you on the mansions of the lordlier brutes and there is none to dispute your just portion of the parisgreen zinc iguana for you have helped pay for them all  the keyword of this reflection makes you anxious to find whether your driver will make you pay him too much but when you tot up the hours by his tariff and timidly suggest that it will be so many dollars and offer him a bill for the same he surprises you by saying no he owes you fifty cents on that and paying it back  such at least was the endearing experience of the companions at the end of their days pleasure not that it was really the end for there was the airy swoop homeward in the elevated train through all that ugly picturesqueness of bridges and boats and blocks of buildings with the added interest of seeing the backflying streets below now full of children let loose from school for the afternoon and possessing the roadways and sidewalks as if these too were common property like the park it seemed to the companions that the children increased toward the shabbier waterside and decreased wherever the houses looked better through that mystical law of population by which poverty is richer than prosperity is in children they could see them yelling and screaming at their games though they could not hear them and they yelled and screamed the louder to the eye because they were visibly for the greatest part boys if they were the offspring of alien parents they might be a proof of american decay but on the other hand the preponderance of boys was in repair of that disproportion of the sexes which in the east of these states is such a crying evil  perhaps it was the behavior of the child in the opposite seat which made the companions think of girls as a crying evil the mental operations are so devious and capricious but this child was really a girl she was a pretty child and prettily dressed with a little face full of a petulant and wilful charm which might well have been too much for her weak meek young mother she wanted to be leaning more than half out of the window and looking both ways at once and she fought away the feebly restraining hands with sharp birdlike shrieks so that the companions expected every moment to see her succeed in dashing herself to death and suffered many things from their fear when it seemed as if nothing could save them the guard came in and told the weak meek mother that the child must not lean out of the window instantly such is the force of all constituted authority among us the child sat down quietly in her mothers lap and for the rest of the journey remained an example to angels so that the companions could rejoice as much in her goodness as in her loveliness she became indeed the crown of their happy day a day so happy that now in the faint air of august it is hard to believe it even of may   the end
