12151137	the god of his fathers tales of the klondyke   contents  the god of his fathers the great interrogation which make men remember siwash the man with the gash jan the unrepentant grit of women where the trail forks a daughter of the aurora at the rainbows end the scorn of women  these tales have appeared in mcclures ainslees outing the overland monthly the wave the national and the san francisco examiner  to the kindness of the various editors is due their reappearance in more permanent form  to the daughters of the wolf who have bred and suckled a race of men     the god of his fathers   i   on every hand stretched the forest primevalthe home of noisy comedy and silent tragedy  here the struggle for survival continued to wage with all its ancient brutality  briton and russian were still to overlap in the land of the rainbows endand this was the very heart of itnor had yankee gold yet purchased its vast domain  the wolfpack still clung to the flank of the caribooherd singling out the weak and the big with calf and pulling them down as remorselessly as were it a thousand thousand generations into the past  the sparse aborigines still acknowledged the rule of their chiefs and medicine men drove out bad spirits burned their witches fought their neighbors and ate their enemies with a relish which spoke well of their bellies  but it was at the moment when the stone age was drawing to a close  already over unknown trails and chartless wildernesses were the harbingers of the steel arrivingfairfaced blueeyed indomitable men incarnations of the unrest of their race  by accident or design singlehanded and in twos and threes they came from no one knew whither and fought or died or passed on no one knew whence  the priests raged against them the chiefs called forth their fighting men and stone clashed with steel but to little purpose  like water seeping from some mighty reservoir they trickled through the dark forests and mountain passes threading the highways in bark canoes or with their moccasined feet breaking trail for the wolfdogs  they came of a great breed and their mothers were many but the furclad denizens of the northland had this yet to learn  so many an unsung wanderer fought his last and died under the cold fire of the aurora as did his brothers in burning sands and reeking jungles and as they shall continue to do till in the fulness of time the destiny of their race be achieved  it was near twelve  along the northern horizon a rosy glow fading to the west and deepening to the east marked the unseen dip of the midnight sun  the gloaming and the dawn were so commingled that there was no nightsimply a wedding of day with day a scarcely perceptible blending of two circles of the sun  a kildee timidly chirped goodnight the full rich throat of a robin proclaimed goodmorrow  from an island on the breast of the yukon a colony of wild fowl voiced its interminable wrongs while a loon laughed mockingly back across a still stretch of river  in the foreground against the bank of a lazy eddy birchbark canoes were lined two and three deep  ivorybladed spears bonebarbed arrows buckskinthonged bows and simple basketwoven traps bespoke the fact that in the muddy current of the river the salmonrun was on  in the background from the tangle of skin tents and drying frames rose the voices of the fisher folk  bucks skylarked with bucks or flirted with the maidens while the older squaws shut out from this by virtue of having fulfilled the end of their existence in reproduction gossiped as they braided rope from the green roots of trailing vines  at their feet their naked progeny played and squabbled or rolled in the muck with the tawny wolfdogs  to one side of the encampment and conspicuously apart from it stood a second camp of two tents  but it was a white mans camp  if nothing else the choice of position at least bore convincing evidence of this in case of offence it commanded the indian quarters a hundred yards away of defence a rise to the ground and the cleared intervening space and last of defeat the swift slope of a score of yards to the canoes below  from one of the tents came the petulant cry of a sick child and the crooning song of a mother  in the open over the smouldering embers of a fire two men held talk  eh  i love the church like a good son  bien  so great a love that my days have been spent in fleeing away from her and my nights in dreaming dreams of reckoning  look you  the halfbreeds voice rose to an angry snarl  i am red river born  my father was whiteas white as you  but you are yankee and he was british bred and a gentlemans son and my mother was the daughter of a chief and i was a man  ay and one had to look the second time to see what manner of blood ran in my veins for i lived with the whites and was one of them and my fathers heart beat in me  it happened there was a maidenwhitewho looked on me with kind eyes  her father had much land and many horses also he was a big man among his people and his blood was the blood of the french  he said the girl knew not her own mind and talked overmuch with her and became wroth that such things should be  but she knew her mind for we came quick before the priest  and quicker had come her father with lying words false promises i know not what so that the priest stiffened his neck and would not make us that we might live one with the other  as at the beginning it was the church which would not bless my birth so now it was the church which refused me marriage and put the blood of men upon my hands  bien  thus have i cause to love the church  so i struck the priest on his womans mouth and we took swift horses the girl and i to fort pierre where was a minister of good heart  but hot on our trail was her father and brothers and other men he had gathered to him  and we fought our horses on the run till i emptied three saddles and the rest drew off and went on to fort pierre  then we took east the girl and i to the hills and forests and we lived one with the other and we were not marriedthe work of the good church which i love like a son  but mark you for this is the strangeness of woman the way of which no man may understand  one of the saddles i emptied was that of her fathers and the hoofs of those who came behind had pounded him into the earth  this we saw the girl and i and this i had forgot had she not remembered  and in the quiet of the evening after the days hunt were done it came between us and in the silence of the night when we lay beneath the stars and should have been one  it was there always  she never spoke but it sat by our fire and held us ever apart  she tried to put it aside but at such times it would rise up till i could read it in the look of her eyes in the very intake of her breath  so in the end she bore me a child a womanchild and died  then i went among my mothers people that it might nurse at a warm breast and live but my hands were wet with the blood of men look you because of the church wet with the blood of men  and the riders of the north came for me but my mothers brother who was then chief in his own right hid me and gave me horses and food  and we went away my womanchild and i even to the hudson bay country where white men were few and the questions they asked not many  and i worked for the company a hunter as a guide as a driver of dogs till my womanchild was become a woman tall and slender and fair to the eye  you know the winter long and lonely breeding evil thoughts and bad deeds  the chief factor was a hard man and bold  and he was not such that a woman would delight in looking upon  but he cast eyes upon my womanchild who was become a woman  mother of god he sent me away on a long trip with the dogs that he mightyou understand he was a hard man and without heart  she was most white and her soul was white and a good woman andwell she died  it was bitter cold the night of my return and i had been away months and the dogs were limping sore when i came to the fort  the indians and breeds looked on me in silence and i felt the fear of i knew not what but i said nothing till the dogs were fed and i had eaten as a man with work before him should  then i spoke up demanding the word and they shrank from me afraid of my anger and what i should do but the story came out the pitiful story word for word and act for act and they marvelled that i should be so quiet  when they had done i went to the factors house calmer than now in the telling of it  he had been afraid and called upon the breeds to help him but they were not pleased with the deed and had left him to lie on the bed he had made  so he had fled to the house of the priest  thither i followed  but when i was come to that place the priest stood in my way and spoke soft words and said a man in anger should go neither to the right nor left but straight to god  i asked by the right of a fathers wrath that he give me past but he said only over his body and besought with me to pray  look you it was the church always the church for i passed over his body and sent the factor to meet my woman child before his god which is a bad god and the god of the white men  then was there hue and cry for word was sent to the station below and i came away  through the land of the great slave down the valley of the mackenzie to the neveropening ice over the white rockies past the great curve of the yukon even to this place did i come  and from that day to this yours is the first face of my fathers people i have looked upon  may it be the last  these people which are my people are a simple folk and i have been raised to honor among them  my word is their law and their priests but do my bidding else would i not suffer them  when i speak for them i speak for myself  we ask to be let alone we do not want your kind  if we permit you to sit by our fires after you will come your church your priests and your gods  and know this for each white man who comes to my village him will i make deny his god you are the first and i give you grace  so it were well you go and go quickly  i am not responsible for my brothers the second man spoke up filling his pipe in a meditative manner  hay stockard was at times as thoughtful of speech as he was wanton of action but only at times  but i know your breed responded the other  your brothers are many and it is you and yours who break the trail for them to follow  in time they shall come to possess the land but not in my time  already have i heard are they on the headreaches of the great river and far away below are the russians  hay stockard lifted his head with a quick start  this was startling geographical information  the hudson bay post at fort yukon had other notions concerning the course of the river believing it to flow into the arctic  then the yukon empties into bering sea he asked  i do not know but below there are russians many russians  which is neither here nor there  you may go on and see for yourself you may go back to your brothers but up the koyukuk you shall not go while the priests and fighting men do my bidding  thus do i command i baptiste the red whose word is law and who am head man over this people  and should i not go down to the russians or back to my brothers  then shall you go swiftfooted before your god which is a bad god and the god of the white men  the red sun shot up above the northern skyline dripping and bloody baptiste the red came to his feet nodded curtly and went back to his camp amid the crimson shadows and the singing of the robins  hay stockard finished his pipe by the fire picturing in smoke and coal the unknown upper reaches of the koyukuk the strange stream which ended here its arctic travels and merged its waters with the muddy yukon flood somewhere up there if the dying words of a shipwrecked sailorman who had made the fearful overland journey were to be believed and if the vial of golden grains in his pouch attested anythingsomewhere up there in that home of winter stood the treasure house of the north  and as keeper of the gate baptiste the red english halfbreed and renegade barred the way  bah  he kicked the embers apart and rose to his full height arms lazily outstretched facing the flushing north with careless soul    ii   hay stockard swore harshly in the rugged monosyllables of his mother tongue  his wife lifted her gaze from the pots and pans and followed his in a keen scrutiny of the river  she was a woman of the teslin country wise in the ways of her husbands vernacular when it grew intensive  from the slipping of a snowshoe thong to the forefront of sudden death she could gauge occasion by the pitch and volume of his blasphemy  so she knew the present occasion merited attention  a long canoe with paddles flashing back the rays of the westering sun was crossing the current from above and urging in for the eddy  hay stockard watched it intently  three men rose and dipped rose and dipped in rhythmical precision but a red bandanna wrapped about the head of one caught and held his eye  bill he called  oh bill  a shambling loosejointed giant rolled out of one of the tents yawning and rubbing the sleep from his eyes  then he sighted the strange canoe and was wide awake on the instant  by the jumping methuselah  that damned skypilot  hay stockard nodded his head bitterly halfreached for his rifle then shrugged his shoulders  potshot him bill suggested and settle the thing out of hand  hell spoil us sure if we dont  but the other declined this drastic measure and turned away at the same time bidding the woman return to her work and calling bill back from the bank  the two indians in the canoe moored it on the edge of the eddy while its white occupant conspicuous by his gorgeous headgear came up the bank  like paul of tarsus i give you greeting  peace be unto you and grace before the lord  his advances were met sullenly and without speech  to you hay stockard blasphemer and philistine greeting  in your heart is the lust of mammon in your mind cunning devils in your tent this woman whom you live with in adultery yet of these divers sins even here in the wilderness i sturges owen apostle to the lord bid you to repent and cast from you your iniquities  save your cant  save your cant hay stockard broke in testily  youll need all youve got and more for red baptiste over yonder  he waved his hand toward the indian camp where the halfbreed was looking steadily across striving to make out the newcomers  sturges owen disseminator of light and apostle to the lord stepped to the edge of the steep and commanded his men to bring up the camp outfit  stockard followed him  look here he demanded plucking the missionary by the shoulder and twirling him about  do you value your hide  my life is in the lords keeping and i do but work in his vineyard he replied solemnly  oh stow that  are you looking for a job of martyrship  if he so wills  well youll find it right here but im going to give you some advice first  take it or leave it  if you stop here youll be cut off in the midst of your labors  and not you alone but your men bill my wife  who is a daughter of belial and hearkeneth not to the true gospel  and myself  not only do you bring trouble upon yourself but upon us  i was frozen in with you last winter as you will well recollect and i know you for a good man and a fool  if you think it your duty to strive with the heathen well and good but do exercise some wit in the way you go about it  this man red baptiste is no indian  he comes of our common stock is as bullnecked as i ever dared be and as wild a fanatic the one way as you are the other  when you two come together hellll be to pay and i dont care to be mixed up in it  understand  so take my advice and go away  if you go downstream youll fall in with the russians  theres bound to be greek priests among them and theyll see you safe through to bering seathats where the yukon emptiesand from there it wont be hard to get back to civilization  take my word for it and get out of here as fast as godll let you  he who carries the lord in his heart and the gospel in his hand hath no fear of the machinations of man or devil the missionary answered stoutly  i will see this man and wrestle with him  one backslider returned to the fold is a greater victory than a thousand heathen  he who is strong for evil can be as mighty for good witness saul when he journeyed up to damascus to bring christian captives to jerusalem  and the voice of the saviour came to him crying saul saul why persecutest thou me  and therewith paul arrayed himself on the side of the lord and thereafter was most mighty in the saving of souls  and even as thou paul of tarsus even so do i work in the vineyard of the lord bearing trials and tribulations scoffs and sneers stripes and punishments for his dear sake  bring up the little bag with the tea and a kettle of water he called the next instant to his boatmen not forgetting the haunch of cariboo and the mixingpan  when his men converts by his own hand had gained the bank the trio fell to their knees hands and backs burdened with camp equipage and offered up thanks for their passage through the wilderness and their safe arrival  hay stockard looked upon the function with sneering disapproval the romance and solemnity of it lost to his matteroffact soul  baptiste the red still gazing across recognized the familiar postures and remembered the girl who had shared his starroofed couch in the hills and forests and the womanchild who lay somewhere by bleak hudsons bay    iii   confound it baptiste couldnt think of it  not for a moment  grant that this man is a fool and of small use in the nature of things but still you know i cant give him up  hay stockard paused striving to put into speech the rude ethics of his heart  hes worried me baptiste in the past and now and caused me all manner of troubles but cant you see hes my own breedwhiteandandwhy i couldnt buy my life with his not if he was a nigger  so be it baptiste the red made answer  i have given you grace and choice  i shall come presently with my priests and fighting men and either shall i kill you or you deny your god  give up the priest to my pleasure and you shall depart in peace  otherwise your trail ends here my people are against you to the babies  even now have the children stolen away your canoes  he pointed down to the river  naked boys had slipped down the water from the point above cast loose the canoes and by then had worked them into the current  when they had drifted out of rifleshot they clambered over the sides and paddled ashore  give me the priest and you may have them back again  come  speak your mind but without haste  stockard shook his head  his glance dropped to the woman of the teslin country with his boy at her breast and he would have wavered had he not lifted his eyes to the men before him  i am not afraid sturges owen spoke up  the lord bears me in his right hand and alone am i ready to go into the camp of the unbeliever it is not too late  faith may move mountains  even in the eleventh hour may i win his soul to the true righteousness  trip the beggar up and make him fast bill whispered hoarsely in the ear of his leader while the missionary kept the floor and wrestled with the heathen  make him hostage and bore him if they get ugly  no stockard answered  i gave him my word that he could speak with us unmolested  rules of warfare bill rules of warfare  hes been on the square given us warning and all that andwhy damn it man i cant break my word  hell keep his never fear  dont doubt it but i wont let a halfbreed outdo me in fair dealing why not do what he wantsgive him the missionary and be done with it  nno bill hesitated doubtfully  shoe pinches eh  bill flushed a little and dropped the discussion  baptiste the red was still waiting the final decision  stockard went up to him  its this way baptiste  i came to your village minded to go up the koyukuk  i intended no wrong  my heart was clean of evil  it is still clean  along comes this priest as you call him  i didnt bring him here  hed have come whether i was here or not  but now that he is here being of my people ive got to stand by him  and im going to further it will be no childs play  when you have done your village will be silent and empty your people wasted as after a famine  true we will he gone likewise the pick of your fighting men  but those who remain shall be in peace nor shall the word of strange gods and the tongues of strange priests be buzzing in their ears  both men shrugged their shoulder and turned away the halfbreed going back to his own camp  the missionary called his two men to him and they fell into prayer  stockard and bill attacked the few standing pines with their axes felling them into convenient breastworks  the child had fallen asleep so the woman placed it on a heap of furs and lent a hand in fortifying the camp  three sides were thus defended the steep declivity at the rear precluding attack from that direction  when these arrangements had been completed the two men stalked into the open clearing away here and there the scattered underbrush  from the opposing camp came the booming of wardrums and the voices of the priests stirring the people to anger  worst of it is theyll come in rushes bill complained as they walked back with shouldered axes  and wait till midnight when the light gets dim for shooting  cant start the ball arolling too early then  bill exchanged the axe for a rifle and took a careful rest  one of the medicinemen towering above his tribesmen stood out distinctly  bill drew a bead on him  all ready he asked  stockard opened the ammunition box placed the woman where she could reload in safety and gave the word  the medicineman dropped  for a moment there was silence then a wild howl went up and a flight of bone arrows fell short  id like to take a look at the beggar bill remarked throwing a fresh shell into place  ill swear i drilled him clean between the eyes  didnt work  stockard shook his head gloomily  baptiste had evidently quelled the more warlike of his followers and instead of precipitating an attack in the bright light of day the shot had caused a hasty exodus the indians drawing out of the village beyond the zone of fire  in the full tide of his proselyting fervor borne along by the hand of god sturges owen would have ventured alone into the camp of the unbeliever equally prepared for miracle or martyrdom but in the waiting which ensued the fever of conviction died away gradually as the natural man asserted itself  physical fear replaced spiritual hope the love of life the love of god  it was no new experience  he could feel his weakness coming on and knew it of old time  he had struggled against it and been overcome by it before  he remembered when the other men had driven their paddles like mad in the van of a roaring iceflood how at the critical moment in a panic of worldly terror he had dropped his paddle and besought wildly with his god for pity  and there were other times  the recollection was not pleasant  it brought shame to him that his spirit should be so weak and his flesh so strong  but the love of life the love of life  he could not strip it from him  because of it had his dim ancestors perpetuated their line because of it was he destined to perpetuate his  his courage if courage it might be called was bred of fanaticism  the courage of stockard and bill was the adherence to deeprooted ideals  not that the love of life was less but the love of race tradition more not that they were unafraid to die but that they were brave enough not to live at the price of shame  the missionary rose for the moment swayed by the mood of sacrifice  he half crawled over the barricade to proceed to the other camp but sank back a trembling mass wailing as the spirit moves  as the spirit moves  who am i that i should set aside the judgments of god  before the foundations of the world were all things written in the book of life worm that i am shall i erase the page or any portion thereof  as god wills so shall the spirit move  bill reached over plucked him to his feet and shook him fiercely silently  then he dropped the bundle of quivering nerves and turned his attention to the two converts  but they showed little fright and a cheerful alacrity in preparing for the coming passage at arms  stockard who had been talking in undertones with the teslin woman now turned to the missionary  fetch him over here he commanded of bill  now he ordered when sturges owen had been duly deposited before him make us man and wife and be lively about it  then he added apologetically to bill no telling how its to end so i just thought id get my affairs straightened up  the woman obeyed the behest of her white lord  to her the ceremony was meaningless  by her lights she was his wife and had been from the day they first foregathered  the converts served as witnesses  bill stood over the missionary prompting him when he stumbled  stockard put the responses in the womans mouth and when the time came for want of better ringed her finger with thumb and forefinger of his own  kiss the bride bill thundered and sturges owen was too weak to disobey  now baptize the child  neat and tidy bill commented  gathering the proper outfit for a new trail the father explained taking the boy from the mothers arms  i was grubstaked once into the cascades and had everything in the kit except salt  never shall forget it  and if the woman and the kid cross the divide tonight they might as well be prepared for potluck  a long shot bill between ourselves but nothing lost if it misses  a cup of water served the purpose and the child was laid away in a secure corner of the barricade  the men built the fire and the evening meal was cooked  the sun hurried round to the north sinking closer to the horizon  the heavens in that quarter grew red and bloody  the shadows lengthened the light dimmed and in the sombre recesses of the forest life slowly died away  even the wild fowl in the river softened their raucous chatter and feigned the nightly farce of going to bed  only the tribesmen increased their clamor wardrums booming and voices raised in savage folk songs but as the sun dipped they ceased their tumult  the rounded hush of midnight was complete  stockard rose to his knees and peered over the logs  once the child wailed in pain and disconcerted him  the mother bent over it but it slept again  the silence was interminable profound  then of a sudden the robins burst into fullthroated song the night had passed  a flood of dark figures boiled across the open  arrows whistled and bow thongs sang  the shrilltongued rifles answered back  a spear and a mighty cast transfixed the teslin woman as she hovered above the child a spent arrow diving between the logs lodged in the missionarys arm  there was no stopping the rush  the middle distance was cumbered with bodies but the rest surged on breaking against and over the barricade like an ocean wave  sturges owen fled to the tent while the men were swept from their feet buried beneath the human tide  hay stockard alone regained the surface flinging the tribesmen aside like yelping curs  he had managed to seize an axe  a dark hand grasped the child by a naked foot and drew it from beneath its mother  at arms length its puny body circled through the air dashing to death against the logs  stockard clove the man to the chin and fell to clearing space  the ring of savage faces closed in raining upon him spearthrusts and bonebarbed arrows the sun shot up and they swayed back and forth in the crimson shadows twice with his axe blocked by too deep a blow they rushed him but each time he flung them clear  they fell underfoot and he trampled dead and dying the way slippery with blood  and still the day brightened and the robins sang  then they drew back from him in awe and he leaned breathless upon his axe  blood of my soul cried baptiste the red  but thou art a man  deny thy god and thou shalt yet live  stockard swore his refusal feebly but with grace  behold  a woman  sturges owen had been brought before the halfbreed  beyond a scratch on the arm he was uninjured but his eyes roved about him in an ecstasy of fear  the heroic figure of the blasphemer bristling with wounds and arrows leaning defiantly upon his axe indifferent indomitable superb caught his wavering vision  and he felt a great envy of the man who could go down serenely to the dark gates of death  surely christ and not he sturges owen had been moulded in such manner  and why not he  he felt dimly the curse of ancestry the feebleness of spirit which had come down to him out of the past and he felt an anger at the creative force symbolize it as he would which had formed him its servant so weakly  for even a stronger man this anger and the stress of circumstance were sufficient to breed apostasy and for sturges owen it was inevitable  in the fear of mans anger he would dare the wrath of god  he had been raised up to serve the lord only that he might be cast down  he had been given faith without the strength of faith he had been given spirit without the power of spirit  it was unjust  where now is thy god the halfbreed demanded  i do not know  he stood straight and rigid like a child repeating a catechism  hast thou then a god at all  i had  and now  no  hay stockard swept the blood from his eyes and laughed  the missionary looked at him curiously as in a dream  a feeling of infinite distance came over him as though of a great remove  in that which had transpired and which was to transpire he had no part  he was a spectatorat a distance yes at a distance  the words of baptiste came to him faintly  very good  see that this man go free and that no harm befall him  let him depart in peace  give him a canoe and food  set his face toward the russians that he may tell their priests of baptiste the red in whose country there is no god  they led him to the edge of the steep where they paused to witness the final tragedy  the halfbreed turned to hay stockard  there is no god he prompted  the man laughed in reply  one of the young men poised a warspear for the cast  hast thou a god  ay the god of my fathers  he shifted the axe for a better grip  baptiste the red gave the sign and the spear hurtled full against his breast  sturges owen saw the ivory head stand out beyond his back saw the man sway laughing and snap the shaft short as he fell upon it  then he went down to the river that he might carry to the russians the message of baptiste the red in whose country there was no god     the great interrogation   i   to say the least mrs saythers career in dawson was meteoric  she arrived in the spring with dog sleds and frenchcanadian voyageurs blazed gloriously for a brief month and departed up the river as soon as it was free of ice  now womanless dawson never quite understood this hurried departure and the local four hundred felt aggrieved and lonely till the nome strike was made and old sensations gave way to new  for it had delighted in mrs sayther and received her widearmed  she was pretty charming and moreover a widow  and because of this she at once had at heel any number of eldorado kings officials and adventuring younger sons whose ears were yearning for the froufrou of a womans skirts  the mining engineers revered the memory of her husband the late colonel sayther while the syndicate and promoter representatives spoke awesomely of his deals and manipulations for he was known down in the states as a great mining man and as even a greater one in london  why his widow of all women should have come into the country was the great interrogation  but they were a practical breed the men of the northland with a wholesome disregard for theories and a firm grip on facts  and to not a few of them karen sayther was a most essential fact that she did not regard the matter in this light is evidenced by the neatness and celerity with which refusal and proposal tallied off during her four weeks stay  and with her vanished the fact and only the interrogation remained  to the solution chance vouchsafed one clew  her last victim jack coughran having fruitlessly laid at her feet both his heart and a five hundredfoot creek claim on bonanza celebrated the misfortune by walking all of a night with the gods  in the midwatch of this night he happened to rub shoulders with pierre fontaine none other than head man of karen saythers voyageurs  this rubbing of shoulders led to recognition and drinks and ultimately involved both men in a common muddle of inebriety  heh pierre fontaine later on gurgled thickly  vot for madame sayther mak visitation to thees country  more better you spik wit her  i know no ting tall only all de tam her ask one mans name  pierre her spik wit me pierre you moos find thees mans and i gif you moochone thousand dollar you find thees mans  thees mans  ah oui  thees mans

hundred dollar go buy polingboat  tomorrow we go up de river ah oui tomorrow up de river and das dam sitka charley mak me pay for de polingboat five hundred dollar  dam  thus it was when jack coughran unburdened himself next day that dawson fell to wondering who was this david payne and in what way his existence bore upon karen saythers  but that very day as pierre fontaine had said mrs sayther and her barbaric crew of voyageurs towed up the east bank to klondike city shot across to the west bank to escape the bluffs and disappeared amid the maze of islands to the south    ii   oui madame thees is de place  one two tree island below stuart river  thees is tree island  as he spoke pierre fontaine drove his pole against the bank and held the stern of the boat against the current  this thrust the bow in till a nimble breed climbed ashore with the painter and made fast  one leel tam madame i go look see  a chorus of dogs marked his disappearance over the edge of the bank but a minute later he was back again  oui madame thees is de cabin  i mak investigation  no can find mans at home  but him no go vaire far vaire long or him no leave dogs him come queek you bet  help me out pierre  im tired all over from the boat  you might have made it softer you know  from a nest of furs amidships karen sayther rose to her full height of slender fairness  but if she looked lilyfrail in her elemental environment she was belied by the grip she put upon pierres hand by the knotting of her womans biceps as it took the weight of her body by the splendid effort of her limbs as they held her out from the perpendicular bank while she made the ascent  though shapely flesh clothed delicate frame her body was a seat of strength  still for all the careless ease with which she had made the landing there was a warmer color than usual to her face and a perceptibly extra beat to her heart  but then also it was with a certain reverent curiousness that she approached the cabin while the hush on her cheek showed a yet riper mellowness  look see  pierre pointed to the scattered chips by the woodpile  him freshtwo tree day no more  mrs sayther nodded  she tried to peer through the small window but it was made of greased parchment which admitted light while it blocked vision  failing this she went round to the door half lifted the rude latch to enter but changed her mind and let it fall back into place then she suddenly dropped on one knee and kissed the roughhewn threshold  if pierre fontaine saw he gave no sign and the memory in the time to come was never shared  but the next instant one of the boatmen placidly lighting his pipe was startled by an unwonted harshness in his captains voice  hey  you  le goire you makm soft more better pierre commanded plenty bearskin plenty blanket  dam  but the nest was soon after disrupted and the major portion tossed up to the crest of the shore where mrs sayther lay down to wait in comfort  reclining on her side she looked out and over the widestretching yukon above the mountains which lay beyond the further shore the sky was murky with the smoke of unseen forest fires and through this the afternoon sun broke feebly throwing a vague radiance to earth and unreal shadows  to the skyline of the four quartersspruceshrouded islands dark waters and icescarred rocky ridgesstretched the immaculate wilderness  no sign of human existence broke the solitude no sound the stillness  the land seemed bound under the unreality of the unknown wrapped in the brooding mystery of great spaces  perhaps it was this which made mrs sayther nervous for she changed her position constantly now to look up the river now down or to scan the gloomy shores for the halfhidden mouths of back channels  after an hour or so the boatmen were sent ashore to pitch camp for the night but pierre remained with his mistress to watch  ah him come thees tam he whispered after a long silence his gaze bent up the river to the head of the island  a canoe with a paddle flashing on either side was slipping down the current  in the stern a mans form and in the bow a womans swung rhythmically to the work  mrs sayther had no eyes for the woman till the canoe drove in closer and her bizarre beauty peremptorily demanded notice  a closefitting blouse of mooseskin fantastically beaded outlined faithfully the wellrounded lines of her body while a silken kerchief gay of color and picturesquely draped partly covered great masses of blueblack hair  but it was the face cast belike in copper bronze which caught and held mrs saythers fleeting glance  eyes piercing and black and large with a traditionary hint of obliqueness looked forth from under clearstencilled cleanarching brows  without suggesting cadaverousness though highboned and prominent the cheeks fell away and met in a mouth thinlipped and softly strong  it was a face which advertised the dimmest trace of ancient mongol blood a reversion after long centuries of wandering to the parent stem  this effect was heightened by the delicately aquiline nose with its thin trembling nostrils and by the general air of eagle wildness which seemed to characterize not only the face but the creature herself  she was in fact the tartar type modified to idealization and the tribe of red indian is lucky that breeds such a unique body once in a score of generations  dipping long strokes and strong the girl in concert with the man suddenly whirled the tiny craft about against the current and brought it gently to the shore  another instant and she stood at the top of the bank heaving up by rope hand under hand a quarter of freshkilled moose  then the man followed her and together with a swift rush they drew up the canoe  the dogs were in a whining mass about them and as the girl stooped among them caressingly the mans gaze fell upon mrs sayther who had arisen  he looked brushed his eyes unconsciously as though his sight were deceiving him and looked again  karen he said simply coming forward and extending his hand i thought for the moment i was dreaming  i went snowblind for a time this spring and since then my eyes have been playing tricks with me  mrs sayther whose flush had deepened and whose heart was urging painfully had been prepared for almost anything save this coolly extended hand but she tactfully curbed herself and grasped it heartily with her own  you know dave i threatened often to come and i would have too onlyonly  only i didnt give the word  david payne laughed and watched the indian girl disappearing into the cabin  oh i understand dave and had i been in your place id most probably have done the same  but i have comenow  then come a little bit farther into the cabin and get something to eat he said genially ignoring or missing the feminine suggestion of appeal in her voice  and you must be tired too  which way are you travelling  up  then you wintered in dawson or came in on the last ice  your camp  he glanced at the voyageurs circled about the fire in the open and held back the door for her to enter  i came up on the ice from circle city last winter he continued and settled down here for a while  am prospecting some on henderson creek and if that fails have been thinking of trying my hand this fall up the stuart river  you arent changed much are you she asked irrelevantly striving to throw the conversation upon a more personal basis  a little less flesh perhaps and a little more muscle  how did you mean  but she shrugged her shoulders and peered i through the dim light at the indian girl who had lighted the fire and was frying great chunks of moose meat alternated with thin ribbons of bacon  did you stop in dawson long  the man was whittling a stave of birchwood into a rude axehandle and asked the question without raising his head  oh a few days she answered following the girl with her eyes and hardly hearing  what were you saying  in dawson  a month in fact and glad to get away  the arctic male is elemental you know and somewhat strenuous in his feelings  bound to be when he gets right down to the soil  he leaves convention with the spring bed at borne  but you were wise in your choice of time for leaving  youll be out of the country before mosquito season which is a blessing your lack of experience will not permit you to appreciate  i suppose not  but tell me about yourself about your life  what kind of neighbors have you  or have you any  while she queried she watched the girl grinding coffee in the corner of a flower sack upon the hearthstone  with a steadiness and skill which predicated nerves as primitive as the method she crushed the imprisoned berries with a heavy fragment of quartz  david payne noted his visitors gaze and the shadow of a smile drifted over his lips  i did have some he replied  missourian chaps and a couple of cornishmen but they went down to eldorado to work at wages for a grubstake  mrs sayther cast a look of speculative regard upon the girl  but of course there are plenty of indians about  every mothers son of them down to dawson long ago  not a native in the whole country barring winapie here and shes a koyokuk lasscomes from a thousand miles or so down the river  mrs sayther felt suddenly faint and though the smile of interest in no wise waned the face of the man seemed to draw away to a telescopic distance and the tiered logs of the cabin to whirl drunkenly about  but she was bidden draw up to the table and during the meal discovered time and space in which to find herself  she talked little and that principally about the land and weather while the man wandered off into a long description of the difference between the shallow summer diggings of the lower country and the deep winter diggings of the upper country  you do not ask why i came north she asked  surely you know  they had moved back from the table and david payne had returned to his axe handle  did you get my letter  a last one  no i dont think so  most probably its trailing around the birch creek country or lying in some traders shack on the lower river  the way they run the mails in here is shameful  no order no system no  dont be wooden dave  help me  she spoke sharply now with an assumption of authority which rested upon the past  why dont you ask me about myself  about those we knew in the old times  have you no longer any interest in the world  do you know that my husband is dead  indeed i am sorry  how long  david  she was ready to cry with vexation but the reproach she threw into her voice eased her  did you get any of my letters  you must have got some of them though you never answered  well i didnt get the last one announcing evidently the death of your husband and most likely others went astray but i did get some ierread them aloud to winapie as a warningthat is you know to impress upon her the wickedness of her white sisters  and ierthink she profited by it  dont you  she disregarded the sting and went on  in the last letter which you did not receive i told as you have guessed of colonel saythers death that was a year ago  i also said that if you did not come out to me i would go in to you  and as i had often promised i came  i know of no promise  in the earlier letters  yes you promised but as i neither asked nor answered it was unratified  so i do not know of any such promise  but i do know of another which you too may remember  it was very long ago  he dropped the axehandle to the floor and raised his head  it was so very long ago yet i remember it distinctly the day the time every detail we were in a rose garden you and iyour mothers rose garden  all things were budding blossoming and the sap of spring was in our blood and i drew you overit was the firstand kissed you full on the lips dont you remember  dont go over it dave dont  i know every shameful line of it  how often have i wept  if you only knew how i have suffered  you promised me thenay and a thousand times in the sweet days that followed  each look of your eyes each touch of your hand each syllable that fell from your lips was a promise  and thenhow shall i saythere came a man  he was oldold enough to have begotten youand not nice to look upon but as the world goes clean  he had done no wrong followed the letter of the law was respectable  further and to the point he possessed some several paltry minesa score it does not matter and he owned a few miles of lands and engineered deals and clipped coupons  he  but there were other things she interrupted i told you pressuremoney matterswantmy peopletrouble  you understood the whole sordid situation  i could not help it  it was not my will  i was sacrificed or i sacrificed have it as you wish  but my god  dave i gave you up  you never did me justice  think what i have gone through  it was not your will  pressure  under high heaven there was no thing to will you to this mans bed or that  but i cared for you all the time she pleaded  i was unused to your way of measuring love  i am still unused  i do not understand  but now now  we were speaking of this man you saw fit to marry  what manner of man was he  wherein did he charm your soul  what potent virtues were his true he had a golden gripan almighty golden grip  he knew the odds he was versed in cent per cent  he had a narrow wit and excellent judgment of the viler parts whereby he transferred this mans money to his pockets and that mans money and the next mans  and the law smiled  in that it did not condemn our christian ethics approved  by social measure he was not a bad man  but by your measure karen by mine by ours of the rose garden what was he  remember he is dead  the fact is not altered thereby  what was he  a great gross material creature deaf to song blind to beauty dead to the spirit  he was fat with laziness and flabbycheeked and the round of his belly witnessed his gluttony  but he is dead  it is we who are nownow now  dont you hear  as you say i have been inconstant  i have sinned  good  but should not you too cry peccavi  if i have broken promises have not you  your love of the rose garden was of all time or so you said  where is it now  it is here now he cried striking his breast passionately with clenched hand  it has always been  and your love was a great love there was none greater she continued or so you said in the rose garden  yet it is not fine enough large enough to forgive me here crying now at your feet  the man hesitated  his mouth opened words shaped vainly on his lips she had forced him to bare his heart and speak truths which he had hidden from himself  and she was good to look upon standing there in a glory of passion calling back old associations and warmer life  he turned away his head that he might not see but she passed around and fronted him  look at me dave  look at me  i am the same after all  and so are you if you would but see  we are not changed  her hand rested on his shoulder and his had halfpassed roughly about her when the sharp crackle of a match startled him to himself  winapie alien to the scene was lighting the slow wick of the slush lamp  she appeared to start out against a background of utter black and the flame flaring suddenly up lighted her bronze beauty to royal gold  you see it is impossible he groaned thrusting the fairhaired woman gently from him  it is impossible he repeated  it is impossible  i am not a girl dave with a girls illusions she said softly though not daring to come back to him  it is as a woman that i understand  men are men  a common custom of the country  i am not shocked  i divined it from the first  butahit is only a marriage of the countrynot a real marriage  we do not ask such questions in alaska he interposed feebly  i know but  well then it is only a marriage of the countrynothing else  and there are no children  no  nor  no no nothingbut it is impossible  but it is not  she was at his side again her hand touching lightly caressingly the sunburned back of his  i know the custom of the land too well  men do it every day  they do not care to remain here shut out from the world for all their days so they give an order on the p c c company for a years provisions some money in hand and the girl is content  by the end of that time a man  she shrugged her shoulders  and so with the girl here  we will give her an order upon the company not for a year but for life  what was she when you found her  a raw meateating savage fish in summer moose in winter feasting in plenty starving in famine  but for you that is what she would have remained  for your coming she was happier for your going surely with a life of comparative splendor assured she will be happier than if you had never been  no no he protested  it is not right  come dave you must see  she is not your kind  there is no race affinity  she is an aborigine sprung from the soil yet close to the soil and impossible to lift from the soil  born savage savage she will die  but weyou and ithe dominant evolved racethe salt of the earth and the masters thereof  we are made for each other  the supreme call is of kind and we are of kind  reason and feeling dictate it  your very instinct demands it  that you cannot deny  you cannot escape the generations behind you  yours is an ancestry which has survived for a thousand centuries and for a hundred thousand centuries and your line must not stop here  it cannot  your ancestry will not permit it instinct is stronger than the will  the race is mightier than you  come dave let us go  we are young yet and life is good  come  winapie passing out of the cabin to feed the dogs caught his attention and caused him to shake his head and weakly to reiterate  but the womans hand slipped about his neck and her cheek pressed to his  his bleak life rose up and smote himthe vain struggle with pitiless forces the dreary years of frost and famine the harsh and jarring contact with elemental life the aching void which mere animal existence could not fill  and there seduction by his side whispering of brighter warmer lands of music light and joy called the old times back again  he visioned it unconsciously  faces rushed in upon him glimpses of forgotten scenes memories of merry hours strains of song and trills of laughter  come dave come  i have for both  the way is soft  she looked about her at the bare furnishings of the cabin  i have for both  the world is at our feet and all joy is ours  come come  she was in his arms trembling and he held her tightly  he rose to his feet    but the snarling of hungry dogs and the shrill cries of winapie bringing about peace between the combatants came muffled to his ear through the heavy logs  and another scene flashed before him  a struggle in the foresta baldface grizzly brokenlegged terrible the snarling of the dogs and the shrill cries of winapie as she urged them to the attack himself in the midst of the crush breathless panting striving to hold off red death brokenbacked entrailripped dogs howling in impotent anguish and desecrating the snow the virgin white running scarlet with the blood of man and beast the bear ferocious irresistible crunching crunching down to the core of his life and winapie at the last in the thick of the frightful muddle hair flying eyes flashing fury incarnate passing the long hunting knife again and againsweat started to his forehead  he shook off the clinging woman and staggered back to the wall  and she knowing that the moment had come but unable to divine what was passing within him felt all she had gained slipping away  dave  dave she cried  i will not give you up  i will not give you up  if you do not wish to come we will stay  i will stay with you  the world is less to me than are you  i will be a northland wife to you  i will cook your food feed your dogs break trail for you lift a paddle with you  i can do it  believe me i am strong  nor did he doubt it looking upon her and holding her off from him but his face had grown stern and gray and the warmth had died out of his eyes  i will pay off pierre and the boatmen and let them go  and i will stay with you priest or no priest minister or no minister go with you now anywhere  dave  dave  listen to me  you say i did you wrong in the pastand i didlet me make up for it let me atone  if i did not rightly measure love before let me show that i can now  she sank to the floor and threw her arms about his knees sobbing  and you do care for me  you do care for me  think  the long years i have waited suffered  you can never know  he stooped and raised her to her feet  listen he commanded opening the door and lifting her bodily outside it cannot be  we are not alone to be considered  you must go  i wish you a safe journey  you will find it tougher work when you get up by the sixty mile but you have the best boatmen in the world and will get through all right  will you say goodby  though she already had herself in hand she looked at him hopelessly ififif winapie should  she quavered and stopped  but he grasped the unspoken thought and answered yes  then struck with the enormity of it it cannot be conceived  there is no likelihood  it must not be entertained  kiss me she whispered her face lighting  then she turned and went away        break camp pierre she said to the boatman who alone had remained awake against her return  we must be going  by the firelight his sharp eyes scanned the woe in her face but he received the extraordinary command as though it were the most usual thing in the world  oui madame he assented  which way  dawson  no she answered lightly enough up out dyea  whereat he fell upon the sleeping voyageurs kicking them grunting from their blankets and buckling them down to the work the while his voice vibrant with action shrilling through all the camp  in a trice mrs saythers tiny tent had been struck pots and pans were being gathered up blankets rolled and the men staggering under the loads to the boat  here on the banks mrs sayther waited till the luggage was made shipshape and her nest prepared  we line up to de head of de island pierre explained to her while running out the long tow rope  den we tak to das back channel where de water not queek and i tink we mak good tam  a scuffling and pattering of feet in the last years dry grass caught his quick ear and he turned his head  the indian girl circled by a bristling ring of wolf dogs was coming toward them  mrs sayther noted that the girls face which had been apathetic throughout the scene in the cabin had now quickened into blazing and wrathful life  what you do my man she demanded abruptly of mrs sayther  him lay on bunk and him look bad all the time  i say what the matter dave  you sick  but him no say nothing  after that him say good girl winapie go way  i be all right bimeby  what you do my man eh  i think you bad woman  mrs sayther looked curiously at the barbarian woman who shared the life of this man while she departed alone in the darkness of night  i think you bad woman winapie repeated in the slow methodical way of one who gropes for strange words in an alien tongue  i think better you go way no come no more  eh  what you think  i have one man  i indian girl  you merican woman  you good to see  you find plenty men  your eyes blue like the sky  your skin so white so soft  coolly she thrust out a brown forefinger and pressed the soft cheek of the other woman  and to the eternal credit of karen sayther she never flinched  pierre hesitated and half stepped forward but she motioned him away though her heart welled to him with secret gratitude  its all right pierre she said  please go away  he stepped back respectfully out of earshot where he stood grumbling to himself and measuring the distance in springs  um white um soft like baby  winapie touched the other cheek and withdrew her hand  bimeby mosquito come  skin get sore in spot um swell oh so big um hurt oh so much  plenty mosquito plenty spot  i think better you go now before mosquito come  this way pointing down the stream you go st michaels that way pointing up you go dyea better you go dyea  goodby  and that which mrs sayther then did caused pierre to marvel greatly for she threw her arms around the indian girl kissed her and burst into tears  be good to him she cried  be good to him  then she slipped half down the face of the bank called back goodby and dropped into the boat amidships  pierre followed her and cast off he shoved the steering oar into place and gave the signal  le goire lifted an old french chanson the men like a row of ghosts in the dim starlight bent their backs to the tow line the steering oar cut the black current sharply and the boat swept out into the night     which make men remember   fortune la pearle crushed his way through the snow sobbing straining cursing his luck alaska nome the cards and the man who had felt his knife  the hot blood was freezing on his hands and the scene yet bright in his eyesthe man clutching the table and sinking slowly to the floor the rolling counters and the scattered deck the swift shiver throughout the room and the pause the gamekeepers no longer calling and the clatter of the chips dying away the startled faces the infinite instant of silence and then the great bloodroar and the tide of vengeance which lapped his heels and turned the town mad behind him  all hells broke loose he sneered turning aside in the darkness and heading for the beach  lights were flashing from open doors and tent cabin and dancehall let slip their denizens upon the chase  the clamor of men and howling of dogs smote his ears and quickened his feet  he ran on and on  the sounds grew dim and the pursuit dissipated itself in vain rage and aimless groping  but a flitting shadow clung to him  head thrust over shoulder he caught glimpses of it now taking vague shape on an open expanse of snow how merging into the deeper shadows of some darkened cabin or beachlisted craft  fortune la pearle swore like a woman weakly with the hint of tears that comes of exhaustion and plunged deeper into the maze of heaped ice tents and prospect holes  he stumbled over taut hawsers and piles of dunnage tripped on crazy guyropes and insanely planted pegs and fell again and again upon frozen dumps and mounds of hoarded driftwood  at times when he deemed he had drawn clear his head dizzy with the painful pounding of his heart and the suffocating intake of his breath he slackened down and ever the shadow leaped out of the gloom and forced him on in heartbreaking flight  a swift intuition lashed upon him leaving in its trail the cold chill of superstition  the persistence of the shadow he invested with his gamblers symbolism  silent inexorable not to be shaken off he took it as the fate which waited at the last turn when chips were cashed in and gains and losses counted up  fortune la pearle believed in those rare illuminating moments when the intelligence flung from it time and space to rise naked through eternity and read the facts of life from the open book of chance  that this was such a moment he had no doubt and when he turned inland and sped across the snowcovered tundra he was not startled because the shadow took upon it greater definiteness and drew in closer  oppressed with his own impotence he halted in the midst of the white waste and whirled about his right hand slipped from its mitten and a revolver at level glistened in the pale light of the stars  dont shoot  i havent a gun  the shadow had assumed tangible shape and at the sound of its human voice a trepidation affected fortune la pearles knees and his stomach was stricken with the qualms of sudden relief  perhaps things fell out differently because uri bram had no gun that night when he sat on the hard benches of the el dorado and saw murder done  to that fact also might be attributed the trip on the long trail which he took subsequently with a most unlikely comrade  but be it as it may he repeated a second time dont shoot  cant you see i havent a gun  then what the flaming hell did you take after me for demanded the gambler lowering his revolver  uri bram shrugged his shoulders  it dont matter much anyhow  i want you to come with me  where  to my shack over on the edge of the camp  but fortune la pearle drove the heel of his moccasin into the snow and attested by his various deities to the madness of uri bram  who are you he perorated and what am i that i should put my neck into the rope at your bidding  i am uri bram the other said simply and my shack is over there on the edge of camp  i dont know who you are but youve thrust the soul from a living mans bodytheres the blood red on your sleeveand like a second cain the hand of all mankind is against you and there is no place you may lay your head  now i have a shack  for the love of your mother hold your say man interrupted fortune la pearle or ill make you a second abel for the joy of it  so help me i will  with a thousand men to lay me by the heels looking high and low what do i want with your shack  i want to get out of hereaway away away  cursed swine  ive half a mind to go back and run amuck and settle for a few of them the pigs  one gorgeous glorious fight and end the whole damn business  its a skin game thats what life is and im sick of it  he stopped appalled crushed by his great desolation and uri bram seized the moment  he was not given to speech this man and that which followed was the longest in his life save one long afterward in another place  thats why i told you about my shack  i can stow you there so theyll never find you and ive got grub in plenty  elsewise you cant get away  no dogs no nothing the sea closed st michael the nearest post runners to carry the news before you the same over the portage to anviknot a chance in the world for you  now wait with me till it blows over  theyll forget all about you in a month or less what of stampeding to york and what not and you can hit the trail under their noses and they wont bother  ive got my own ideas of justice  when i ran after you out of the el dorado and along the beach it wasnt to catch you or give you up  my ideas are my own and thats not one of them  he ceased as the murderer drew a prayerbook from his pocket  with the aurora borealis glimmering yellow in the northeast heads bared to the frost and naked hands grasping the sacred book fortune la pearle swore him to the words he had spokenan oath which uri bram never intended breaking and never broke  at the door of the shack the gambler hesitated for an instant marvelling at the strangeness of this man who had befriended him and doubting  but by the candlelight he found the cabin comfortable and without occupants and he was quickly rolling a cigarette while the other man made coffee his muscles relaxed in the warmth and he lay back with halfassumed indolence intently studying uris face through the curling wisps of smoke  it was a powerful face but its strength was of that peculiar sort which stands girt in and unrelated  the seams were deepgraven more like scars while the stern features were in no way softened by hints of sympathy or humor  under prominent bushy brows the eyes shone cold and gray  the cheekbones high and forbidding were undermined by deep hollows  the chin and jaw displayed a steadiness of purpose which the narrow forehead advertised as single and if needs be pitiless everything was harsh the nose the lips the voice the lines about the mouth  it was the face of one who communed much with himself unused to seeking counsel from the world the face of one who wrestled oft of nights with angels and rose to face the day with shut lips that no man might know  he was narrow but deep and fortune his own humanity broad and shallow could make nothing of him  did uri sing when merry and sigh when sad he could have understood but as it was the cryptic features were undecipherable he could not measure the soul they concealed  lend a hand mister man uri ordered when the cups had been emptied weve got to fix up for visitors  fortune purred his name for the others benefit and assisted understandingly  the bunk was built against a side and end of the cabin it was a rude affair the bottom being composed of driftwood logs overlaid with moss  at the foot the rough ends of these timbers projected in an uneven row  from the side next the wall uri ripped back the moss and removed three of the logs  the jagged ends he sawed off and replaced so that the projecting row remained unbroken  fortune carried in sacks of flour from the cache and piled them on the floor beneath the aperture  on these uri laid a pair of long seabags and over all spread several thicknesses of moss and blankets  upon this fortune could lie with the sleeping furs stretching over him from one side of the bunk to the other and all men could look upon it and declare it empty  in the weeks which followed several domiciliary visits were paid not a shack or tent in nome escaping but fortune lay in his cranny undisturbed  in fact little attention was given to uri brams cabin for it was the last place under the sun to expect to find the murderer of john randolph  except during such interruptions fortune lolled about the cabin playing long games of solitaire and smoking endless cigarettes  though his volatile nature loved geniality and play of words and laughter he quickly accommodated himself to uris taciturnity beyond the actions and plans of his pursuers the state of the trails and the price of dogs they never talked and these things were only discussed at rare intervals and briefly  but fortune fell to working out a system and hour after hour and day after day he shuffled and dealt shuffled and dealt noted the combinations of the cards in long columns and shuffled and dealt again  toward the end even this absorption failed him and head bowed upon the table he visioned the lively allnight houses of nome where the gamekeepers and lookouts worked in shifts and the clattering roulette ball never slept  at such times his loneliness and bankruptcy stunned him till he sat for hours in the same unblinking unchanging position  at other times his longpent bitterness found voice in passionate outbursts for he had rubbed the world the wrong way and did not like the feel of it  lifes a skingame he was fond of repeating and on this one note he rang the changes  i never had half a chance he complained  i was faked in my birth and flimflammed with my mothers milk  the dice were loaded when she tossed the box and i was born to prove the loss  but that was no reason she should blame me for it and look on me as a cold deck but she diday she did  why didnt she give me a show  why didnt the world  why did i go broke in seattle  why did i take the steerage and live like a hog to nome  why did i go to the el dorado  i was heading for big petes and only went for matches  why didnt i have matches  why did i want to smoke  dont you see  all worked out every bit of it all parts fitting snug  before i was born like as not  ill put the sack i never hope to get on it before i was born  thats why thats why john randolph passed the word and his checks in at the same time  damn him  it served him well right  why didnt he keep his tongue between his teeth and give me a chance  he knew i was next to broke  why didnt i hold my hand  oh why  why  why  and fortune la pearle would roll upon the floor vainly interrogating the scheme of things  at such outbreaks uri said no word gave no sign save that his grey eyes seemed to turn dull and muddy as though from lack of interest  there was nothing in common between these two men and this fact fortune grasped sufficiently to wonder sometimes why uri had stood by him  but the time of waiting came to an end  even a communitys blood lust cannot stand before its gold lust  the murder of john randolph had already passed into the annals of the camp and there it rested  had the murderer appeared the men of nome would certainly have stopped stampeding long enough to see justice done whereas the whereabouts of fortune la pearle was no longer an insistent problem  there was gold in the creek beds and ruby beaches and when the sea opened the men with healthy sacks would sail away to where the good things of life were sold absurdly cheap  so one night fortune helped uri bram harness the dogs and lash the sled and the twain took the winter trail south on the ice  but it was not all south for they left the sea east from st michaels crossed the divide and struck the yukon at anvik many hundred miles from its mouth then on into the northeast past koyokuk tanana and minook till they rounded the great curve at fort yukon crossed and recrossed the arctic circle and headed south through the flats  it was a weary journey and fortune would have wondered why the man went with him had not uri told him that he owned claims and had men working at eagle  eagle lay on the edge of the line a few miles farther on the british flag waved over the barracks at fort cudahy  then came dawson pelly the five fingers windy arm caribou crossing linderman the chilcoot and dyea  on the morning after passing eagle they rose early  this was their last camp and they were now to part  fortunes heart was light  there was a promise of spring in the land and the days were growing longer  the way was passing into canadian territory  liberty was at hand the sun was returning and each day saw him nearer to the great outside  the world was big and he could once again paint his future in royal red  he whistled about the breakfast and hummed snatches of light song while uri put the dogs in harness and packed up  but when all was ready fortunes feet itching to be off uri pulled an unused backlog to the fire and sat down  ever hear of the dead horse trail  he glanced up meditatively and fortune shook his head inwardly chafing at the delay  sometimes there are meetings under circumstances which make men remember uri continued speaking in a low voice and very slowly and i met a man under such circumstances on the dead horse trail  freighting an outfit over the white pass in 97 broke many a mans heart for there was a world of reason when they gave that trail its name  the horses died like mosquitoes in the first frost and from skaguay to bennett they rotted in heaps  they died at the rocks they were poisoned at the summit and they starved at the lakes they fell off the trail what there was of it or they went through it in the river they drowned under their loads or were smashed to pieces against the boulders they snapped their legs in the crevices and broke their backs falling backwards with their packs in the sloughs they sank from sight or smothered in the slime and they were disembowelled in the bogs where the corduroy logs turned end up in the mud men shot them worked them to death and when they were gone went back to the beach and bought more  some did not bother to shoot themstripping the saddles off and the shoes and leaving them where they fell  their hearts turned to stonethose which did not breakand they became beasts the men on dead horse trail  it was there i met a man with the heart of a christ and the patience and he was honest  when he rested at midday he took the packs from the horses so that they too might rest  he paid 50 a hundredweight for their fodder and more  he used his own bed to blanket their backs when they rubbed raw  other men let the saddles eat holes the size of water buckets  other men when the shoes gave out let them wear their hoofs down to the bleeding stumps  he spent his last dollar for horseshoe nails  i know this because we slept in the one bed and ate from the one pot and became blood brothers where men lost their grip of things and died blaspheming god  he was never too tired to ease a strap or tighten a cinch and often there were tears in his eyes when he looked on all that waste of misery  at a passage in the rocks where the brutes upreared hindlegged and stretched their forelegs upward like cats to clear the wall the way was piled with carcasses where they had toppled back  and here he stood in the stench of hell with a cheery word and a hand on the rump at the right time till the string passed by  and when one bogged he blocked the trail till it was clear again nor did the man live who crowded him at such time  at the end of the trail a man who had killed fifty horses wanted to buy but we looked at him and at our ownmountain cayuses from eastern oregon  five thousand he offered and we were broke but we remembered the poison grass of the summit and the passage in the rocks and the man who was my brother spoke no word but divided the cayuses into two buncheshis in the one and mine in the otherand he looked at me and we understood each other  so he drove mine to the one side and i drove his to the other and we took with us our rifles and shot them to the last one while the man who had killed fifty horses cursed us till his throat cracked  but that man with whom i welded bloodbrothership on the dead horse trail  why that man was john randolph fortune sneering the while completed the climax for him  uri nodded and said i am glad you understand  i am ready fortune answered the old weary bitterness strong in his face again  go ahead but hurry  uri bram rose to his feet  i have had faith in god all the days of my life  i believe he loves justice  i believe he is looking down upon us now choosing between us i believe he waits to work his will through my own right arm  and such is my belief that we will take equal chance and let him speak his own judgment  fortunes heart leaped at the words  he did not know much concerning uris god but he believed in chance and chance had been coming his way ever since the night he ran down the beach and across the snow  but there is only one gun he objected  we will fire turn about uri replied at the same time throwing out the cylinder of the other mans colt and examining it  and the cards to decide  one hand of seven up  fortunes blood was warming to the game and he drew the deck from his pocket as uri nodded  surely chance would not desert him now  he thought of the returning sun as he cut for deal and he thrilled when he found the deal was his  he shuffled and dealt and uri cut him the jack of spades  they laid down their hands  uris was bare of trumps while he held ace deuce  the outside seemed very near to him as they stepped off the fifty paces  if god withholds his hand and you drop me the dogs and outfit are yours  youll find a bill of sale already made out in my pocket uri explained facing the path of the bullet straight and broadbreasted  fortune shook a vision of the sun shining on the ocean from his eyes and took aim  he was very careful  twice he lowered as the spring breeze shook the pines  but the third time he dropped on one knee gripped the revolver steadily in both hands and fired  uri whirled half about threw up his arms swayed wildly for a moment and sank into the snow but fortune knew he had fired too far to one side else the man would not have whirled  when uri mastering the flesh and struggling to his feet beckoned for the weapon fortune was minded to fire again  but he thrust the idea from him  chance had been very good to him already he felt and if he tricked now he would have to pay for it afterward  no he would play fair  besides uri was hard hit and could not possibly hold the heavy colt long enough to draw a bead  and where is your god now he taunted as he gave the wounded man the revolver  and uri answered god has not yet spoken  prepare that he may speak  fortune faced him but twisted his chest sideways in order to present less surface  uri tottered about drunkenly but waited too for the moments calm between the catspaws  the revolver was very heavy and he doubted like fortune because of its weight  but he held it arm extended above his head and then let it slowly drop forward and down at the instant fortunes left breast and the sight flashed into line with his eye he pulled the trigger  fortune did not whirl but gay san francisco dimmed and faded and as the sunbright snow turned black and blacker he breathed his last malediction on the chance he had misplayed     siwash   if i was a man  her words were in themselves indecisive but the withering contempt which flashed from her black eyes was not lost upon the menfolk in the tent  tommy the english sailor squirmed but chivalrous old dick humphries cornish fisherman and erstwhile american salmon capitalist beamed upon her benevolently as ever  he bore women too large a portion of his rough heart to mind them as he said when they were in the doldrums or when their limited vision would not permit them to see all around a thing  so they said nothing these two men who had taken the halffrozen woman into their tent three days back and who had warmed her and fed her and rescued her goods from the indian packers  this latter had necessitated the payment of numerous dollars to say nothing of a demonstration in forcedick humphries squinting along the sights of a winchester while tommy apportioned their wages among them at his own appraisement  it had been a little thing in itself but it meant much to a woman playing a desperate singlehand in the equally desperate klondike rush of 97  men were occupied with their own pressing needs nor did they approve of women playing singlehanded the odds of the arctic winter  if i was a man i know what i would do  thus reiterated molly she of the flashing eyes and therein spoke the cumulative grit of five americanborn generations  in the succeeding silence tommy thrust a pan of biscuits into the yukon stove and piled on fresh fuel  a reddish flood pounded along under his suntanned skin and as he stooped the skin of his neck was scarlet dick palmed a threecornered sail needle through a set of broken pack straps his good nature in nowise disturbed by the feminine cataclysm which was threatening to burst in the stormbeaten tent  and if you was a man he asked his voice vibrant with kindness  the threecornered needle jammed in the damp leather and he suspended work for the moment  id be a man  id put the straps on my back and light out  i wouldnt lay in camp here with the yukon like to freeze most any day and the goods not half over the portage  and youyou are men and you sit here holding your hands afraid of a little wind and wet  i tell you straight yankeemen are made of different stuff  theyd be hitting the trail for dawson if they had to wade through hellfire  and you youi wish i was a man  im very glad my dear that youre not  dick humphries threw the bight of the sail twine over the point of the needle and drew it clear with a couple of deft turns and a jerk  a snort of the gale dealt the tent a broadhanded slap as it hurtled past and the sleet rattattatted with snappy spite against the thin canvas  the smoke smothered in its exit drove back through the fire box door carrying with it the pungent odor of green spruce  good gawd  why cant a woman listen to reason  tommy lifted his head from the denser depths and turned upon her a pair of smokeoutraged eyes  and why cant a man show his manhood  tommy sprang to his feet with an oath which would have shocked a woman of lesser heart ripped loose the sturdy reefknots and flung back the flaps of the tent  the trio peered out  it was not a heartening spectacle  a few water soaked tents formed the miserable foreground from which the streaming ground sloped to a foaming gorge  down this ramped a mountain torrent here and there dwarf spruce rooting and grovelling in the shallow alluvium marked the proximity of the timber line  beyond on the opposing slope the vague outlines of a glacier loomed deadwhite through the driving rain  even as they looked its massive front crumbled into the valley on the breast of some subterranean vomit and it lifted its hoarse thunder above the screeching voice of the storm  involuntarily molly shrank back  look woman  look with all your eyes  three miles in the teeth of the gale to crater lake across two glaciers along the slippery rimrock kneedeep in a howling river  look i say you yankee woman  look theres your yankeemen  tommy pointed a passionate hand in the direction of the struggling tents  yankees the last mothers son of them  are they on trail  is there one of them with the straps to his back  and you would teach us men our work  look i say  another tremendous section of the glacier rumbled earthward  the wind whipped in at the open doorway bulging out the sides of the tent till it swayed like a huge bladder at its guy ropes  the smoke swirled about them and the sleet drove sharply into their flesh  tommy pulled the flaps together hastily and returned to his tearful task at the firebox dick humphries threw the mended pack straps into a corner and lighted his pipe  even molly was for the moment persuaded  theres my clothes she halfwhimpered the feminine for the moment prevailing  theyre right at the top of the cache and theyll be ruined  i tell you ruined  there there dick interposed when the last quavering syllable had wailed itself out  dont let that worry you little woman  im old enough to be your fathers brother and ive a daughter older than you and ill tog you out in fripperies when we get to dawson if it takes my last dollar  when we get to dawson  the scorn had come back to her throat with a sudden surge  youll rot on the way first  youll drown in a mudhole youyoubritishers  the last word explosive intensive had strained the limits of her vituperation  if that would not stir these men what could  tommys neck ran red again but he kept his tongue between his teeth  dicks eyes mellowed  he had the advantage over tommy for he had once had a white woman for a wife  the blood of five americanborn generations is under certain circumstances an uncomfortable heritage and among these circumstances might be enumerated that of being quartered with next of kin  these men were britons  on sea and land her ancestry and the generations thereof had thrashed them and theirs  on sea and land they would continue to do so  the traditions of her race clamored for vindication  she was but a woman of the present but in her bubbled the whole mighty past  it was not alone molly travis who pulled on gum boots mackintosh and straps for the phantom hands of ten thousand forbears drew tight the buckles just so as they squared her jaw and set her eyes with determination  she molly travis intended to shame these britishers they the innumerable shades were asserting the dominance of the common race  the menfolk did not interfere  once dick suggested that she take his oilskins as her mackintosh was worth no more than paper in such a storm but she sniffed her independence so sharply that he communed with his pipe till she tied the flaps on the outside and slushed away on the flooded trail  think shell make it  dicks face belied the indifference of his voice  make it  if she stands the pressure till she gets to the cache what of the cold and misery shell be stark raving mad  stand it  shell be dumbcrazed  you know it yourself dick  youve windjammed round the horn  you know what it is to lay out on a topsail yard in the thick of it bucking sleet and snow and frozen canvas till youre ready to just let go and cry like a baby  clothes  she wont be able to tell a bundle of skirts from a gold pan or a teakettle  kind of think we were wrong in letting her go then  not a bit of it  so help me dick shed a made this tent a hell for the rest of the trip if we hadnt  trouble with her shes got too much spirit  thisll tone it down a bit  yes dick admitted shes too ambitious  but then mollys all right a cussed little fool to tackle a trip like this but a plucky sight better than those pickmeupandcarryme kind of women  shes the stock that carried you and me tommy and youve got to make allowance for the spirit  takes a woman to breed a man  you cant suck manhood from the dugs of a creature whose only claim to womanhood is her petticoats  takes a shecat not a cow to mother a tiger  and when theyre unreasonable weve got to put up with it eh  the proposition  a sharp sheathknife cuts deeper on a slip than a dull one but thats no reason for to hack the edge off over a capstan bar  all right if you say so but when it comes to woman i guess ill take mine with a little less edge  what do you know about it dick demanded  some  tommy reached over for a pair of mollys wet stockings and stretched them across his knees to dry  dick eying him querulously went fishing in her hand satchel then hitched up to the front of the stove with divers articles of damp clothing spread likewise to the heat  thought you said you never were married he asked  did i  no more was ithat isyes by gawd i was  and as good a woman as ever cooked grub for a man  slipped her moorings dick symbolized infinity with a wave of his hand  ay  childbirth he added after a moments pause  the beans bubbled rowdily on the front lid and he pushed the pot back to a cooler surface  after that he investigated the biscuits tested them with a splinter of wood and placed them aside under cover of a damp cloth  dick after the manner of his kind stifled his interest and waited silently  a different woman to molly  siwash  dick nodded his understanding  not so proud and wilful but stick by a fellow through thick and thin sling a paddle with the next and starve as contentedly as job  go forard when the sloops nose was more often under than not and take in sail like a man  went prospecting once up teslin way past surprise lake and the little yellowhead  grub gave out and we ate the dogs dogs gave out and we ate harnesses moccasins and furs  never a whimper never a pickmeupandcarryme  before we went she said look out for grub but when it happened never a itoldyouso  never mind tommy shed say day after day that weak she could bare lift a snow shoe and her feet raw with the work  never mind  id sooner be flat bellied of hunger and be your woman tommy than have a potlach every day and be chief georges klooch  george was chief of the chilcoots you know and wanted her bad  great days those  was a likely chap myself when i struck the coast jumped a whaler the pole star at unalaska and worked my way down to sitka on an otter hunter  picked up with happy jack thereknow him  had charge of my traps for me dick answered down on the columbia pretty wild wasnt he with a warm place in his heart for whiskey and women  the very chap  went trading with him for a couple of seasonshooch and blankets and such stuff  then got a sloop of my own and not to cut him out came down juneau way  thats where i met killisnoo i called her tilly for short  met her at a squaw dance down on the beach  chief george had finished the years trade with the sticks over the passes and was down from dyea with half his tribe  no end of siwashes at the dance and i the only white  no one knew me barring a few of the bucks id met over sitka way but id got most of their histories from happy jack  everybody talking chinook not guessing that i could spit it better than most and principally two girls whod run away from haines mission up the lynn canal  they were trim creatures good to the eye and i kind of thought of casting that way but they were fresh as freshcaught cod  too much edge you see  being a newcomer they started to twist me not knowing i gathered in every word of chinook they uttered  i never let on but set to dancing with tilly and the more we danced the more our hearts warmed to each other  looking for a woman one of the girls says and the other tosses her head and answers small chance hell get one when the women are looking for men  and the bucks and squaws standing around began to grin and giggle and repeat what had been said  quite a pretty boy says the first one  ill not deny i was rather smoothfaced and youngish but id been a man amongst men manys the day and it rankled me  dancing with chief georges girl pipes the second  first thing georgell give him the flat of a paddle and send him about his business  chief george had been looking pretty black up to now but at this he laughed and slapped his knees  he was a husky beggar and would have used the paddle too  whos the girls i asked tilly as we went ripping down the centre in a reel  and as soon as she told me their names i remembered all about them from happy jack  had their pedigree down fineseveral things hed told me that not even their own tribe knew  but i held my hush and went on courting tilly they acasting sharp remarks and everybody roaring bide a wee tommy i says to myself bide a wee  and bide i did till the dance was ripe to break up and chief george had brought a paddle all ready for me  everybody was on the lookout for mischief when we stopped but i marched easy as you please slap into the thick of them  the mission girls cut me up something clever and for all i was angry i had to set my teeth to keep from laughing  i turned upon them suddenly  are you done i asked  you should have seen them when they heard me spitting chinook  then i broke loose  i told them all about themselves and their people before them their fathers mothers sisters brotherseverybody everything each mean trick theyd played every scrape theyd got into every shame thatd fallen them  and i burned them without fear or favor  all hands crowded round  never had they heard a white man sling their lingo as i did  everybody was laughing save the mission girls  even chief george forgot the paddle or at least he was swallowing too much respect to dare to use it  but the girls  oh dont tommy they cried the tears running down their cheeks  please dont  well be good  sure tommy sure  but i knew them well and i scorched them on every tender spot  nor did i slack away till they came down on their knees begging and pleading with me to keep quiet  then i shot a glance at chief george but he did not know whether to have at me or not and passed it off by laughing hollowly  so be  when i passed the parting with tilly that night i gave her the word that i was going to be around for a week or so and that i wanted to see more of her  not thickskinned her kind when it came to showing like and dislike and she looked her pleasure for the honest girl she was  ay a striking lass and i didnt wonder that chief george was taken with her  everything my way  took the wind from his sails on the first leg  i was for getting her aboard and sailing down wrangel way till it blew over leaving him to whistle but i wasnt to get her that easy  seems she was living with an uncle of hersguardian the way such things goand seems he was nigh to shuffling off with consumption or some sort of lung trouble  he was good and bad by turns and she wouldnt leave him till it was over with  went up to the tepee just before i left to speculate on how long itd be but the old beggar had promised her to chief george and when he clapped eyes on me his anger brought on a hemorrhage  come and take me tommy she says when we bid goodby on the beach ay i answers when you give the word  and i kissed her whiteman fashion and loverfashion till she was all of a tremble like a quaking aspen and i was so beside myself id half a mind to go up and give the uncle a lift over the divide  so i went down wrangel way past st marys and even to the queen charlottes trading running whiskey turning the sloop to most anything winter was on stiff and crisp and i was back to juneau when the word came  come the beggar says who brought the news  killisnoo say come now  whats the row i asks  chief george says he potlach  killisnoo makum klooch  ay it was bitterthe taku howling down out of the north the salt water freezing quick as it struck the deck and the old sloop and i hammering into the teeth of it for a hundred miles to dyea  had a douglass islander for crew when i started but midway up he was washed over from the bows  jibed all over and crossed the course three times but never a sign of him  doubled up with the cold most likely dick suggested putting a pause into the narrative while he hung one of mollys skirts up to dry and went down like a pot of lead  my idea  so i finished the course alone halfdead when i made dyea in the dark of the evening  the tide favored and i ran the sloop plump to the bank in the shelter of the river  couldnt go an inch further for the fresh water was frozen solid  halyards and blocks were that iced up i didnt dare lower mainsail or jib  first i broached a pint of the cargo raw and then leaving all standing ready for the start and with a blanket around me headed across the flat to the camp  no mistaking it was a grand layout  the chilcats had come in a bodydogs babies and canoesto say nothing of the dogears the little salmons and the missions  full half a thousand of them to celebrate tillys wedding and never a white man in a score of miles  nobody took note of me the blanket over my head and hiding my face and i waded knee deep through the dogs and youngsters till i was well up to the front  the show was being pulled off in a big open place among the trees with great fires burning and the snow moccasinpacked as hard as portland cement  next me was tilly beaded and scarletclothed galore and against her chief george and his head men  the shaman was being helped out by the big medicines from the other tribes and it shivered my spine up and down the deviltries they cut  i caught myself wondering if the folks in liverpool could only see me now and i thought of yellow haired gussie whose brother i licked after my first voyage just because he was not for having a sailorman courting his sister  and with gussie in my eyes i looked at tilly  a rum old world thinks i with man astepping in trails the mother little dreamed of when he lay at suck  so be  when the noise was loudest walrus hides booming and priests a singing i says are you ready  gawd  not a start not a shot of the eyes my way not the twitch of a muscle  i knew she answers slow and steady as a calm spring tide  where  the high bank at the edge of the ice i whispers back  jump out when i give the word  did i say there was no end of huskies  well there was no end  here there everywhere they were scattered abouttame wolves and nothing less  when the strain runs thin they breed them in the bush with the wild and theyre bitter fighters  right at the toe of my moccasin lay a big brute and by the heel another  i doubled the first ones tail quick till it snapped in my grip  as his jaws clipped together where my hand should have been i threw the second one by the scruff straight into his mouth  go i cried to tilly  you know how they fight  in the wink of an eye there was a raging hundred of them top and bottom ripping and tearing each other kids and squaws tumbling which way and the camp gone wild  tillyd slipped away so i followed  but when i looked over my shoulder at the skirt of the crowd the devil laid me by the heart and i dropped the blanket and went back  by then the dogsd been knocked apart and the crowd was untangling itself  nobody was in proper place so they didnt note that tillyd gone  hello i says gripping chief george by the hand  may your potlachsmoke rise often and the sticks bring many furs with the spring  lord love me dick but he was joyed to see mehim with the upper hand and wedding tilly  chance to puff big over me  the tale that i was hot after her had spread through the camps and my presence did him proud all hands knew me without my blanket and set to grinning and giggling it was rich but i made it richer by playing unbeknowing  whats the row i asks  whos getting married now  chief george the shaman says ducking his reverence to him  thought he had two klooches  him takum morethree with another duck  oh  and i turned away as though it didnt interest me  but this wouldnt do and everybody begins singing out killisnoo killisnoo  killisnoo what i asked  killisnoo klooch chief george they blathered  killisnoo klooch  i jumped and looked at chief george  he nodded his head and threw out his chest  shell be no klooch of yours i says solemnly  no klooch of yours i repeats while his face went black and his hand began dropping to his huntingknife  look i cries striking an attitude  big medicine  you watch my smoke  i pulled off my mittens rolled back my sleeves and made halfadozen passes in the air  killisnoo i shouts  killisnoo  killisnoo  i was making medicine and they began to scare  every eye was on me no time to find out that tilly wasnt there  then i called killisnoo three times again and waited and three times more  all for mystery and to make them nervous  chief george couldnt guess what i was up to and wanted to put a stop to the foolery but the shamans said to wait and that theyd see me and go me one better or words to that effect besides he was a superstitious cuss and i fancy a bit afraid of the white mans magic  then i called killisnoo long and soft like the howl of a wolf till the women were all atremble and the bucks looking serious  look i sprang forard pointing my finger into a bunch of squawseasier to deceive women than men you know  look  and i raised it aloft as though following the flight of a bird  up up straight overhead making to follow it with my eyes till it disappeared in the sky  killisnoo i said looking at chief george and pointing upward again killisnoo  so help me dick the gammon worked  half of them at least saw tilly disappear in the air  theyd drunk my whiskey at juneau and seen stranger sights ill warrant  why should i not do this thing i who sold bad spirits corked in bottles  some of the women shrieked everybody fell to whispering in bunches  i folded my arms and held my head high and they drew further away from me  the time was ripe to go grab him chief george cries  three or four of them came at me but i whirled quick made a couple of passes like to send them after tilly and pointed up  touch me  not for the kingdoms of the earth  chief george harangued them but he couldnt get them to lift a leg  then he made to take me himself but i repeated the mummery and his grit went out through his fingers  let your shamans work wonders the like of which i have done this night i says  let them call killisnoo down out of the sky whither i have sent her  but the priests knew their limits  may your klooches bear you sons as the spawn of the salmon i says turning to go and may your totem pole stand long in the land and the smoke of your camp rise always  but if the beggars could have seen me hitting the high places for the sloop as soon as i was clear of them theyd thought my own medicine had got after me  tillyd kept warm by chopping the ice away and was all ready to cast off  gawd how we ran before it the taku howling after us and the freezing seas sweeping over at every clip  with everything battened down me asteering and tilly chopping ice we held on half the night till i plumped the sloop ashore on porcupine island and we shivered it out on the beach blankets wet and tilly drying the matches on her breast  so i think i know something about it  seven years dick man and wife in rough sailing and smooth  and then she died in the heart of the winter died in childbirth up there on the chilcat station  she held my hand to the last the ice creeping up inside the door and spreading thick on the gut of the window  outside the lone howl of the wolf and the silence inside death and the silence  youve never heard the silence yet dick and gawd grant you dont ever have to hear it when you sit by the side of death  hear it  ay till the breath whistles like a siren and the heart booms booms booms like the surf on the shore  siwash dick but a woman  white dick white clear through  towards the last she says keep my feather bed tommy keep it always  and i agreed  then she opened her eyes full with the pain  ive been a good woman to you tommy and because of that i want you to promiseto promisethe words seemed to stick in her throatthat when you marry the woman be white  no more siwash tommy  i know  plenty white women down to juneau now  i know  your people call you squawman your women turn their heads to the one side on the street and you do not go to their cabins like other men  why  your wife siwash  is it not so and this is not good  wherefore i die  promise me  kiss me in token of your promise  i kissed her and she dozed off whispering it is good  at the end that near gone my ear was at her lips she roused for the last time remember tommy remember my feather bed  then she died in childbirth up there on the chilcat station  the tent heeled over and half flattened before the gale  dick refilled his pipe while tommy drew the tea and set it aside against mollys return  and she of the flashing eyes and yankee blood  blinded falling crawling on hand and knee the wind thrust back in her throat by the wind she was heading for the tent  on her shoulders a bulky pack caught the full fury of the storm  she plucked feebly at the knotted flaps but it was tommy and dick who cast them loose  then she set her soul for the last effort staggered in and fell exhausted on the floor  tommy unbuckled the straps and took the pack from her  as he lifted it there was a clanging of pots and pans  dick pouring out a mug of whiskey paused long enough to pass the wink across her body  tommy winked back  his lips pursed the monosyllable clothes but dick shook his head reprovingly  here little woman he said after she had drunk the whiskey and straightened up a bit  heres some dry togs  climb into them  were going out to extrapeg the tent  after that give us the call and well come in and have dinner  sing out when youre ready  so help me dick thats knocked the edge off her for the rest of this trip tommy spluttered as they crouched to the lee of the tent  but its the edge is her saving grace dick replied ducking his head to a volley of sleet that drove around a corner of the canvas  the edge that you and ive got tommy and the edge of our mothers before us     the man with the gash   jacob kent had suffered from cupidity all the days of his life  this in turn had engendered a chronic distrustfulness and his mind and character had become so warped that he was a very disagreeable man to deal with  he was also a victim to somnambulic propensities and very set in his ideas  he had been a weaver of cloth from the cradle until the fever of klondike had entered his blood and torn him away from his loom  his cabin stood midway between sixty mile post and the stuart river and men who made it a custom to travel the trail to dawson likened him to a robber baron perched in his fortress and exacting toll from the caravans that used his illkept roads  since a certain amount of history was required in the construction of this figure the less cultured wayfarers from stuart river were prone to describe him after a still more primordial fashion in which a command of strong adjectives was to be chiefly noted  this cabin was not his by the way having been built several years previously by a couple of miners who had got out a raft of logs at that point for a grubstake  they had been most hospitable lads and after they abandoned it travelers who knew the route made it an object to arrive there at nightfall  it was very handy saving them all the time and toil of pitching camp and it was an unwritten rule that the last man left a neat pile of firewood for the next comer  rarely a night passed but from half a dozen to a score of men crowded into its shelter  jacob kent noted these things exercised squatter sovereignty and moved in thenceforth the weary travelers were mulcted a dollar per head for the privilege of sleeping on the floor jacob kent weighing the dust and never failing to steal the downweight  besides he so contrived that his transient guests chopped his wood for him and carried his water  this was rank piracy but his victims were an easygoing breed and while they detested him they yet permitted him to flourish in his sins  one afternoon in april he sat by his doorfor all the world like a predatory spidermarvelling at the heat of the returning sun and keeping an eye on the trail for prospective flies  the yukon lay at his feet a sea of ice disappearing around two great bends to the north and south and stretching an honest two miles from bank to bank  over its rough breast ran the sledtrail a slender sunken line eighteen inches wide and two thousand miles in length with more curses distributed to the linear foot than any other road in or out of all christendom  jacob kent was feeling particularly good that afternoon  the record had been broken the previous night and he had sold his hospitality to no less than twentyeight visitors  true it had been quite uncomfortable and four had snored beneath his bunk all night but then it had added appreciable weight to the sack in which he kept his gold dust  that sack with its glittering yellow treasure was at once the chief delight and the chief bane of his existence  heaven and hell lay within its slender mouth  in the nature of things there being no privacy to his oneroomed dwelling he was tortured by a constant fear of theft  it would be very easy for these bearded desperatelooking strangers to make away with it  often he dreamed that such was the case and awoke in the grip of nightmare  a select number of these robbers haunted him through his dreams and he came to know them quite well especially the bronzed leader with the gash on his right cheek  this fellow was the most persistent of the lot and because of him he had in his waking moments constructed several score of hidingplaces in and about the cabin  after a concealment he would breathe freely again perhaps for several nights only to collar the man with the gash in the very act of unearthing the sack  then on awakening in the midst of the usual struggle he would at once get up and transfer the bag to a new and more ingenious crypt  it was not that he was the direct victim of these phantasms but he believed in omens and thoughttransference and he deemed these dreamrobbers to be the astral projection of real personages who happened at those particular moments no matter where they were in the flesh to be harboring designs in the spirit upon his wealth  so he continued to bleed the unfortunates who crossed his threshold and at the same time to add to his trouble with every ounce that went into the sack  as he sat sunning himself a thought came to jacob kent that brought him to his feet with a jerk  the pleasures of life had culminated in the continual weighing and reweighing of his dust but a shadow had been thrown upon this pleasant avocation which he had hitherto failed to brush aside  his goldscales were quite small in fact their maximum was a pound and a halfeighteen ounceswhile his hoard mounted up to something like three and a third times that  he had never been able to weigh it all at one operation and hence considered himself to have been shut out from a new and most edifying coign of contemplation  being denied this half the pleasure of possession had been lost nay he felt that this miserable obstacle actually minimized the fact as it did the strength of possession  it was the solution of this problem flashing across his mind that had just brought him to his feet  he searched the trail carefully in either direction  there was nothing in sight so he went inside  in a few seconds he had the table cleared away and the scales set up  on one side he placed the stamped disks to the equivalent of fifteen ounces and balanced it with dust on the other  replacing the weights with dust he then had thirty ounces precisely balanced  these in turn he placed together on one side and again balanced with more dust  by this time the gold was exhausted and he was sweating liberally  he trembled with ecstasy ravished beyond measure  nevertheless he dusted the sack thoroughly to the last least grain till the balance was overcome and one side of the scales sank to the table  equilibrium however was restored by the addition of a pennyweight and five grains to the opposite side  he stood head thrown back transfixed  the sack was empty but the potentiality of the scales had become immeasurable  upon them he could weigh any amount from the tiniest grain to pounds upon pounds mammon laid hot fingers on his heart  the sun swung on its westering way till it flashed through the open doorway full upon the yellowburdened scales  the precious heaps like the golden breasts of a bronze cleopatra flung back the light in a mellow glow  time and space were not  gawd blime me but you ave the makin of several quid there avent you  jacob kent wheeled about at the same time reaching for his doublebarrelled shotgun which stood handy  but when his eyes lit on the intruders face he staggered back dizzily  it was the face of the man with the gash  the man looked at him curiously  oh thats all right he said waving his hand deprecatingly  you neednt think as ill arm you or your blasted dust  youre a rum un you are he added reflectively as he watched the sweat pouring from off kents face and the quavering of his knees  wy dont you pipe up an say somethin he went on as the other struggled for breath  wots gone wrong o your gaff  anythink the matter  wwwhered you get it kent at last managed to articulate raising a shaking forefinger to the ghastly scar which seamed the others cheek  shipmate stove me down with a marlinspike from the mainroyal  an now as you ave your figgeread in trim wot i want to know is wots it to you  thats wot i want to knowwots it to you  gawd blime me do it urt you  aint it smug enough for the likes o you  thats wot i want to know  no no kent answered sinking upon a stool with a sickly grin  i was just wondering  did you ever see the like the other went on truculently  no  aint it a beute  yes  kent nodded his head approvingly intent on humoring this strange visitor but wholly unprepared for the outburst which was to follow his effort to be agreeable  you blasted bloomin burgooeatin sonofaseaswab  wot do you mean a sayin the most onsightly thing gawd almighty ever put on the face o man is a beute  wot do you mean you  and thereat this fiery son of the sea broke off into a string of oriental profanity mingling gods and devils lineages and men metaphors and monsters with so savage a virility that jacob kent was paralyzed  he shrank back his arms lifted as though to ward off physical violence  so utterly unnerved was he that the other paused in the midswing of a gorgeous peroration and burst into thunderous laughter  the suns knocked the bottom out o the trail said the man with the gash between departing paroxysms of mirth  an i only ope as youll appreciate the hoppertunity of consortin with a man o my mug  get steam up in that firebox o yourn  im goin to unrig the dogs an grub em  an dont be shy o the wood my lad theres plenty more where that come from and its youve got the time to sling an axe  an tote up a bucket o water while youre about it  lively or ill run you down so elp me  such a thing was unheard of  jacob kent was making the fire chopping wood packing waterdoing menial tasks for a guest  when jim cardegee left dawson it was with his head filled with the iniquities of this roadside shylock and all along the trail his numerous victims had added to the sum of his crimes  now jim cardegee with the sailors love for a sailors joke had determined when he pulled into the cabin to bring its inmate down a peg or so  that he had succeeded beyond expectation he could not help but remark though he was in the dark as to the part the gash on his cheek had played in it  but while he could not understand he saw the terror it created and resolved to exploit it as remorselessly as would any modern trader a choice bit of merchandise  strike me blind but youre a ustler he said admiringly his head cocked to one side as his host bustled about  you never ort to ave gone klondiking  its the keeper of a pub you was laid out for  an its often as i ave eard the lads up an down the river speak o you but i adnt no idea you was so jolly nice  jacob kent experienced a tremendous yearning to try his shotgun on him but the fascination of the gash was too potent  this was the real man with the gash the man who had so often robbed him in the spirit  this then was the embodied entity of the being whose astral form had been projected into his dreams the man who had so frequently harbored designs against his hoard hencethere could be no other conclusionthis man with the gash had now come in the flesh to dispossess him  and that gash  he could no more keep his eyes from it than stop the beating of his heart  try as he would they wandered back to that one point as inevitably as the needle to the pole  do it urt you jim cardegee thundered suddenly looking up from the spreading of his blankets and encountering the rapt gaze of the other it strikes me as ow it ud be the proper thing for you to draw your jib douse the glim an turn in seein as ow it worrits you  jes lay to that you swab or so elp me ill take a pull on your peakpurchases  kent was so nervous that it took three puffs to blow out the slushlamp and he crawled into his blankets without even removing his moccasins  the sailor was soon snoring lustily from his hard bed on the floor but kent lay staring up into the blackness one hand on the shotgun resolved not to close his eyes the whole night  he had not had an opportunity to secrete his five pounds of gold and it lay in the ammunition box at the head of his bunk  but try as he would he at last dozed off with the weight of his dust heavy on his soul  had he not inadvertently fallen asleep with his mind in such condition the somnambulic demon would not have been invoked nor would jim cardegee have gone mining next day with a dishpan  the fire fought a losing battle and at last died away while the frost penetrated the mossy chinks between the logs and chilled the inner atmosphere  the dogs outside ceased their howling and curled up in the snow dreamed of salmonstocked heavens where dogdrivers and kindred taskmasters were not  within the sailor lay like a log while his host tossed restlessly about the victim of strange fantasies  as midnight drew near he suddenly threw off the blankets and got up  it was remarkable that he could do what he then did without ever striking a light  perhaps it was because of the darkness that he kept his eyes shut and perhaps it was for fear he would see the terrible gash on the cheek of his visitor but be this as it may it is a fact that unseeing he opened his ammunition box put a heavy charge into the muzzle of the shotgun without spilling a particle rammed it down with double wads and then put everything away and got back into bed  just as daylight laid its steelgray fingers on the parchment window jacob kent awoke  turning on his elbow he raised the lid and peered into the ammunition box  whatever he saw or whatever he did not see exercised a very peculiar effect upon him considering his neurotic temperament  he glanced at the sleeping man on the floor let the lid down gently and rolled over on his back  it was an unwonted calm that rested on his face  not a muscle quivered  there was not the least sign of excitement or perturbation  he lay there a long while thinking and when he got up and began to move about it was in a cool collected manner without noise and without hurry  it happened that a heavy wooden peg had been driven into the ridgepole just above jim cardegees head  jacob kent working softly ran a piece of halfinch manila over it bringing both ends to the ground  one end he tied about his waist and in the other he rove a running noose  then he cocked his shotgun and laid it within reach by the side of numerous moosehide thongs  by an effort of will he bore the sight of the scar slipped the noose over the sleepers head and drew it taut by throwing back on his weight at the same time seizing the gun and bringing it to bear  jim cardegee awoke choking bewildered staring down the twin wells of steel  where is it kent asked at the same time slacking on the rope  you blastedugh  kent merely threw back his weight shutting off the others wind  bloominburugh  where is it kent repeated  wot  cardegee asked as soon as he had caught his breath  the golddust  wot golddust the perplexed sailor demanded  you know well enoughmine  aint seen nothink of it  wot do ye take me for  a safedeposit  wot ave i got to do with it anyow  mebbe you know and mebbe you dont know but anyway im going to stop your breath till you do know  and if you lift a hand ill blow your head off  vast heavin cardegee roared as the rope tightened  kent eased away a moment and the sailor wriggling his neck as though from the pressure managed to loosen the noose a bit and work it up so the point of contact was just under the chin  well kent questioned expecting the disclosure  but cardegee grinned  go ahead with your angin you bloomin old pot wolloper  then as the sailor had anticipated the tragedy became a farce  cardegee being the heavier of the two kent throwing his body backward and down could not lift him clear of the ground  strain and strive to the uttermost the sailors feet still stuck to the floor and sustained a part of his weight  the remaining portion was supported by the point of contact just under his chin  failing to swing him clear kent clung on resolved to slowly throttle him or force him to tell what he had done with the hoard  but the man with the gash would not throttle  five ten fifteen minutes passed and at the end of that time in despair kent let his prisoner down  well he remarked wiping away the sweat if you wont hang youll shoot  some men wasnt born to be hanged anyway  an its a pretty mess as youll make o this ere cabin floor cardegee was fighting for time  now look ere ill tell you wot we do well lay our eads longside an reason together  youve lost some dust  you say as ow i know an i say as ow i dont  lets get a hobservation an shape a course  vast heavin  kent dashed in maliciously imitating the others enunciation  im going to shape all the courses of this shebang and you observe and if you do anything more ill bore you as sure as moses  for the sake of my mother  whom god have mercy upon if she loves you  ah  would you  he frustrated a hostile move on the part of the other by pressing the cold muzzle against his forehead  lay quiet now  if you lift as much as a hair youll get it  it was rather an awkward task with the trigger of the gun always within pulling distance of the finger but kent was a weaver and in a few minutes had the sailor tied hand and foot  then he dragged him without and laid him by the side of the cabin where he could overlook the river and watch the sun climb to the meridian  now ill give you till noon and then  wot  youll be hitting the brimstone trail  but if you speak up ill keep you till the next bunch of mounted police come by  well gawd blime me if this aint a go  ere i be innercent as a lamb an ere you be lost all o your top amper an out o your reckonin run me foul an goin to rake me into ellfire  you bloomin old pirut  you  jim cardegee loosed the strings of his profanity and fairly outdid himself  jacob kent brought out a stool that he might enjoy it in comfort  having exhausted all the possible combinations of his vocabulary the sailor quieted down to hard thinking his eyes constantly gauging the progress of the sun which tore up the eastern slope of the heavens with unseemly haste  his dogs surprised that they had not long since been put to harness crowded around him  his helplessness appealed to the brutes  they felt that something was wrong though they knew not what and they crowded about howling their mournful sympathy  chook  mushon you siwashes he cried attempting in a vermicular way to kick at them and discovering himself to be tottering on the edge of a declivity  as soon as the animals had scattered he devoted himself to the significance of that declivity which he felt to be there but could not see  nor was he long in arriving at a correct conclusion  in the nature of things he figured man is lazy  he does no more than he has to  when he builds a cabin he must put dirt on the roof  from these premises it was logical that he should carry that dirt no further than was absolutely necessary  therefore he lay upon the edge of the hole from which the dirt had been taken to roof jacob kents cabin  this knowledge properly utilized might prolong things he thought and he then turned his attention to the moosehide thongs which bound him  his hands were tied behind him and pressing against the snow they were wet with the contact  this moistening of the rawhide he knew would tend to make it stretch and without apparent effort he endeavored to stretch it more and more  he watched the trail hungrily and when in the direction of sixty mile a dark speck appeared for a moment against the white background of an ice jam he cast an anxious eye at the sun  it had climbed nearly to the zenith  now and again he caught the black speck clearing the hills of ice and sinking into the intervening hollows but he dared not permit himself more than the most cursory glances for fear of rousing his enemys suspicion  once when jacob kent rose to his feet and searched the trail with care cardegee was frightened but the dogsled had struck a piece of trail running parallel with a jam and remained out of sight till the danger was past  ill see you ung for this cardegee threatened attempting to draw the others attention  an youll rot in ell jes you see if you dont  i say he cried after another pause dye blieve in ghosts  kents sudden start made him sure of his ground and he went on now a ghost as the right to aunt a man wot dont do wot he says and you cant shuffle me off till eight bellswot i mean is twelve oclockcan you cos if you do itll appen as ow ill aunt you  dye ear  a minute a second too quick an ill aunt you so elp me i will  jacob kent looked dubious but declined to talk  ows your chronometer  wots your longitude  ow do you know as your times correct cardegee persisted vainly hoping to beat his executioner out of a few minutes  is it barracks time you ave or is it the company time  cos if you do it before the stroke o the bell ill not rest  i give you fair warnin  ill come back  an if you avent the time ow will you know  thats wot i wantow will you tell  ill send you off all right kent replied  got a sundial here  no good  thirtytwo degrees variation o the needle  stakes are all set  ow did you set em  compass  no lined them up with the north star  sure  sure  cardegee groaned then stole a glance at the trail  the sled was just clearing a rise barely a mile away and the dogs were in full lope running lightly  ow close is the shadows to the line  kent walked to the primitive timepiece and studied it  three inches he announced after a careful survey  say jes sing out eight bells afore you pull the gun will you  kent agreed and they lapsed into silence  the thongs about cardegees wrists were slowly stretching and he had begun to work them over his hands  say ow close is the shadows  one inch  the sailor wriggled slightly to assure himself that he would topple over at the right moment and slipped the first turn over his hands  ow close  half an inch  just then kent heard the jarring churn of the runners and turned his eyes to the trail  the driver was lying flat on the sled and the dogs swinging down the straight stretch to the cabin  kent whirled back bringing his rifle to shoulder  it aint eight bells yet cardegee expostulated  ill aunt you sure  jacob kent faltered  he was standing by the sundial perhaps ten paces from his victim  the man on the sled must have seen that something unusual was taking place for he had risen to his knees his whip singing viciously among the dogs  the shadows swept into line  kent looked along the sights  make ready he commanded solemnly  eight b  but just a fraction of a second too soon cardegee rolled backward into the hole  kent held his fire and ran to the edge  bang  the gun exploded full in the sailors face as he rose to his feet  but no smoke came from the muzzle instead a sheet of flame burst from the side of the barrel near its butt and jacob kent went down  the dogs dashed up the bank dragging the sled over his body and the driver sprang off as jim cardegee freed his hands and drew himself from the hole  jim  the newcomer recognized him  whats the matter  wots the matter  oh nothink at all  it jest appens as i do little things like this for my ealth  wots the matter you bloomin idjit wots the matter eh  cast me loose or ill show you wot  urry up or ill olystone the decks with you  huh he added as the other went to work with his sheathknife  wots the matter  i want to know  jes tell me that will you wots the matter  hey  kent was quite dead when they rolled him over  the gun an oldfashioned heavyweighted muzzleloader lay near him  steel and wood had parted company  near the butt of the righthand barrel with lips pressed outward gaped a fissure several inches in length  the sailor picked it up curiously  a glittering stream of yellow dust ran out through the crack  the facts of the case dawned upon jim cardegee  strike me standin he roared eres a go  eres is bloomin dust gawd blime me an you too charley if you dont run an get the dish pan     jan the unrepentant      for theres never a law of god or man    runs north of fiftythree  jan rolled over clawing and kicking  he was fighting hand and foot now and he fought grimly silently  two of the three men who hung upon him shouted directions to each other and strove to curb the short hairy devil who would not curb  the third man howled  his finger was between jans teeth  quit yer tantrums jan an ease up panted red bill getting a stranglehold on jans neck  why on earth cant yeh hang decent and peaceable  but jan kept his grip on the third mans finger and squirmed over the floor of the tent into the pots and pans  youah no gentleman suh reproved mr taylor his body following his finger and endeavoring to accommodate itself to every jerk of jans head  you hev killed mistah gordon as brave and honorable a gentleman as ever hit the trail aftah the dogs  youah a murderah suh and without honah  an yer no comrade broke in red bill  if you was youd hang thout rampin around an roarin  come on jan theres a good fellow  dont give us no more trouble  jes quit an well hang yeh neat and handy an be done with it  steady all lawson the sailorman bawled  jam his head into the bean pot and batten down  but my fingah suh mr taylor protested  leggo with yr finger then  always in the way  but i cant mistah lawson  its in the critters gullet and nigh chewed off as t is  stand by for stays  as lawson gave the warning jan half lifted himself and the struggling quartet floundered across the tent into a muddle of furs and blankets  in its passage it cleared the body of a man who lay motionless bleeding from a bulletwound in the neck  all this was because of the madness which had come upon janthe madness which comes upon a man who has stripped off the raw skin of earth and grovelled long in primal nakedness and before whose eyes rises the fat vales of the homeland and into whose nostrils steals the whiff of bay and grass and flower and newturned soil  through five frigid years jan had sown the seed  stuart river forty mile circle city koyokuk kotzebue had marked his bleak and strenuous agriculture and now it was nome that bore the harvestnot the nome of golden beaches and ruby sands but the nome of 97 before anvil city was located or eldorado district organized  john gordon was a yankee and should have known better  but he passed the sharp word at a time when jans bloodshot eyes blazed and his teeth gritted in torment  and because of this there was a smell of saltpetre in the tent and one lay quietly while the other fought like a cornered rat and refused to hang in the decent and peacable manner suggested by his comrades  if you will allow me mistah lawson befoah we go further in this rumpus i would say it wah a good idea to pry this hyer varmints teeth apart  neither will he bite off nor will he let go  he has the wisdom of the sarpint suh the wisdom of the sarpint  lemme get the hatchet to him vociferated the sailor  lemme get the hatchet  he shoved the steel edge close to mr taylors finger and used the mans teeth as a fulcrum  jan held on and breathed through his nose snorting like a grampus  steady all  now she takes it  thank you suh it is a powerful relief  and mr taylor proceeded to gather into his arms the victims wildly waving legs  but jan upreared in his berserker rage bleeding frothing cursing five frozen years thawing into sudden hell  they swayed backward and forward panted sweated like some cyclopean manylegged monster rising from the lower deeps  the slushlamp went over drowned in its own fat while the midday twilight scarce percolated through the dirty canvas of the tent  for the love of gawd jan get yer senses back pleaded red bill  we aint goin to hurt yeh r kill yeh r anythin of that sort  jes want to hang yeh thats all an you amessin round an rampagin somethin terrible  to think of travellin trail together an then bein treated thisa way  wouldnt bleeved it of yeh jan  hes got too much steerageway  grab holt his legs taylor and heavem over  yes suh mistah lawson  do you press youah weight above after i give the word  the kentuckian groped about him in the murky darkness  now suh now is the accepted time  there was a great surge and a quarter of a ton of human flesh tottered and crashed to its fall against the sidewall  pegs drew and guyropes parted and the tent collapsing wrapped the battle in its greasy folds  yer only makin it harder fer yerself red bill continued at the same time driving both his thumbs into a hairy throat the possessor of which he had pinned down  youve made nuisance enough a ready an itll take half the day to get things straightened when weve strung yeh up  ill thank you to leave go suh spluttered mr taylor  red bill grunted and loosed his grip and the twain crawled out into the open  at the same instant jan kicked clear of the sailor and took to his heels across the snow  hi you lazy devils  buck  bright  sicm  pull m down sang out lawson lunging through the snow after the fleeing man  buck and bright followed by the rest of the dogs outstripped him and rapidly overhauled the murderer  there was no reason that these men should do this no reason for jan to run away no reason for them to attempt to prevent him  on the one hand stretched the barren snowland on the other the frozen sea  with neither food nor shelter he could not run far  all they had to do was to wait till he wandered back to the tent as he inevitably must when the frost and hunger laid hold of him  but these men did not stop to think  there was a certain taint of madness running in the veins of all of them  besides blood had been spilled and upon them was the blood lust thick and hot  vengeance is mine saith the lord and he saith it in temperate climes where the warm sun steals away the energies of men  but in the northland they have discovered that prayer is only efficacious when backed by muscle and they are accustomed to doing things for themselves  god is everywhere they have heard but he flings a shadow over the land for half the year that they may not find him so they grope in darkness and it is not to be wondered that they often doubt and deem the decalogue out of gear  jan ran blindly reckoning not of the way of his feet for he was mastered by the verb to live  to live  to exist  buck flashed gray through the air but missed  the man struck madly at him and stumbled then the white teeth of bright closed on his mackinaw jacket and he pitched into the snow  to live  to exist  he fought wildly as ever the centre of a tossing heap of men and dogs  his left hand gripped a wolfdog by the scruff of the back while the arm was passed around the neck of lawson  every struggle of the dog helped to throttle the hapless sailor  jans right hand was buried deep in the curling tendrils of red bills shaggy head and beneath all mr taylor lay pinned and helpless  it was a deadlock for the strength of his madness was prodigious but suddenly without apparent reason jan loosed his various grips and rolled over quietly on his back  his adversaries drew away a little dubious and disconcerted  jan grinned viciously  mine friends he said still grinning you haf asked me to be politeful und now i am politeful  vot piziness vood you do mit me  thats right jan  be cam soothed red bill  i knowed youd come to yer senses afore long  jes be cam now an well do the trick with neatness and despatch  vot piziness  vot trick  the hangin  an

and i tank yes you swab lawson spoke up mockingly at the same time cutting a sledlashing and coiling it up with ominous care  judge lynch holds court this day  von liddle while  jan stepped back from the proffered noose  i haf somedings to ask und to make der great proposition  kentucky you know about der shudge lynch  yes suh  it is an institution of free men and of gentlemen and it is an ole one and timehonored  corruption may wear the robe of magistracy suh but judge lynch can always be relied upon to give justice without court fees  i repeat suh without court fees  law may be bought and sold but in this enlightened land justice is free as the air we breathe strong as the licker we drink prompt as  cut it short  find out what the beggar wants interrupted lawson spoiling the peroration  vell kentucky tell me dis von man kill von odder man shudge lynch hang dot man  if the evidence is strong enoughyes suh  an the evidence in this here case is strong enough to hang a dozen men jan

and his hands are washed clean of blood  and further suh our great and glorious constitution has said to wit that no man may twice be placed in jeopardy of his life for one and the same crime or words

your eyes over der landscape und find der tird ding to tie der rope to  eh  vot you say  mechanically they swept the ice and snow with their eyes  it was a homogeneous scene devoid of contrasts or bold contours dreary desolate and monotonousthe icepacked sea the slow slope of the beach the background of lowlying hills and over all thrown the endless mantle of snow  no trees no bluffs no cabins no telegraph poles nothin moaned red bill nothin respectable enough nor big enough to swing the toes of a fivefoot man clear o the ground  i give it up  he looked yearningly at that portion of jans anatomy which joins the head and shoulders  give it up he repeated sadly to lawson  throw the rope down  gawd never intended this here country for livin purposes an thats a cold frozen fact  jan grinned triumphantly  i tank i go mit der tent und haf a smoke  ostensiblee yr correct bill me son spoke up lawson but yr a dummy and you can lay to that for another cold frozen fact  takes a sea farmer to learn you landsmen things  ever hear of a pair of shears  then clap yr eyes to this  the sailor worked rapidly  from the pile of dunnage where they had pulled up the boat the preceding fall he unearthed a pair of long oars these he lashed together at nearly right angles close to the ends of the blades  where the handles rested he kicked holes through the snow to the sand  at the point of intersection he attached two guyropes making the end of one fast to a cake of beachice  the other guy he passed over to red bill  here me son lay holt o that and run it out  and to his horror jan saw his gallows rise in the air  no no he cried recoiling and putting up his fists  it is not goot  i vill not hang  come you noddleheads  i vill lick you all together von after der odder  i vill blay hell  i vill do eferydings  und i vill die pefore i hang  the sailor permitted the two other men to clinch with the mad creature they rolled and tossed about furiously tearing up snow and tundra their fierce struggle writing a tragedy of human passion on the white sheet spread by nature  and ever and anon a hand or foot of jan emerged from the tangle to be gripped by lawson and lashed fast with ropeyarns pawing clawing blaspheming he was conquered and bound inch by inch and drawn to where the inexorable shears lay like a pair of gigantic dividers on the snow  red bill adjusted the noose placing the hangmans knot properly under the left ear  mr taylor and lawson tailed onto the runningguy ready at the word to elevate the gallows  bill lingered contemplating his work with artistic appreciation  herr gott  vood you look at it  the horror in jans voice caused the rest to desist  the fallen tent had uprisen and in the gathering twilight it flapped ghostly arms about and titubated toward them drunkenly  but the next instant john gordon found the opening and crawled forth  what the flaming  for the moment his voice died away in his throat as his eyes took in the tableau  hold on  im not dead he cried out coming up to the group with stormy countenance  allow me mistah gordon to congratulate you upon youah escape mr taylor ventured  a close shave suh a powahful close shave   congratulate hell  i might have been dead and rotten and no thanks to you you  and thereat john gordon delivered himself of a vigorous flood of english terse intensive denunciative and composed solely of expletives and adjectives  simply creased me he went on when he had eased himself sufficiently ever crease cattle taylor  yes suh many a time down in gods country  just so  thats what happened to me  bullet just grazed the base of my skull at the top of the neck  stunned me but no harm done  he turned to the bound man  get up jan  im going to lick you to a standstill or youre going to apologize  the rest of you lads stand clear  i tank not  shust tie me loose und you see replied jan the unrepentant the devil within him still unconquered  und after as i lick you i take der rest of der noddleheads von after der odder altogedder     grit of women   a wolfish head wistfuleyed and frostrimed thrust aside the tentflaps  hi  chook  siwash  chook you limb of satan chorused the protesting inmates  bettles rapped the dog sharply with a tin plate and it withdrew hastily  louis savoy refastened the flaps kicked a fryingpan over against the bottom and warmed his hands  it was very cold without fortyeight hours gone the spirit thermometer had burst at sixtyeight below and since that time it had grown steadily and bitterly colder there was no telling when the snap would end  and it is poor policy unless the gods will it to venture far from a stove at such times or to increase the quantity of cold atmosphere one must breathe  men sometimes do it and sometimes they chill their lungs  this leads up to a dry hacking cough noticeably irritable when bacon is being fried  after that somewhere along in the spring or summer a hole is burned in the frozen muck  into this a mans carcass is dumped covered over with moss and left with the assurance that it will rise on the crack of doom wholly and frigidly intact  for those of little faith sceptical of material integration on that fateful day no fitter country than the klondike can be recommended to die in  but it is not to be inferred from this that it is a fit country for living purposes  it was very cold without but it was not overwarm within  the only article which might be designated furniture was the stove and for this the men were frank in displaying their preference  upon half of the floor pine boughs had been cast above this were spread the sleepingfurs beneath lay the winters snowfall  the remainder of the floor was moccasinpacked snow littered with pots and pans and the general impedimenta of an arctic camp  the stove was red and roaring hot but only a bare three feet away lay a block of ice as sharpedged and dry as when first quarried from the creek bottom  the pressure of the outside cold forced the inner heat upward  just above the stove where the pipe penetrated the roof was a tiny circle of dry canvas next with the pipe always as centre a circle of steaming canvas next a damp and moistureexuding ring and finally the rest of the tent sidewalls and top coated with a halfinch of dry white crystalencrusted frost  oh  oh  oh  a young fellow lying asleep in the furs bearded and wan and weary raised a moan of pain and without waking increased the pitch and intensity of his anguish  his body halflifted from the blankets and quivered and shrank spasmodically as though drawing away

scandinavian with the tragic events which shadowed his passing had made a deep mark on the mining engineer  he lies up there somewhere  he swept his hand in the vague direction of the mysterious east  biggest man that ever turned his heels to salt water or run a moose down with sheer grit supplemented bettles but hes the provetherule exception  look at his woman ungatip the scales at a hundred an ten clean meat an nary ounce to spare  shed bank grit gainst his for all there was in him an see him an go him better if it was possible nothing over the earth or in it or under it she wouldnt a done  but she loved him objected the engineer  t aint that  it  look you brothers broke in sitka charley from his seat on the grub box  ye have spoken of the streak of fat that runs in big mens muscles of the grit of women and the love and ye have spoken fair but i have in mind things which happened when the land was young and the fires of men apart as the stars  it was then i had concern with a big man and a streak of fat and a woman  and the woman was small but her heart was greater than the beefheart of the man and she had grit  and we traveled a weary trail even to the salt water and the cold was bitter the snow deep the hunger great  and the womans love was a mighty loveno more can man say than this  he paused and with the hatchet broke pieces of ice from the large chunk beside him  these he threw into the gold pan on the stove where the drinkingwater thawed  the men drew up closer and he of the cramps sought greater comfort vainly for his stiffened body  brothers my blood is red with siwash but my heart is white  to the faults of my fathers i owe the one to the virtues of my friends the other  a great truth came to me when i was yet a boy  i learned that to your kind and you was given the earth that the siwash could not withstand you and like the caribou and the bear must perish in the cold  so i came into the warm and sat among you by your fires and behold i became one of you i have seen much in my time  i have known strange things and bucked big on big trails with men of many breeds and because of these things i measure deeds after your manner and judge men and think thoughts  wherefore when i speak harshly of one of your own kind i know you will not take it amiss and when i speak high of one of my fathers people you will not take it upon you to say sitka charley is siwash and there is a crooked light in his eyes and small honor to his tongue  is it not so  deep down in throat the circle vouchsafed its assent  the woman was passuk  i got her in fair trade from her people who were of the coast and whose chilcat totem stood at the head of a salt arm of the sea  my heart did not go out to the woman nor did i take stock of her looks  for she scarce took her eyes from the ground and she was timid and afraid as girls will be when cast into a strangers arms whom they have never seen before  as i say there was no place in my heart for her to creep for i had a great journey in mind and stood in need of one to feed my dogs and to lift a paddle with me through the long river days  one blanket would cover the twain so i chose passuk  have i not said i was a servant to the government  if not it is well that ye know  so i was taken on a warship sleds and dogs and evaporated foods and with me came passuk  and we went north to the winter icerim of bering sea where we were landedmyself and passuk and the dogs  i was also given moneys of the government for i was its servant and charts of lands which the eyes of man had never dwelt upon and messages these messages were sealed and protected shrewdly from the weather and i was to deliver them to the whaleships of the arctic icebound by the great mackenzie  never was there so great a river forgetting only our own yukon the mother of all rivers  all of which is neither here nor there for my story deals not with the whaleships nor the bergbound winter i spent by the mackenzie afterward in the spring when the days lengthened and there was a crust to the snow we came south passuk and i to the country of the yukon  a weary journey but the sun pointed out the way of our feet  it was a naked land then as i have said and we worked up the current with pole and paddle till we came to forty mile  good it was to see white faces once again so we put into the bank  and that winter was a hard winter the darkness and the cold drew down upon us and with them the famine  to each man the agent of the company gave forty pounds of flour and twenty of bacon  there were no beans  and the dogs howled always and there were flat bellies and deeplined faces and strong men became weak and weak men died  there was also much scurvy  then came we together in the store one night and the empty shelves made us feel our own emptiness the more  we talked low by the light of the fire for the candles had been set aside for those who might yet gasp in the spring  discussion was held and it was said that a man must go forth to the salt water and tell to the world our misery  at this all eyes turned to me for it was understood that i was a great traveler  it is seven hundred miles said i to haines mission by the sea and every inch of it snowshoe work  give me the pick of your dogs and the best of your grub and i will go  and with me shall go passuk  to this they were agreed  but there arose one long jeff a yankeeman bigboned and bigmuscled  also his talk was big  he too was a mighty traveler he said born to the snowshoe and bred up on buffalo milk  he would go with me in case i fell by the trail that he might carry the word on to the mission  i was young and i knew not yankeemen  how was i to know that big talk betokened the streak of fat or that yankeemen who did great things kept their teeth together  so we took the pick of the dogs and the best of the grub and struck the trail we threepassuk long jeff and i  well ye have broken virgin snow labored at the geepole and are not unused to the packed riverjams so i will talk little of the toil save that on some days we made ten miles and on others thirty but more often ten  and the best of the grub was not good while we went on stint from the start  likewise the pick of the dogs was poor and we were hard put to keep them on their legs  at the white river our three sleds became two sleds and we had only come two hundred miles  but we lost nothing the dogs that left the traces went into the bellies of those that remained  not a greeting not a curl of smoke till we made pelly  here i had counted on grub and here i had counted on leaving long jeff who was whining and trailsore  but the factors lungs were wheezing his eyes bright his cache nigh empty and he showed us the empty cache of the missionary also his grave with the rocks piled high to keep off the dogs  there was a bunch of indians there but babies and old men there were none and it was clear that few would see the spring  so we pulled on lightstomached and heavyhearted with half a thousand miles of snow and silence between us and haines mission by the sea  the darkness was at its worst and at midday the sun could not clear the sky line to the south  but the icejams were smaller the going better so i pushed the dogs hard and traveled late and early  as i said at forty mile every inch of it was snowshoe work  and the shoes made great sores on our feet which cracked and scabbed but would not heal  and every day these sores grew more grievous till in the morning when we girded on the shoes long jeff cried like a child  i put him at the fore of the light sled to break trail but he slipped off the shoes for comfort  because of this the trail was not packed his moccasins made great holes and into these holes the dogs wallowed  the bones of the dogs were ready to break through their hides and this was not good for them  so i spoke hard words to the man and he promised and broke his word  then i beat him with the dogwhip and after that the dogs wallowed no more  he was a child what of the pain and the streak of fat  but passuk  while the man lay by the fire and wept she cooked and in the morning helped lash the sleds and in the evening to unlash them  and she saved the dogs  ever was she to the fore lifting the webbed shoes and making the way easy  passukhow shall i sayi took it for granted that she should do these things and thought no more about it  for my mind was busy with other matters and besides i was young in years and knew little of woman  it was only on looking back that i came to understand  and the man became worthless  the dogs had little strength in them but he stole rides on the sled when he lagged behind  passuk said she would take the one sled so the man had nothing to do  in the morning i gave him his fair share of grub and started him on the trail alone  then the woman and i broke camp packed the sleds and harnessed the dogs  by midday when the sun mocked us we would overtake the man with the tears frozen on his cheeks and pass him  in the night we made camp set aside his fair share of grub and spread his furs  also we made a big fire that he might see  and hours afterward he would come limping in and eat his grub with moans and groans and sleep  he was not sick this man  he was only trailsore and tired and weak with hunger  but passuk and i were trailsore and tired and weak with hunger and we did all the work and he did none  but he had the streak of fat of which our brother bettles has spoken  further we gave the man always his fair share of grub  then one day we met two ghosts journeying through the silence  they were a man and a boy and they were white  the ice had opened on lake le barge and through it had gone their main outfit  one blanket each carried about his shoulders  at night they built a fire and crouched over it till morning  they had a little flour  this they stirred in warm water and drank  the man showed me eight cups of flourall they had and pelly stricken with famine two hundred miles away  they said also that there was an indian behind that they had whacked fair but that he could not keep up  i did not believe they had whacked fair else would the indian have kept up  but i could give them no grub  they strove to steal a dogthe fattest which was very thinbut i shoved my pistol in their faces and told them begone  and they went away like drunken men through the silence toward pelly  i had three dogs now and one sled and the dogs were only bones and hair  when there is little wood the fire burns low and the cabin grows cold  so with us  with little grub the frost bites sharp and our faces were black and frozen till our own mothers would not have known us  and our feet were very sore  in the morning when i hit the trail i sweated to keep down the cry when the pain of the snowshoes smote me  passuk never opened her lips but stepped to the fore to break the way  the man howled  the thirty mile was swift and the current ate away the ice from beneath and there were many airholes and cracks and much open water one day we came upon the man resting for he had gone ahead as was his wont in the morning  but between us was open water  this he had passed around by taking to the rimice where it was too narrow for a sled  so we found an icebridge  passuk weighed little and went first with a long pole crosswise in her hands in chance she broke through  but she was light and her shoes large and she passed over  then she called the dogs  but they had neither poles nor shoes and they broke through and were swept under by the water  i held tight to the sled from behind till the traces broke and the dogs went on down under the ice  there was little meat to them but i had counted on them for a weeks grub and they were gone  the next morning i divided all the grub which was little into three portions  and i told long jeff that he could keep up with us or not as he saw fit for we were going to travel light and fast  but he raised his voice and cried over his sore feet and his troubles and said harsh things against comradeship  passuks feet were sore and my feet were soreay sorer than his for we had worked with the dogs also we looked to see  long jeff swore he would die before he hit the trail again so passuk took a fur robe and i a cooking pot and an axe and we made ready to go  but she looked on the mans portion and said it is wrong to waste good food on a baby  he is better dead  i shook my head and said nothat a comrade once was a comrade always  then she spoke of the men of forty mile that they were many men and good and that they looked to me for grub in the spring  but when i still said no she snatched the pistol from my belt quick and as our brother bettles has spoken long jeff went to the bosom of abraham before his time  i chided passuk for this but she showed no sorrow nor was she sorrowful  and in my heart i knew she was right  sitka charley paused and threw pieces of ice into the gold pan on the stove  the men were silent and their backs chilled to the sobbing cries of the dogs as they gave tongue to their misery in the outer cold  and day by day we passed in the snow the sleepingplaces of the two ghostspassuk and iand we knew we would be glad for such ere we made salt water  then we came to the indian like another ghost with his face set toward pelly  they had not whacked up fair the man and the boy he said and he had had no flour for three days  each night he boiled pieces of his moccasins in a cup and ate them  he did not have much moccasins left  and he was a coast indian and told us these things through passuk who talked his tongue  he was a stranger in the yukon and he knew not the way but his face was set to pelly  how far was it two sleeps ten a hundredhe did not know but he was going to pelly it was too far to turn back he could only keep on  he did not ask for grub for he could see we too were hard put  passuk looked at the man and at me as though she were of two minds like a mother partridge whose young are in trouble  so i turned to her and said this man has been dealt unfair  shall i give him of our grub a portion  i saw her eyes light as with quick pleasure but she looked long at the man and at me and her mouth drew close and hard and she said no  the salt water is afar off and death lies in wait  better it is that he take this stranger man and let my man charley pass  so the man went away in the silence toward pelly  that night she wept never had i seen her weep before  nor was it the smoke of the fire for the wood was dry wood  so i marveled at her sorrow and thought her womans heart had grown soft at the darkness of the trail and the pain  life is a strange thing  much have i thought on it and pondered long yet daily the strangeness of it grows not less but more  why this longing for life  it is a game which no man wins  to live is to toil hard and to suffer sore till old age creeps heavily upon us and we throw down our hands on the cold ashes of dead fires  it is hard to live  in pain the babe sucks his first breath in pain the old man gasps his last and all his days are full of trouble and sorrow yet he goes down to the open arms of death stumbling falling with head turned backward fighting to the last  and death is kind  it is only life and the things of life that hurt  yet we love life and we hate death  it is very strange  we spoke little passuk and i in the days which came  in the night we lay in the snow like dead people and in the morning we went on our way walking like dead people  and all things were dead  there were no ptarmigan no squirrels no snowshoe rabbitsnothing  the river made no sound beneath its white robes  the sap was frozen in the forest  and it became cold as now and in the night the stars drew near and large and leaped and danced and in the day the sundogs mocked us till we saw many suns and all the air flashed and sparkled and the snow was diamond dust  and there was no heat no sound only the bitter cold and the silence  as i say we walked like dead people as in a dream and we kept no count of time  only our faces were set to salt water our souls strained for salt water and our feet carried us toward salt water  we camped by the tahkeena and knew it not  our eyes looked upon the white horse but we saw it not  our feet trod the portage of the canyon but they felt it not  we felt nothing  and we fell often by the way but we fell always with our faces toward salt water  our last grub went and we had shared fair passuk and i but she fell more often and at caribou crossing her strength left her  and in the morning we lay beneath the one robe and did not take the trail  it was in my mind to stay there and meet death handinhand with passuk for i had grown old and had learned the love of woman  also it was eighty miles to haines mission and the great chilcoot far above the timber line reared his stormswept head between  but passuk spoke to me low with my ear against her lips that i might hear  and now because she need not fear my anger she spoke her heart and told me of her love and of many things which i did not understand  and she said you are my man charley and i have been a good woman to you  and in all the days i have made your fire and cooked your food and fed your dogs and lifted paddle or broken trail i have not complained  nor did i say that there was more warmth in the lodge of my father or that there was more grub on the chilcat  when you have spoken i have listened  when you have ordered i have obeyed  is it not so charley  and i said ay it is so  and she said when first you came to the chilcat nor looked upon me but bought me as a man buys a dog and took me away my heart was hard against you and filled with bitterness and fear  but that was long ago for you were kind to me charley as a good man is kind to his dog  your heart was cold and there was no room for me yet you dealt me fair and your ways were just  and i was with you when you did bold deeds and led great ventures and i measured you against the men of other breeds and i saw you stood among them full of honor and your word was wise your tongue true  and i grew proud of you till it came that you filled all my heart and all my thought was of you  you were as the midsummer sun when its golden trail runs in a circle and never leaves the sky  and whatever way i cast my eyes i beheld the sun  but your heart was ever cold charley and there was no room  and i said it is so  it was cold and there was no room  but that is past  now my heart is like the snowfall in the spring when the sun has come back  there is a great thaw and a bending a sound of running waters and a budding and sprouting of green things  and there is drumming of partridges and songs of robins and great music for the winter is broken passuk and i have learned the love of woman  she smiled and moved for me to draw her closer  and she said i am glad  after that she lay quiet for a long time breathing softly her head upon my breast  then she whispered the trail ends here and i am tired  but first i would speak of other things  in the long ago when i was a girl on the chilcat i played alone among the skin bales of my fathers lodge for the men were away on the hunt and the women and boys were dragging in the meat  it was in the spring and i was alone  a great brown bear just awake from his winters sleep hungry his fur hanging to the bones in flaps of leanness shoved his head within the lodge and said oof  my brother came running back with the first sled of meat  and he fought the bear with burning sticks from the fire and the dogs in their harnesses with the sled behind them fell upon the bear  there was a great battle and much noise  they rolled in the fire the skin bales were scattered the lodge overthrown  but in the end the bear lay dead with the fingers of my brother in his mouth and the marks of his claws upon my brothers face  did you mark the indian by the pelly trail his mitten which had no thumb his hand which he warmed by our fire  he was my brother  and i said he should have no grub  and he went away in the silence without grub  this my brothers was the love of passuk who died in the snow by the caribou crossing  it was a mighty love for she denied her brother for the man who led her away on weary trails to a bitter end  and further such was this womans love she denied herself  ere her eyes closed for the last time she took my hand and slipped it under her squirrelskin parka to her waist  i felt there a wellfilled pouch and learned the secret of her lost strength  day by day we had shared fair to the last least bit and day by day but half her share had she eaten  the other half had gone into the wellfilled pouch  and she said this is the end of the trail for passuk but your trail charley leads on and on over the great chilcoot down to haines mission and the sea  and it leads on and on by the light of many suns over unknown lands and strange waters and it is full of years and honors and great glories  it leads you to the lodges of many women and good women but it will never lead you to a greater love than the love of passuk  and i knew the woman spoke true  but a madness came upon me and i threw the wellfilled pouch from me and swore that my trail had reached an end till her tired eyes grew soft with tears and she said among men has sitka charley walked in honor and ever has his word been true does he forget that honor now and talk vain words by the caribou crossing  does he remember no more the men of forty mile who gave him of their grub the best of their dogs the pick  ever has passuk been proud of her man  let him lift himself up gird on his snowshoes and begone that she may still keep her pride  and when she grew cold in my arms i arose and sought out the wellfilled pouch and girt on my snowshoes and staggered along the trail for there was a weakness in my knees and my head was dizzy and in my ears there was a roaring and a flashing of fire upon my eyes  the forgotten trails of boyhood came back to me  i sat by the full pots of the potlach feast and raised my voice in song and danced to the chanting of the men and maidens and the booming of the walrus drums  and passuk held my hand and walked by my side  when i laid down to sleep she waked me  when i stumbled and fell she raised me  when i wandered in the deep snow she led me back to the trail  and in this wise like a man bereft of reason who sees strange visions and whose thoughts are light with wine i came to haines mission by the sea  sitka charley threw back the tentflaps  it was midday  to the south just clearing the bleak henderson divide poised the colddisked sun  on either hand the sundogs blazed  the air was a gossamer of glittering frost  in the foreground beside the trail a wolfdog bristling with frost thrust a long snout heavenward and mourned     where the trail forks      must i then must i then now leave this town    and you my love stay hereschwabian folksong  the singer cleanfaced and cheeryeyed bent over and added water to a pot of simmering beans and then rising a stick of firewood in hand drove back the circling dogs from the grubbox and cookinggear  he was blue of eye and his long hair was golden and it was a pleasure to look upon his lusty freshness  a new moon was thrusting a dim horn above the white line of closepacked snowcapped pines which ringed the camp and segregated it from all the world  overhead so clear it was and cold the stars danced with quick pulsating movements  to the southeast an evanescent greenish glow heralded the opening revels of the aurora borealis  two men in the immediate foreground lay upon the bearskin which was their bed  between the skin and naked snow was a sixinch layer of pine boughs  the blankets were rolled back  for shelter there was a fly at their backsa sheet of canvas stretched between two trees and angling at fortyfive degrees  this caught the radiating heat from the fire and flung it down upon the skin  another man sat on a sled drawn close to the blaze mending moccasins  to the right a heap of frozen gravel and a rude windlass denoted where they toiled each day in dismal groping for the paystreak  to the left four pairs of snowshoes stood erect showing the mode of travel which obtained when the stamped snow of the camp was left behind  that schwabian folksong sounded strangely pathetic under the cold northern stars and did not do the men good who lounged about the fire after the toil of the day  it put a dull ache into their hearts and a yearning which was akin to bellyhunger and sent their souls questing southward across the divides to the sunlands  for the love of god sigmund shut up expostulated one of the men  his hands were clenched painfully but he hid them from sight in the folds of the bearskin upon which he lay  and what for dave wertz sigmund demanded  why shall i not sing when the heart is glad  because youve got no call to thats why  look about you man and think of the grub weve been defiling our bodies with for the last twelvemonth and the way weve lived and worked like beasts  thus abjured sigmund the goldenhaired surveyed it all and the frost rimmed wolfdogs and the vapor breaths of the men  and why shall not the heart be glad he laughed  it is good it is all good  as for the grub  he doubled up his arm and caressed the swelling biceps  and if we have lived and worked like beasts have we not been paid like kings twenty dollars to the pan the streak is running and we know it to be eight feet thick  it is another klondikeand we know itjim hawes there by your elbow knows it and complains not  and theres hitchcock he sews moccasins like an old woman and waits against the time  only you cant wait and work until the washup in the spring  then we shall all be rich rich as kings only you cannot wait  you want to go back to the states  so do i and i was born there but i can wait when each day the gold in the pan shows up yellow as butter in the churning  but you want your good time and like a child you cry for it now  bah  why shall i not sing     in a year in a year when the grapes are ripe       i shall stay no more away    then if you still are true my love       it will be our wedding day    in a year in a year when my time is past       then ill live in your love for aye    then if you still are true my love       it will be our wedding day  the dogs bristling and growling drew in closer to the firelight  there was a monotonous crunchcrunch of webbed shoes and between each crunch the dragging forward of the heel of the shoe like the sound of sifting sugar  sigmund broke off from his song to hurl oaths and firewood at the animals  then the light was parted by a furclad figure and an indian girl slipped out of the webs threw back the hood of her squirrelskin parka and stood in their midst  sigmund and the men on the bearskin greeted her as sipsu with the customary hello but hitchcock made room on the sled that she might sit beside him  and how goes it sipsu he asked talking after her fashion in broken english and bastard chinook  is the hunger still mighty in the camp and has the witch doctor yet found the cause wherefore game is scarce and no moose in the land  yes even so  there is little game and we prepare to eat the dogs also has the witch doctor found the cause of all this evil and tomorrow will he make sacrifice and cleanse the camp  and what does the sacrifice chance to bea newborn babe or some poor devil of a squaw old and shaky who is a care to the tribe and better out of the way  it chanced not that wise for the need was great and he chose none other than the chiefs daughter none other than i sipsu  hell  the word rose slowly to hitchcocks lips and brimmed over full and deep in a way which bespoke wonder and consideration  wherefore we stand by a forking of the trail you and i she went on calmly and i have come that we may look once more upon each other and once more only  she was born of primitive stock and primitive had been her traditions and her days so she regarded life stoically and human sacrifice as part of the natural order  the powers which ruled the daylight and the dark the flood and the frost the bursting of the bud and the withering of the leaf were angry and in need of propitiation  this they exacted in many waysdeath in the bad water through the treacherous icecrust by the grip of the grizzly or a wasting sickness which fell upon a man in his own lodge till he coughed and the life of his lungs went out through his mouth and nostrils  likewise did the powers receive sacrifice  it was all one  and the witch doctor was versed in the thoughts of the powers and chose unerringly  it was very natural  death came by many ways yet was it all one after alla manifestation of the allpowerful and inscrutable  but hitchcock came of a later worldbreed  his traditions were less concrete and without reverence and he said not so sipsu  you are young and yet in the full joy of life  the witch doctor is a fool and his choice is evil  this thing shall not be  she smiled and answered life is not kind and for many reasons  first it made of us twain the one white and the other red which is bad  then it crossed our trails and now it parts them again and we can do nothing  once before when the gods were angry did your brothers come to the camp  they were three big men and white and they said the thing shall not be  but they died quickly and the thing was  hitchcock nodded that he heard halfturned and lifted his voice  look here you fellows  theres a lot of foolery going on over to the camp and theyre getting ready to murder sipsu  what dye say  wertz looked at hawes and hawes looked back but neither spoke  sigmund dropped his head and petted the shepherd dog between his knees  he had brought shep in with him from the outside and thought a great deal of the animal  in fact a certain girl who was much in his thoughts and whose picture in the little locket on his breast often inspired him to sing had given him the dog and her blessing when they kissed goodby and he started on his northland quest  what dye say hitchcock repeated  mebbe its not so serious hawes answered with deliberation  most likely its only a girls story  that isnt the point  hitchcock felt a hot flush of anger sweep over him at their evident reluctance  the question is if it is so are we going to stand it  what are we going to do  i dont see any call to interfere spoke up wertz  if it is so it is so and thats all there is about it  its a way these people have of doing  its their religion and its no concern of ours  our concern is to get the dust and then get out of this godforsaken land  t isnt fit for naught else but beasts  and what are these black devils but beasts besides itd be damn poor policy  thats what i say chimed in hawes  here we are four of us three hundred miles from the yukon or a white face  and what can we do against halfahundred indians  if we quarrel with them we have to vamose if we fight we are wiped out  further weve struck pay and by god i for one am going to stick by it  ditto here supplemented wertz  hitchcock turned impatiently to sigmund who was softly singing     in a year in a year when the grapes are ripe       i shall stay no more away  well its this way hitchcock he finally said im in the same boat with the rest  if threescore bucks have made up their mind to kill the girl why we cant help it  one rush and wed be wiped off the landscape  and what goodd that be  theyd still have the girl  theres no use in going against the customs of a people except youre in force  but we are in force hitchcock broke in  four whites are a match for a hundred times as many reds  and think of the girl  sigmund stroked the dog meditatively  but i do think of the girl  and her eyes are blue like summer skies and laughing like summer seas and her hair is yellow like mine and braided in ropes the size of a big mans arms  shes waiting for me out there in a better land  and shes waited long and now my piles in sight im not going to throw it away  and shamed i would be to look into the girls blue eyes and remember the black ones of the girl whose blood was on my hands hitchcock sneered for he was born to honor and championship and to do the thing for the things sake nor stop to weigh or measure  sigmund shook his head  you cant make me mad hitchcock nor do mad things because of your madness  its a cold business proposition and a question of facts  i didnt come to this country for my health and further its impossible for us to raise a hand  if it is so it is too bad for the girl thats all  its a way of her people and it just happens were on the spot this one time  theyve done the same for a thousandthousand years and theyre going to do it now and theyll go on doing it for all time to come  besides theyre not our kind  nors the girl  no i take my stand with wertz and hawes and  but the dogs snarled and drew in and he broke off listening to the crunchcrunch of many snowshoes  indian after indian stalked into the firelight tall and grim furclad and silent their shadows dancing grotesquely on the snow  one the witch doctor spoke gutturally to sipsu  his face was daubed with savage paint blotches and over his shoulders was drawn a wolfskin the gleaming teeth and cruel snout surmounting his head  no other word was spoken  the prospectors held the peace  sipsu arose and slipped into her snowshoes  goodby o my man she said to hitchcock  but the man who had sat beside her on the sled gave no sign nor lifted his head as they filed away into the white forest  unlike many men his faculty of adaptation while large had never suggested the expediency of an alliance with the women of the northland his broad cosmopolitanism had never impelled toward covenanting in marriage with the daughters of the soil  if it had his philosophy of life would not have stood between  but it simply had not  sipsu  he had pleasured in campfire chats with her not as a man who knew himself to be man and she woman but as a man might with a child and as a man of his make certainly would if for no other reason than to vary the tedium of a bleak existence  that was all  but there was a certain chivalric thrill of warm blood in him despite his yankee ancestry and new england upbringing and he was so made that the commercial aspect of life often seemed meaningless and bore contradiction to his deeper impulses  so he sat silent with head bowed forward an organic force greater than himself as great as his race at work within him  wertz and hawes looked askance at him from time to time a faint but perceptible trepidation in their manner  sigmund also felt this  hitchcock was strong and his strength had been impressed upon them in the course of many an event in their precarious life  so they stood in a certain definite awe and curiosity as to what his conduct would be when he moved to action  but his silence was long and the fire nigh out when wertz stretched his arms and yawned and thought hed go to bed  then hitchcock stood up his full height  may god damn your souls to the deepest hells you chickenhearted cowards  im done with you  he said it calmly enough but his strength spoke in every syllable and every intonation was advertisement of intention  come on he continued whack up and in whatever way suits you best  i own a quarterinterest in the claims our contracts show that  therere twentyfive or thirty ounces in the sack from the test pans  fetch out the scales  well divide that now  and you sigmund measure me my quartershare of the grub and set it apart  four of the dogs are mine and i want four more  ill trade you my share in the camp outfit and mininggear for the dogs  and ill throw in my six or seven ounces and the spare 4590 with the ammunition  what dye say  the three men drew apart and conferred  when they returned sigmund acted as spokesman  well whack up fair with you hitchcock  in everything youll get your quartershare neither more nor less and you can take it or leave it  but we want the dogs as bad as you do so you get four and thats all  if you dont want to take your share of the outfit and gear why thats your lookout  if you want it you can have it if you dont leave it  the letter of the law hitchcock sneered  but go ahead  im willing and hurry up  i cant get out of this camp and away from its vermin any too quick  the division was effected without further comment  he lashed his meagre belongings upon one of the sleds rounded in his four dogs and harnessed up  his portion of outfit and gear he did not touch though he threw onto the sled half a dozen dog harnesses and challenged them with his eyes to interfere  but they shrugged their shoulders and watched him disappear in the forest        a man crawled upon his belly through the snow  on every hand loomed the moosehide lodges of the camp  here and there a miserable dog howled or snarled abuse upon his neighbor  once one of them approached the creeping man but the man became motionless  the dog came closer and sniffed and came yet closer till its nose touched the strange object which had not been there when darkness fell  then hitchcock for it was hitchcock upreared suddenly shooting an unmittened hand out to the brutes shaggy throat  and the dog knew its death in that clutch and when the man moved on was left brokennecked under the stars  in this manner hitchcock made the chiefs lodge  for long he lay in the snow without listening to the voices of the occupants and striving to locate sipsu  evidently there were many in the tent and from the sounds they were in high excitement  at last he heard the girls voice and crawled around so that only the moosehide divided them  then burrowing in the snow he slowly wormed his head and shoulders underneath  when the warm inner air smote his face he stopped and waited his legs and the greater part of his body still on the outside  he could see nothing nor did he dare lift his head  on one side of him was a skin bale  he could smell it though he carefully felt to be certain  on the other side his face barely touched a furry garment which he knew clothed a body  this must be sipsu  though he wished she would speak again he resolved to risk it  he could hear the chief and the witch doctor talking high and in a far corner some hungry child whimpering to sleep  squirming over on his side he carefully raised his head still just touching the furry garment  he listened to the breathing  it was a womans breathing he would chance it  he pressed against her side softly but firmly and felt her start at the contact  again he waited till a questioning hand slipped down upon his head and paused among the curls  the next instant the hand turned his face gently upward and he was gazing into sipsus eyes  she was quite collected  changing her position casually she threw an elbow well over on the skin bale rested her body upon it and arranged her parka  in this way he was completely concealed  then and still most casually she reclined across him so that he could breathe between her arm and breast and when she lowered her head her ear pressed lightly against his lips  when the time suits go thou he whispered out of the lodge and across the snow down the wind to the bunch of jackpine in the curve of the creek  there wilt thou find my dogs and my sled packed for the trail  this night we go down to the yukon and since we go fast lay thou hands upon what dogs come nigh thee by the scruff of the neck and drag them to the sled in the curve of the creek  sipsu shook her head in dissent but her eyes glistened with gladness and she was proud that this man had shown toward her such favor  but she like the women of all her race was born to obey the will masculine and when hitchcock repeated go he did it with authority and though she made no answer he knew that his will was law  and never mind harness for the dogs he added preparing to go  i shall wait  but waste no time  the day chaseth the night alway nor does it linger for mans pleasure  half an hour later stamping his feet and swinging his arms by the sled he saw her coming a surly dog in either hand  at the approach of these his own animals waxed truculent and he favored them with the butt of his whip till they quieted  he had approached the camp up the wind and sound was the thing to be most feared in making his presence known  put them into the sled he ordered when she had got the harness on the two dogs  i want my leaders to the fore  but when she had done this the displaced animals pitched upon the aliens  though hitchcock plunged among them with clubbed rifle a riot of sound went up and across the sleeping camp  now we shall have dogs and in plenty he remarked grimly slipping an axe from the sled lashings  do thou harness whichever i fling thee and betweenwhiles protect the team  he stepped a space in advance and waited between two pines  the dogs of the camp were disturbing the night with their jangle and he watched for their coming  a dark spot growing rapidly took form upon the dim white expanse of snow  it was a forerunner of the pack leaping cleanly and after the wolf fashion singing direction to its brothers  hitchcock stood in the shadow  as it sprang past he reached out gripped its forelegs in midcareer and sent it whirling earthward  then he struck it a welljudged blow beneath the ear and flung it to sipsu  and while she clapped on the harness he with his axe held the passage between the trees till a shaggy flood of white teeth and glistening eyes surged and crested just beyond reach  sipsu worked rapidly  when she had finished he leaped forward seized and stunned a second and flung it to her  this he repeated thrice again and when the sled team stood snarling in a string of ten he called enough  but at this instant a young buck the forerunner of the tribe and swift of limb wading through the dogs and cuffing right and left attempted the passage  the butt of hitchcocks rifle drove him to his knees whence he toppled over sideways  the witch doctor running lustily saw the blow fall  hitchcock called to sipsu to pull out  at her shrill chook the maddened brutes shot straight ahead and the sled bounding mightily just missed unseating her  the powers were evidently angry with the witch doctor for at this moment they plunged him upon the trail  the leaddog fouled his snowshoes and tripped him up and the nine succeeding dogs trod him under foot and the sled bumped over him  but he was quick to his feet and the night might have turned out differently had not sipsu struck backward with the long dogwhip and smitten him a blinding blow across the eyes  hitchcock hurrying to overtake her collided against him as he swayed with pain in the middle of the trail  thus it was when this primitive theologian got back to the chiefs lodge that his wisdom had been increased in so far as concerns the efficacy of the white mans fist  so when he orated then and there in the council he was wroth against all white men        tumble out you loafers  tumble out  grubll be ready before you get into your footgear  dave wertz threw off the bearskin sat up and yawned  hawes stretched discovered a lame muscle in his arm and rubbed it sleepily  wonder where hitchcock bunked last night he queried reaching for his moccasins  they were stiff and he walked gingerly in his socks to the fire to thaw them out  its a blessing hes gone he added though he was a mighty good worker  yep  too masterful  that was his trouble  too bad for sipsu  think he cared for her much  dont think so  just principle  thats all  he thought it wasnt rightand of course it wasntbut that was no reason for us to interfere and get hustled over the divide before our time  principle is principle and its good in its place but its best left to home when you go to alaska  eh  wertz had joined his mate and both were working pliability into their frozen moccasins  think we ought to have taken a hand  sigmund shook his head  he was very busy  a scud of chocolatecolored foam was rising in the coffeepot and the bacon needed turning  also he was thinking about the girl with laughing eyes like summer seas and he was humming softly  his mates chuckled to each other and ceased talking  though it was past seven daybreak was still three hours distant  the aurora borealis had passed out of the sky and the camp was an oasis of light in the midst of deep darkness  and in this light the forms of the three men were sharply defined  emboldened by the silence sigmund raised his voice and opened the last stanza of the old song     in a year in a year when the grapes are ripe  then the night was split with a rattling volley of rifleshots  hawes sighed made an effort to straighten himself and collapsed  wertz went over on an elbow with drooping head  he choked a little and a dark stream flowed from his mouth  and sigmund the goldenhaired his throat agurgle with the song threw up his arms and pitched across the fire        the witch doctors eyes were well blackened and his temper none of the best for he quarrelled with the chief over the possession of wertzs rifle and took more than his share of the partsack of beans  also he appropriated the bearskin and caused grumbling among the tribesmen  and finally he tried to kill sigmunds dog which the girl had given him but the dog ran away while he fell into the shaft and dislocated his shoulder on the bucket  when the camp was well looted they went back to their own lodges and there was a great rejoicing among the women further a band of moose strayed over the south divide and fell before the hunters so the witch doctor attained yet greater honor and the people whispered among themselves that he spoke in council with the gods  but later when all were gone the shepherd dog crept back to the deserted camp and all the night long and a day it wailed the dead  after that it disappeared though the years were not many before the indian hunters noted a change in the breed of timber wolves and there were dashes of bright color and variegated markings such as no wolf bore before     a daughter of the aurora   youwhat you calllazy mans you lazy mans would desire me to haf for wife  it is not good  nevaire no nevaire will lazy mans my hoosband be  thus joy molineau spoke her mind to jack harrington even as she had spoken it but more tritely and in his own tongue to louis savoy the previous night  listen joy  no no why moos i listen to lazy mans  it is vaire bad you hang rount make visitation to my cabin and do nothing  how you get grub for the famine  why haf not you the dust  odder mans haf plentee  but i work hard joy  never a day am i not on trail or up creek  even now have i just come off  my dogs are

mans go odder mans now rich  you know i was prospecting over on the headreaches of the tanana harrington protested and knew nothing of the eldorado or bonanza until it was too late  that is deeferent

claim  then they race o so queek like the wind to file the papaire  him be vaire rich  him get grub for famine  harrington hid the major portion of his interest  whens the time up he asked  what claim is it  so i speak louis savoy last night she continued ignoring him  him i think the winnaire  hang louis savoy  so louis savoy speak in my cabin last night  him say joy i am strong mans  i haf good dogs  i haf long wind  i will be winnaire  then you will haf me for hoosband  and i say to him i say  whatd you say  i say if louis savoy is winnaire then will he haf me for wife  and if he dont win  then louis savoy him will not bewhat you callthe father of my children  and if i win  you winnaire  ha ha  nevaire  exasperating as it was joy molineaus laughter was pretty to hear harrington did not mind it  he had long since been broken in  besides he was no exception  she had forced all her lovers to suffer in kind and very enticing she was just then her lips parted her color heightened by the sharp kiss of the frost her eyes vibrant with the lure which is the greatest of all lures and which may be seen nowhere save in womans eyes  her sleddogs clustered about her in hirsute masses and the leader wolf fang laid his long snout softly in her lap  if i do win harrington pressed  she looked from dog to lover and back again  what you say wolf fang  if him strong mans and file the papaire shall we his wife become  eh  what you say  wolf fang picked up his ears and growled at harrington  it is vaire cold she suddenly added with feminine irrelevance rising to her feet and straightening out the team  her lover looked on stolidly  she had kept him guessing from the first time they met and patience had been joined unto his virtues  hi  wolf fang she cried springing upon the sled as it leaped into sudden motion  ai  ya  mushon  from the corner of his eye harrington watched her swinging down the trail to forty mile  where the road forked and crossed the river to fort cudahy she halted the dogs and turned about  o mistaire lazy mans she called back  wolf fang him say yesif you winnaire        but somehow as such things will it leaked out and all forty mile which had hitherto speculated on joy molineaus choice between her two latest lovers now hazarded bets and guesses as to which would win in the forthcoming race  the camp divided itself into two factions and every effort was put forth in order that their respective favorites might be the first in at the finish  there was a scramble for the best dogs the country could afford for dogs and good ones were essential above all to success  and it meant much to the victor  besides the possession of a wife the like of which had yet to be created it stood for a mine worth a million at least  that fall when news came down of mccormacks discovery on bonanza all the lower country circle city and forty mile included had stampeded up the yukonat least all save those who like jack harrington and louis savoy were away prospecting in the west  moose pastures and creeks were staked indiscriminately and promiscuously and incidentally one of the unlikeliest of creeks eldorado  olaf nelson laid claim to five hundred of its linear feet duly posted his notice and as duly disappeared  at that time the nearest recording office was in the police barracks at fort cudahy just across the river from forty mile but when it became bruited abroad that eldorado creek was a treasurehouse it was quickly discovered that olaf nelson had failed to make the downyukon trip to file upon his property  men cast hungry eyes upon the ownerless claim where they knew a thousandthousand dollars waited but shovel and sluice box  yet they dared not touch it for there was a law which permitted sixty days to lapse between the staking and the filing during which time a claim was immune  the whole country knew of olaf nelsons disappearance and scores of men made preparation for the jumping and for the consequent race to fort cudahy  but competition at forty mile was limited  with the camp devoting its energies to the equipping either of jack harrington or louis savoy no man was unwise enough to enter the contest singlehanded  it was a stretch of a hundred miles to the recorders office and it was planned that the two favorites should have four relays of dogs stationed along the trail  naturally the last relay was to be the crucial one and for these twentyfive miles their respective partisans strove to obtain the strongest possible animals  so bitter did the factions wax and so high did they bid that dogs brought stiffer prices than ever before in the annals of the country  and as it chanced this scramble for dogs turned the public eye still more searchingly upon joy molineau  not only was she the cause of it all but she possessed the finest sleddog from chilkoot to bering sea  as wheel or leader wolf fang had no equal  the man whose sled he led down the last stretch was bound to win  there could be no doubt of it  but the community had an innate sense of the fitness of things and not once was joy vexed by overtures for his use and the factions drew consolation from the fact that if one man did not profit by him neither should the other  however since man in the individual or in the aggregate has been so fashioned that he goes through life blissfully obtuse to the deeper subtleties of his womankind so the men of forty mile failed to divine the inner deviltry of joy molineau  they confessed afterward that they had failed to appreciate this darkeyed daughter of the aurora whose father had traded furs in the country before ever they dreamed of invading it and who had herself first opened eyes on the scintillant northern lights  nay accident of birth had not rendered her less the woman nor had it limited her womans understanding of men  they knew she played with them but they did not know the wisdom of her play its deepness and its deftness  they failed to see more than the exposed card so that to the very last forty mile was in a state of pleasant obfuscation and it was not until she cast her final trump that it came to reckon up the score  early in the week the camp turned out to start jack harrington and louis savoy on their way  they had taken a shrewd margin of time for it was their wish to arrive at olaf nelsons claim some days previous to the expiration of its immunity that they might rest themselves and their dogs be fresh for the first relay  on the way up they found the men of dawson already stationing spare dog teams along the trail and it was manifest that little expense had been spared in view of the millions at stake  a couple of days after the departure of their champions forty mile began sending up their relaysfirst to the seventyfive station then to the fifty and last to the twentyfive  the teams for the last stretch were magnificent and so equally matched that the camp discussed their relative merits for a full hour at fifty below before they were permitted to pull out  at the last moment joy molineau dashed in among them on her sled  she drew lon mcfane who had charge of harringtons team to one side and hardly had the first words left her lips when it was noticed that his lower jaw dropped with a celerity and emphasis suggestive of great things  he unhitched wolf fang from her sled put him at the head of harringtons team and mushed the string of animals into the yukon trail  poor louis savoy men said but joy molineau flashed her black eyes defiantly and drove back to her fathers cabin        midnight drew near on olaf nelsons claim  a few hundred furclad men had preferred sixty below and the jumping to the inducements of warm cabins and comfortable bunks  several score of them had their notices prepared for posting and their dogs at hand  a bunch of captain constantines mounted police had been ordered on duty that fair play might rule  the command had gone forth that no man should place a stake till the last second of the day had ticked itself into the past  in the northland such commands are equal to jehovahs in the matter of potency the dumdum as rapid and effective as the thunderbolt  it was clear and cold  the aurora borealis painted palpitating color revels on the sky rosy waves of cold brilliancy swept across the zenith while great coruscating bars of greenish white blotted out the stars or a titans hand reared mighty arches above the pole  and at this mighty display the wolfdogs howled as had their ancestors of old time  a bearskincoated policeman stepped prominently to the fore watch in hand  men hurried among the dogs rousing them to their feet untangling their traces straightening them out  the entries came to the mark firmly gripping stakes and notices  they had gone over the boundaries of the claim so often that they could now have done it blindfolded  the policeman raised his hand  casting off their superfluous furs and blankets and with a final cinching of belts they came to attention  time  sixty pairs of hands unmitted as many pairs of moccasins gripped hard upon the snow  go  they shot across the wide expanse round the four sides sticking notices at every corner and down the middle where the two centre stakes were to be planted  then they sprang for the sleds on the frozen bed of the creek  an anarchy of sound and motion broke out  sled collided with sled and dogteam fastened upon dogteam with bristling manes and screaming fangs  the narrow creek was glutted with the struggling mass lashes and butts of dogwhips were distributed impartially among men and brutes  and to make it of greater moment each participant had a bunch of comrades intent on breaking him out of jam  but one by one and by sheer strength the sleds crept out and shot from sight in the darkness of the overhanging banks  jack harrington had anticipated this crush and waited by his sled until it untangled  louis savoy aware of his rivals greater wisdom in the matter of dogdriving had followed his lead and also waited  the rout had passed beyond earshot when they took the trail and it was not till they had travelled the ten miles or so down to bonanza that they came upon it speeding along in single file but well bunched  there was little noise and less chance of one passing another at that stage  the sleds from runner to runner measured sixteen inches the trail eighteen but the trail packed down fully a foot by the traffic was like a gutter  on either side spread the blanket of soft snow crystals if a man turned into this in an endeavor to pass his dogs would wallow perforce to their bellies and slow down to a snails pace  so the men lay close to their leaping sleds and waited  no alteration in position occurred down the fifteen miles of bonanza and klondike to dawson where the yukon was encountered  here the first relays waited  but here intent to kill their first teams if necessary harrington and savoy had had their fresh teams placed a couple of miles beyond those of the others  in the confusion of changing sleds they passed full half the bunch  perhaps thirty men were still leading them when they shot on to the broad breast of the yukon  here was the tug  when the river froze in the fall a mile of open water had been left between two mighty jams this had but recently crusted the current being swift and now it was as level hard and slippery as a dance floor  the instant they struck this glare ice harrington came to his knees holding precariously on with one hand his whip singing fiercely among his dogs and fearsome abjurations hurtling about their ears  the teams spread out on the smooth surface each straining to the uttermost  but few men in the north could lift their dogs as did jack harrington  at once he began to pull ahead and louis savoy taking the pace hung on desperately his leaders running even with the tail of his rivals sled  midway on the glassy stretch their relays shot out from the bank  but harrington did not slacken  watching his chance when the new sled swung in close he leaped across shouting as he did so and jumping up the pace of his fresh dogs  the other driver fell off somehow  savoy did likewise with his relay and the abandoned teams swerving to right and left collided with the others and piled the ice with confusion harrington cut out the pace savoy hung on  as they neared the end of the glare ice they swept abreast of the leading sled  when they shot into the narrow trail between the soft snowbanks they led the race and dawson watching by the light of the aurora swore that it was neatly done  when the frost grows lusty at sixty below men cannot long remain without fire or excessive exercise and live  so harrington and savoy now fell to the ancient custom of ride and run  leaping from their sleds tow thongs in hand they ran behind till the blood resumed its wonted channels and expelled the frost then back to the sleds till the heat again ebbed away  thus riding and running they covered the second and third relays  several times on smooth ice savoy spurted his dogs and as often failed to gain past  strung along for five miles in the rear the remainder of the race strove to overtake them but vainly for to louis savoy alone was the glory given of keeping jack harringtons killing pace  as they swung into the seventyfivemile station lon mcfane dashed alongside wolf fang in the lead caught harringtons eye and he knew that the race was his  no team in the north could pass him on those last twentyfive miles  and when savoy saw wolf fang heading his rivals team he knew that he was out of the running and he cursed softly to himself in the way woman is most frequently cursed  but he still clung to the others smoking trail gambling on chance to the last  and as they churned along the day breaking in the southeast they marvelled in joy and sorrow at that which joy molineau had done        forty mile had early crawled out of its sleeping furs and congregated near the edge of the trail  from this point it could view the upyukon course to its first bend several miles away  here it could also see across the river to the finish at fort cudahy where the gold recorder nervously awaited  joy molineau had taken her position several rods back from the trail and under the circumstances the rest of forty mile forbore interposing itself  so the space was clear between her and the slender line of the course  fires had been built and around these men wagered dust and dogs the long odds on wolf fang  here they come shrilled an indian boy from the top of a pine  up the yukon a black speck appeared against the snow closely followed by a second  as these grew larger more black specks manifested themselves but at a goodly distance to the rear  gradually they resolved themselves into dogs and sleds and men lying flat upon them  wolf fang leads a lieutenant of police whispered to joy  she smiled her interest back  ten to one on harrington cried a birch creek king dragging out his sack  the queen her pay you not mooch queried joy  the lieutenant shook his head  you have some dust ah how mooch she continued  he exposed his sack  she gauged it with a rapid eye  mebbesaytwo hundred eh  good  now i givewhat you callthe tip covaire the bet  joy smiled inscrutably  the lieutenant pondered  he glanced up the trail  the two men had risen to their knees and were lashing their dogs furiously harrington in the lead  ten to one on harrington bawled the birch creek king flourishing his sack in the lieutenants face  covaire the bet joy prompted  he obeyed shrugging his shoulders in token that he yielded not to the dictate of his reason but to her charm  joy nodded to reassure him  all noise ceased  men paused in the placing of bets  yawing and reeling and plunging like luggers before the wind the sleds swept wildly upon them  though he still kept his leader up to the tail of harringtons sled louis savoys face was without hope  harringtons mouth was set  he looked neither to the right nor to the left  his dogs were leaping in perfect rhythm firmfooted close to the trail and wolf fang head low and unseeing whining softly was leading his comrades magnificently  forty mile stood breathless  not a sound save the roar of the runners and the voice of the whips  then the clear voice of joy molineau rose on the air  ai  ya  wolf fang  wolf fang  wolf fang heard  he left the trail sharply heading directly for his mistress  the team dashed after him and the sled poised an instant on a single runner then shot harrington into the snow  savoy was by like a flash  harrington pulled to his feet and watched him skimming across the river to the gold recorders  he could not help hearing what was said  ah him do vaire well joy molineau was explaining to the lieutenant himwhat you callset the pace  yes him set the pace vaire well     at the rainbows end   i   it was for two reasons that montana kid discarded his chaps and mexican spurs and shook the dust of the idaho ranges from his feet  in the first place the encroachments of a steady sober and sternly moral civilization had destroyed the primeval status of the western cattle ranges and refined society turned the cold eye of disfavor upon him and his ilk  in the second place in one of its cyclopean moments the race had arisen and shoved back its frontier several thousand miles  thus with unconscious foresight did mature society make room for its adolescent members  true the new territory was mostly barren but its several hundred thousand square miles of frigidity at least gave breathing space to those who else would have suffocated at home  montana kid was such a one  heading for the seacoast with a haste several sheriffs posses might possibly have explained and with more nerve than coin of the realm he succeeded in shipping from a puget sound port and managed to survive the contingent miseries of steerage seasickness and steerage grub  he was rather sallow and drawn but still his own indomitable self when he landed on the dyea beach one day in the spring of the year  between the cost of dogs grub and outfits and the customs exactions of the two clashing governments it speedily penetrated to his understanding that the northland was anything save a poor mans mecca  so he cast about him in search of quick harvests between the beach and the passes were scattered many thousands of passionate pilgrims  these pilgrims montana kid proceeded to farm  at first he dealt faro in a pineboard gambling shack but disagreeable necessity forced him to drop a sudden period into a mans life and to move on up trail  then he effected a corner in horseshoe nails and they circulated at par with legal tender four to the dollar till an unexpected consignment of a hundred barrels or so broke the market and forced him to disgorge his stock at a loss  after that he located at sheep camp organized the professional packers and jumped the freight ten cents a pound in a single day  in token of their gratitude the packers patronized his faro and roulette layouts and were mulcted cheerfully of their earnings  but his commercialism was of too lusty a growth to be long endured so they rushed him one night burned his shanty divided the bank and headed him up the trail with empty pockets  illluck was his running mate  he engaged with responsible parties to run whisky across the line by way of precarious and unknown trails lost his indian guides and had the very first outfit confiscated by the mounted police  numerous other misfortunes tended to make him bitter of heart and wanton of action and he celebrated his arrival at lake bennett by terrorizing the camp for twenty straight hours  then a miners meeting took him in hand and commanded him to make himself scarce  he had a wholesome respect for such assemblages and he obeyed in such haste that he inadvertently removed himself at the tailend of another mans dog team  this was equivalent to horsestealing in a more mellow clime so he hit only the high places across bennett and down tagish and made his first camp a full hundred miles to the north  now it happened that the break of spring was at hand and many of the principal citizens of dawson were travelling south on the last ice  these he met and talked with noted their names and possessions and passed on he had a good memory also a fair imagination nor was veracity one of his virtues    ii   dawson always eager for news beheld montana kids sled heading down the yukon and went out on the ice to meet him  no he hadnt any newspapers didnt know whether durrant was hanged yet nor who had won the thanksgiving game hadnt heard whether the united states and spain had gone to fighting didnt know who dreyfus was but obrien  hadnt they heard  obrien why he was drowned in the white horse sitka charley the only one of the party who escaped  joe ladue  both legs frozen and amputated at the five fingers  and jack dalton  blown up on the sea lion with all hands  and bettles  wrecked on the carthagina in seymour narrowstwenty survivors out of three hundred and swiftwater bill  gone through the rotten ice of lake lebarge with six female members of the opera troupe he was convoying  governor walsh lost with all hands and eight sleds on the thirty mile  devereaux  who was devereaux  oh the courier  shot by indians on lake marsh  so it went  the word was passed along  men shouldered in to ask after friends and partners and in turn were shouldered out too stunned for blasphemy  by the time montana kid gained the bank he was surrounded by several hundred furclad miners  when he passed the barracks he was the centre of a procession  at the opera house he was the nucleus of an excited mob each member struggling for a chance to ask after some absent comrade  on every side he was being invited to drink  never before had the klondike thus opened its arms to a chechaqua  all dawson was humming  such a series of catastrophes had never occurred in its history  every man of note who had gone south in the spring had been wiped out  the cabins vomited forth their occupants  wildeyed men hurried down from the creeks and gulches to seek out this man who had told a tale of such disaster  the russian halfbreed wife of bettles sought the fireplace inconsolable and rocked back and forth and ever and anon flung white woodashes upon her raven hair  the flag at the barracks flopped dismally at halfmast  dawson mourned its dead  why montana kid did this thing no man may know  nor beyond the fact that the truth was not in him can explanation be hazarded  but for five whole days he plunged the land in wailing and sorrow and for five whole days he was the only man in the klondike  the country gave him its best of bed and board  the saloons granted him the freedom of their bars  men sought him continuously  the high officials bowed down to him for further information and he was feasted at the barracks by constantine and his brother officers  and then one day devereaux the government courier halted his tired dogs before the gold commissioners office dead  who said so  give him a moose steak and hed show them how dead he was  why governor walsh was in camp on the little salmon and obrien coming in on the first water  dead  give him a moose steak and hed show them  and forthwith dawson hummed  the barracks flag rose to the masthead and bettles wife washed herself and put on clean raiment  the community subtly signified its desire that montana kid obliterate himself from the landscape  and montana kid obliterated as usual at the tailend of some one elses dog team  dawson rejoiced when he headed down the yukon and wished him godspeed to the ultimate destination of the casehardened sinner  after that the owner of the dogs bestirred himself made complaint to constantine and from him received the loan of a policeman    iii   with circle city in prospect and the last ice crumbling under his runners montana kid took advantage of the lengthening days and travelled his dogs late and early  further he had but little doubt that the owner of the dogs in question had taken his trail and he wished to make american territory before the river broke  but by the afternoon of the third day it became evident that he had lost in his race with spring  the yukon was growling and straining at its fetters  long detours became necessary for the trail had begun to fall through into the swift current beneath while the ice in constant unrest was thundering apart in great gaping fissures  through these and through countless airholes the water began to sweep across the surface of the ice and by the time he pulled into a woodchoppers cabin on the point of an island the dogs were being rushed off their feet and were swimming more often than not  he was greeted sourly by the two residents but he unharnessed and proceeded to cook up  donald and davy were fair specimens of frontier inefficients  canadian born citybred scots in a foolish moment they had resigned their countinghouse desks drawn upon their savings and gone klondiking  and now they were feeling the rough edge of the country  grubless spiritless with a lust for home in their hearts they had been staked by the p c company to cut wood for its steamers with the promise at the end of a passage home  disregarding the possibilities of the icerun they had fittingly demonstrated their inefficiency by their choice of the island on which they located  montana kid though possessing little knowledge of the breakup of a great river looked about him dubiously and cast yearning glances at the distant bank where the towering bluffs promised immunity from all the ice of the northland  after feeding himself and dogs he lighted his pipe and strolled out to get a better idea of the situation  the island like all its river brethren stood higher at the upper end and it was here that donald and davy had built their cabin and piled many cords of wood  the far shore was a full mile away while between the island and the near shore lay a backchannel perhaps a hundred yards across  at first sight of this montana kid was tempted to take his dogs and escape to the mainland but on closer inspection he discovered a rapid current flooding on top below the river twisted sharply to the west and in this turn its breast was studded by a maze of tiny islands  thats where shell jam he remarked to himself  half a dozen sleds evidently bound upstream to dawson were splashing through the chill water to the tail of the island  travel on the river was passing from the precarious to the impossible and it was nip and tuck with them till they gained the island and came up the path of the woodchoppers toward the cabin  one of them snowblind towed helplessly at the rear of a sled  husky young fellows they were rough garmented and trailworn yet montana kid had met the breed before and knew at once that it was not his kind  hello  hows things up dawsonway queried the foremost passing his eye over donald and davy and settling it upon the kid  a first meeting in the wilderness is not characterized by formality  the talk quickly became general and the news of the upper and lower countries was swapped equitably back and forth  but the little the newcomers had was soon over with for they had wintered at minook a thousand miles below where nothing was doing  montana kid however was fresh from salt water and they annexed him while they pitched camp swamping him with questions concerning the outside from which they had been cut off for a twelvemonth  a shrieking split suddenly lifting itself above the general uproar on the river drew everybody to the bank  the surface water had increased in depth and the ice assailed from above and below was struggling to tear itself from the grip of the shores  fissures reverberated into life before their eyes and the air was filled with multitudinous crackling crisp and sharp like the sound that goes up on a clear day from the firing line  from up the river two men were racing a dog team toward them on an uncovered stretch of ice  but even as they looked the pair struck the water and began to flounder through  behind where their feet had sped the moment before the ice broke up and turned turtle  through this opening the river rushed out upon them to their waists burying the sled and swinging the dogs off at right angles in a drowning tangle  but the men stopped their flight to give the animals a fighting chance and they groped hurriedly in the cold confusion slashing at the detaining traces with their sheathknives  then they fought their way to the bank through swirling water and grinding ice where foremost in leaping to the rescue among the jarring fragments was the kid  why blime me if it aint montana kid exclaimed one of the men whom the kid was just placing upon his feet at the top of the bank  he wore the scarlet tunic of the mounted police and jocularly raised his right hand in salute  got a warrant for you kid he continued drawing a bedraggled paper from his breast pocket an i ope as youll come along peaceable  montana kid looked at the chaotic river and shrugged his shoulders and the policeman following his glance smiled  where are the dogs his companion asked  gentlemen interrupted the policeman this ere mate o mine is jack sutherland owner of twentytwo eldorado  not sutherland of 92 broke in the snowblinded minook man groping feebly toward him  the same  sutherland gripped his hand  and you  oh im after your time but i remember you in my freshman yearyou were doing p g work then  boys he called turning half about this is sutherland jack sutherland erstwhile fullback on the varsity  come up you goldchasers and fall upon him  sutherland this is greenwichplayed quarter two seasons back  yes i read of the game sutherland said shaking hands  and i remember that big run of yours for the first touchdown  greenwich flushed darkly under his tanned skin and awkwardly made room for another  and heres matthewsberkeley man  and weve got some eastern cracks knocking about too  come up you princeton men  come up  this is sutherland jack sutherland  then they fell upon him heavily carried him into camp and supplied him with dry clothes and numerous mugs of black tea  donald and davy overlooked had retired to their nightly game of crib montana kid followed them with the policeman  here get into some dry togs he said pulling them from out his scanty kit  guess youll have to bunk with me too  well i say youre a good un the policeman remarked as he pulled on the other mans socks sorry ive got to take you back to dawson but i only ope they wont be ard on you  not so fast  the kid smiled curiously  we aint under way yet  when i go im going down river and i guess the chances are youll go along  not if i know myself  come on outside and ill show you then  these damn fools thrusting a thumb over his shoulder at the two scots played smash when they located here  fill your pipe firstthis is pretty good plugand enjoy yourself while you can  you havent many smokes before you  the policeman went with him wonderingly while donald and davy dropped their cards and followed  the minook men noticed montana kid pointing now up the river now down and came over  whats up sutherland demanded  nothing much  nonchalance sat well upon the kid  just a case of raising hell and putting a chunk under  see that bend down there  thats where shell jam millions of tons of ice  then shell jam in the bends up above millions of tons  upper jam breaks first lower jam holds pouf  he dramatically swept the island with his hand  millions of tons he added reflectively  and what of the woodpiles davy questioned  the kid repeated his sweeping gestures and davy wailed the labor of months  it canna be  na na lad it canna be  i doot not its a jowk ay say that it is he appealed  but when the kid laughed harshly and turned on his heel davy flung himself upon the piles and began frantically to toss the cordwood back from the bank  lend a hand donald he cried  can ye no lend a hand  t is the labor of months and the passage home  donald caught him by the arm and shook him but he tore free  did ye no hear man  millions of tons and the island shall be sweepit clean  straighten yersel up man said donald  its a bit fashed ye are  but davy fell upon the cordwood  donald stalked back to the cabin buckled on his money belt and davys and went out to the point of the island where the ground was highest and where a huge pine towered above its fellows  the men before the cabin heard the ringing of his axe and smiled greenwich returned from across the island with the word that they were penned in  it was impossible to cross the backchannel  the blind minook man began to sing and the rest joined in with     wonder if its true    does it seem so to you    seems to me hes lying    oh i wonder if its true  its ay sinfu davy moaned lifting his head and watching them dance in the slanting rays of the sun  and my guid wood a going to waste     oh i wonder if its true  was flaunted back  the noise of the river ceased suddenly  a strange calm wrapped about them  the ice had ripped from the shores and was floating higher on the surface of the river which was rising  up it came swift and silent for twenty feet till the huge cakes rubbed softly against the crest of the bank  the tail of the island being lower was overrun  then without effort the white flood started downstream  but the sound increased with the momentum and soon the whole island was shaking and quivering with the shock of the grinding bergs  under pressure the mighty cakes weighing hundreds of tons were shot into the air like peas  the frigid anarchy increased its riot and the men had to shout into one anothers ears to be heard  occasionally the racket from the back channel could be heard above the tumult  the island shuddered with the impact of an enormous cake which drove in squarely upon its point  it ripped a score of pines out by the roots then swinging around and over lifted its muddy base from the bottom of the river and bore down upon the cabin slicing the bank and trees away like a gigantic knife  it seemed barely to graze the corner of the cabin but the cribbed logs tilted up like matches and the structure like a toy house fell backward in ruin  the labor of months  the labor of months and the passage home davy wailed while montana kid and the policeman dragged him backward from the woodpiles  youll ave plenty o hoppertunity all in good time for yer passage ome the policeman growled clouting him alongside the head and sending him flying into safety  donald from the top of the pine saw the devastating berg sweep away the cordwood and disappear downstream  as though satisfied with this damage the iceflood quickly dropped to its old level and began to slacken its pace  the noise likewise eased down and the others could hear donald shouting from his eyrie to look downstream  as forecast the jam had come among the islands in the bend and the ice was piling up in a great barrier which stretched from shore to shore  the river came to a standstill and the water finding no outlet began to rise  it rushed up till the island was awash the men splashing around up to their knees and the dogs swimming to the ruins of the cabin  at this stage it abruptly became stationary with no perceptible rise or fall  montana kid shook his head  its jammed above and no mores coming down  and the gamble is which jam will break first sutherland added  exactly the kid affirmed  if the upper jam breaks first we havent a chance  nothing will stand before it  the minook men turned away in silence but soon rumsky ho floated upon the quiet air followed by the orange and the black  room was made in the circle for montana kid and the policeman and they quickly caught the ringing rhythm of the choruses as they drifted on from song to song  oh donald will ye no lend a hand davy sobbed at the foot of the tree into which his comrade had climbed  oh donald man will ye no lend a hand he sobbed again his hands bleeding from vain attempts to scale the slippery trunk  but donald had fixed his gaze up river and now his voice rang out vibrant with fear     god almichty here she comes  standing kneedeep in the icy water the minook men with montana kid and the policeman gripped hands and raised their voices in the terrible battle hymn of the republic  but the words were drowned in the advancing roar  and to donald was vouchsafed a sight such as no man may see and live  a great wall of white flung itself upon the island  trees dogs men were blotted out as though the hand of god had wiped the face of nature clean  this much he saw then swayed an instant longer in his lofty perch and hurtled far out into the frozen hell     the scorn of women   i   once freda and mrs eppingwell clashed  now freda was a greek girl and a dancer  at least she purported to be greek but this was doubted by many for her classic face had overmuch strength in it and the tides of hell which rose in her eyes made at rare moments her ethnology the more dubious  to a fewmenthis sight had been vouchsafed and though long years may have passed they have not forgotten nor will they ever forget  she never talked of herself so that it were well to let it go down that when in repose expurgated greek she certainly was  her furs were the most magnificent in all the country from chilcoot to st michaels and her name was common on the lips of men  but mrs eppingwell was the wife of a captain also a social constellation of the first magnitude the path of her orbit marking the most select coterie in dawsona coterie captioned by the profane as the official clique  sitka charley had travelled trail with her once when famine drew tight and a mans life was less than a cup of flour and his judgment placed her above all women  sitka charley was an indian his criteria were primitive but his word was flat and his verdict a hallmark in every camp under the circle  these two women were manconquering mansubduing machines each in her own way and their ways were different  mrs eppingwell ruled in her own house and at the barracks where were younger sons galore to say nothing of the chiefs of the police the executive and the judiciary freda ruled down in the town but the men she ruled were the same who functioned socially at the barracks or were fed tea and canned preserves at the hand of mrs eppingwell in her hillside cabin of roughhewn logs each knew the other existed but their lives were apart as the poles and while they must have heard stray bits of news and were curious they were never known to ask a question  and there would have been no trouble had not a free lance in the shape of the modelwoman come into the land on the first ice with a spanking dogteam and a cosmopolitan reputation loraine lisznayialliterative dramatic and hungarianprecipitated the strife and because of her mrs eppingwell left her hillside and invaded fredas domain and freda likewise went up from the town to spread confusion and embarrassment at the governors ball  all of which may be ancient history so far as the klondike is concerned but very few even in dawson know the inner truth of the matter nor beyond those few are there any fit to measure the wife of the captain or the greek dancer  and that all are now permitted to understand let honor be accorded sitka charley  from his lips fell the main facts in the screed herewith presented  it ill befits that freda herself should have waxed confidential to a mere scribbler of words or that mrs eppingwell made mention of the things which happened  they may have spoken but it is unlikely    ii   floyd vanderlip was a strong man apparently  hard work and hard grub had no terrors for him as his early history in the country attested  in danger he was a lion and when he held in check half a thousand starving men as he once did it was remarked that no cooler eye ever took the glint of sunshine on a riflesight  he had but one weakness and even that rising from out his strength was of a negative sort  his parts were strong but they lacked coordination  now it happened that while his centre of amativeness was pronounced it had lain mute and passive during the years he lived on moose and salmon and chased glowing eldorados over chill divides  but when he finally blazed the cornerpost and centrestakes on one of the richest klondike claims it began to quicken and when he took his place in society a fullfledged bonanza king it awoke and took charge of him  he suddenly recollected a girl in the states and it came to him quite forcibly not only that she might be waiting for him but that a wife was a very pleasant acquisition for a man who lived some several degrees north of 53  so he wrote an appropriate note enclosed a letter of credit generous enough to cover all expenses including trousseau and chaperon and addressed it to one flossie  flossie  one could imagine the rest  however after that he built a comfortable cabin on his claim bought another in dawson and broke the news to his friends  and just here is where the lack of coordination came into play  the waiting was tedious and having been long denied the amative element could not brook further delay  flossie was coming but loraine lisznayi was here  and not only was loraine lisznayi here but her cosmopolitan reputation was somewhat the worse for wear and she was not exactly so young as when she posed in the studios of artist queens and received at her door the cards of cardinals and princes  also her finances were unhealthy  having run the gamut in her time she was now not averse to trying conclusions with a bonanza king whose wealth was such that he could not guess it within six figures  like a wise soldier casting about after years of service for a comfortable billet she had come into the northland to be married  so one day her eyes flashed up into floyd vanderlips as he was buying table linen for flossie in the p c companys store and the thing was settled out of hand  when a man is free much may go unquestioned which should he be rash enough to cumber himself with domestic ties society will instantly challenge  thus it was with floyd vanderlip  flossie was coming and a low buzz went up when loraine lisznayi rode down the main street behind his wolfdogs  she accompanied the lady reporter of the kansas city star when photographs were taken of his bonanza properties and watched the genesis of a sixcolumn article  at that time they were dined royally in flossies cabin on flossies table linen  likewise there were comings and goings and junketings all perfectly proper by the way which caused the men to say sharp things and the women to be spiteful  only mrs eppingwell did not hear  the distant hum of wagging tongues rose faintly but she was prone to believe good of people and to close her ears to evil so she paid no heed  not so with freda  she had no cause to love men but by some strange alchemy of her nature her heart went out to womento women whom she had less cause to love  and her heart went out to flossie even then travelling the long trail and facing into the bitter north to meet a man who might not wait for her  a shrinking clinging sort of a girl freda pictured her with weak mouth and pretty pouting lips blowaway sunkissed hair and eyes full of the merry shallows and the lesser joys of life  but she also pictured flossie face nosestrapped and frost rimed stumbling wearily behind the dogs  wherefore she smiled dancing one night upon floyd vanderlip  few men are so constituted that they may receive the smile of freda unmoved nor among them can floyd vanderlip be accounted  the grace he had found with the modelwoman had caused him to remeasure himself and by the favor in which he now stood with the greek dancer he felt himself doubly a man  there were unknown qualities and depths in him evidently which they perceived  he did not know exactly what those qualities and depths were but he had a hazy idea that they were there somewhere and of them was bred a great pride in himself  a man who could force two women such as these to look upon him a second time was certainly a most remarkable man  some day when he had the time he would sit down and analyze his strength but now just now he would take what the gods had given him  and a thin little thought began to lift itself and he fell to wondering whatever under the sun he had seen in flossie and to regret exceedingly that he had sent for her  of course freda was out of the running  his dumps were the richest on bonanza creek and they were many while he was a man of responsibility and position  but loraine lisznayishe was just the woman  her life had been large she could do the honors of his establishment and give tone to his dollars  but freda smiled and continued to smile till he came to spend much time with her  when she too rode down the street behind his wolfdogs the modelwoman found food for thought and the next time they were together dazzled him with her princes and cardinals and personal little anecdotes of courts and kings  she also showed him dainty missives superscribed my dear loraine and ended most affectionately yours and signed by the given name of a real live queen on a throne  and he marvelled in his heart that the great woman should deign to waste so much as a moment upon him  but she played him cleverly making flattering contrasts and comparisons between him and the noble phantoms she drew mainly from her fancy till he went away dizzy with selfdelight and sorrowing for the world which had been denied him so long  freda was a more masterful woman  if she flattered no one knew it  should she stoop the stoop were unobserved  if a man felt she thought well of him so subtly was the feeling conveyed that he could not for the life of him say why or how  so she tightened her grip upon floyd vanderlip and rode daily behind his dogs  and just here is where the mistake occurred  the buzz rose loudly and more definitely coupled now with the name of the dancer and mrs eppingwell heard  she too thought of flossie lifting her moccasined feet through the endless hours and floyd vanderlip was invited up the hillside to tea and invited often  this quite took his breath away and he became drunken with appreciation of himself  never was man so maltreated  his soul had become a thing for which three women struggled while a fourth was on the way to claim it  and three such women  but mrs eppingwell and the mistake she made  she spoke of the affair tentatively to sitka charley who had sold dogs to the greek girl  but no names were mentioned  the nearest approach to it was when mrs eppingwell said thiserhorrid woman and sitka charley with the modelwoman strong in his thoughts had echoed erhorrid woman  and he agreed with her that it was a wicked thing for a woman to come between a man and the girl he was to marry  a mere girl charley she said i am sure she is  and she is coming into a strange country without a friend when she gets here  we must do something  sitka charley promised his help and went away thinking what a wicked woman this loraine lisznayi must be also what noble women mrs eppingwell and freda were to interest themselves in the welfare of the unknown flossie  now mrs eppingwell was open as the day  to sitka charley who took her once past the hills of silence belongs the glory of having memorialized her clearsearching eyes her clearringing voice and her utter downright frankness  her lips had a way of stiffening to command and she was used to coming straight to the point  having taken floyd vanderlips measurement she did not dare this with him but she was not afraid to go down into the town to freda  and down she went in the bright light of day to the house of the dancer  she was above silly tongues as was her husband the captain  she wished to see this woman and to speak with her nor was she aware of any reason why she should not  so she stood in the snow at the greek girls door with the frost at sixty below and parleyed with the waitingmaid for a full five minutes  she had also the pleasure of being turned away from that door and of going back up the hill wroth at heart for the indignity which had been put upon her  who was this woman that she should refuse to see her she asked herself  one would think it the other way around and she herself but a dancing girl denied at the door of the wife of a captain  as it was she knew had freda come up the hill to herno matter what the errandshe would have made her welcome at her fire and they would have sat there as two women and talked merely as two women she had overstepped convention and lowered herself but she had thought it different with the women down in the town  and she was ashamed that she had laid herself open to such dishonor and her thoughts of freda were unkind  not that freda deserved this  mrs eppingwell had descended to meet her who was without caste while she strong in the traditions of her own earlier status had not permitted it  she could worship such a woman and she would have asked no greater joy than to have had her into the cabin and sat with her just sat with her for an hour  but her respect for mrs eppingwell and her respect for herself who was beyond respect had prevented her doing that which she most desired  though not quite recovered from the recent visit of mrs mcfee the wife of the minister who had descended upon her in a whirlwind of exhortation and brimstone she could not imagine what had prompted the present visit  she was not aware of any particular wrong she had done and surely this woman who waited at the door was not concerned with the welfare of her soul  why had she come  for all the curiosity she could not help but feel she steeled herself in the pride of those who are without pride and trembled in the inner room like a maid on the first caress of a lover  if mrs eppingwell suffered going up the hill she too suffered lying face downward on the bed dryeyed drymouthed dumb  mrs eppingwells knowledge of human nature was great  she aimed at universality  she had found it easy to step from the civilized and contemplate things from the barbaric aspect  she could comprehend certain primal and analogous characteristics in a hungry wolfdog or a starving man and predicate lines of action to be pursued by either under like conditions  to her a woman was a woman whether garbed in purple or the rags of the gutter freda was a woman  she would not have been surprised had she been taken into the dancers cabin and encountered on common ground nor surprised had she been taken in and flaunted in prideless arrogance  but to be treated as she had been treated was unexpected and disappointing  ergo she had not caught fredas point of view  and this was good  there are some points of view which cannot be gained save through much travail and personal crucifixion and it were well for the world that its mrs eppingwells should in certain ways fall short of universality  one cannot understand defilement without laying hands to pitch which is very sticky while there be plenty willing to undertake the experiment  all of which is of small concern beyond the fact that it gave mrs eppingwell ground for grievance and bred for her a greater love in the greek girls heart    iii   and in this way things went along for a monthmrs eppingwell striving to withhold the man from the greek dancers blandishments against the time of flossies coming flossie lessening the miles each day on the dreary trail freda pitting her strength against the modelwoman the modelwoman straining every nerve to land the prize and the man moving through it all like a flying shuttle very proud of himself whom he believed to be a second don juan  it was nobodys fault except the mans that loraine lisznayi at last landed him  the way of a man with a maid may be too wonderful to know but the way of a woman with a man passeth all conception whence the prophet were indeed unwise who would dare forecast floyd vanderlips course twentyfour hours in advance  perhaps the modelwomans attraction lay in that to the eye she was a handsome animal perhaps she fascinated him with her oldworld talk of palaces and princes leastwise she dazzled him whose life had been worked out in uncultured roughness and he at last agreed to her suggestion of a run down the river and a marriage at forty mile  in token of his intention he bought dogs from sitka charleymore than one sled is necessary when a woman like loraine lisznayi takes to the trail and then went up the creek to give orders for the superintendence of his bonanza mines during his absence  he had given it out rather vaguely that he needed the animals for sledding lumber from the mill to his sluices and right here is where sitka charley demonstrated his fitness  he agreed to furnish dogs on a given date but no sooner had floyd vanderlip turned his toes upcreek than charley hied himself away in perturbation to loraine lisznayi  did she know where mr vanderlip had gone  he had agreed to supply that gentleman with a big string of dogs by a certain time but that shameless one the german trader meyers had been buying up the brutes and skimped the market  it was very necessary he should see mr vanderlip because of the shameless one he would be all of a week behindhand in filling the contract  she did know where he had gone  upcreek  good  he would strike out after him at once and inform him of the unhappy delay  did he understand her to say that mr vanderlip needed the dogs on friday night that he must have them by that time  it was too bad but it was the fault of the shameless one who had bid up the prices  they had jumped fifty dollars per head and should he buy on the rising market he would lose by the contract  he wondered if mr vanderlip would be willing to meet the advance  she knew he would  being mr vanderlips friend she would even meet the difference herself  and he was to say nothing about it  she was kind to so look to his interests  friday night did she say  good  the dogs would be on hand  an hour later freda knew the elopement was to be pulled off on friday night also that floyd vanderlip had gone upcreek and her hands were tied  on friday morning devereaux the official courier bearing despatches from the governor arrived over the ice  besides the despatches he brought news of flossie  he had passed her camp at sixty mile humans and dogs were in good condition and she would doubtless be in on the morrow  mrs eppingwell experienced a great relief on hearing this floyd vanderlip was safe upcreek and ere the greek girl could again lay hands upon him his bride would be on the ground  but that afternoon her big st bernard valiantly defending her front stoop was downed by a foraging party of trailstarved malemutes  he was buried beneath the hirsute mass for about thirty seconds when rescued by a couple of axes and as many stout men  had he remained down two minutes the chances were large that he would have been roughly apportioned and carried away in the respective bellies of the attacking party but as it was it was a mere case of neat and expeditious mangling  sitka charley came to repair the damages especially a right forepaw which had inadvertently been left a fraction of a second too long in some other dogs mouth  as he put on his mittens to go the talk turned upon flossie and in natural sequence passed on to theer horrid woman sitka charley remarked incidentally that she intended jumping out down river that night with floyd vanderlip and further ventured the information that accidents were very likely at that time of year  so mrs eppingwells thoughts of freda were unkinder than ever  she wrote a note addressed it to the man in question and intrusted it to a messenger who lay in wait at the mouth of bonanza creek  another man bearing a note from freda also waited at that strategic point  so it happened that floyd vanderlip riding his sled merrily down with the last daylight received the notes together  he tore fredas across  no he would not go to see her  there were greater things afoot that night besides she was out of the running  but mrs eppingwell  he would observe her last wishor rather the last wish it would be possible for him to observeand meet her at the governors ball to hear what she had to say  from the tone of the writing it was evidently important perhaps he smiled fondly but failed to shape the thought  confound it all what a lucky fellow he was with the women any way  scattering her letter to the frost he mushed the dogs into a swinging lope and headed for his cabin  it was to be a masquerade and he had to dig up the costume used at the opera house a couple of months before  also he had to shave and to eat  thus it was that he alone of all interested was unaware of flossies proximity  have them down to the waterhole off the hospital at midnight sharp dont fail me he said to sitka charley who dropped in with the advice that only one dog was lacking to fill the bill and that that one would be forthcoming in an hour or so  heres the sack  theres the scales weigh out your own dust and dont bother me  ive got to get ready for the ball  sitka charley weighed out his pay and departed carrying with him a letter to loraine lisznayi the contents of which he correctly imagined to refer to a meeting at the waterhole of the hospital at midnight sharp    iv   twice freda sent messengers up to the barracks where the dance was in full swing and as often they came back without answers  then she did what only freda could doput on her furs masked her face and went up herself to the governors ball  now there happened to be a customnot an original one by any meansto which the official clique had long since become addicted  it was a very wise custom for it furnished protection to the womankind of the officials and gave greater selectness to their revels  whenever a masquerade was given a committee was chosen the sole function of which was to stand by the door and peep beneath each and every mask  most men did not clamor to be placed upon this committee while the very ones who least desired the honor were the ones whose services were most required  the chaplain was not well enough acquainted with the faces and places of the townspeople to know whom to admit and whom to turn away  in like condition were the several other worthy gentlemen who would have asked nothing better than to so serve  to fill the coveted place mrs mcfee would have risked her chance of salvation and did one night when a certain trio passed in under her guns and muddled things considerably before their identity was discovered thereafter only the fit were chosen and very ungracefully did they respond  on this particular night prince was at the door  pressure had been brought to bear and he had not yet recovered from amaze at his having consented to undertake a task which bid fair to lose him half his friends merely for the sake of pleasing the other half  three or four of the men he had refused were men whom he had known on creek and trailgood comrades but not exactly eligible for so select an affair he was canvassing the expediency of resigning the post there and then when a woman tripped in under the light  freda  he could swear it by the furs did he not know that poise of head so well  the last one to expect in all the world  he had given her better judgment than to thus venture the ignominy of refusal or if she passed the scorn of women he shook his head without scrutiny he knew her too well to be mistaken but she pressed closer  she lifted the black silk ribbon and as quickly lowered it again  for one flashing eternal second he looked upon her face  it was not for nothing the saying which had arisen in the country that freda played with men as a child with bubbles  not a word was spoken  prince stepped aside and a few moments later might have been seen resigning with warm incoherence the post to which he had been unfaithful        a woman flexible of form slender yet rhythmic of strength in every movement now pausing with this group now scanning that urged a restless and devious course among the revellers  men recognized the furs and marvelledmen who should have served upon the door committee but they were not prone to speech  not so with the women  they had better eyes for the lines of figure and tricks of carriage and they knew this form to be one with which they were unfamiliar likewise the furs mrs mcfee emerging from the supperroom where all was in readiness caught one flash of the blazing questing eyes through the silken mask slits and received a start  she tried to recollect where she had seen the like and a vivid picture was recalled of a certain proud and rebellious sinner whom she had once encountered on a fruitless errand for the lord  so it was that the good woman took the trail in hot and righteous wrath a trail which brought her ultimately into the company of mrs eppingwell and floyd vanderlip  mrs eppingwell had just found the opportunity to talk with the man  she had determined now that flossie was so near at hand to proceed directly to the point and an incisive little ethical discourse was titillating on the end of her tongue when the couple became three  she noted and pleasurably the faintly foreign accent of the beg pardon with which the furred woman prefaced her immediate appropriation of floyd vanderlip and she courteously bowed her permission for them to draw a little apart  then it was that mrs mcfees righteous hand descended and accompanying it in its descent was a black mask torn from a startled woman  a wonderful face and brilliant eyes were exposed to the quiet curiosity of those who looked that way and they were everybody  floyd vanderlip was rather confused  the situation demanded instant action on the part of a man who was not beyond his depth while he hardly knew where he was  he stared helplessly about him  mrs eppingwell was perplexed  she could not comprehend  an explanation was forthcoming somewhere and mrs mcfee was equal to it  mrs eppingwell and her celtic voice rose shrilly it is with great pleasure i make you acquainted with freda moloof miss freda moloof as i understand  freda involuntarily turned  with her own face bared she felt as in a dream naked upon her turned the clothed features and gleaming eyes of the masked circle  it seemed almost as though a hungry wolfpack girdled her ready to drag her down  it might chance that some felt pity for her she thought and at the thought hardened  she would by far prefer their scorn  strong of heart was she this woman and though she had hunted the prey into the midst of the pack mrs eppingwell or no mrs eppingwell she could not forego the kill  but here mrs eppingwell did a strange thing  so this at last was freda she mused the dancer and the destroyer of men the woman from whose door she had been turned  and she too felt the imperious creatures nakedness as though it were her own  perhaps it was this her saxon disinclination to meet a disadvantaged foe perhaps forsooth that it might give her greater strength in the struggle for the man and it might have been a little of both but be that as it may she did do this strange thing  when mrs mcfees thin voice vibrant with malice had raised and freda turned involuntarily mrs eppingwell also turned removed her mask and inclined her head in acknowledgment  it was another flashing eternal second during which these two women regarded each other  the one eyes blazing meteoric at bay aggressive suffering in advance and resenting in advance the scorn and ridicule and insult she had thrown herself open to a beautiful burning bubbling lava cone of flesh and spirit  and the other calmeyed cool browed serene strong in her own integrity with faith in herself thoroughly at ease dispassionate imperturbable a figure chiselled from some cold marble quarry  whatever gulf there might exist she recognized it not  no bridging no descending her attitude was that of perfect equality  she stood tranquilly on the ground of their common womanhood and this maddened freda  not so had she been of lesser breed but her souls plummet knew not the bottomless and she could follow the other into the deeps of her deepest depths and read her aright  why do you not draw back your garments hem she was fain to cry out all in that flashing dazzling second  spit upon me revile me and it were greater mercy than this  she trembled  her nostrils distended and quivered but she drew herself in check returned the inclination of head and turned to the man  come with me floyd she said simply  i want you now  what the he began explosively and quit as suddenly discreet enough to not round it off  where the deuce had his wits gone anyway  was ever a man more foolishly placed  he gurgled deep down in his throat and high up in the roof of his mouth heaved as one his big shoulders and his indecision and glared appealingly at the two women  i beg pardon just a moment but may i speak first with mr vanderlip mrs eppingwells voice though flutelike and low predicated will in its every cadence  the man looked his gratitude  he at least was willing enough  im very sorry from freda  there isnt time  he must come at once the conventional phrases dropped easily from her lips but she could not forbear to smile inwardly at their inadequacy and weakness  she would much rather have shrieked  but miss moloof who are you that you may possess yourself of mr vanderlip and command his actions  whereupon relief brightened his face and the man beamed his approval trust mrs eppingwell to drag him clear  freda had met her match this time  ii freda hesitated and then her feminine mind putting on its harnessand who are you to ask this question  i  i am mrs eppingwell and  there the other broke in sharply  you are the wife of a captain who is therefore your husband  i am only a dancing girl  what do you with this man  such unprecedented behavior mrs mcfee ruffled herself and cleared for action but mrs eppingwell shut her mouth with a look and developed a new attack  since miss moloof appears to hold claims upon you mr vanderlip and is in too great haste to grant me a few seconds of your time i am forced to appeal directly to you  may i speak with you alone and now  mrs mcfees jaws brought together with a snap  that settled the disgraceful situation  why erthat is certainly the man stammered  of course of course growing more effusive at the prospect of deliverance  men are only gregarious vertebrates domesticated and evolved and the chances are large that it was because the greek girl had in her time dealt with wilder masculine beasts of the human sort for she turned upon the man with hells tides aflood in her blazing eyes much as a bespangled lady upon a lion which has suddenly imbibed the pernicious theory that he is a free agent  the beast in him fawned to the lash  that is to say ah afterward  tomorrow mrs eppingwell yes tomorrow  that is what i meant  he solaced himself with the fact should he remain that more embarrassment awaited  also he had an engagement which he must keep shortly down by the waterhole off the hospital  ye gods he had never given freda credit  wasnt she magnificent  ill thank you for my mask mrs mcfee  that lady for the nonce speechless turned over the article in question  goodnight miss moloof  mrs eppingwell was royal even in defeat  freda reciprocated though barely downing the impulse to clasp the others knees and beg forgivenessno not forgiveness but something she knew not what but which she none the less greatly desired  the man was for her taking his arm but she had made her kill in the midst of the pack and that which led kings to drag their vanquished at the chariottail led her toward the door alone floyd vanderlip close at heel and striving to reestablish his mental equilibrium    v   it was bitter cold  as the trail wound a quarter of a mile brought them to the dancers cabin by which time her moist breath had coated her face frostily while his had massed his heavy mustache till conversation was painful  by the greenish light of the aurora borealis the quicksilver showed itself frozen hard in the bulb of the thermometer which hung outside the door  a thousand dogs in pitiful chorus wailed their ancient wrongs and claimed mercy from the unheeding stars  not a breath of air was moving  for them there was no shelter from the cold no shrewd crawling to leeward in snug nooks  the frost was everywhere and they lay in the open ever and anon stretching their trailstiffened muscles and lifting the long wolfhowl  they did not talk at first the man and the woman  while the maid helped freda off with her wraps floyd vanderlip replenished the fire and by the time the maid had withdrawn to an inner room his head over the stove he was busily thawing out his burdened upper lip  after that he rolled a cigarette and watched her lazily through the fragrant eddies she stole a glance at the clock  it lacked half an hour of midnight  how was she to hold him  was he angry for that which she had done  what was his mood  what mood of hers could meet his best  not that she doubted herself  no no  hold him she could if need be at pistol point till sitka charleys work was done and devereauxs too  there were many ways and with her knowledge of this her contempt for the man increased  as she leaned her head on her hand a fleeting vision of her own girlhood with its mournful climacteric and tragic ebb was vouchsafed her and for the moment she was minded to read him a lesson from it  god it must be less than human brute who could not be held by such a tale told as she could tell it butbah  he was not worth it nor worth the pain to her  the candle was positioned just right and even as she thought of these things sacredly shameful to her he was pleasuring in the transparent pinkiness of her ear  she noted his eye took the cue and turned her head till the clean profile of the face was presented  not the least was that profile among her virtues  she could not help the lines upon which she had been builded and they were very good but she had long since learned those lines and though little they needed was not above advantaging them to the best of her ability  the candle began to flicker  she could not do anything ungracefully but that did not prevent her improving upon nature a bit when she reached forth and deftly snuffed the red wick from the midst of the yellow flame again she rested head on hand this time regarding the man thoughtfully and any man is pleased when thus regarded by a pretty woman  she was in little haste to begin  if dalliance were to his liking it was to hers  to him it was very comfortable soothing his lungs with nicotine and gazing upon her  it was snug and warm here while down by the waterhole began a trail which he would soon be hitting through the chilly hours  he felt he ought to be angry with freda for the scene she had created but somehow he didnt feel a bit wrathful  like as not there wouldnt have been any scene if it hadnt been for that mcfee woman  if he were the governor he would put a poll tax of a hundred ounces a quarter upon her and her kind and all gospel sharks and sky pilots  and certainly freda had behaved very ladylike held her own with mrs eppingwell besides  never gave the girl credit for the grit  he looked lingeringly over her coming back now and again to the eyes behind the deep earnestness of which he could not guess lay concealed a deeper sneer  and jove wasnt she well put up  wonder why she looked at him so  did she want to marry him too  like as not but she wasnt the only one  her looks were in her favor werent they  and youngyounger than loraine lisznayi  she couldnt be more than twenty three or four twentyfive at most  and shed never get stout  anybody could guess that the first time  he couldnt say it of loraine though she certainly had put on flesh since the day she served as model  huh once he got her on trail hed take it off  put her on the snowshoes to break ahead of the dogs  never knew it to fail yet  but his thought leaped ahead to the palace under the lazy mediterranean skyand how would it be with loraine then  no frost no trail no famine now and again to cheer the monotony and she getting older and piling it on with every sunrise  while this girl fredahe sighed his unconscious regret that he had missed being born under the flag of the turk and came back to alaska  well  both hands of the clock pointed perpendicularly to midnight and it was high time he was getting down to the waterhole  oh freda started and she did it prettily delighting him as his fellows have ever been delighted by their womankind  when a man is made to believe that a woman looking upon him thoughtfully has lost herself in meditation over him that man needs be an extremely coldblooded individual in order to trim his sheets set a lookout and steer clear  i was just wondering what you wanted to see me about he explained drawing his chair up to hers by the table  floyd she looked him steadily in the eyes i am tired of the whole business  i want to go away  i cant live it out here till the river breaks  if i try ill die  i am sure of it  i want to quit it all and go away and i want to do it at once  she laid her hand in mute appeal upon the back of his which turned over and became a prison  another one he thought just throwing herself at him  guess it wouldnt hurt loraine to cool her feet by the waterhole a little longer  well  this time from freda but softly and anxiously  i dont know what to say he hastened to answer adding to himself that it was coming along quicker than he had expected  nothing id like better freda  you know that well enough  he pressed her hand palm to palm  she nodded  could she wonder that she despised the breed  but you see iim engaged  of course you know that  and the girls coming into the country to marry me  dont know what was up with me when i asked her but it was a long while back and i was allfired young  i want to go away out of the land anywhere she went on disregarding the obstacle he had reared up and apologized for  i have been running over the men i know and reached the conclusion thatthat  i was the likeliest of the lot  she smiled her gratitude for his having saved her the embarrassment of confession  he drew her head against his shoulder with the free hand and somehow the scent of her hair got into his nostrils  then he discovered that a common pulse throbbed throbbed throbbed where their palms were in contact  this phenomenon is easily comprehensible from a physiological standpoint but to the man who makes the discovery for the first time it is a most wonderful thing  floyd vanderlip had caressed more shovelhandles than womens hands in his time so this was an experience quite new and delightfully strange  and when freda turned her head against his shoulder her hair brushing his cheek till his eyes met hers full and at close range luminously soft ay and tenderwhy whose fault was it that he lost his grip utterly  false to flossie why not to loraine  even if the women did keep bothering him that was no reason he should make up his mind in a hurry  why he had slathers of money and freda was just the girl to grace it  a wife shed make him for other men to envy  but go slow  he must be cautious  you dont happen to care for palaces do you he asked  she shook her head  well i had a hankering after them myself till i got to thinking a while back and ive about sized it up that oned get fat living in palaces and soft and lazy  yes its nice for a time but you soon grow tired of it i imagine she hastened to reassure him  the world is good but life should be manysided  rough and knock about for a while and then rest up somewhere  off to the south seas on a yacht then a nibble of paris a winter in south america and a summer in norway a few months in england  good society  most certainlythe best and then heigho for the dogs and sleds and the hudson bay country  change you know  a strong man like you full of vitality and go could not possibly stand a palace for a year  it is all very well for effeminate men but you werent made for such a life you are masculine intensely masculine  think so  it does not require thinking  i know  have you ever noticed that it was easy to make women care for you  his dubious innocence was superb  it is very easy  and why  because you are masculine  you strike the deepest chords of a womans heart  you are something to cling tobig muscled strong and brave  in short because you are a man  she shot a glance at the clock  it was half after the hour  she had given a margin of thirty minutes to sitka charley and it did not matter now when devereaux arrived  her work was done  she lifted her head laughed her genuine mirth slipped her hand clear and rising to her feet called the maid  alice help mr vanderlip on with his parka  his mittens are on the sill by the stove  the man could not understand  let me thank you for your kindness floyd  your time was invaluable to me and it was indeed good of you  the turning to the left as you leave the cabin leads the quickest to the waterhole  goodnight  i am going to bed  floyd vanderlip employed strong words to express his perplexity and disappointment  alice did not like to hear men swear so dropped his parka on the floor and tossed his mittens on top of it  then he made a break for freda and she ruined her retreat to the inner room by tripping over the parka  he brought her up standing with a rude grip on the wrist  but she only laughed  she was not afraid of men  had they not wrought their worst with her and did she not still endure  dont be rough she said finally  on second thought here she looked at his detaining hand ive decided not to go to bed yet a while  do sit down and be comfortable instead of ridiculous  any questions  yes my lady and reckoning too  he still kept his hold  what do you know about the waterhole  what did you mean byno never mind  one question at a time  oh nothing much  sitka charley had an appointment there with somebody you may know and not being anxious for a man of your known charm to be present fell back upon me to kindly help him  thats all  theyre off now and a good half hour ago  where  down river and without me  and he an indian  theres no accounting for taste you know especially in a woman  but how do i stand in this deal  ive lost four thousand dollars worth of dogs and a tidy bit of a woman and nothing to show for it  except you he added as an afterthought and cheap you are at the price  freda shrugged her shoulders  you might as well get ready  im going out to borrow a couple of teams of dogs and well start in as many hours  i am very sorry but im going to bed  youll pack if you know whats good for you  go to bed or not when i get my dogs outside so help me onto the sled you go  mebbe you fooled with me but ill just see your bluff and take you in earnest  hear me  he closed on her wrist till it hurt but on her lips a smile was growing and she seemed to listen intently to some outside sound  there was a jingle of dog bells and a mans voice crying haw as a sled took the turning and drew up at the cabin  now will you let me go to bed  as freda spoke she threw open the door  into the warm room rushed the frost and on the threshold garbed in trailworn furs kneedeep in the swirling vapor against a background of flaming borealis a woman hesitated  she removed her nosetrap and stood blinking blindly in the white candlelight  floyd vanderlip stumbled forward  floyd she cried relieved and glad and met him with a tired bound  what could he but kiss the armful of furs  and a pretty armful it was nestling against him wearily but happy  it was good of you spoke the armful to send mr devereaux with fresh dogs after me else i would not have been in till tomorrow  the man looked blankly across at freda then the light breaking in upon him and wasnt it good of devereaux to go  couldnt wait a bit longer could you dear  flossie snuggled closer  well i was getting sort of impatient he confessed glibly at the same time drawing her up till her feet left the floor and getting outside the door  that same night an inexplicable thing happened to the reverend james brown missionary who lived among the natives several miles down the yukon and saw to it that the trails they trod led to the white mans paradise  he was roused from his sleep by a strange indian who gave into his charge not only the soul but the body of a woman and having done this drove quickly away  this woman was heavy and handsome and angry and in her wrath unclean words fell from her mouth  this shocked the worthy man but he was yet young and her presence would have been pernicious in the simple eyes of his flock had she not struck out on foot for dawson with the first gray of dawn  the shock to dawson came many days later when the summer had come and the population honored a certain royal lady at windsor by lining the yukons bank and watching sitka charley rise up with flashing paddle and drive the first canoe across the line  on this day of the races mrs eppingwell who had learned and unlearned numerous things saw freda for the first time since the night of the ball  publicly mind you as mrs mcfee expressed it without regard or respect for the morals of the community she went up to the dancer and held out her hand  at first it is remembered by those who saw the girl shrank back then words passed between the two and freda great freda broke down and wept on the shoulder of the captains wife  it was not given to dawson to know why mrs eppingwell should crave forgiveness of a greek dancing girl but she did it publicly and it was unseemly  it were well not to forget mrs mcfee  she took a cabin passage on the first steamer going out  she also took with her a theory which she had achieved in the silent watches of the long dark nights and it is her conviction that the northland is unregenerate because it is so cold there  fear of hellfire cannot be bred in an icebox  this may appear dogmatic but it is mrs mcfees theory
