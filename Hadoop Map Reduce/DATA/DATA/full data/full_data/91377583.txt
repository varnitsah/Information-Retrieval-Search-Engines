 preface to the fifth volume  the plays and poems contained in this volume were written within the space of two yearsthe last two years of byrons career as a poet but that was not all cantos vixv of don juan the vision of judgment the blues the irish avatar and other minor poems belong to the same period the end was near and as though he had received a warning he hastened to make the roll complete  proof is impossible but the impression remains that the greater part of this volume has been passed over and left unread by at least two generations of readers old playgoers recall macready as werner and many persons have read cain but apart from students of literature readers of sardanapalus and of the two foscari are rare of the age of bronze and the island rarer still a few of byrons later poems have shared the fate of southeys epics and yet with something of southeys persistence byron believed that posterity would weigh his regular dramas in a fresh balance and that his heedless critics would kick the beam but can these bones live can dramas which excited the wondering admiration of goethe and lamartine and sir walter scott touch or lay hold of the more adventurous reader of the present day it is certain that even the halfforgotten works of a great and still popular poet which have left their mark on the creative imagination of the poets and playwrights of three quarters of a century will always be studied by the few from motives of curiosity or for purposes of reference but it is improbable though not impossible that in the revolution of taste and sentiment moribund or extinct poetry will be born again into the land of the living poetry which has never had its day such as blakes songs of innocence the lyrical ballads or fitzgeralds omar khayyám may come in due time to be recognized at its full worth but it is a harder matter for a poem which has lost its vogue to recapture the interest and enthusiasm of the many  byron is only an instance in point bygone poetry has little or no attraction for modern readers this poem or that drama may be referred to and occasionally examined in the interests of general culture or in support of a particular belief or line of conduct as a classical or quasiscriptural authority but with the rarest exceptions plays and narrative poems are not read spontaneously or with any genuine satisfaction or delight an oldworld poem which will not yield up its secret to the idle reader of an empty day is more or less rudely dismissed without even a show of favour or hospitality  and yet these forgotten works of the imagination are full of hidden treasures there is not one of byrons impressionist studies of striking episodes of history or historical legend flung as it were with a take it or leave it in the face of friend or foe which does not transform names and shadows into persons and substance which does not contain lines and passages of unquestionable beauty and distinction  but some would have it that byrons plays as a whole are dull and uninspiring monotonous harpings on wornout themes which every one has mastered or wishes to forget a close study of the text together with some knowledge of the subject as it presented itself to the author and arrested his attention may compel these impatient critics to a different conclusion byron did not scruple to refer the reader to his sources and was at pains to publish in the notes and appendices to his dramas and poems long extracts from old chronicles from plutarchs lives from french and italian histories which he had read himself and as he fondly believed would be read by others who were willing to submit themselves to his guidance he expected his readers to take some trouble and to display some intelligence  poetry is successful only so far as it is intelligible to a clear cry an answer comes but not to a muffled call the reader who comes within speaking distance of his author can hear him and to bring the living within speaking distance of the dead the living must know the facts and understand the ideas which informed and inspired the dead thought and attention are scarcely to be reckoned among necromantic arts but thought and knowledge can make these bones live and stand upon their feet if they do not leap and sing  i desire to renew my acknowledgments of the generous assistance of the officials of the british museum and

or infatuation for the regular drama lasted a little over a year marino faliero sardanapalus and the two foscari were the fruits of his selfdenying ordinance to dramatize like the greeks  striking passages of history letter to murray july 14 1821 letters 1901 v 323 the mood was destined to pass but for a while the neophyte was spellbound  sardanapalus a tragedy the second and perhaps the most successful of these studies in the poetry of history was begun at ravenna january 13 1821 with all deliberate speed but for a time from laziness or depression of spirits or perhaps from the counterexcitement of the poetry of politics letters 1901 v 205 that is the revolutionary drama which had begun to run its course a month went by before he had finished the first act february 15 three months later may 28 he announces the completion of the drama the last act having been dashed off in two or three days letters 1901 v 300  for the story of sardanapalus which had excited his interest as a schoolboy byron consulted the pages of diodorus siculus bibliothecæ historicæ lib ii pp 78 sq ed 1604 and possibly to ward off and neutralize the distracting influence of shakespeare and other barbarian dramatists he turned over the tragedies of seneca letters 1901 v 173 it is hardly necessary to remind the modern reader that the sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an unverifiable personage diodorus the sicilian who was contemporary with cicero derived his knowledge of assyrian history from the persica of ctesias of cnidos who was private physician at the court of artaxerxes mnemon bc 405359 and is said to have had access to and to have consulted the persian authorities διφθέραι Βασιλικαὶ diphtherai basilikai\  the character which ctesias depicted or invented an effeminate debauchee sunk in luxury and sloth who at the last was driven to take up arms and after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance avoided capture by suicide cannot be identified asurbanipal ašurbāniapli the son of esarhaddon and grandson of sennacherib who ascended the throne bc 668 and reigned for about forty years was as the cuneiform records and the friezes of his palace testify a bold hunter and a mighty warrior he vanquished tarkū tirhakah of ethiopia and his successor urdamanē baal king of tyre yakinlū king of the islandcity of arvad sandăsarmū of cilicia teumman of elam and other potentates suffered defeat at his hands the land of elam writes the king or his historiographer royal through its extent i covered as when a mighty storm approaches i cut off the head of teumman their king beyond number i slew his warriors alive in my hands i took his fighting men with their corpses as with thorns and thistles i filled the vicinity of susa their blood i caused to flow in the eulæus and i stained its waters like wool clearly the sardanapalus who painted his face and carded purple wool in the penetralia of his seraglio does not bear even a traditional resemblance to ašurbāniapli the conqueror  all that can be affirmed with any certainty is that within twenty years of the death of asurbanipal the assyrian empire passed into the hands of the medes1 but there is nothing to show whether the period of decay had already set in before the close of his reign or under which of his two successors Ăsuretililāni or sinšariškun the final catastrophe bc 606 took place

could make him diodorus or rather ctesias who may have drawn upon personal reminiscences of his patron artaxerxes mnemon see plutarchs artaxerxes passim does not enlarge upon his amiability and credits him only with the courage of despair byrons sardanapalus with his sudden transition from voluptuous abandonment to heroic chivalry his remorseful recognition of the sanctities of wedlock his general good nature his sly insinuating sarcasms moores diary september 30 1821 memoirs iii 282 all made out of the carvers brain resembles history as little as history resembles the assyrian record fortunately the genius of the poet escaped from the meshes which he had woven round himself and in spite of himself he was constrained to beat his music out regardless of his authorities  the character of myrrha which bears some resemblance to aspasia a native of phocea in ioniathe favourite mistress of cyrus see plutarchs artaxerxes langhornes translation 1838 p 699 was introduced partly to pacify the countess guiccioli who had quarrelled with him for maintaining that love was not the loftiest theme for true tragedy and in part to prove that he was not a slave to his own ideals and could imagine and delineate a woman who was both passionate and highminded diodorus bibl hist lib iii p 130 records the exploits of myrina queen of the amazons but it is probable that byron named his ionian slave after mirra who gives her name to alfieris tragedy which brought on a convulsive fit of tears and shuddering when he first saw it played at bologna in august 1819 letters 1900 iv 339

most remote view to the stage on the attempt made by the managers in a former instance the public opinion has been already expressed with regard to my own private feelings as it seems that they are to stand for nothing i shall say nothing  for the historical foundation of the following compositions the reader is referred to the notes  the author has in one instance attempted to preserve and in the other to approach the unities conceiving that with any very distant departure from them there may be poetry but can be no drama he is aware of the unpopularity of this notion in present english literature but it is not a system of his own being merely an opinion which not very long ago was the law of literature throughout the world and is still so in the more civilised parts of it but nous avons changé tout cela and are reaping the advantages of the change the writer is far from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or example can at all approach his regular or even irregular predecessors he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation of a structure however feeble to an entire abandonment of all rules whatsoever where he has failed the failure is in the architectand not in the art  in this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of diodorus siculus4 reducing it however to such dramatic regularity as i best could and trying to approach the unities i therefore suppose the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy instead of the long war of the history

was conscious of his own powers and of their effects could only gratefully and modestly consider this dedication as the expression of an inexhaustible intellect deeply feeling and creating its own object he was by no means dissatisfied when after long delay sardanapalus appeared without the dedication and was made happy by the possession of a facsimile of it engraved on stone which he

seen of none out of his family he led a most effeminate life for wallowing in pleasure and wanton dalliances he cloathed himself in womens attire and spun fine wool and purple amongst the throngs of his whores and concubines he painted likewise his face and decked his whole body with other allurements he imitated likewise a womans voice and proceeded to such a degree of voluptuousness that he composed verses for his epitaph  which were thus translated by a grecian out of the barbarian language      Ταῦτ ἔχω ὅσ ἔφαγον καὶ ἐφύβρισα καὶ μετ ἔρωτος     taut echô os ephagon kai\ ephybrisa kai\

with his beard carefully scraped and his face smoothed with pumice stone for he was whiter than milk and pencilled under his eyes and eyebrows and when he saw arbaces he was putting a little more white under his eyes most historians of whom duris is one relate that arbaces being indignant at his countrymen being ruled over by such a monarch as that stabbed him and slew him but ctesias says that he went to war with him and collected a great army and then that sardanapalus being dethroned by arbaces died burning himself alive in his palace having heaped up a funeral pile four plethra in

cowardice he never went out of his palace but spent all his time among a company of women dressed and painted like them and employed like them at the distaff he placed all his happiness and glory in the possession of immense treasures in feasting and rioting and indulging himself in all the most infamous and criminal pleasures he ordered two verses to be put upon his tomb signifying that he

get into the palace and having with his own eyes seen sardanapalus in the midst of his infamous seraglio enraged at such a spectacle and not able to endure that so many brave men should be subjected to a prince more soft and effeminate than the women themselves immediately formed a conspiracy against him beleses governor of babylon and several others entered into it on the first rumour of this revolt the king hid himself in the inmost part of his palace being afterwards obliged to take the field with some forces which he had assembled he at first gained three successive victories over the enemy but was afterwards overcome and pursued to the gates of nineveh wherein he shut himself in hopes the rebels would never be able to take a city so well fortified and stored with provisions for a considerable time the siege proved indeed of very great length it had been declared by an ancient oracle that nineveh could never be taken unless the river became an enemy to the city these words buoyed up sardanapalus because he looked upon the thing as impossible but when he saw that the tigris by a violent inundation had thrown down twenty stadia two miles and a half of the city wall and by that means opened a passage to the enemy he understood the meaning of the oracle and thought himself lost he resolved however to die in such a manner as according to his opinion should cover the infamy of his scandalous and effeminate life he ordered a pile of wood to be made in his palace and setting fire to it burnt himself his eunuchs his women and his treasuresdiod sic bibl hist lib ii

quite so whether the purpose has not been to invite to civil order a people disposed to turbulence rather than to recommend immoderate luxury may perhaps reasonably be questioned what indeed could be the object of a king of assyria in founding such towns in a country so distant from his capital and so divided from it by an immense extent of sandy deserts and lofty mountains and still more how the inhabitants could be at once in circumstances to abandon themselves to the intemperate joys which their prince has been supposed to have recommended is not obvious but it may deserve observation that in that line of coast the southern of lesser asia ruins of cities evidently of an age after alexander yet barely named in history at this day astonish the adventurous traveller by their magnificence and elegance amid the desolation which under a singularly barbarian government has for so many centuries been daily spreading in the finest countries of the globe whether more from soil and climate or from opportunities for commerce extraordinary means must have been found for communities to flourish there whence it may seem that the measures of sardanapalus were directed by juster views than have been commonly ascribed to him but that monarch having been the last of a dynasty ended by a revolution obloquy on his memory would follow of course from the policy of his successors and their

byron was still in the vein of the historic drama though less concerned with ancient chroniclers and original authorities vide ante preface to marino faliero vol iv p 332 than heretofore the venetian play he tells murray july 14 1821 is rigidly historical but he seems to have depended for his facts not on sanudo or navagero but on darus histoire de la république de vénise 1821 ii 520537 and on sismondis histoire des républiques  du moyen age 1815 x 3646 the story of the two doges so far as it concerns the characters and action of byrons play may be briefly retold it will be found to differ in some important particulars from the extracts from daru and sismondi which byron printed in his appendix to the two foscari sardanapalus etc 1821 pp 305324 and no less from a passage in smedleys sketches from venetian history 1832 ii 93105 which was substituted for the french pièces justificatives in the collected edition of 18321835 xiii 198202 and the octavo edition of 1837 etc pp 790 791  francesco son of nicolò foscari was born in 1373 he was nominated a member of the council of ten in 1399 and after holding various offices of state elected doge in 1423 his dukedom the longest on record lasted till 1457 he was married in 1395 to maria daughter of andrea priuli and en secondes noces to maria or marina daughter of bartolommeo nani by his two wives he was the father of ten childrenfive sons and five daughters of the five sons four died of the plague and the fifth jacopo lived to be the cause if not the hero of a tragedy  the younger of the two foscari was a man of some cultivation a collector and student of greek manuscripts wellmannered and of ready wit a child and lover of venice but indifferent to her ideals and regardless of her prejudices and restrictions he seems to have begun life in a blaze of popularity the admired of all admirers his wedding with lucrezia contarini january 1441 was celebrated with a novel and peculiar splendour gorgeous youths companions of the hose della calza in jackets of crimson velvet with slashed sleeves lined with squirrel fur preceded and followed the bridegrooms train a hundred bridesmaids accompanied the bride her dowry exceeded 16000 ducats and her jewels which included a necklace worn by a queen of cyprus were rich and rare and the maiden herself was a pearl of great price she behaved writes her brother and does behave so well beyond what could have been looked for i believe she is inspired by god  jacopo had everything which fortune could bestow but he lacked a capacity for right conduct four years after his marriage february 17 1445 an accusation was laid before the ten romanin storia etc iv 266 that contrary to the law embodied in the ducal promissione he had accepted gifts of jewels and money not only from his fellowcitizens but from his countrys bitterest enemy filippo visconti duke of milan jacopo fled to trieste and in his absence the ten supported by a giunta of ten on their own authority and independently of the doge sentenced him to perpetual banishment at nauplia in roumania one of the three capi di dieci was ermolao or veneticé almoro donato of whom more hereafter it is to be noted that this sentence was never carried into effect at the end of four months thanks to the intervention of five members of the ten he was removed from trieste to treviso and two years later september 13 1447 out of consideration to the doge who pleaded that the exile of his only son prevented him from giving his whole heart and soul to the republic permitted to return to venice so ends the first chapter of jacopos misadventures he stands charged with unlawful if not criminal appropriation of gifts and moneys he had been punished but less than he deserved and for his fathers sake the sentence of exile had been altogether remitted  three years went by and once again january 1451 a charge was preferred against jacopo foscari and on this occasion he was arrested and brought before the ten he was accused of being implicated in the murder of ermolao donato who was assassinated november 5 1450 on leaving the ducal palace where he had been attending the council of the pregadi on the morning after the murder benedetto gritti one of the avvogadori di commun was at mestre some five miles from venice and happening to accost a servant of jacopos who was loading a barge with wood asked for the latest news from venice and got as answer donato has been murdered the possession of the news some hours before it had been made public and the fact that the newsmonger had been haunting the purlieus of the ducal palace on the previous afternoon enabled the ten to convict jacopo they alleged decree of x march 26 1451 that other evidence testificationes et scripturæ was in their possession and they pointed to the prisoners obstinate silence on the racka silence unbroken save by several incantations and magic words which fell from him as a confirmation of his guilt moreover it was for the advantage of the state from many points of view that convicted and condemned he should be the question of his innocence or guilt complicated by the report or tradition that one nicolò erizzo confessed on his deathbed that he had assassinated donato for reasons of his own is still under discussion berlan i due foscari etc 1852 p 36 sums up against him it may however be urged in favour of jacopo that the ten did not produce or quote the scripturæ et testificationes which convinced them of his guilt that they stopped short of the deathpenalty and pronounced a sentence inadequate to the crime and lastly that not many years before they had taken into consideration the possibility and advisability of poisoning filippo visconti an event which would no doubt have been to the advantage of the state from many points of view  innocent or guilty he was sentenced to perpetual banishment to the city of candia on the north coast of the island of crete and guilty or innocent jacopo was not the man to make the best of what remained to him and submit to fate intrigue he must and five years later june 1456 a report reached venice that papers had been found in his possession some relating to the duke of milan calculated to excite nuovi scandali e disordini and others in cypher which the ten could not read over and above these papers there was direct evidence that jacopo had written to the imperatore dei turchi imploring him to send his galley and take him away from candia here was a fresh instance of treachery to the republic and july 21 1456 jacopo returned to venice under the custody of lorenzo loredano  according to romanin storia etc iv 284 he was not put to the torture but confessed his guilt spontaneously pleading by way of excuse that the letter to the duke of milan had been allowed to fall into the hands of spies with a view to his being recalled to venice and obtaining a glimpse of his parents and family even at a risk of a fresh trial on the other hand the dolfin cronaca the work of a kinsman of the foscari which records jacopos fruitless appeal to the sorrowful but inexorable doge and other incidents of a personal nature testifies if not to torture on the rack to mutilation by thirty strokes of the lash be that as it may he was once more condemned to lifelong exile with the additional penalty that he should be imprisoned for a year he sailed for venice july 31 1456 and died at candia january 12 1457 jacopos misconduct and consequent misfortune overshadowed the splendour of his fathers reign and in very truth brought his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave  after his sons death the aged doge now in his eightyfifth year retired to his own apartments and refused to preside at councils of state the ten who in 1446 had yielded to the doges plea that a father fretting for an exiled son could not discharge his public duties were instant that he should abdicate the dukedom on the score of decrepitude accounts differ as to the mode in which he received the sentence of deposition it is certain that he was compelled to abdicate on sunday morning october 23 1457 but was allowed a breathingspace of a few days to make his arrangements for quitting the ducal palace  on monday october 24 the great council met to elect his successor and sat with closed doors till sunday october 30  on thursday october 27 francesco heedless of a suggestion that he should avoid the crowd descended the giants staircase for the last time and says the dolfin cronaca after crossing the courtyard went out by the door leading to the prisons and entered his boat by the ponte di paglia he was dressed says another chronicle august cod i cl vii in a scarlet mantle from which the fur lining had been taken surmounted by a scarlet hood an old friend which he had worn when his ducal honours were new and which he had entrusted to his wifes care to be preserved for red days and festivals of state in his hand he held his staff as he walked very slowly his brother marco was by his side behind him were cousins and grandsons  and in this way he went to his own house  on sunday october 30 pasquale malipiero was declared doge and two days after all saints day at the first hour of the morning francesco foscari died if the interval between ten oclock on sunday night and one oclock on tuesday morning disproves the legend that the discrowned doge ruptured a bloodvessel at the moment when the bell was tolling for the election of his successor the truth remains that old as he was he died of a broken heart  his predecessor tomaso mocenigo had prophesied on his deathbed that if the venetians were to make foscari doge they would forfeit their gold and silver their honour and renown from your position of lords said he you will sink to that of vassals and servants to men of arms the prophecy was fulfilled if we look writes mr h f brown venice etc 1893 p 306 at the sumtotal of foscaris reign  we find that the republic had increased her land territory by the addition of two great provinces bergamo and brescia  but the price had been enormous  her debt rose from 6000000 to 13000000 ducats venetian funds fell to 1812 externally there was much pomp and splendour but underneath this bravery there lurked the official corruption of the nobles the suspicion of the ten the first signs of bank failures the increase in the national debt the fall in the value of the funds land wars and landed possessions drew the venetians from the sea to terra ferma the beginning of the end had arrived see two doges of

reviews etc of the two foscari vide ante introduction to sardanapalus p 5  both jeffrey in the edinburgh and heber in the quarterly review took exception to the character of jacopo foscari in accordance with the horatian maxim incredulus odi if said jeffrey he had been presented to the audience wearing out his heart in exile  we might have caught some glimpse of the nature of his motives as it is in obedience to the unities we first meet with him led from the question and afterwards  clinging to the dungeon walls of his native city and expiring from his dread of leaving them the situation lacks conviction  if argued heber there ever existed in nature a case so extraordinary as that of a man who gravely preferred tortures and a dungeon at home to a temporary residence in a beautiful island and a fine climate it is what few can be made to believe and still fewer to sympathize with  it was no doubt with reference to these criticisms that byron told medwin conversations 1824 p 173 that it was no invention of his that the young foscari should have a sickly affection for his native city i painted the men as i found them as they werenot as the critics would have them but no painting however highly coloured can give an idea of the intensity of a venetians affection for his native city  goethe on the other hand was not careful to note these inconsistencies and perplexities he thought that the dramatic handling of the two foscari was worthy of great praise was admirable conversations with goethe 1874 p 265                                  dramatis personÆ

i became doge or dreamed of such advancement     you need not school me signor i sate in     that council when you were a young patrician      lor true in my fathers time i have heard him and     the admiral his brother say as much     your highness may remember them they both     died suddenly54      doge       and if they did so better                           210     so die than live on

epitaph attributing their deaths     to poison tis perhaps as true as most     inscriptions upon tombs and yet no less     a fable      lor   who dares say so      doge                   itis true     your fathers were mine enemies as bitter     as their son eer can be and i no less     was theirs but i was openly their foe                          230     i never worked by plot in council nor

250     i do not speak of you but as a single     voice of the many somewhat beyond what     i could enforce for my authority     were i disposed to brawl but as i said     i have observed with veneration like     a priests for the high altar even unto     the sacrifice of my own blood and quiet     safety and all save honour the decrees     the health the pride and welfare of the state

such a land      doge that is not a venetian thought my daughter      mar no twas too human may i share his exile      lor of this the ten said nothing      mar                                 so i

under such laws venice                 400     has risen to what she isa state to rival     in deeds and days and sway and let me add     in glory for we have had roman spirits     amongst us all that

name is alike nothing when     the policy irrevocably tending     to one great end must be maintained in vigour      mar this means that you are more a doge than father      doge it means i am more

preceding trials of his son as may be gathered from the parte of the council of ten relating to the first trial there was a law which prescribed the contrary in ipsius domini ducis præsentiâ de rebus ad ipsum vel ad filios suos tangentibus non tractetur loquatur vel consulatur sicut non potest fieri quando tractatur de rebus tangentibus ad attinentes domini ducis the fact that nos franciscus

123pietro loredano admiral of the venetian fleet died november 11 1438 his death was sudden and suspicious for he was taken with violent pains and spasms after presiding at a banquet in honour of his victories over the milanese and when his illness ended fatally it was remembered that the doge had publicly declared that so long as the admiral lived he would never be de facto prince of the republic jacopo loredano chose to put his own interpretation on this outburst of impatience and inscribed on his fathers monument in the church of the monastery of sant elena in the isola della santa lena the words per insidias hostium veneno sublatus see ecclesiæ venetæ by flaminio cornaro 1749 ix 193 194 see too cicognas inscrizioni veneziane 1830 iii 381  not long afterwards marco loredano the admirals brother met with a somewhat similar fate he had been despatched by the x to legnano to investigate the conduct of andrea donate the doges brotherinlaw who was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys his report was unfavourable to donato and shortly after he too fell sick and died it is most improbable that the doge was directly or indirectly responsible for the death of either brother but there was an hereditary feud and the libellous epitaph was a move in the game  40 124daru gives palazzis fasti ducales and lhistoire vénitienne of vianolo as his authorities for this story  au4

letters in cypher found in his possession and that a direct invitation to the sultan to rescue him by force was among the impounded documents quod requirebat dictum teucrum ut mitteret ex galeis suis

when he was at work on the first act of sardanapalus byron had pondered cain but it was not till sardanapalus and a second historical play the two foscari had been written copied out and sent to england that he indulged his genius with a third dramaon a metaphysical subject something in the style of manfred letters 1901 v 189  goethes comment on reading and reviewing cain was that he should be surprised if byron did not pursue the treatment of such biblical subjects as the destruction of sodom and gomorrah conversations etc 1879 p 62 and many years after he told crabb robinson diary 1869 ii 435 that byron should have lived to execute his vocation  to dramatize the old testament he was better equipped for such a task than might have been imagined a scottish schoolboy from a child he had known the scriptures and as his hebrew melodies testify he was not unwilling to turn to the bible as a source of poetic inspiration moreover he was born with the religious temperament questions of providence foreknowledge will and fate exercised his curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit he was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who challenged or rebuked him hodgson for instance or dallas and he responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of such orthodox professors as mr sheppard and dr kennedy he was no doubt from first to last a heretic impatient not to say contemptuous of authority but he was by no means indifferent to religion altogether to argue about it and about was a necessity if not an agreeable relief to his intellectual energies it would appear from the ravenna diary january 28 1821 letters 1901 v 190191 that the conception of lucifer was working in his brain before the tragedy of cain was actually begun he had been recording a thought which had come to him that at the very height of human desire and pleasure a certain sense of doubt and sorrowan amari aliquid which links the future to the past and so blots out the presentmingles with our bliss making it of none effect and by way of moral or corollary to his soliloquy he adds three lines of verse headed thought for a speech of lucifer in the tragedy of cain      were death an evil would i let thee live     fool live as i liveas thy father lives     and thy sons sons shall live for evermore  in these three lines which were not inserted in the play and in the preceding thought we have the keynote to cain man walketh in a vain shadowa shadow which he can never overtake the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition with a being capable of infinite satisfaction he is doomed to realize failure in attainment in all that is best and most enjoyable the rapturous moment and the placid hour there is a foretaste of death the unknown the tragedy of manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past the tragedy of cain in revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present  the investigation of the sources of cain does not lead to any very definite conclusion see lord byrons cain und seine quellen von alfred schaffner 1880 he was pleased to call his play a mystery and in his preface vide post p 207 byron alludes to the old mysteries as those very profane productions whether in english french italian or spanish the first reprint of the chester plays was published by the roxburghe club in 1818 but byrons knowledge of mystery plays was probably derived from dodsleys plays ed 1780 l xxxiiixlii or from john stevenss continuation of dugdales monasticon vide post p 207 or possibly as herr schaffner suggests from wartons history of english poetry ed 1871 ii 222230 he may too have witnessed some belated rappresentazione of the creation and fall at ravenna or in one of the remoter towns or villages of italy there is a superficial resemblance between the treatment of the actual encounter of cain and abel and the conventional rendering of the same incident in the ludus coventriæ and in the mistère du viel testament but it is unlikely that he had closely studied any one mystery play at first hand on the other hand his recollections of gessners death of abel which he had never read since he was eight years old were clearer than he imagined not only in such minor matters as the destruction of cains altar by a whirlwind and the substitution of the angel of the lord for the deus of the mysteries but in the teutonic domesticities of cain and adah and the evangelical piety of adam and abel there is a reflection if not an imitation of the german idyll see gessners death of abel ed 1797 pp 80 102  of his indebtedness to milton he makes no formal acknowledgment but he was not ashamed to shelter himself behind miltons shield when he was attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity if cain be blasphemous paradise lost is blasphemous letter to murray pisa february 8 1822 was he would fain believe a conclusive answer to his accusers but apart from verbal parallels or coincidences there is a genuine affinity between byrons lucifer and miltons satan lucifer like satan is not less than archangel ruined a repulsed but unvanquished titan marred by a demonic sorrow a confessor though a rival of omnipotence he is a majestic and as a rule a serious and solemn spirit who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of the reader there is however another strain in his ghostly attributes which betrays a more recent consanguinity now and again he gives token that he is of the lineage of mephistopheles he is sometimes though rarely a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit and occasionally indulges in a grim persiflage beneath the dignity if not the capacity of satan it is needless to add that lucifer has a most lifelike personality of his own the conception of the spirit of evil justifying an eternal antagonism to the creator from the standpoint of a superior morality may perhaps be traced to a manichean source but it has been touched with a new emotion miltons devil is an abstraction of infernal pride            sole positive of night             antipathist of light     fates only essence primal scorpion rod     the one permitted opposite of god  goethes devil is an abstraction of scorn he maketh a mock alike of good and evil but byrons devil is a spirit yet a mortal toothe traducer because he has suffered for his sins the deceiver because he is selfdeceived the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the soul in perfect selfwill and not in perfect selfsacrifice byron did not uphold lucifer but he had passed that way and could imagine a spiritual warfare not only against the deus of the mysteries or of the book of genesis but against what he believed and acknowledged to be the author and principle of good  autres temps autres mœurs it is all but impossible for the modern reader to appreciate the audacity of cain or to realize the alarm and indignation which it aroused by its appearance byron knew that he was raising a tempest and pleads in his preface that with regard to the language of lucifer it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman and again and again he assures his correspondents eg to murray november 23 1821 cain is nothing more than a drama to moore march 4 1822 with respect to religion can i never convince you that i have no such opinions as the characters in that drama which seems to have frightened everybody letters 1901 v 469 vi 30 that it is lucifer and not byron who puts such awkward questions with regard to the politics of paradise and the origin of evil nobody seems to have believed him it was taken for granted that lucifer was the mouthpiece of byron that the author of don juan was not on the side of the angels  little need be said of the literature the pamphlets and poems which were evoked by the publication of cain a mystery one of the most prominent assailants said to be the rev h j todd 17631845 archdeacon of cleveland 1832 author inter alia of original sin free will etc 1818 issued a remonstrance to mr john murray respecting a recent publication 1822 signed oxoniensis the sting of the remonstrance lay in the exposure of the fact that byron was indebted to bayles dictionary for his rabbinical legends and that he had derived from the same source his manichean doctrines of the two principles etc and other oftenrefuted sophisms with regard to the origin of evil byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material but it cannot be denied that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of bayles most objectionable articles eg adam eve abel manichees paulicians etc the remonstrance was answered in a letter to sir walter scott etc by harroviensis byron welcomed such a defender of the faith and was anxious that murray should print the letter together with the poem but murray belittled the defender and was upbraided in turn for his slowness of heart letter to murray june 6 1822 letters 1901 vi 76  fresh combatants rushed into the fray philomilton with a vindication of the paradise lost from the charge of exculpating cain a mystery london 1822 britannicus with a pamphlet entitled revolutionary causes etc and a postscript containing strictures on cain etc london 1822 etc but their works which hardly deserve to be catalogued have perished with them finally in 1830 a barrister named harding grant author of chancery practice compiled a work lord byrons cain etc with notes of more than four hundred pages in which he treats the proceedings and speeches of lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly personages but it was a week too late the coryphæus of the satanic school had passed away and the tumult had dwindled

mystery by the author of don juan was issued by w benbow at castle street leicester square the notorious byron head which southey described as one of those preparatory schools for the brothel and the gallows where obscenity sedition and blasphemy are retailed in drams for the vulgar  murray had paid byron £2710 for the three tragedies and in order to protect the copyright he applied through counsel lancelot shadwell afterwards vicechancellor for an injunction in chancery to stop the sale of piratical editions of cain in delivering judgment february 12 1822 the chancellor lord eldon see courier wednesday february 13 replying to shadwell drew a comparison between cain and paradise lost which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last long vacationsolicitæ jucunda oblivia vitæ no one he argued could deny that the object and effects of paradise lost were not to bring into disrepute but to promote reverence for our religion and per contra no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to the preface the poem the general tone and manner of cain it was a question for a jury a jury might decide that cain was blasphemous and void of copyright and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive he was compelled to refuse the injunction according to dr smiles memoir of john murray 1891 i 428 the decision of a jury was taken and an injunction eventually granted if so it was ineffectual for benbow issued another edition of

conformity with the ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects which were styled mysteries or moralities87 the author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions whether in english french italian or spanish the author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters and where it is and this is but rarely taken from actual scripture he has made as little alteration even of words as the rhythm would permit the reader will recollect that the book of genesis does not state that eve was tempted by a demon but by the serpent88 and that only because he was the most subtil of all the beasts of the field whatever interpretation the rabbins and the fathers may have put upon this i take the words as i find them and reply with bishop watson89 upon similar occasions when the fathers were quoted to him as moderator in the schools of cambridge behold the bookholding up the scripture it is to be recollected that my present subject has nothing to do with the new testament to which no reference can be here made without anachronism90 with the poems upon similar topics i have not been recently familiar since i was twenty i have never read milton but i had read him so frequently before that this may make little difference gesners death of abel i have never read since i was eight years of age at aberdeen the general impression of my recollection is delight but of the contents i remember only that cains wife was called mahala and abels thirza in the following pages i have called them adah and zillah the earliest female names which occur in genesis they were those of lamechs wives those of cain and abel are not called by their names whether then a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression i know nothing and care as little i91 am prepared to be accused of manicheism92 or some other hard name ending in ism which makes a formidable figure and awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled to explain the terms so bandied about as the liberal and pious indulgers in such epithets against such i can defend myself or if necessary i can attack in turn claw for claw as conan said to satan and the deevil take the shortest nails waverley93  the reader will please to bear in mind what few choose to recollect that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of moses nor indeed in the old testament for a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult warburtons divine legation94 whether satisfactory or not no better has yet been assigned i have therefore supposed it new to cain without i hope any perversion of holy writ  with regard to the language of lucifer it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects but i have done what i could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness if he disclaims having tempted eve in the shape of the serpent it is only because the book of genesis has not the most distant allusion to anything of the kind but merely to the serpent in his serpentine capacity  notethe reader will perceive that the author has partly adopted in this poem the notion of cuvier95 that the world had been destroyed several times before the creation of man this speculation derived from the different strata and the bones of enormous and unknown animals found in them is not contrary to the mosaic account but rather confirms it as no human bones have yet been discovered in those strata although those of many known animals are found near the remains of the unknown the assertion of lucifer that the preadamite world was also peopled by rational beings much more intelligent than man and proportionably powerful to the mammoth etc etc is of course a poetical fiction to help him to make out his case  i ought to add that there is a tramelogedia of alfieri called abele96 i have never read that nor any other of the posthumous works of the writer except his life  ravenna sept 20 1821                              dramatis personÆ

   while that of knowledge by my mothers haste     was plucked too soon and all the fruit is death      lucifer they have deceived thee thou shalt live      cain                                               i live     but live to die and living see no thing                         110     to make death hateful save an innate clinging     a loathsome and yet all invincible     instinct of life

and      lucifer                        i am none     and having failed to be one would be nought     save what i am he conquered let him reign                       130      cain who      lucifer   thy sires makerand the earths      cain                                        and heavens     and all that in them is so i have heard     his seraphs sing and so my father saith      lucifer they saywhat they must sing and say on pain     of being that which i amand thou art     of spirits and of men      cain                and what is that      lucifer souls who dare use their immortality     souls who dare look the omnipotent tyrant in     his everlasting face and tell him that     his evil is not good if he has made                              140     as he saithwhich i know not nor believe     but if he made ushe cannot unmake     we are immortalnay hed have us so     that he may torturelet him he is great     but in his greatness is no happier than     we in our conflict goodness would not make     evil and what else hath he made but let him     sit on his vast and solitary throne     creating worlds to make eternity     less burthensome to his immense existence                          150     and unparticipated solitude99     let him crowd orb on orb he is alone     indefinite indissoluble tyrant     could he but crush himself twere the best boon     he ever granted but let him reign on     and multiply himself in misery     spirits and men at least we sympathise     and suffering in concert make our pangs     innumerable more endurable     by the unbounded sympathy of all                                   160     with all but he so wretched in his height     so restless in his wretchedness must still     create and recreateperhaps hell make100     one day a son unto himselfas he     gave you a fatherand if he so doth     mark me that son will be a sacrifice      cain thou speakst to me of things which long have swum     in visions through my thought i never could     reconcile what i saw with what i heard     my father and my mother talk to me                                 170     of serpents and of fruits and trees i see     the gates of what they call their paradise     guarded by fierysworded cherubim     which shut them outand me i feel the weight     of daily toil and constant thought i look     around a world where i seem nothing with     thoughts which arise within me as if they     could master all thingsbut i thought alone     this misery was mine my father is     tamed down my mother has forgot the mind                          180     which made her thirst for knowledge at the risk     of an eternal curse my brother is     a watching shepherd boy101 who offers up     the firstlings of the flock to him who bids     the earth yield nothing to us without sweatby     my sister zillah sings an earlier hymn     than the birds matins and my adahmy     own and belovédshe too understands not     the mind which overwhelms me never till     now met i aught to sympathise with me                             190     tis welli rather would consort with spirits      lucifer and hadst thou not been fit by thine own soul     for such companionship i would not now     have stood before thee as i am a serpent     had been enough to charm ye as beforebz      cain ah didst thou tempt my mother      lucifer                                i tempt none     save with the truth was not the tree the tree     of knowledge and was not the tree of life     still fruitful did i bid her pluck them not     did i plant things prohibited within                               200     the reach of beings innocent and curious     by their own innocence i would have made ye     gods and even he who thrust ye forth so thrust ye     because ye should not eat the fruits of life     and become gods as we were those his words      cain   they were as i have heard from those who heard them     in thunder      lucifer    then who was the demon he     who would not let ye live or he who would     have made ye live for ever in the joy     and power of knowledge      cain                would they had snatched both                210     the fruits or neither      lucifer              one is yours already     the other may be still      cain                  how so      lucifer                      by being     yourselves in your resistance nothing can     quench the mind if the mind will be itself     and centre of surrounding thingstis made     to sway      cain   but didst thou tempt my parents      lucifer                                  i     poor claywhat should i tempt them for or how      cain they say the serpent was a spirit      lucifer                                   who     saith that it is not written so on high     the proud one will not so far falsify                             220     though mans vast fears and little vanity     would make him cast upon the spiritual nature     his own low failing the snake was the snake     no more102 and yet not less than those he tempted     in nature being earth alsomore in wisdom     since he could overcome them and foreknew     the knowledge fatal to their narrow joys     thinkst thou id take the shape of things that die      cain but the thing had a demon      lucifer                         he but woke one     in those he spake to with his forky tongue                        230     i tell thee that the serpent was no more     than a mere serpent ask the cherubim     who guard the tempting tree when thousand ages     have rolled oer your dead ashes and your seeds     the seed of the then world may thus array     their earliest fault in fable and attribute     to me a shape i scorn as i scorn all     that bows to him who made things but to bend     before his sullen sole eternity     but we who see the truth must speak it thy                      240     fond parents listened to a creeping thing     and fell for what should spirits tempt them what     was there to envy in the narrow bounds     of paradise that spirits who pervade     spacebut i speak to thee of what thou knowst not     with all thy tree of knowledge      cain                         but thou canst not     speak aught of knowledge which i would not know     and do not thirst to know and bear a mind     to know      lucifer   and heart to look on      cain                           be it proved      lucifer darest thou look on death      cain                                he has not yet              250     been seen      lucifer but must be undergone      cain                            my father     says he is something dreadful and my mother     weeps when hes named and abel lifts his eyes     to heaven and zillah casts hers to the earth     and sighs a prayer and adah looks on me     and speaks not      lucifer     and thou      cain                 thoughts unspeakable     crowd in my breast to burning when i hear     of this almighty death who is it seems     inevitable could i wrestle with him     i wrestled with the lion when a boy                              260     in play till he ran roaring from my gripe      lucifer it has no shape but will absorb all things     that bear the form of earthborn being      cain                                 ah     i thought it was a being who could do     such evil things to beings save a being      lucifer ask the destroyer      cain                       who      lucifer                        the makercall him     which name thou wilt he makes but to destroy      cain i knew not that yet thought it since i heard     of death although i know not what it is     yet it seems horrible i have looked out                           270     in the vast desolate night in search of him     and when i saw gigantic shadows in     the umbrage of the walls of eden chequered     by the farflashing of the cherubs swords     i watched for what i thought his coming for     with fear rose longing in my heart to know     what twas which shook us allbut nothing came     and then i turned my weary eyes from off     our native and forbidden paradise     up to the lights above us in the azure                           280     which are so beautiful shall they too die      lucifer perhapsbut long outlive both thine and thee      cain im glad of that i would not have them die     they are so lovely what is death i fear     i feel it is a dreadful thing but what     i cannot compass tis denounced against us     both them who sinned and sinned not as an ill     what ill      lucifer to be resolved into the earth      cain but shall i know it      lucifer                   as i know not death     i cannot answer103      cain              were i quiet earth                           290     that were no evil would i neer had been     aught else but dust      lucifer           that is a grovelling wish     less than thy fathersfor he wished to know      cain but not to liveor wherefore plucked he not     the lifetree      lucifer    he was hindered      cain                       deadly error     not to snatch first that fruitbut ere he plucked     the knowledge he was ignorant of death     alas i scarcely now know what it is     and yet i fear itfear i know not what      lucifer and i who know all things fear nothing see           300     what is true knowledge      cain                 wilt thou teach me all      lucifer aye upon one condition      cain                              name it      lucifer                                    that     thou dost fall down and worship methy lord      cain thou art not the lord my father worships      lucifer                                         no      cain his equal      lucifer        noi

    who shallbe thou amongst the first      cain                              i never                       310     as yet have bowed unto my fathers god     although my brother abel oft implores     that i would join with him in sacrifice     why should i bow to thee      lucifer                 hast thou neer bowed     to him      cain have i not said itneed i say it     could not thy mighty knowledge teach thee that      lucifer he who bows not to him has bowed to me104      cain but i will bend to neither      lucifer                          neer the less     thou art my worshipper not

      let me but     be taught the mystery of my being      lucifer                        follow     where i will lead thee      cain                 but i must retire     to till the earthfor i had promised      lucifer                                what      cain to cull some firstfruits      lucifer                        why      cain                               to offer up     with abel

of      lucifer higher things than ye are slaves and higher     than them or ye would be so did they not     prefer an independency of torture     to the smooth agonies of adulation     in hymns and harpings and selfseeking prayers     to that which is omnipotent because     it is omnipotent and not from love     but terror and selfhope      adah                   omnipotence

the higher knowledge quenches love     what must he be you cannot love when knownca     since the allknowing cherubim love least     the seraphs love can be but ignorance     that they are not compatible the doom     of thy fond parents for their daring proves     choose betwixt love and knowledgesince there is     no other choice your sire hath chosen already                    430     his

children cain      cain my little enoch and his lisping sister     could i but deem them happy i would half     forgetbut it can never be forgotten                            440     through thrice a thousand generations never     shall men love the remembrance of the man     who sowed the seed of evil and mankind     in the same hour they plucked the tree of science     and sinand not content

hath not fulfilled its promiseif they sinned     at least they ought to have known all things that are     of knowledgeand the mystery of deathcb                        460     what do they knowthat they are miserable     what need of snakes and fruits to teach us that      adah i am not wretched cain and if thou     wert happy      cain       be thou happy then alone     i will have nought to do with happiness     which humbles me and mine      adah                    alone i could not     nor would be happy but with those around us     i think i could be so despite of death     which as i know it not i dread not though     it seems an awful shadowif i may                                 470     judge from what i have heard      lucifer                    and thou couldst not     alone thou sayst be happy      adah                         alone oh my god     who could be happy and alone or good     to me my solitude seems sin unless     when i think how soon i shall see my brother     his brother and our children and our parents      lucifer yet thy god is alone and is he happy     lonely and good      adah           he is not so he hath     the angels and the mortals to make happy     and thus becomes so in diffusing joy                              480     what else can joy be but the spreading joycc      lucifer ask of your sire the exile fresh from eden     or of his firstborn son ask your own heart     it is not tranquil      adah            alas no and you     are you of heaven      lucifer         if i am not enquire     the cause of this allspreading happiness     which you proclaim of the allgreat and good     maker of life and living things it is     his secret and he keeps it we must bear     and some of us resistand both in vain                           490     his seraphs say but it is worth the trial     since better may not be without there is     a wisdom in the spirit which directs     to right as in the dim blue air the eye     of you young mortals lights at once upon     the star which watches welcoming the morn      adah it is a beautiful star i love it for     its beauty      lucifer    and why not adore      adah                         our father     adores the invisible only      lucifer                but the symbols     of the invisible are the loveliest                                 500     of what is visible and yon bright star     is leader of the host of heaven      adah                         our father     saith that he has beheld the god himself     who made him and our mother      lucifer                  hast thou seen him      adah yesin his works      lucifer                 but in his being      adah                                     no     save in my father who is gods own image     or in his angels who are like to thee     and brighter yet less beautiful and powerful     in seeming as the silent sunny noon     all light they look upon us but thou seemst                     510     like an ethereal night108 where long white clouds     streak the deep purple and unnumbered stars     spangle the wonderful mysterious vault     with things that look as if they would be suns     so beautiful unnumbered and endearing     not dazzling and yet drawing us to them     they fill my eyes with tears and so dost thou     thou seemst unhappy do not make us so     and i will weep for thee      lucifer                alas those tears     couldst thou but know what oceans will be shed                 520      adah by me      lucifer     by all      adah               what all      lucifer

in an hour     but in that hour see things of many days      adah how can that be      lucifer               did not your maker make     out of old worlds this new one in few days                        530     and cannot i who aided in this work     show in an hour what he hath made in many     or hath destroyed in few      cain                  lead on      adah                          will he     in sooth return within an hour      lucifer                       he shall     with us acts are exempt from time and we     can crowd eternity into an hour     or stretch an hour into eternity     we breathe not by a mortal measurement     but thats a mystery cain come on with me      adah will he return      lucifer              aye woman he alone                       540     of mortals from that place the first and last     who shall return save one shall come back to thee     to make that silent and expectant world     as populous as this at present there     are few inhabitants      adah             where dwellest thou      lucifer throughout all space where should i dwell where are     thy god or godsthere am i all things are     divided with me life and deathand time     eternityand heaven and earthand that     which is not heaven nor earth but peopled with                    550     those who once peopled or shall people both     these are my realms so that i do divide     his and possess a kingdom which is not     his109 if i were not that which i have said     could i stand here his angels are within     your vision      adah      so they were when the fair serpent     spoke with our mother first      lucifer                  cain thou hast heard     if thou dost long for knowledge i can satiate     that thirst nor ask thee to partake of fruits     which shall deprive thee of a single good                          560     the conqueror has left thee follow me      cain spirit i have said it                                              exeunt lucifer

    to sink      lucifer have faith in me and thou shalt be     borne on the air110 of which i am the prince      cain can i do so without impiety      lucifer believeand sink not doubtand perish thus     would run the edict of the other god     who names me demon to his angels they     echo the sound to miserable things     which knowing nought beyond their shallow senses     worship the word which strikes their ear and deem                10     evil or good what is proclaimed to them     in their abasement i will have none such     worship or worship not thou shalt behold     the worlds beyond thy little world nor be     amerced for doubts beyond thy little life     with torture of my dooming there will come     an hour when tossed upon some waterdropscd     a man shall say to a man believe in me     and walk the waters and the man shall walk     the billows and be safe i will not say                          20     believe in me as a conditional creed     to save thee but fly with me oer the gulf     of space an equal flight and i will show     what thou darst not denythe history     of pastand present and of future worlds      cain oh god or demon or whateer thou art     is yon our earth      lucifer        dost thou not recognise     the dust which formed your father      cain                            can it be     yon small blue circle swinging in far etherce     with an inferior circlet purpler it still111                     30     which looks like that which lit our earthly night     is this our paradise where are its walls     and they who guard them      lucifer               point me out the site     of paradise      cain      how should i as we move     like sunbeams onward it grows small and smaller     and as it waxes little and then less     gathers a halo round it like the light     which shone the roundest of the stars when i     beheld them from the skirts of paradise     methinks they both as we recede from them                         40     appear to join the innumerable stars     which are around us and as we move on     increase their myriads      lucifer              and if there should be     worlds greater than thine owninhabited     by greater thingsand they themselves far more     in number than the dust of thy dull earth     though multiplied to animated atoms     all livingand all doomed to deathand wretched     what wouldst thou think      cain                  i should be proud of thought     which knew such things      lucifer              but if that high thought were               50     linked to a servile mass of matterand     knowing such things aspiring to such things     and science still beyond them were chained down     to the most gross and petty paltry wants     all foul and fulsomeand the very best     of thine enjoyments a sweet degradation     a most enervating and filthy cheat     to lure thee on to the renewal of     fresh souls and bodies112 all foredoomed to be     as frail and few so happy      cain                        spirit i                            60     know nought of death save as a dreadful thing     of which i have heard my parents speak as of     a hideous heritage i owe to them     no less than lifea heritage not happy     if i may judge till now but spirit if     it be as thou hast said and i within     feel the prophetic torture of its truth     here let me die for to give birth to those     who can but suffer many years and die     methinks is merely propagating death                               70     and multiplying murder      lucifer              thou canst not     all diethere is what must survive      cain                                the other     spake not of this unto my father when     he shut him forth from paradise with death     written upon his forehead but at least     let what is mortal of me perish that     i may be in the rest as angels are      lucifer i am angelic wouldst thou be as i am      cain i know not what thou art i see thy power     and see thou showst me things beyond my power                   80     beyond all power of my born faculties     although inferior still to my desires     and my conceptions      lucifer          what are they which dwell     so humbly in their pride as to sojourn     with worms in clay      cain            and what art thou who dwellest     so haughtily in spirit and canst range     nature and immortalityand yet     seemst sorrowful      lucifer         i seem that which i am     and therefore do i ask of thee if thou     wouldst be immortal      cain             thou hast said i must be                       90     immortal in despite of me i knew not     this until latelybut since it must be     let me or happy or unhappy learn     to anticipate my immortality      lucifer thou didst before i came upon thee      cain                                        how      lucifer by suffering      cain                  and must torture be immortal      lucifer we and thy sons will try but now behold     is it not glorious      cain             oh thou beautiful     and unimaginable ether and     ye multiplying masses of increased                                 100     and stillincreasing lights what are ye what     is this blue wilderness of interminable     air where ye roll along as i have seen     the leaves along the limpid streams of eden     is your course measured for ye or do ye     sweep on in your unbounded revelry     through an aërial universe of endless     expansionat which my soul aches to think     intoxicated with eternity113     oh god oh gods or whatsoeer ye are                             110     how beautiful ye are how beautiful     your works or accidents or whatsoeer     they may be let me die as atoms die     if that they die or know ye in your might     and knowledge my thoughts are not in this hour     unworthy what i see though my dust is     spirit let me expire or see them nearer      lucifer art thou not nearer look back to thine earth      cain where is it i see nothing save a mass     of most innumerable lights      lucifer                  look there                            120      cain i cannot see it      lucifer               yet it sparkles still      cain thatyonder      lucifer            yea      cain                   and wilt thou tell me so     why i have seen the fireflies and fireworms     sprinkle the dusky groves and the green banks     in the dim twilight brighter than yon world     which bears them      lucifer        thou hast seen both worms and worlds     each bright and sparklingwhat dost think of them      cain that they are beautiful in their own sphere     and that the night which makes both beautiful     the little shining firefly in its flight                         130     and the immortal star in its great course     must both be guided      lucifer           but by whom or what      cain show me      lucifer       darst thou behold      cain                            how know i what     i dare behold as yet thou hast shown nought     i dare not gaze on further      lucifer                  on then with me     wouldst thou behold things mortal or immortal      cain why what are things      lucifer                  both partly but what doth     sit next thy heart      cain            the things i see      lucifer                          but what     sate nearest it      cain           the things i have not seen     nor ever shallthe mysteries of death                            140      lucifer what if i show to thee things which have died     as i have shown thee much which cannot die      cain do so      lucifer     away then on our mighty wings      cain oh how we cleave the blue the stars fade from us     the earth where is my earth let me look on it     for i was made of it      lucifer           tis now beyond thee     less in the universe than thou in it     yet deem not that thou canst escape it thou     shalt soon return to earth and all its dust     tis part of thy eternity and mine                               150      cain where dost thou lead me      lucifer                      to what was before thee     the phantasm of the world of which thy world     is but the wreck      cain           what is it not then new      lucifer no more than life is and that was ere thou     or i were or the things which seem to us     greater than either many things will have     no end and some which would pretend to have     had no beginning have had one as mean     as thou and mightier things have been extinct     to make way for much meaner than we can                            160     surmise for moments only and the space     have been and must be all unchangeable     but changes make not death except to clay     but thou art clayand canst but comprehend     that which was clay and such thou shall behold      cain clayspiritwhat thou wilti can survey      lucifer away then      cain                but the lights fade from me fast     and some till now grew larger as we approached     and wore the look of worlds      lucifer                   and such they are      cain and edens in them      lucifer                 it may be      cain                              and men                      170      lucifer yea or things higher

recede     where fly we      lucifer    to the world of phantoms which     are beings past and shadows still to come      cain but it grows dark and darkthe stars are gone      lucifer and yet thou seest      cain                       tis a fearful light     no sunno moonno lights innumerable     the very blue of the empurpled night     fades to a dreary twilightyet i see                              180     huge dusky masses but unlike the worlds     we were approaching which begirt with light     seemed full of life even when their atmosphere     of light gave way and showed them taking shapes     unequal of deep valleys and vast mountains     and some emitting sparks and some displaying     enormous liquid plains and some begirt     with luminous belts and floating moons which took     like them the features of fair earthinstead     all here seems dark and dreadful      lucifer                         but distinct                   190     thou seekest to behold death and dead things      cain i seek it not but as i know there are     such and that my sires sin makes him and me     and all that we inherit liable     to such i would behold at once what i     must one day see perforce      lucifer                  behold      cain                            tis darkness      lucifer and so it shall be everbut we will     unfold its gates      cain           enormous vapours roll     apartwhats this      lucifer          enter      cain                   can i return      lucifer return be sure how else should death be peopled      200     its present realm is thin to what it will be     through thee and thine      cain                 the clouds still open wide     and wider and make widening circles round us      lucifer advance      cain             and thou      lucifer                   fear notwithout me thou     couldst not have gone beyond thy world on on                                      they disappear through the clouds                              scene iihades                          enter lucifer and cain      cain how silent and how vast are these dim worlds     for they seem more than one and yet more peopled     than the huge brilliant luminous orbs which swung     so thickly in the upper air that i     had deemed them rather the bright populace     of some all unimaginable heaven     than things to be inhabited themselvescg     but that on drawing near them i beheld     their swelling into palpable immensity     of matter which seemed made for life to dwell on                  10     rather than life itself but here all is     so shadowy and so full of twilight that     it speaks of a day past      lucifer              it is the realm     of deathwouldst have it present      cain                             till i know     that which it really is i cannot answer     but if it be as i have heard my father     deal out in his long homilies tis a thing     oh god i dare not think ont curséd be     he who invented life that leads to death     or the dull mass of life that being life                         20     could not retain but needs must forfeit it     even for the innocent      lucifer             dost thou curse thy father      cain cursed he not me in giving me my birth     cursed he not me before my birth in daring     to pluck the fruit forbidden      lucifer                    thou sayst well     the curse is mutual twixt thy sire and thee     but for thy sons and brother      cain                       let them share it     with me their sire and brother what else is     bequeathed to me i leave them my inheritance     oh ye interminable gloomy realms                                   30     of swimming shadows and enormous shapes     some fully shown some indistinct and all     mighty and melancholywhat are ye     live ye or have ye lived      lucifer                 somewhat of both      cain then what is death      lucifer                  what hath not he who made ye     said tis another life      cain                 till now he hath     said nothing save that all shall die      lucifer                             perhaps     he one day will unfold that further secret      cain happy the day      lucifer             yes happy when unfolded     through agonies unspeakable and clogged                            40     with agonies eternal to innumerable     yet unborn myriads of unconscious atoms     all to be animated for this only      cain what are these mighty phantoms which i see     floating around methey wear not the form     of the intelligences i have seen     round our regretted and unentered eden     nor wear the form of man as i have viewed it     in adams and in abels and in mine     nor in my sisterbrides nor in my childrens                     50     and yet they have an aspect which though not     of men nor angels looks like something which     if not the last rose higher than the first     haughty and high and beautiful and full     of seeming strength but of inexplicable     shape for i never saw such they bear not     the wing of seraph nor the face of man     nor form of mightiest brute nor aught that is     now breathing mighty yet and beautiful     as the most beautiful and mighty which                              60     live and yet so unlike them that i scarce     can call them living114      lucifer               yet they lived      cain                                  where      lucifer                                      where     thou livest      cain     when      lucifer       on what thou callest earth     they did inhabit      cain           adam is the first      lucifer of thine i grant theebut too mean to be     the last of these      cain            and what are they      lucifer                           that which     thou shalt be      cain        but what were they      lucifer                          living high     intelligent good great and glorious things     as much superior unto all thy sire     adam could eer have been in eden as                               70     the sixtythousandth generation shall be     in its dull damp degeneracy to     thee and thy sonand how weak they are judge     by thy own flesh      cain           ah me and did they perish      lucifer yes from their earth as thou wilt fade from thine      cain but was mine theirs      lucifer                      it was      cain                                but not as now     it is too little and too lowly to     sustain such creatures      lucifer              true it was more glorious      cain and wherefore did it fall      lucifer                         ask him who fells115      cain but how      lucifer        by a most crushing and inexorable                 80     destruction and disorder of the elements     which struck a world to chaos as a chaos     subsiding has struck out a world such things     though rare in time are frequent in eternity     pass on and gaze upon the past      cain                          tis awful      lucifer and true behold these phantoms they were once     material as thou art      cain               and must i be     like them      lucifer let he116 who made thee answer that     i show thee what thy predecessors are     and what they were thou feelest in degree                        90     inferior as thy petty feelings and     thy pettier portion of the immortal part     of high intelligence and earthly strength     what ye in common have with what they had     is life and what ye shall havedeath the rest     of your poor attributes is such as suits     reptiles engendered out of the subsiding     slime of a mighty universe crushed into     a scarcelyyet shaped planet peopled with     things whose enjoyment was to be in blindness                    100     a paradise of ignorance from which     knowledge was barred as poison but behold     what these superior beings are or were     or if it irk thee turn thee back and till     the earth thy taskill waft thee there in safety      cain no ill stay here      lucifer                   how long      cain                               for ever since     i must one day return here from the earth     i rather would remain i am sick of all     that dust has shown melet me dwell in shadows      lucifer it cannot be thou now beholdest as                     110     a vision that which is reality     to make thyself fit for this dwelling thou     must pass through what the things thou seest have passed     the gates of death      cain             by what gate have we entered     even now      lucifer by mine but plighted to return     my spirit buoys thee up to breathe in regions     where all is breathless save thyself gaze on     but do not think to dwell here till thine hour     is come      cain and these toocan they neer repass     to earth again      lucifer      their earth is gone for ever                   120     so changed by its convulsion they would not     be conscious to a single present spot     of its new scarcely hardened surfacetwas     oh what a beautiful world it was      cain                               and is     it is not with the earth though i must till it     i feel at warbut that i may not profit     by what it bears of beautiful untoiling     nor gratify my thousand swelling thoughts     with knowledge nor allay my thousand fears     of death and life      lucifer       what thy world is thou seest                   130     but canst not comprehend the shadow of     that which it was      cain            and those enormous creatures     phantoms inferior in intelligence     at least so seeming to the things we have passed     resembling somewhat the wild habitants     of the deep woods of earth the hugest which     roar nightly in the forest but tenfold     in magnitude and terror taller than     the cherubguarded walls of edenwith     eyes flashing like the fiery swords which fence them             140     and tusks projecting like the trees stripped of     their bark and brancheswhat were they      lucifer                               that which     the mammoth is in thy worldbut these lie     by myriads underneath its surface      cain                            but     none on it      lucifer   no for thy frail race to war     with them would render the curse on it useless     twould be destroyed so early      cain                        but why war      lucifer you have forgotten the denunciation     which drove your race from edenwar with all things     and death to all things and disease to most things               150     and pangs and bitterness these were the fruits     of the forbidden tree      cain                but animals     did they too eat of it that they must die      lucifer your maker told ye they were made for you     as you for himyou would not have their doom     superior to your own had adam not     fallen all had stood      cain                 alas the hopeless wretches     they too must share my sires fate like his sons     like them too without having shared the apple     like them too without the so dearbought knowledge            160     it was a lying treefor we know nothing     at least it promised knowledge at the price     of deathbut knowledge still but what knows man      lucifer it may be death leads to the highest knowledge     and being of all things the sole thing certainch     at least leads to the surest science therefore     the tree was true though deadly      cain                          these dim realms     i see them but i know them not      lucifer                    because     thy hour is yet afar and matter cannot     comprehend spirit whollybut tis something                       170     to know there are such realms      cain                        we knew already     that there was death      lucifer            but not what was beyond it      cain nor know i now      lucifer             thou knowest that there is     a state and many states beyond thine own     and this thou knewest not this morn      cain                              but all     seems dim and shadowy      lucifer             be content it will     seem clearer to thine immortality      cain and yon immeasurable liquid space     of glorious azure which floats on beyond us     which looks like water and which i should deemci                180     the river which flows out of paradise     past my own dwelling but that it is bankless     and boundless and of an ethereal hue     what is it      lucifer   there is still some such on earth     although inferior and thy children shall     dwell near ittis the phantasm of an ocean      cain tis like another world a liquid sun     and those inordinate creatures sporting oer     its shining surface      lucifer           are its inhabitants     the past leviathans      cain               and yon immense                              190     serpent which rears his dripping mane and vasty     head ten times higher than the haughtiest cedar     forth from the abyss looking as he could coil     himself around the orbs we lately looked on     is he not of the kind which basked beneath     the tree in eden      lucifer         eve thy mother best     can tell what shape of serpent tempted her      cain this seems too terrible no doubt the other     had more of beauty      lucifer           hast thou neer beheld him      cain many of the same kind at least so called                 200     but never that precisely which persuaded     the fatal fruit nor even of the same aspect      lucifer your father saw him not      cain                             no twas my mother     who tempted himshe tempted by the serpent      lucifer good man wheneer thy wife or thy sons wives     tempt thee or them to aught thats new or strange     be sure thou seest first who hath tempted them      cain thy precept comes too late there is no more     for serpents to tempt woman to      lucifer                      but there     are some things still which woman may tempt man to                210     and man tempt womanlet thy sons look to it     my counsel is a kind one for tis even     given chiefly at my own expense tis true     twill not be followed so theres little lost117      cain i understand not this      lucifer                     the happier thou     thy world and thou are still too young thou thinkest     thyself most wicked and unhappyis it     not so      cain for crime i know not but for pain     i have felt much      lucifer        firstborn of the first man     thy present state of sinand thou art evil                       220     of sorrowand thou sufferest are both eden     in all its innocence compared to what     thou shortly mayst be and that state again     in its redoubled wretchedness a paradise     to what thy sons sons sons accumulating     in generations like to dust which they     in fact but add to shall endure and do     now let us back to earth      cain                   and wherefore didst thou     lead me here only to inform me this      lucifer was not thy quest for knowledge      cain                                     yesas being          230     the road to happiness      lucifer             if truth be so     thou hast it      cain       then my fathers god did well     when he prohibited the fatal tree      lucifer but had done better in not planting it     but ignorance of evil doth not save     from evil it must still roll on the same     a part of all things      cain               not of all things no     ill not believe itfor i thirst for good      lucifer and who and what doth not who covets evil     for its own bitter sakenonenothing tis                    240     the leaven of all life and lifelessness      cain within those glorious orbs which we behold     distant and dazzling and innumerable     ere we came down into this phantom realm     ill cannot come they are too beautiful      lucifer thou hast seen them from afar      cain                                   and what of that     distance can but diminish glorythey     when nearer must be more ineffable      lucifer approach the things of earth most beautiful     and judge their beauty near      cain                      i have done this                    250     the loveliest thing i know is loveliest nearest      lucifer then there must be delusionwhat is that     which being nearest to thine eyes is still     more beautiful than beauteous things remote      cain my sister adahall the stars of heaven     the deep blue noon of night lit by an orb     which looks a spirit or a spirits world     the hues of twilightthe suns gorgeous coming     his setting indescribable which fills     my eyes with pleasant tears as i behold                            260     him sink and feel my heart float softly with him     along that western paradise of clouds     the forest shade the green bough the birds voice     the vesper birds which seems to sing of love     and mingles with the song of cherubim     as the day closes over edens walls     all these are nothing to my eyes and heart     like adahs face i turn from earth and heaven     to gaze on it      lucifer      tis fair as frail mortality     in the first dawn and bloom of young creation                     270     and earliest embraces of earths parents     can make its offspring still it is delusion      cain you think so being not her brother      lucifer                                    mortal     my brotherhoods with those who have no children      cain then thou canst have no fellowship with us      lucifer it may be that thine own shall be for me     but if thou dost possess a beautiful     being beyond all beauty in thine eyes     why art thou wretched      cain                why do i exist     why art thou wretched why are all things so                    280     evn he who made us must be as the maker     of things unhappy to produce destruction     can surely never be the task of joy     and yet my sire says hes omnipotent     then why is evilhe being good i asked     this question of my father and he said     because this evil only was the path     to good strange good that must arise from out     its deadly opposite i lately saw     a lamb stung by a reptile the poor suckling                       290     lay foaming on the earth beneath the vain     and piteous bleating of its restless dam     my father plucked some herbs and laid them to     the wound and by degrees the helpless wretch     resumed its careless life and rose to drain     the mothers milk who oer it tremulous     stood licking its reviving limbs with joy     behold my son said adam how from evil     springs good118      lucifer     what didst thou answer      cain                                nothing for     he is my father but i thought that twere                        300     a better portion for the animal     never to have been stung at all than to     purchase renewal of its little life     with agonies unutterable though     dispelled by antidotes      lucifer             but as thou saidst     of all belovéd things thou lovest her     who shared thy mothers milk and giveth hers     unto thy children      cain               most assuredly     what should i be without her      lucifer                    what am i      cain dost thou love nothing      lucifer                      what does thy god love            310      cain all things my father says but i confess     i see it not in their allotment here      lucifer and therefore thou canst not see if i love     or noexcept some vast and general purpose     to which particular things must melt like snows      cain snows what are they      lucifer                    be happier in not knowing     what thy remoter offspring must encounter     but bask beneath the clime which knows no winter      cain but dost thou not love something like thyself      lucifer and dost thou love thyself      cain                                 yes but love more         320     what makes my feelings more endurable     and is more than myself because i love it      lucifer thou lovest it because tis beautiful     as was the apple in thy mothers eye     and when it ceases to be so thy love     will cease like any other appetite119      cain cease to be beautiful how can that be      lucifer with time      cain               but time has passed and hitherto     even adam and my mother both are fair     not fair like adah and the seraphim                              330     but very fair      lucifer     all that must pass away     in them and her      cain          im sorry for it but     cannot conceive my love for her the less     and when her beauty disappears methinks     he who creates all beauty will lose more     than me in seeing perish such a work      lucifer i pity thee who lovest what must perish      cain and i thee who lovst nothing      lucifer                             and thy brother     sits he not near thy heart      cain                    why should he not      lucifer thy father loves him wellso does thy god             340      cain and so do i      lucifer           tis well and meekly done      cain meekly      lucifer      he is the second born of flesh     and is his mothers favourite      cain                        let him keep     her favour since the serpent was the first     to win it      lucifer and his fathers      cain                      what is that     to me should i not love that which all love      lucifer and the jehovahthe indulgent lord     and bounteous planter of barred paradise     he too looks smilingly on abel      cain                           i     neer saw him and i know not if he smiles                        350      lucifer but you have seen his angels      cain                                    rarely      lucifer                                        but     sufficiently to see they love your brother     his sacrifices are acceptable      cain so be they wherefore speak to me of this      lucifer because thou hast thought of this ere now      cain                                               and if     i have thought why recall a thought that       he pauses as agitatedspirit     here we are in thy world speak not of mine     thou hast shown me wonders thou hast shown me those     mighty preadamites who walked the earth     of which ours is the wreck thou hast pointed out                  360     myriads of starry worlds of which our own     is the dim and remote companion in     infinity of life thou hast shown me shadows     of that existence with the dreaded name     which my sire brought usdeathcj thou hast shown me much     but not all show me where jehovah dwells     in his especial paradiseor thine     where is it      lucifer     here and oer all space      cain                                    but ye     have some allotted dwellingas all things     clay has its earth and other worlds their tenants                370     all temporary breathing creatures their     peculiar element and things which have     long ceased to breathe our breath have theirs thou sayst     and the jehovah and thyself have thine     ye do not dwell together      lucifer                no we reign     together but our dwellings are asunder      cain would there were only one of ye perchance     an unity of purpose might make union     in elements which seem now jarred in storms     how came ye being spirits wise and infinite                      380     to separate are ye not as brethren in     your essenceand your nature and your glory      lucifer art not thou abels brother      cain                                 we are brethren     and so we shall remain but were it not so     is spirit like to flesh can it fall out     infinity with immortality     jarring and turning space to misery     for what      lucifer to reign      cain              did ye not tell me that     ye are both eternal      lucifer           yea       cain                  and what i have seen     yon blue immensity is boundless      lucifer                        aye                             390     cain and cannot ye both reign thenis there not     enoughwhy should ye differ      lucifer                     we both reign      cain but one of you makes evil      lucifer                         which      cain                                  thou for     if thou canst do man good why dost thou not      lucifer and why not he who made i made ye not     ye are his creatures and not mine      cain                              then leave us     his creatures as thou sayst we are or show me     thy dwelling or his dwelling      lucifer                      i could show thee     both but the time will come thou shalt see one     of them for evermore120      cain                and why not now                            400      lucifer thy human mind hath scarcely grasp to gather     the little i have shown thee into calm     and clear thought and thou wouldst go on aspiring     to the great double mysteries the two principles121     and gaze upon them on their secret thrones     dust limit thy ambition for to see     either of these would be for thee to perish      cain and let me perish so i see them      lucifer                                there     the son of her who snatched the apple spake     but thou wouldst only perish and not see them                    410     that sight is for the other state      cain                            of death      lucifer that is the prelude      cain                         then i dread it less     now that i know it leads to something definite      lucifer and now i will convey thee to thy world     where thou shall multiply the race of adam     eat drink toil tremble laugh weep sleepand die      cain and to what end have i beheld these things     which thou hast shown me      lucifer                didst thou not require     knowledge and have i not in what i showed     taught thee to know thyself      cain                      alas i seem                          420     nothing122      lucifer and this should be the human sum     of knowledge to know mortal natures nothingness     bequeath that science to thy children and     twill spare them many tortures      cain                          haughty spirit     thou speakst it proudly but thyself though proud     hast a superior      lucifer       no by heaven which he     holds and the abyss and the immensity     of worlds and life which i hold with himno     i have a victortrue but no superior123     homage he has from allbut none from me                          430     i battle it against him as i battled     in highest heaventhrough all eternity     and the unfathomable gulfs of hades     and the interminable realms of space     and the infinity of endless ages     all all will i dispute and world by world     and star by star and universe by universe     shall tremble in the balance till the great     conflict shall cease if ever it shall cease     which it neer shall till he or i be quenched                    440     and what can quench our immortality     or mutual and irrevocable hate     he as a conqueror will call the conquered     evil but what will be the good he gives     were i the victor his works would be deemed     the only evil ones and you ye new     and scarceborn mortals what have been his gifts     to you already in your little world      cain but few and some of those but bitter      lucifer                                     back     with me then to thine earth and try the rest                    450     of his celestial boons to you and yours     evil and good are things in their own essence     and not made good or evil by the giver     but if he gives you goodso call him if     evil springs from him do not name it mine     till ye know better its true fount and judge     not by words though of spirits but the fruits     of your existence such as it must be     one good gift has the fatal apple given     your reasonlet it not be overswayed                           460     by tyrannous threats to force you into faith     gainst all external sense and inward feeling     think and endureand form an inner world     in your own bosomwhere the outward fails     so shall you nearer be the spiritual     nature and war triumphant with your own

which looks as if it mourned     oer what it shadows wherefore didst thou choose it     for our childs canopy      adah                 because its branches     shut out the sun like night and therefore seemed     fitting to shadow slumber      cain                    aye the last     and longest but no matterlead me to him                                                they go up to the

 and his lips too     how beautifully parted no you shall not     kiss him at least not now he will awake soon     his hour of midday rest is nearly over     but it were pity to disturb him till     tis closed      cain     you have said well i will contain     my heart till then he smiles and sleepssleep on     and smile thou little young inheritor     of a world scarce less young sleep on and

be amerced for sins unknown     which were not thine nor mine but now sleep on     his cheeks are reddening into deeper smiles     and shining lids are trembling oer his long     lashes125 dark as the cypress which waves oer them     half open from beneath them the clear blue     laughs out although in slumber he must dream                    30     of what of paradiseaye dream of it     my disinherited boy tis but a dream     for never more thyself thy sons nor fathers     shall walk in that forbidden place of joy      adah dear cain nay do not whisper oer our son     such melancholy yearnings oer the past     why wilt thou always mourn for paradise     can we not make another      cain                  where      adah                        here or     whereer thou wilt whereer

owe so much besides our birth      cain yesdeath too is amongst the debts we owe her      adah cain that proud spirit who withdrew thee hence     hath saddened thine still deeper i had hoped     the promised wonders which thou hast beheld     visions thou sayst of past and present worlds     would have composed thy mind into the calm     of a contented knowledge but i see                                 50     thy guide hath done thee evil still i thank him     and can forgive him all that he so soon     hath given thee back to us      cain                     so soon      adah                            tis scarcely     two hours since ye departed two long hours     to me but only hours upon the sun      cain and yet i have approached that sun and seen     worlds which he once shone on and never more     shall light and worlds he never lit methought     years had rolled oer my absence      adah                           hardly hours      cain the mind then hath capacity of time                        60     and measures it by that which it beholds     pleasing or painful126 little or almighty     i had beheld the immemorial works     of endless beings skirred extinguished worlds     and gazing on eternity methought     i had borrowed more by a few drops of ages     from its immensity but now i feel     my littleness again well said the spirit     that i was nothing      adah             wherefore said he so     jehovah said not that      cain                no he contents him                        70     with making us the nothing which we are     and after flattering dust with glimpses of     eden and immortality resolves     it back to dust againfor what      adah                          thou knowst     even for our parents error      cain                      what is that     to us they sinned then let them die      adah thou hast not spoken well nor is that thought     thy own but of the spirit who was with thee     would i could die for them so they might live      cain why so say iprovided that one victim                     80     might satiate the insatiable of life     and that our little rosy sleeper there     might never taste of death nor human sorrow     nor hand it down to those who spring from him      adah how know we that some such atonement one day     may not redeem our race      cain                   by sacrificing     the harmless for the guilty what atonement127     were there why we are innocent what have we     done that we must be victims for a deed     before our birth or need have victims to                           90     atone for this mysterious nameless sin     if it be such a sin to seek for knowledge      adah alas thou sinnest now my cain thy words     sound impious in mine ears      cain                     then leave me      adah                                   never     though thy god left thee      cain                   say what have we here      adah two altars which our brother abel made     during thine absence whereupon to offer     a sacrifice to god on thy return      cain and how knew he that i would be so ready     with the burnt offerings which he daily brings                    100     with a meek brow whose base humility     shows more of fear than worshipas a bribe     to the creator      adah         surely tis well done      cain one altar may suffice i have no offering      adah the fruits of the earth128 the early beautiful     blossom and budand bloom of flowers and fruits     these are a goodly offering to the lord     given with a gentle and a contrite spirit      cain i have toiled and tilled and sweaten in the sun     according to the cursemust i do more                           110     for what should i be gentle for a war     with all the elements ere they will yield     the bread we eat for what must i be grateful     for being dust and grovelling in the dust     till i return to dust if i am nothing     for nothing shall i be an hypocrite     and seem wellpleased with pain for what should i     be contrite for my fathers sin already     expiate with what we all have undergone     and to be more than expiated by                                    120     the ages prophesied upon our seed     little deems our young blooming sleeper there     the germs of an eternal misery     to myriads is within him better twere     i snatched him in his sleep and dashed him gainst     the rocks than let him live to      adah                            oh my god     touch not the childmy child thy child oh cain      cain fear not for all the stars and all the power     which sways them i would not accost yon infant     with ruder greeting than a fathers kiss                          130      adah then why so awful in thy speech      cain                                  i said     twere better that he ceased to live than give     life to so much of sorrow as he must     endure and harder still bequeath but since     that saying jars you let us only say     twere better that he never had been born      adah oh do not say so where were then the joys     the mothers joys of watching nourishing     and loving him soft he awakes sweet enoch                                                  she goes to the child     oh cain look on him see how full of life                       140     of strength of bloom of beauty and of joy     how like to mehow like to thee when gentle     for then we are all alike ist not so cain     mother and sire and son our features are     reflected in each other as they are     in the clear waters when they are gentle and     when thou art gentle love us then my cain     and love thyself for our sakes for we love thee     look how he laughs and stretches out his arms     and opens wide his blue eyes upon thine                           150     to hail his father while his little form     flutters as winged with joy talk not of pain     the childless cherubs well might envy thee     the pleasures of a

condemn the paradise lost if they have a mind to be consistent the fiendlike reasoning and bold blasphemy of the fiend and of his pupil lead exactly to the point which was to be expectedthe commission of the first murder and the ruin and despair of the perpetrator  i do not see how any one can accuse the author himself of manicheism the devil talks the language of that sect doubtless because not being able to deny the existence of the good principle he endeavours to exalt himselfthe evil principleto a seeming equality with the good but such arguments in the mouth of such a being can only be used to deceive and to betray lord byron might have made this more evident by placing in the mouth of adam or of some good and protecting spirit the reasons which render the existence of moral evil consistent with the general benevolence of the deity the great key to the mystery is perhaps the imperfection of our own faculties which see and feel strongly the partial evils which press upon us but know too little of the general system of the universe to be aware how the existence of these is to be reconciled with the benevolence of the great creator  to drop these speculations you have much

is unduly disparaged as various in composition as shakespeare himself lord byron has embraced says sir walter scott every topic of human life and sounded every string on the divine harp from its slightest to its most powerful and heartastounding tones in the very grand and tremendous drama of cain etc and lord byron has done all this scott adds while managing his pen with the careless and negligent ease of a man of qualitypoetry of byron chosen and arranged by matthew arnold 1881 p xiii  scott does not add anything of the kind the comparison with shakespeare was written after byrons

number of john bull for god the king and the people was published sunday december 17 1820 theodore hook was the editor and it is supposed that he owed his appointment to the intervention of sir walter scott the raison dêtre of john bull was to write up george iv and to write down queen caroline the national movement in favour of the queen was arrested and george iv had mainly john bull to thank for that resulta sketch by j g lockhart 1852 p 45  87 207mysteries or mystery plays were prior to and distinct from moralities byron seems to have had some acquaintance with the archæology of the drama but it is not easy to divine the source or extent of his knowledge he may have received and read the roxburghe reprint of the chester plays published in 1818 but it is most probable that he had read the pages devoted to mystery plays in wartons history of poetry or that he had met with a version of the ludus coventriæ reprinted by j o halliwell phillipps in 1841 printed in stevenss continuation

if possible in the same volume with the others sardanapalus etc and would serve so he seems to have reflected the moment he reflects he is a child said goethe as an antidote to the audacities or as some would have it the impieties of cain  he reckoned without his publisher who understood the temper of the public and of the government and was naturally loth to awaken any more reasonable doubts in the mind of the chancellor with regard to whether a scriptural drama was irreverent or profane the new mystery was revised by gifford and printed but withheld from month to month till at length the fire kindled and on the last day of october 1821 byron instructed john hunt to obtain from mr murray werner a drama and another dramatic poem called heaven and earth it was published in the second number of the liberal pp 165206 january 1 1823  the same subject the unequal union of angelic lovers with the daughters of men had taken moores fancy a year before byron had begun to dramatize the old testament he had designed a long poem but having discovered that byron was at work on the same theme he resolved to restrict himself to the production of an episode to give himself the chance of  an heliacal rising before he was outshone by the advent of a greater luminary thanks to murrays scruples and the translation of mss to hunt the episode took the lead of the mystery by eight days the loves of the angels see memoirs etc 1853 iv 28 was published december 23 1822 none the less lyric and drama were destined to run in double harness critics found it convenient to review the two poems in the same article and were at pains to draw a series of more or less pointed and pungent comparisons between the unwilling though not unwitting rivals  wilson in blackwood writes the first the loves etc is all glitter and point like a piece of derbyshire spar and the other is dark and massy like a block of marble moore writes with a crowquill  byron writes with an eagles plume while jeffrey in the edinburgh likens moore to an aurora borealis and byron to an eruption of mount vesuvius  there is indeed apart from the subject nothing in common between moores tender and alluring lyric and byrons gloomy and tumultuous rhapsody while contrast is to be sought rather in the poets than in their poems the loves of the angels is the finished composition of an accomplished designer of amoretti one of the best of his kind heaven and earth is the rough and unpromising sketch thrown off by a great master  both the one and the other have passed out of the ken of readers of poetry but on the whole the loves of the angels has suffered the greater injustice it is opined that there may be possibilities in a halfforgotten work of byron but it is taken for granted that nothing worthy of attention is to be found in moore at the time however moore scored a success and byron hardly escaped a failure it is to be noted that within a month of publication january 18 1823 moore was at work upon a revise for a fifth editionconsulting dherbelot for the project of turning the poor angels into turks and so getting rid of that connection with the scriptures which so the longmans feared would in the long run be a drag on the popularity of the poem memoirs etc 1853 iv 41 it was no wonder that murray was timorous with regard to byron and his scriptural dramas when the longmans started at the shadow of a scriptural allusion  byron in his innocence had taken for his motto the verse in genesis ch vi 2 which records the intermarriage of the sons of god with the daughters of men in heaven and earth the angels are angels members though erring members of jehovahs thundering choir and the daughters of men are the descendants of cain the question had come up for debate owing to the recent appearance of a translation of the book of enoch by richard laurence lld oxford 1821 and moore by way of safeguarding himself against any suspicion of theological irregularity is careful to assure his readers preface to loves of the angels 1823 p viii and note pp 125127 that the sons of god were the descendants of seth and not beings of a supernatural order as a mistranslation by the lxx assisted by philo and the rhapsodical fictions of the book of enoch had induced the ignorant or the profane to suppose nothing is so dangerous as innocence and a little more of that empeiria of which goethe accused him would have saved byron from straying from the path of orthodoxy  it is impossible to say for certain whether laurences translation of the whole of the book of enoch had come under byrons notice before he planned his new mystery but it is plain that he was at any rate familiar with the wellknown fragment concerning the watchers Περὶ των Ἐγρηγόρων peri\ tôn egrêgorôn which is preserved

december 18 1821 and finished january 20 1822 at the end of the month january 29 byron despatched the ms not to murray but to moore then in retreat at paris intending no doubt that it should be placed in the hands of another publisher but a letter from murray melted him and on march 6 1822 letters 1901 vi 34 he desired moore to forward the packet to albemarle street the play was set up in type and revised proofs were returned to murray at the end of june but for various reasons publication was withheld and on october 31 byron informed john hunt that he had empowered his friend douglas kinnaird to obtain werner with other mss from murray none the less milder counsels again prevailed and on saturday november 23 1822 werner was published not in the same volume with heaven and earth as byron intended and expected nor by john hunt as he had threatened but by itself and as heretofore by john murray werner was the last of all the flock to issue from murrays fold  in his preface to werner vide post p 337 byron disclaims all pretensions to originality the following drama he writes is taken entirely from the germans tale kruitzner published  in lees canterbury tales i have adopted the characters plan and even the language of many parts of this story kruitzner seems to have made a deep impression on his mind when he was a boy of thirteen ie in 1801 when the fourth volume of the canterbury tales was published and again in 1815 he set himself to turn the tale into a drama his first attempt named ulric and ilvina he threw into the fire but he had nearly completed the first act of his second and maturer adaptation when he was interrupted by circumstances that is no doubt the circumstances which led up to and ended in the separation from his wife see letter of october 9 1821 letters 1901 v 391  on his leaving england for the continent april 25 1816 the fragment was left behind most probably the ms fell into his sisters hands for in october 1821 it was not forthcoming when byron gave directions that hobhouse should search for it amongst my papers ultimately it came into the possession of the late mr murray and is now printed for the first time in its entirety vide post pp 453466 selections were given in the nineteenth century august 1899 it should be borne in mind that this unprinted first act of werner which synchronizes with the siege of corinth and parisina was written when byron was a member of the subcommittee of management of drury lane theatre and as the numerous stage directions testify with a view to stagerepresentation the ms is scored with corrections and betrays an unusual elaboration and perhaps some difficulty and hesitation in the choice of words and the construction of sentences in the opening scene the situation is not caught and gripped while the melancholy squalor of the original narrative is only too faithfully reproduced the werner of 1821 with all its shortcomings is the production of a playwright the werner of 1815 is the attempt of a highly gifted amateur  when byron once more bethought himself of his old subject he not only sent for the ms of the first act but desired murray to cut out sophia lees vide post p 337 germans tale from the canterbury tales and send it in a letter letters 1901 v 390 he seems to have intended from the first to construct a drama out of the story and no doubt to acknowledge the source of his inspiration on the whole he carried out his intention taking places characters and incidents as he found them but recasting the materials and turning prose into metre but here and there to save himself trouble he stole his brooms ready made and as he acknowledges in the preface adopted even the language of the story act ii sc 2 lines 87172 act iii sc 4 and act v sc 1 lines 94479 are more or less faithful and exact reproductions of pp 203206 228232 and 252271 of the novel see canterbury tales ed 1832 vol ii on the other hand in the remaining threefourths of the play the language is not miss lees but byrons and the conveyance of incidents occasional and insignificant much too was imported into the play eg almost the whole of the fourth act of which there is neither hint nor suggestion in the story maginns categorical statement see odoherty on werner miscellanies 1885 i 189 that here lord byron has invented nothingabsolutely positively undeniably nothing that there is not one incident in his play not even the most trivial that is not to be found in the novel etc is positively and undeniably a falsehood maginn read werner for the purpose of attacking byron and by printing selected passages from the novel and the play in parallel columns gives the reader to understand that he had made an exhaustive analysis of the original and the copy the review which is quoted as an authority in the editions of 1832 xiv pp 113 114 and 1837 etc p 341 is disingenuous and misleading  the original story may be briefly retold the prodigal and outlawed son of a bohemian noble count siegendorf after various adventures marries under the assumed name of friedrich kruitzner the daughter of an italian scholar and man of science of noble birth but in narrow circumstances a son conrad is born to him who at eight years of age is transferred to the charge of his grandfather twelve years go by and when the fortunes of the younger siegendorf are at their lowest ebb he learns at the same moment that his father is dead and that a distant kinsman the baron stralenheim is meditating an attack on his person with a view to claiming his inheritance of conrad who has disappeared he hears nothing  an accident compels the count and the baron to occupy adjoining quarters in a small town on the northern frontier of silesia and again another accident places the usurping and intriguing baron at the mercy of his povertystricken and exiled kinsman stralenheim has fallen asleep near the fire in his easychair papers and several rouleaux of gold are ranged on a cabinet beside the bed kruitzner who is armed with a large and sharp knife is suddenly confronted with his unarmed and slumbering foe and though habit and conscience conspire to make murder impossible he yields to a sudden and irresistible impulse and snatches up the portion of gold which is nearest he has no sooner returned to his wife and confessed his deed than conrad suddenly appears on the scene and at the very moment of an unexpected and joyous reunion with his parents learns that his father is a thief kruitzner pleads guilty with extenuating circumstances and conrad who either is or pretends to be disgusted at his fathers sophistries makes the best of a bad business and undertakes to conceal his fathers dishonour and rescue him from the power of stralenheim the plot hinges on the unlookedfor and unsuspected action of conrad unlike his father he is not the man to let i dare not wait upon i would but murders stralenheim in cold blood and at the same time diverts suspicion from his father and himself to the person of his comrade a hungarian soldier of fortune who is already supposed to be the thief and who had sought and obtained shelter in the apartments of the consciencestricken kruitzner  the scene changes to prague siegendorf no longer kruitzner has regained his inheritance and is once more at the height of splendour and prosperity a service of thanksgiving is being held in the cathedral to commemorate the signature of the treaty of prague 1635 and the count is present in state suddenly he catches sight of the hungarian and like a flash of lightning feels and remembers that he is a thief and that he might however unjustly be suspected if not accused of the murder of stralenheim the service is over and the count is recrossing muldaus bridge when he hears the fatal word kruitzner the seal of his shame spoken in his ear he returns to his castle and issues orders that the hungarian should be arrested and interrogated an interview takes place at which the hungarian denounces conrad as the murderer of stralenheim the son acknowledges the deed and upbraids the father for his weakness and credulity in supposing that his escape from stralenheims machinations could have been effected by any other means if he argues circumstances can palliate dishonesty they can compel and justify murder common sense even now demands the immediate slaughter of the hungarian as it compelled and sanctioned the effectual silencing of stralenheim but siegendorf knows not thorough and shrinks at assassination he repudiates and denounces his son and connives at the escape of the hungarian conrad who is banished from prague rejoins his former associates the black bands which were the scandal and terror of the neighbouring provinces and is killed in a skirmish with the regular troops siegendorf dies of a broken heart  the conception of the germans tale as byron perceived is superior to the execution the style is laboured and involved and the narrative longwinded and tiresome it is perhaps an adaptation though not a literal translation of a german historical romance but the motifa son predestined to evil by the weakness and sensuality of his father a father punished for his want of rectitude by the passionate criminality of his son is the very keynote of tragedy  if from haste or indolence byron scamped his task and cut up whole cantles of the novel into nerveless and pointless blank verse here and there throughout the play in scattered lines and passages he outdoes himself the inspiration is fitful but supreme  werner was reviewed in blackwoods

granville to her sister lady carlisle which asserts that their mother the duchess wrote an entire tragedy from miss lees kreutzner the hungarian sic and that the ms had been sent to her by lady carolines brother mr william ponsonby and was in her possession 3 another letter of lady granvilles dated december 3 1822 in which she informs her sister that her husband lord granville had promised to read werner aloud to her ie byrons werner published november 23 1822 a promise which if fulfilled must have revealed one of two thingsthe existence of two dramas based on miss lees kruitzner or the identity of byrons version with that of the duchess now argues mr leveson gower if lady granville had known that two dramas were in existence she would not have allowed her daughter lady georgiana fullerton to believe that the duchess was the author of the published poem  i will deal with the external evidence first practically it amounts to this 1 that lady granville knew that her mother the duchess of devonshire dramatized miss lees kruitzner and 2 that lady georgiana fullerton believed that the duchess gave the ms of her play to lady caroline ponsonby and that many years after lady caroline handed it over to byron  the external evidence establishes the fact that the duchess of devonshire dramatized kruitzner but it does not prove that byron purloined her adaptation it records an unverified impression on the part of the duchesss granddaughter that the ms of a play written between the years 18011806 passed into byrons hands about the year 1813 that he took a copy of the ms and that in 182122 he caused his copy to be retranscribed and published under his own name  but mr leveson gower appeals to internal as well as external evidence 1 he regards the great inferiority of werner to byrons published plays and to the genuine hitherto unpublished first act together with the wholesale plagiarisms from miss lees story as an additional proof that the work was none of his 2 he notes as a suspicious circumstance that while the rough copies of his other poems have been preserved no rough copy of werner is to be found  in conclusion he deals with two possible objections which may be brought against his theory 1 that byron would not have incurred the risk of detection at the hands of the owners of the duchesss ms and 2 that a great poet of assured fame and reputation could have had no possible motive for perpetrating a literary fraud the first objection he answers by assuming that byron would have counted on the reluctance of the ponsonby family and the daughters of the duchess to rake up the ashes of old scandals the second by pointing out that in 1822 he was making frantic endeavours to obtain money not for himself but to help the cause of greece  1 with regard to the marked inferiority of werner to byrons other plays and the relative proportion of adapted to original matter mr leveson gower appears to have been misled by the disingenuous criticism of maginn and other contemporary reviewers vide the introduction etc p 326 there is no such inferiority and the plagiarisms which were duly acknowledged are confined to certain limited portions of the play 2 there is nothing unusual in the fact that the rough draft of werner cannot be found in fact but few of the early drafts of the dramas and other poems written in the later italian days ever reached murrays hands or are still in existence the fair copy for the printer alone was sent home the time had gone by when byrons publisher who was also his friend would stipulate that all the original mss copies and scraps should fall to his share but no argument can be founded on so insignificant a circumstance  finally the argument on which mr leveson gower dwells at some length that byrons motive for perpetrating a literary fraud was the necessity for raising money for the cause of greek independence is refuted by the fact that werner was begun in december 1821 and finished in january 1822 and that it was not till the spring of 1823 that he was elected a member of the greek committee or had any occasion to raise funds for the maintenance of troops or the general expenses of the war so far from attempting to raise money by werner in letters to murray dated march 6 october 24 november 18 1822 he emphatically waives the question of terms and makes no demand or request for money whatever it was not till december 23 1823 letters 1901 vi 287 two years after the play had been written that he speaks of applying the two or three hundred pounds which the copyright of werner might be worth to the maintenance of armed men in the service of the provisional government he could not have purloined and palmed off as his own the duchesss version of miss lees story in order to raise money for a purpose which had not arisen he had no intention at first or last of presenting the copyright of werner to murray or hunt but he was willing to wait for his money and had no motive for raising funds by an illegal and dishonourable trick  that byron did not write werner is surely nonproven on the external and internal evidence adduced by mr leveson gower on the other hand there is abundant evidence both external and internal that apart from his acknowledged indebtedness to miss lees story he did write werner  to take the external evidence first on the first page of mrs shelleys transcript of werner byron inserted the date dec 18 1821 and on the last he wrote the end of fifth act of the drama b pisa jy 21 1822  turning to the journal of edward williams shelleys prose works 1880 iv 318 i find the following entries  december 21 1821 lord b told me that he had commenced a tragedy from miss lees german tale werner and had been fagging at it all day  january 8 1822 mary read us the first two acts of lord bs werner  again in an unpublished diary of the same period it is recorded that mrs shelley was engaged in the task of copying on january 17 1822 and the eight following days and that on january 25 she finished her transcript  again medwin conversations 1824 p 409 records the fact that byron told him that he had almost finished another play  called werner and p 412 that werner was written in twentyeight days and one entire act at a sitting it is almost incredible that byron should have recopied a copy of the duchesss play in order to impose on mrs shelley and williams and medwin and it is quite incredible that they were in the plot and lent themselves to the deception it is certain that both williams and medwin believed that byron was the author of werner and it is certain that nothing would have induced mrs shelley to be particeps criministo copy a play which was not byrons to be published as byrons and to suffer her copy to be fraudulently endorsed by her guilty accomplice  the internal evidence of the genuineness of werner is still more convincing in the first place there are numerous undesigned coincidences allusions and phrases to be found in werner and elsewhere in byrons poetical works which bear his signmanual and cannot be attributed to another writer and secondly scattered through the play there are numerous

many years ago in lees canterbury tales written i believe by two sisters of whom one furnished only this story and another both of which are considered superior to the remainder of the collection159 i have adopted the characters plan and even the language of many parts of this story some of the characters are modified or altered a few of the names changed and one character ida of stralenheim added by myself but in the rest the original is chiefly followed when i was young about fourteen i think i first read this tale which made a deep impression upon me and may indeed be said to contain the germ of much that i have since written i am not sure that it ever was very popular or at any rate its popularity has since been eclipsed by that of other great writers in the same department but i have generally found that those who had read it agreed with me in their estimate of the singular power of mind and conception which it developes i should also add conception rather than execution for the story might perhaps have been developed with greater advantage amongst those whose opinions agreed with mine upon this story i could mention some very high names but it is not necessary nor indeed of any use for every one must judge according to his own feelings i merely refer the reader to the original story that he may see to what extent i have borrowed from it and am not unwilling that he should find much greater pleasure in perusing it than the drama which is founded upon its contents  i had begun a drama upon this tale so far back as 1815 the first i ever attempted except one at thirteen years old called ulric and ilvina which i had sense enough to burn and had nearly completed an act when i was interrupted by circumstances this is somewhere amongst my papers in england but as it has not been found i have rewritten the first and added the subsequent acts  the whole is neither intended nor in any shape adapted for the stagecm                                 dramatis

unto those who long for novelty     though made by a new grave but as for wassail     methinks the old count siegendorf maintained     his feudal hospitality as high     as eer another prince of the empire      eric                               why     for the mere cup and trencher we no doubt     fared passing well but as for merriment                            10     and sport without which salt and sauces season     the cheer but scantily our sizings were     even of the narrowest      hen                 the old count loved not     the roar of revel are you sure that this does      eric as yet he hath been courteous as hes bounteous     and we all love him      hen               his reign is as yet     hardly a year oerpast its honeymoon     and the first year of sovereigns is

over in the hall who like     count ulric for a wellsupported pride     which awes but yet offends not in the field     who like him with his spear in hand when gnashing                  30     his tusks and ripping up from right to left     the howling hounds the boar makes for the thicket     who backs a horse or bears a hawk or wears     a sword like him whose plume nods knightlier      hen no ones i grant you do not fear if war     be long in coming he is of that kind     will make it for himself if he hath not     already done as much      eric               what do you mean      hen you cant deny his train of followers     but few our native fellowvassals born                             40     on the domain are such a sort of knaves     as

withgod knows who they fly     by night and disappear with sunrise but     leave us no less desolation nay even more     than the most open warfare      eric                    but count ulric     what has all this to do with him      hen                            with him     hemight prevent it as you say hes fond     of war why makes he it not on those marauders      eric youd better ask

eric why do you turn so pale      hen                          tis nothingbut     be silent      eric    i will upon what you have said      hen i assure you i meant nothinga mere sport     of words

secured a band of desperate men supposed     marauders from the hostile campthey proved     however not to be sobut banditti     whom either accident or enterprise     had carried from their usual hauntthe forests     which skirt bohemiaeven into lusatia     many amongst them were reported of     high rankand martial law slept for a time     at last they were escorted oer the frontiers     and placed beneath the civil jurisdiction                          240     of the free town of frankfort of their fate     i know no more      sieg         and what is this to ulric      gab amongst them

remonstrance upon the theatres of more than one nation i trust it will not be deemed impertinent if i once more repeat my protest against a gross folly which may injure meand benefit no one if it be understood that all dramatic writing is generically intended for the stage i deny it with the exception of shakespeare or tate cibber and thompson under his name not one in fifty plays of our dramatists is ever acted however much they may be read only one of massingernone of fordnone of marlowe one of ben jonsonnone of webster none of heywood and even in comedy congreve is rarely acted and that in only one of his plays neither is joanna baillie i am far from attempting to raise myself to a level with the least of these namesi only wish to be exempted from a stage which is not theirs

mutilated page of ms m   byron is replying to jeffrey edinburgh review february 1822 vol 36 p 422 a drama is not merely a dialogue but an action and necessarily supposes that something is to pass before the eyes of assembled spectators if an author does not bear this continually in his mind and does not write in the ideal presence of an eager and diversified assemblage he may be a poet perhaps but assuredly he will never be a dramatist   it may seem a paradox but i cannot help being of opinion that the plays of shakespeare are less calculated for performance on a stage than those of almost any other dramatist whateveron the tragedies of shakespeare complete works of charles lamb 1875 p 255 it was too something of a paradox that byron should be eager to shelter himself under the ægis of

in 1815 not in 1821 and it is far more probable that byron called his hero werner because kruitzner is unrhythmical or simply because werner a common german surname is not unlike werther which was

1822 there is nothing to show in what month it was written but it may be conjectured that it was begun and finished within the period which elapsed between the death of allegra april 20 and the death of shelley july 8 1822 according to medwin conversations 1824 p 227 an unfavourable criticism of shelleys it is a bad imitation of faust together with a discovery that two entire lines of southeys      and water shall see thee     and fear thee and flee thee  were imbedded in one of his songs touched byron so deeply that he threw the poem into the fire and concealed the existence of a second copy for more than two years it is a fact that byrons correspondence does not contain the remotest allusion to the deformed transformed but with regard to the plagiarism from southey in the play as written in 1822 there is neither song nor incantation which could have contained two lines from the curse of kehama  as a dramatist byrons function or métier was twofold in manfred in cain in heaven and earth he is concerned with the analysis and evolution of metaphysical or ethical notions in marino faliero in sardanapalus and the two foscari he set himself to dramatize striking passages of history in the deformed transformed he sought to combine the solution of a metaphysical puzzle or problem the relation of personality to individuality with the scenic rendering of a striking historical episode the sack of rome in 1527  in the note or advertisement prefixed to the drama byron acknowledges that the production is founded partly on the story of a forgotten novel the three brothers and partly on the faust of the great goethe  arnaud or julian the hero of the three brothers by joshua pickersgill jun 4 vols 1803 sells his soul to the devil and becomes an archfiend in order to avenge himself for the taunts of strangers on the deformity of his person see gent mag november 1804 vol 74 p 1047 and post pp 473479 the idea of an escape from natural bonds or disabilities by supernatural means and at the price of the soul or will the unchristlike surrender to the tempter which is the grundstoff of the faustlegend was brought home to byron in the first instance not by goethe or calderon or marlowe but by joshua pickersgill a fellowfeeling lent an intimate and peculiar interest to the theme he had suffered all his life from a painful and inconvenient defect which his proud and sensitive spirit had magnified into a deformity he had been stung to the quick by his mothers taunts and his sweethearts ridicule by the jeers of the base and thoughtless by slanderous and brutal paragraphs in newspapers he could not forget that he was lame if his enemies had but possessed the wit they might have given him the sobriquet of le diable boiteux letter to moore april 2 1823 letters 1901 vi 179 it was no wonder that so poignant so persistent a calamity should be reproduced in his poetry life p 13 or that his passionate impatience of such a thorn in the flesh should picture to itself a mysterious and unhallowed miracle of healing it is true as moore says life pp 45 306 that the trifling deformity of his foot was the embittering circumstance of his life that it haunted him like a curse but it by no means follows that he seriously regarded his physical peculiarity as a stamp of the divine reprobation that he was possessed by an idée fixe that every blessing would be turned into a curse to him

intellect brooding like the day a master oer a slave kept guard he would never have pleaded on his own behalf that the tyranny of an idée fixe a delusion that he was predestined to evil was an excuse for his shortcomings or his sins  byrons very considerable obligations to the three brothers might have escaped notice but the resemblance between his stranger or cæsar and the mephistopheles of the great goethe was open and palpable  if medwin may be trusted conversations 1824 p 210 byron had read faust in a sorry french translation and it is probable that shelleys inspired rendering of mayday night which was published in the liberal no i october 14 1822 pp 123137 had been read to him and had attracted his attention the deformed transformed is a faustish kind of drama and goethe who maintained that byrons play as a whole was no imitation but new and original close genuine and spirited could not fail to perceive that his devil was suggested by my mephistopheles conversations 1874 p 174 the tempter who cannot resist the temptation of sneering at his own wiles who mocks for mockings sake is not byrons creation but goethes lucifer talked at the clergy if he did not talk like a clergyman but the bitter hunchback even when he is solus sneers as the river wanders at his own sweet will he is not a doctor but a spirit of unbelief  the second part of the deformed transformed represents in three scenes the siege and sack of rome in 1527 byron had read robertsons charles the fifth ed 1798 ii 313329 in his boyhood life p 47 but it is on record that he had studied more or less closely the narratives of contemporary authorities a note to the prophecy of dante poetical works 1901 iv 258 refers to the sacco di roma descritto da luigi guicciardini and the ragguaglio storico  sacco di roma dell anno mdxxvii of jacopo buonaparte and it is evident that he was familiar with cellinis story of the marvellous gests and exploits quorum maxima pars fuit which were wrought at the walls by the campo santo or on the ramparts of the castle of san angelo  the sack of rome was a great national calamity and it was something more it was a profanation and a sacrilege the literature which it evoked was a cry of anguish a prophetic burden of despair chants populaires writes m emile gebhart de litalie le sac de rome en 1527 1876 pp 267 sq nouvelles de giraldi cintio en

brothers in the british museum the following extracts are taken from a copy in the bodleian library at oxford vol 4 cap xi pp 229350  arnaud the natural son of the marquis de souvricour was a child extraordinary in beauty and intellect when travelling with his parents to languedoc arnaud being 8 years old he was shot at by banditti and forsaken by his parents the captain of the band nursed him but those perfections to which arnaud owed his existence ceased to adorn it the ball had gored his shoulder and the fall had dislocated it by the latter misadventure his spine likewise was so fatally injured as to be irrecoverable to its pristine uprightness injuries so compound confounded the captain who sorrowed to see a creature so charming at once deformed by a crooked back and an excrescent shoulder arnaud was found and taken back to his parents the bitterest consciousness of his deformity was derived from their indelicate though perhaps insensible alteration of conduct of his person he continued to speak as of an abhorrent enemy were a blessing submitted to my choice i would say said arnaud be it my immediate dissolution i think said his mother  that you could wish better yes adjoined arnaud for that wish should be that i ever had remained unborn he polishes the broken blade of a sword and views himself therein the sight so horrifies him that he determines to throw himself over a precipice but draws back at the last moment he goes to a cavern and conjures up the prince of hell arnaud knew himself to be interrogated what he required what was that answer the effects explain there passed in liveliest portraiture the various men distinguished for that beauty and grace which arnaud so much desired that he was ambitious to purchase them with his soul he felt that it was his part to chuse whom he would resemble yet he remained unresolved though the spectator of an hundred shades of renown among which glided by alexander alcibiades and hephestion at length appeared the supernatural effigy of a man whose perfections human artist never could depict or insculpdemetrius the son of antigonus arnauds heart heaved quick with preference and strait he found within his hand the resemblance of a poniard its point inverted towards his breast a mere automaton in the hands of the demon he thrust the point through his heart and underwent a painless death during his trance his spirit metempsychosed from the body of his detestation to that of his admiration  arnaud awoke a julian  202 474for a résumé of m g lewiss wood demon afterwards recast as one oclock or the

shelley inscribed the following note on the flyleaf of her copy of the deformed transformed  this had long been a favourite subject with lord byron i think that he mentioned it also in switzerland i copied ithe sending a portion of it at a time as it was finished to me at this time he had a great horror of its being said that he plagiarised or that he studied for ideas and wrote with difficulty thus he gave shelley aikins edition of the british poets that it might not be found in his house by some english lounger and reported home thus too he always dated when he began and when he ended a poem to prove hereafter how quickly it was done i do not think that he altered a line in this drama after he had once written it down he composed and corrected in his mind i do not know how he meant to finish it but he said himself that the whole conduct of the story was already conceived it was at this time that a brutal paragraph alluding to his lameness appeared which he repeated to me lest i should hear it from some one else no action of lord byrons lifescarce a line he has writtenbut was influenced by his personal defect   it is possible that mrs shelley alludes to a sentence in the memoirs etc of lord byron by dr john watkin 1822 p 46 a malformation of one of his feet and other indications of a rickety constitution served as a plea for suffering him to range the hills and to

passage in byrons memoranda where in speaking of his own sensitiveness on the subject of his deformed foot he described the feeling of horror and humiliation that came over him when his mother in one of her fits of passion called him a lame brat it may be questioned he adds whether that whole drama the deformed transformed was not indebted for its origin to that single recollection  byrons early

his mother louise de savoie was recalled from his command in italy and superseded by odet de foix brother of the kings mistress it was not however till he became a widower susanne duchesse de bourbon died april 28 1521 that he finally broke with francis and attached himself to the emperor charles v madame the kings mother not only coveted the vast estates of the house of bourbon but was enamoured of the constables person and so to speak gave him his choice between marriage and a suit for his fiefs charles would have nothing to say to the ladys proposals or to her sons entreaties and seeing that rejection meant ruin he entered into a correspondence with the emperor and the king henry viii of england  and finding this discovered went into the emperors service  after various and varying

english bards style but a little more stilted and somewhat too full of epithets of war and classical and historical allusions if notes are necessary they can be added  on march 5th he forwarded the proof in slips and certainly the slips are the most conspicuous part of it to his new publisher john hunt and on april 1 1823 the age of bronze was published but not with the authors name  ten years had gone by since he had published only to disclaim the latest of his boyish satires the waltz and more than six years since he had written at the request of douglas kinnaird the stilted and laboured monody on the death of  sheridan in the interval 18161822 he had essayed any and every measure but the heroic and at length as a tardy recognition of his allegiance to the great moral poet of all times of all climes of all feelings and of all stages of existence observations upon observations letters 1901 v 590 he reverts as he believes to his early english bards style the style of pope  the brazen age the annus haud mirabilis which the satirist would hold up to scorn was 1822 the year after napoleons death which witnessed a revolution in spain and the congress of allied sovereigns at verona earlier in the year the publication of las cases memorial de ste hélène and of omearas napoleon in exile or a voice from st helena had created a sensation on both sides of the channel public opinion had differed as to the system on which napoleon should be treatedand since his death there had been a conflict of evidence as to the manner in which he had been treated at st helena tories believed that an almost excessive lenience and indulgence had been wasted on a graceless and thankless intriguer while the opposition liberals or radicals were moved to indignation at the hardships and restrictions which were ruthlessly and needlessly imposed on a fallen and powerless foe it was and is a very pretty quarrel and byron whose lifelong admiration for his héros de roman was tempered by reason approached the longwood controversy somewhat in the spirit of a partisan  in the age of bronze sects iiiv he touches on certain incidents of the last phase of napoleons career and proceeds to recapitulate in a sort of memoria technica the chief events of his history from the dawn at marengo to the sunset at bloody and most bootless waterloo and draws the unimpeachable moral that honesty is the best policy even when the game is empire and the stakes are thrones  from the rise and fall the tyranny and captivity of napoleon he passes on to the congress of allied powers which met at verona in november 1822  the congress is the object of his satire it had assembled with a parade of power and magnificence and had dispersed with little or nothing accomplished it was impar achilli vide ante p 535 note 1 an empty menace illmatched with the revolutionary spirit and in pitiful contrast to the sic volo sic jubeo of the dead napoleon  the immediate and efficient cause of the congress of verona was the success of the revolution in spain the point at issue between spanish liberals and royalists or serviles was the adherence to or the evasion of the democratic constitution of 1812 at the moment the liberals were in the ascendant and as chateaubriand puts it had driven king ferdinand into captivity at urgel in catalonia to the tune of the spanish marseillaise tragala tragala swallow it swallow it that is accept the constitution on july 7 1822 a government was established under the name of the supreme regency of spain during the captivity of the king and hence the consternation of the partners of the holy alliance especially france who conceived or feigned to conceive that revolution next door was a source of danger to constitutional government at home to meet the emergency a congress was summoned in the first instance at vienna and afterwards at verona thither came the sovereigns of europe great and small accompanied by their chancellors and ministers the czar alexander was attended by count nesselrode and count pozzo di borgo the emperor francis of austria by metternich and prince esterhazy the king of prussia frederic william iii by count bernstorff and baron humboldt george iv of great britain and louis xviii of france being elderly and gouty sent as their plenipotentiaries the duke of wellington and the vicomte de montmorenci accompanied and finally superseded by the french ambassador m de chateaubriand thither too came the smaller fry kings of the two sicilies and of sardinia and last but not least marie louise of austria archduchess of parma cidevant widow of napoleon and wife sub rosâ of her oneeyed chamberlain count de neipperg they met they debated they went to the theatre in state and finally decided to send monitory despatches to spain and to leave to france a free hand to look after her own interests and to go to war or not as she was pleased to determine there was one dissentient the duke of wellington who refused to sign the procès verbaux his britannic majesty had been advised to let the spaniards alone and not to meddle with their internal affairs the final outcome of the congress the french invasion of spain could not be foreseen and apparently all that the congress had accomplished was to refuse to prohibit the exportation of negroes from africa to america and to decline to receive the greek deputies  as the morning chronicle november 7 1822 was pleased to put it the royal vultures have been deprived of their anticipated meal  from the holy alliance and its antagonist the revolutionary stork byron turns to the landed and agricultural interest of great britain with the cessation of war and the resumption of cash payments in 1819 prices had fallen some 50 per cent and rents were beginning to fall wheat which in 1818 had fetched 80s a quarter in december 1822 was quoted at 39s 11d consols were at 80 poor rates had risen from £2000000 in 1792 to £8000000 in 1822 how was the distress which these changes involved to be met by retrenchment and reform by the repeal of taxes the reduction of salaries by the landlords and farmers who had profited by war prices submitting to the inevitable reaction or by sliding scales by a return to an inflated currency perhaps by a repudiation of a portion of the funded debt  the point of byrons diatribe is that squire dives had enjoyed good things during the war and now that the war was over he had no intention to let lazarus have his turn that whoever suffered it should not be dives that patriotism had brought grist to his mill and that he proposed to suck no small advantage out of peace      year after year they voted cent per cent     blood sweat and tearwrung millionswhy for rent     they roared they dined they drank they swore they meant     to die for englandwhy then livefor rent  it is easier to divine the sources and the inspiration of the age of bronze than to place the reader au courant with the literary and political causerie of the day byron wrote with omearas book at his elbow and with batches of galignanis messenger the morning chronicle and cobbetts weekly register within his reach he was under the impression that his lines would appear as an anonymous contribution to the liberal and in any case he felt that he could speak out unchecked and uncriticized by friend or publisher he was so to speak unmuzzled  with regard to the style and quality of his new satire byron was under an amiable delusion his couplets he imagined were in his early english bards style but more stilted he did not realize that whatever the intervening years had taken away they had left behind experience and passion and that he had learned to think and to feel the fault of the poem is that too much matter is packed into too small a compass and that in parts every line implies a minute acquaintance with contemporary events and requires an explanatory note but even so in the age of bronze byron has wedded a striking passage of

history of the captivity of napoleon by william forsyth qc 1853 iii 121 sq see too sir hudson lowe and napoleon by r c seaton 1898 it is a fact that sir hudson lowe on his own responsibility increased the allowance for the household expenses of napoleon and his staff from £8000 to £12000 a year and it is also perfectly true that opportunities for complaint were welcomed by the exemperor and his mimic court it was la politique de longwood to make the worst of everything on the offchance that england would get to hear and that radical indignation and radical sympathy would gild perhaps unbar the eagles cage it is true too that a large sum of money was spent on behalf of a prisoner of war whom the stalwarts of the tory party would have executed in cold blood but it is also true that napoleon had no need to manufacture complaints that he was exposed to unnecessary discomforts that useless and irritating precautions were taken to prevent his escape that the bottles of champagne and madeira the fowls and the bundles of wood were counted with an irritating preciseness inconsistent with the general scale of expenditure which saved a little waste and covered both principals and agents with ridicule it is said that omeara in his published volumes manipulated his evidence and that his own letters give him the lie but there is a mass of correspondence published and unpublished between him and sir thomas reade sir hudson lowe and major gorrequer see addit mss brit mus 20145 which remains as it was written and which testifies to facts which might have been and were not refuted on the spot and at the moment with regard to disputed rations the governor should have been armed with a crushing answer to any and every complaint as it was he was able to show that champagne was allowed to napoleon buonaparte and that he did not exceed his allowance  263 545in his correspondence with lord bathurst sir hudson lowe more than once quotes statements made by dr omeara vide

october 3 1816 forsyth i 318 319 is characteristic with respect to the instructions i have received and my manner of making them known never having regarded general bonapartes opinions in any point whatever as to matter or manner as an oracle or criterion by which to regulate my own judgment i am not disposed to think the less favourably of the instructions or my mode of executing them it must however be borne in mind that this was written some time after lowes fifth and last interview with his captive aug 18 1816 that napoleon had abused him to his face and behind his back and was not above resorting to paltry subterfuges in order to defy and exasperate his paltry gaoler  268 546there is reason to think that the staring stranger was the traveller captain basil hall 17881844 who called upon byron at venice see letters 1900 iv 252 but did not see him his account of his interview with napoleon is attached to his narrative of a voyage to java 1840 it is not included in the earlier editions of halls voyage to the corea and the loochoo islands but is quoted by scott in his life of napoleon 1827  269 barry edward omeara 17861836 began life as assistantsurgeon to the 62nd regiment then stationed in sicily and calabria in 1815 he was surgeon on board the bellerophon under captain f l maitland napoleon took a fancy to him because he could speak italian and as his own surgeon mengeaud would not follow him into exile requested that omeara might accompany him in the northumberland to st helena his position was an ambiguous one he was to act as napoleons medical and quoad hoc confidential attendant but he was not to be subservient to him or dependent on him at st helena lowe expected him to be something between an intermediary and a spy and for a time omeara discharged both functions to the governors satisfaction statements by dr omeara are quoted by lowe in his letter to lord bathurst life of napoleon etc by sir w scott 1828 p 763 as time went on the surgeon yielded to the glamour of napoleons influence and more and more disliked and resented the necessity of communicating private conversations to lowe he withheld his confidence with the result that the governor became suspicious and treated omeara with reprobation and contempt at length on july 18 1818 on a renewed accusation of irregularities lord bathurst dismissed him from his post and ordered him to quit st helena he returned to england and october 28 1818 addressed a letter see forsyths napoleon etc iii 432 433 to j w croker the secretary to the admiralty in which he argued against the justice of his dismissal one sentence which asserted that lowe had dwelt upon the benefit which would result to europe from the death of napoleon was seized upon by croker as calumnious and in answer to his remonstrance omearas name was struck off the list of naval surgeons he published in 1819 a work entitled exposition of some of the transactions that have taken place at st helena since the appointment of sir hudson lowe as governor which was afterwards expanded into napoleon in exile or a voice from st helena 2 vols 1822 the latter work made a great sensation and passed through five editions it was republished in 1888 omeara was able and generously disposed but he was not stiff vide infra 489 he was says lord rosebery napoleon the last phase 1900 p 31 the

      christian and his comrades                            introduction to the island  the first canto of the island was finished january 10 1823 we know that byron was still at work on the poeshie january 25 letters 1901 vi 164 and may reasonably conjecture that a somewhat illegible date affixed to the fourth canto stands for february 14 1823 the ms had been received in london before april 9 ibid p 192 and on june 26 1823 the island or the adventures of christian and his comrades was published by john hunt  byrons advertisement or note prefixed to the island contains all that need be said with regard to the sources of the poem  two separate works were consulted 1 a narrative of the mutiny on board his majestys ship bounty and the subsequent voyage of  the ships boat from tafoa one of the friendly islands to timor a dutch settlement in the east indies written by lieutenant william bligh 1790 and 2 an account of the natives of the tonga islands compiled and arranged from the extensive communications of mr william mariner by john martin md 1817  according to george clinton life and writings of lord byron 1824 p 656 byron was profoundly impressed by mariners report of the scenery and folklore of the friendly islands was never tired of talking of it to his friends and in order to turn this poetic material to account finally bethought him that blighs narrative of the mutiny of the bounty would serve as a framework or structure for an embroidery of rare devicethe figures and foliage of a tropical pattern that at least is the substance of clintons analysis of the sources of the island and whether he spoke or only feigned to speak with authority his criticism is sound and to the point the story of the mutiny of the bounty which is faithfully related in the first canto is not as the second title implies a prelude to the adventures of christian and his comrades but to a description of the island an ogygia of the south seas  it must be borne in mind that byrons acquaintance with the details of the mutiny of the bounty was derived exclusively from blighs narrative that he does not seem to have studied the minutes of the courtmartial on peter heywood and the other prisoners september 1792 or to have possessed the information that in 1809 and again in 1815 the admiralty received authentic information with regard to the final settlement of christian and his comrades on pitcairn island articles however had appeared in the quarterly review february 1810 vol iii pp 23 24 and july 1815 vol xiii pp 376378 which contained an extract from the logbook of captain mayhew folger of the american ship topaz dated september 29 1808 and letters from folger march 1 1813 and sir thomas staines october 18 1814 which solved the mystery moreover the article of february 1810 is quoted in the notes pp 313318 affixed to miss mitfords christina the maid of the south seas 1811 a poem founded on blighs narrative of which neither byron or his reviewers seem to have heard  but whatever may have been his opportunities of ascertaining the facts of the case it is certain see his note to canto iv section vi line 122 that he did not know what became of christian and that whereas in the first canto he follows the text of blighs narrative in the three last cantos he draws upon his imagination turning tahiti into toobonai tubuai and transporting toobonai from one archipelago to anotherfrom the society to the friendly islands  another and still more surprising feature of the island is that byron accepts without qualification or reserve the guilt of the mutineers and the innocence and worth of lieutenant bligh it is true that by inheritance he was imbued with the traditions of the service and from personal experience understood the necessity of discipline on board ship but it may be taken for granted that if he had known that the sympathy if not the esteem of the public had been transferred from bligh to christian that in the opinion of grave and competent writers the guilt of mutiny on the high seas had been almost condoned by the violence and brutality of the commanding officer he would have sided with the oppressed rather than the oppressor as it is he takes bligh at his own valuation and carefully abstains from eulogizing mutiny letter to l hunt january 25 1823  the story of the mutiny of the bounty happened in this wise in 1787 it occurred to certain west india planters and merchants resident in london that it would benefit the natives and perhaps themselves if the breadfruit tree which flourished in tahiti the otaheite of captain cook and sir joseph banks see poetical works 1899 ii 7 note 2 and other islands of the south seas could be acclimatized in the west indies a petition was addressed to the king with the result that a vessel with a burden of 215 tons which banks christened the bounty sailed from spithead december 23 1787 lieutenant william bligh who had sailed with cook in the resolution acted as commanding officer and under him were five midshipmen a master two masters mates etcfortyfour persons all told the bounty arrived at tahiti october 26 1788 and there for six delightful months the ships company tarried fleeting the time carelessly as in the elder world but scripture saith an ending to all fine things must be and on april 4 1789 the bounty with a cargo of over a thousand breadfruit trees planted in pots tubs and boxes see for plate of the pots etc a voyage etc 1792 p 1 sailed away westward for the cape of good hope and the west indies all went well at first but just before sunrising on tuesday april 28 1789 the northwesternmost of the friendly islands called tofoa bearing northeast fletcher christian who was mate of the watch assisted by charles churchill masteratarms alexander smith the john adams of pitcairn island and thomas burkitt able seamen seized the captain tied his hands behind his back hauled him out of his berth and forced him on deck the boatswain william cole was ordered to hoist out the ships launch which measured twentythree feet from stem to stern and into this open boat bligh together with eighteen of the crew who were or were supposed to be on his side were thrust on pain of instant death when they were in the boat they were veered round with a rope and finally cast adrift bligh and his eighteen innocent companions sailed westward and after a voyage of twelve hundred leagues during which they were preserved from death and destruction by the wise ordering and patient heroism of the commander safely anchored in kœpang bay on the northwest coast of the isle of timor june 14 1789 see blighs narrative etc 1790 pp 1188 and the island canto i section ix lines 169201  the bounty with the remainder of the crew twentyfive in number the most able of the ships company sailed eastward first to toobooai or tubuai an island to the south of the society islands thence to tahiti june 6 back to tubuai june 26 and yet again to tahiti september 20 where sixteen of the mutineers including the midshipman george stewart the torquil of the island were put on shore finally september 21 1789 fletcher christian with the bounty and eight of her crew six tahitian men and twelve women sailed away still further east to unknown shores and so it was believed disappeared for good and all long afterwards it was known that they had landed on pitcairn island broken up the bounty and founded a permanent settlement  when bligh returned to england march 14 1790 and acquainted the government with the atrocious act of piracy and mutiny which had been committed on the high seas the pandora frigate with captain edwards was despatched to apprehend the mutineers and bring them back to england for trial and punishment the pandora reached tahiti march 23 1791 set sail with fourteen prisoners may 8 and was wrecked on the great barrier reef northeast of queensland august 29 1791 four of the prisoners including george stewart who had been manacled and were confined in pandoras box perished in the wreck and the remaining ten were brought back to england and tried by courtmartial see the eventful history of the mutiny etc by sir john barrow 1831 pp 205244  the story which runs through the second third and fourth cantos may possibly owe some of its details to a vague recollection of incidents which happened or were supposed to happen at tahiti in the interval between the final departure of the bounty september 21 1789 and the arrival of the pandora march 23 1791 but as a whole it is a work of fiction  with the exception of the fifteenth and sixteenth cantos of don juan the island was the last poem of any importance which byron lived to write and the question naturally suggests itselfis the new song as good as the old byron answers the question himself he tells leigh hunt january 25 1823 that he hopes the poem will be a little above the ordinary run of periodical poesy and that though portions of the toobonai sic islanders are pamby he intends to scatter some uncommon places here and there nevertheless on the whole in point of conception and execution the island is weaker and less coherent than the corsair but it contains lines and passages eg canto i lines 107124 133140 canto ii lines 272297 canto iv lines 94188 which display a finer feeling and a more exalted wit than the purple patches of the turkish tales  the poetic faculty is somewhat exhausted but the poetic vision has been purged and heightened by suffering and selfknowledge  the island was reviewed in the monthly review july 1823 es vol 101

   they steered to take their latest view of land     and yield as victims or die sword in hand     dismissed the natives and their shallop who     would still have battled for that scanty crew

resolution 177275 as sailingmaster and in 1782 fought under lord howe at gibraltar he married a daughter of william betham first collector of customs in the isle of man and hence his connection with fletcher christian who belonged to a manx family and the midshipman peter hayward who was the son of a deemster he was appointed to the bounty in december 1787 and in 1791 to the providence which was despatched to the society islands to obtain a fresh cargo of breadfruit trees in place of those which were thrown overboard by the mutineers he commanded the glatton at copenhagen may 21 1801 and on that and other occasions served with distinction he was made governor of new south wales in 1805 but was forcibly deposed in an insurrection headed by major johnston january 1808 he was kept in prison till 1810 but on his return to england his administration of his office was approved and johnston was cashiered he was advanced to the rank of viceadmiral of the blue in 1814 and died december 7 1817  in his narrative bligh describes the mutiny as a closeplanned act of villainy and attributes the conspiracy not to his own harshness or to disloyalty provoked by real or imaginary grievances but to the contrast of life on board ship in ever climbing up the climbing wave with the unearned luxuries of tahiti the allurements of dissipation  the female connections which the sailors had left behind besides his own apology there are the sworn statements of the two midshipmen hayward and hallet and others which bligh published in answer to a pamphlet which edward christian afterwards chief justice of ely wrote in defence of his brother fletcher the evidence against bligh is contained in the ms journal of the boatswains mate james morrison which was saved as by a miracle from the wreck of the pandora and is quoted by sir john barrow lady belcher and other authorities there is too the testimony of john adams alexander smith as recorded by captain beachey and as additional proof of indifference and tyrannical behaviour there are blighs own letters to peter haywards mother and uncle march 26 april 2 1790 and w c wentworths account of his administration as governor of new south wales see a statistical description etc 1819 p 166 it cannot be gainsaid that bligh was a man of integrity and worth and that he was upheld and esteemed by the admiralty morrisons journal though in parts corroborated by blighs ms journal is not altogether convincing and the testimony of john adams in his old age counts for little but according to his own supporters he damned his men though not the officers and his own narrative as well as morrisons journal proves that he was suspicious and that he underrated and misunderstood the character and worth of his subordinates he was responsible for the prolonged sojourn at tahiti and he should have remembered that time and distance are powerful solvents and that between portsmouth hard and the untracked waters of the pacific all arcadia had intervened he was a man of imperfect sympathies wanting in tact and fineness but in the hour of need he behaved like a hero and saved himself and others by submission to duty and strenuous selfcontrol

brought all this on himself bligh seems to have flattered himself that in the act of mutiny christian was seized with remorse but it is clear that the wish was father to the thought moreover on being

9 bligh described him as aged 24 years five feet nine inches high blackish or very dark brown complexioned dark brown hair strong made star tatowed on the left breast etc according to morrisons journal high words had passed between bligh and christian on more than one occasion and on the day before the mutiny a question having arisen with regard to the disappearance of some cocoanuts christian was crossexamined by the captain as to his share of the plunder i really do not know sir he replied but i hope you do not think me so mean as to be guilty of stealing yours yes said bligh you  hound i do think so or you could have given a better account of them it was after this offensive accusation that christian determined in the first instance to quit the ship and on the morning of april 28 1788 finding the mate of the watch asleep on the spur of the moment resolved to lay violent hands on the captain and assume the command of the bounty the language attributed to bligh reads like a translation into the vernacular but if christian kept his designs to himself it is strange that they were immediately understood and acted upon by a body of impromptu conspirators testimony whether written or spoken with regard to the succession of events in moments like to these is worth very little but it is pretty evident that christian was a gentleman and that blighs violent and unmannerly ratings were the immediate cause of the mutiny  contradictory accounts are given of christians death it is generally believed that in the fourth year of the settlement on pitcairn island

inquiry at the time as well as in his account of it to me that they lived under christians government several years after they landed that during the whole time they enjoyed tolerable harmony that christian became sick and died a natural death it stands to reason that the expirate alexander smith who had developed into john adams the pious founder of a patriarchal colony would be anxious to

chapter of mariners account of the tonga islands 1817 i 267279 i have taken the poetical liberty to transplant it to toobonai the last island where any distinct account is left of christian and his comrades  the following is the account given by mariner on this island hoonga there is a peculiar cavern which was first discovered by a young chief whilst diving after a turtle the nature of this cavern will be better understood if we imagine a hollow rock rising sixty feet or more above the surface of the water into the cavity of which there is no known entrance but one and that is on the side of the rock as low down as six feet under the water into which it flows and consequently the base of the cavern may be said to be the sea itself mariner seeing some young chiefs diving into the water one after another and not rise again he inquired of the last  what they were about follow me said he and i will take you where you have never been before mariner prepared to follow his companion and guided by the light reflected from his heels entered the opening in the rock and rose into the cavern the light was sufficient after remaining about five minutes to show objects with some little distinctness  nevertheless as it was desirable to have a stronger light mariner dived out again and priming his pistol tied plenty of gnatoo tight round it and wrapped the whole up in a plantainleaf he directed an attendant to bring a torch in the same way thus prepared he reentered the cavern unwrapped the gnatoo fired it by the flash of the powder and lighted the torch the place was now illuminated tolerably well it appeared by guess to be about forty feet wide in the main part but it branched off on one side in two narrower portions the medium height seemed also about forty feet the roof was hung with stalactites in a very curious way resembling upon a cursory view the gothic arches and ornaments of an old church according to one of the matabooles present the entire family of a certain chief had in former times been condemned to death for conspiring against a rival tyrantthe chief to be taken out to sea and drowned the rest of the family to be massacred one of the chiefs daughters was a beautiful girl to whom the youth who discovered the cave was attached he had long been enamoured of this young maiden but had never dared to make her acquainted with the soft emotions of his heart knowing that she was betrothed to a chief of higher rank and greater power but now  no time was to be lost he flew to her abode  declared himself her deliverer if she would trust to his honour soon her consenting hand was clasped in his the shades of evening favoured their escape  till her lover had brought a small canoe to a lonely part of the beach in this they speedily embarked they soon arrived at the rock he leaped into the water and she instructed by him followed close after they rose into the cavern and rested from their fatigue partaking of some refreshments which he had brought there for himself here she remained visited from time to time by her more fortunate leander until he was enabled to carry her off to the fiji islands where they dwelt till the death of the tyrant when they returned to vavaoo and lived long in peace and happiness  404 631 this may seem too minute for the general outline in mariners account from which it is taken but few men have
