of grace 1758 there were two families living on that island which we of today call mount desert but champlain named mons deserts because its thirteen high rugged mountains could be seen from the seaward a distance of twenty leagues making it the first landmark of the coast for seamen  it is said by those gentlemen who write down historical facts for us young people to study that the savages were much attached to the island for in the mountains they hunted bears wildcats raccoons foxes and fowls in the marshes and natural meadows beaver otter and musquash and in the waters they took fin and shellfish  now in the proper kind of a story there should be nothing which savors of schoolbook study and yet before telling how the children of these two families defended the island in 1758 it seems much as if the reader would have a better idea of all that was done if he or she knew just a few facts concerning those who lived on mount desert before stephen pemberton and silas harding took there their wives and children to build for themselves homes  it is said by those who busy themselves with finding out about such things that in the year 1605 champlain stopped at the island and named it but not until four years later did any white people visit the place then two jesuit missionaries who had been living at port royal under the protection of monsieur biencourt went to mount desert with the hope of converting the indians to christianity  how long these good men lived there no one seems to know but it is certain that they went back to port royal quite soon because in the year 1613 a frenchman by the name of la suassaye the agent of madame de guercheville a very rich and religious lady visited port royal and persuaded the missionaries to return to mount desert in company with several french colonists  an englishman by the name of argall who had come across the ocean to drive away the french people from north america in order to take possession of the country in the name of his king found the settlers while they were yet living in tents not having had time to build houses he robbed them of all their goods afterward sending them adrift in an open boat to make certain they wouldnt encroach on the land to which he believed they had no claim  the french people after suffering severely contrived to gain the mainland however and before many months had passed returned to mount desert where they formed a settlement which did not survive the encroachments of the indians as is known from the fact that when in 1704 the great indian fighter from massachusetts major benjamin church rendezvoused at mount desert before attacking the baron de castine on penobscot bay he found no person living there  in 1746 stephen pemberton and silas harding with their wives who were sisters and their children emigrated from england to acadia in nova scotia hoping there to make better homes for themselves and their little ones than could be had in their native land then came the quarrels between the french and english until acadia was not a very pleasant land in which to live and these two settlers determined to find an abidingplace where they might not be literally overrun by the soldiers of two armies  therefore it was that they built a small vessel in which they could carry all their household belongings including two cows three or four pigs and a flock of chickens and started on a voyage that did not come to an end until they were arrived at the island of mount desert near the mouth of what is now known as duck brook within a short distance of the present town of bar harbor  there the men built two small houses of logs enclosed by a palisade which is a high fence formed by driving stakes into the ground for protection against the indians whom they had every reason to fear  here the two families lived in peace and comparative comfort until the year 1758 and then there were children in plenty  stephen pemberton had in his family mark who was fifteen years old luke two years younger mary aged eleven and john a stout lad of eight years  silas hardings children were susan who was fourteen years old mary four years younger and james who had lived seven years on mount desert without having seen ten white people save those belonging to his own and uncle stephen pembertons family  now after so many words which have not been strung together in a very entertaining fashion it is time to begin the story of what was done by these children with as a matter of course some assistance from their mothers  each summer just before the work of harvesting should be begun the two men went out in the boat which had brought them from acadia to catch fish enough for the winters supply and on this year they set off early in september with never a thought that any danger might menace their dear ones after so many years of peace and comparative prosperity  the children had work in plenty to keep them from idleness during the week of ten days their fathers might be absent and no sooner had the little vessel sailed out of the harbor than they set about their several tasks in order that all the labor might be performed by the time the fishermen returned  mark and luke were engaged in setting up the flakes or framework on which the fish were to be dried and this labor was performed near the shore of the harbor quite beyond sight of the homesteads with the high palisade which last hid from view all save the roofs of the buildings  the future hopes which was the name of the small vessel belonging to the settlers had left her moorings when the first gray light of the coming day could be seen stealing over the waters and while she was yet close inshore the two lads set about building the flakes counting on completing the task within three days and to that end working so industriously as to give little or no heed to what might be passing around them  therefore it was that they failed to see a canoe in which were five indians come swiftly up from the southward past what is now known as pulpit rock and sail straight for the island at the mouth of the harbor which the people of today call bar island  here the frail craft was hidden from view of the boys and when half an hour or more had gone by another canoe this one carrying six men executed the same maneuver  five minutes later a third craft appeared but just as she came in view past the rock luke stood erect to drive in one of the stakes and therefore saw the strangers as they were evidently trying to steal by without being seen  more than once since luke could remember had mount desert been visited by red men of the abenakis tribe but the visitors had always approached boldly like friends and this skulking from rock to island seemed much like a show of enmity  certain it is that the lad was alarmed but he understood from what his father had said many times that it was not wise to let the indians know of his fear and continuing at the labor he said in a low tone to mark  dont raise your head nor look around a canoe filled with abenakis has sneaked in behind the harbor island can it be mischief is intended  they may be after rockcod and count on coming ashore later mark replied continuing his work in such a fashion that he could look seaward without seeming to do so  at this moment the occupants of the last canoe were moving around the point of the island as if to gain a position where a full view of the buildings might be had for there could be no possibility the visitors were engaged in fishing of any other such peaceful pursuit  theres trouble of some kind and its for us to find out what mark said in a whisper there must have been other canoes than the one you saw for i have already counted eleven men on the island and they could not all have come in a single boat  the boys had had no experience fortunately for them in indian warfare but they had heard enough from their parents to be fully alive to the possibilities and after a few moments during which time fear had held them speechless mark said in a low tone although there was no chance the enemy could have heard him  we must get over to the house without seeming to be running away you start first and when you go through the gate call out that mother wants to see me  luke obeyed leisurely although his heart was beating so loudly and heavily that it seemed as if it could be heard a long distance away and arriving at the palisade he summoned his brother as had been proposed  then it was that mark was at liberty to leave his work and he answered the summons more quickly perhaps than ever before in his life  mistress pemberton was busily engaged inside the house and the other two children were in a small garden directly in the rear of the building therefore the boys were able to impart the disagreeable tidings without alarming those who could be of little or no assistance  indians skulking on the harbor island the good woman exclaimed when mark had hurriedly told his story and her face paled as the lads had never seen it before  and they have chanced to come on the very day our father went fishing luke cried  it wasnt chance that brought them my son unless coming for some evil purpose they would have landed boldly as they have done so many times it must be that the painted wretches have been watching to learn when your father and uncle left the island ask your aunt and susan to come over her the other children need not be told until it is no longer possible to hold them in ignorance of what may be done  luke ran swiftly to the house which stood hardly more than fifty feet away and in a twinkling mistress harding and her daughter susan were where they could hear what to settlers in their situation was the worst possible news  illustration indians skulking on the harbor island  women who did their share in conquering the wilderness were not cowardly even though they might turn pale with apprehension when the first note of danger was sounded and there two knowing it was useless to expect aid from the outside lost no time in planning a defence  the palisade was weak in many places more than one of the timbers had decayed and fallen for while the indians from the nearby mainland were friendly disposed there seemed to be no good reason why time and labor should be expended upon a means of defence which might never be needed and at this moment both the women bethought themselves of such fact  there may be time in which to strengthen the fence mistress harding suggested and mark who considered himself as wellnigh being a man grown took the part of leader by saying stoutly  in can be done aunt luke and i will get the timbers and the other children shall drag them out of the woods coming into the enclosure near the spring where the indians cannot see them  but surely we can do something to help the work along his mother said quickly  so you shall we must know what the indians are about and you two can take one of the small boys down near the shore stay there as if bent on pleasuring and without seeming to do so keep a sharp watch on the harbor island i will look after the rest  boys who lived on the frontier in 1758 were accustomed to doing the work of men and very seldom was one found to be a coward  now that danger in its most frightful form menaced mark pemberton understood that he must stand in the place of his father and uncle and there was no disposition on his part to shirk the responsibility he knew full well that there was no hope the fishermen would return for at least a full week therefore he must work unaided save as the women and other children might be able to help him  the axes were near at hand mary pemberton and ellen harding were summoned from the garden and the two younger boys sent with their mothers to the shore  as the five young people went into the thicket which had been left standing in the rear of the dwellings that it might serve to break the force of the north winds in the winter the younger girls learned of the painted peril on the harbor island and mark explained his plan of defence so far as he had formed one  the two boys set about their task feverishly knowing that every moment was precious for no one could say when the attack might be made the only matter certain in the minds of all was that the indians had come bent on mischief otherwise there would have been no skulking on the island  the palisade as originally built stood six feet above the surface of the land and the posts were driven a good four feet into the ground therefore large timbers were necessary and perhaps mark was the only member of the party who realized that when the work of driving the logs in place was begun the enemy would have a very good idea of what was being done  the skulkers on the island must as a matter of course know that they were discovered and their purpose suspected otherwise the defences would not be in process of strengthening when the boys should have been making ready for the curing of such fish as the fishermen might bring in  then was the moment when possibly the attack would be made and all preparations for resistance concluded before the first blow was struck on the palisade  there will be a moon tonight susan harding said quietly and mark knew she was thinking of what might be expected after the sun had set therefore he replied to encourage her  ay sue the painted villains cant come across without showing themselves for some time before gaining the beach and luke and i should be able to warm their hides a bit  i can shoot as well as you  so you can sue and the worst part of it is that you must do your share of the work  will you watch on the shore for them tonight  i think so luke and i can be there while the rest of you are inside  i shall go with you and the girl spoke as if demanding a part in some scheme of pleasure  perhaps you can well see what the plan shall be when night comes the fence may not be in shape then and im hoping the indians will hold off for a darker night thats about the only chance weve got to save ourselves from being killed or carried prisoners to canada  if they had landed on this island they might have crept up without our suspecting anything susan suggested and mark literally trembled with fear for thought came to his mind that possibly another body of savages was on mount desert counting on coming up through the thicket when the attack was begun  however as he said to himself a moment later after struggling manfully against this new fear which assailed him that was a matter which could not be guarded against other than as the general defences were strengthened and it stood him in hand to think of work rather than all which might happen  remember im to take my place with you and luke susan insisted and the lad knowing she could be depended upon to use a musket nearly as well as himself replied  so you shall sue i promise to call on you as i would on luke here is the first timber he added as he struck the finishing blows to the sharpened end of the log drag it inside to the weakest place in the fence and take good care that you dont go where any one on the harbor island can see you  aided by mary and ellen the stouthearted girl set about the task of carrying the heavy log since that would be the quickest method of getting it into place and the boys plied their axes yet more vigorously in order to have another timber in readiness when the carriers returned  illustration the stouthearted girl set about the task  take nothing smaller than six inches through the butt and well drive the tapering end into the ground mark cried cheerily as he selected a second tree and luke had but just finished hewing his log when the girls came for another load  i ran down to talk with mother and aunt susan said speaking with difficulty because of her heavy breathing they have seen only one indian who lies behind the big rock keeping watch and he is sewattis who came here for potatoes last winter  and we gave him all he could carry away mark exclaimed bitterly now he has come to try and murder us because we have ever been his good friends  is there any war on the mainland susan asked  the captain of the last fishingvessel father boarded told him that an attack had been made by the french and indians on the fort at st george last month so i suppose england and france are still fighting if the two kings could be in our places just now i reckon thered be an end of the war before nightfall  it isnt three months since master peabody and his wife were killed on arrowsick island and the six children carried into canada luke suggested grimly and mark cried peremptorily  dont be digging up every horrible thing you can remember for it wont improve our courage and were like to need all weve got between now and sunset heres another timber sue before you come back again get some idea of how many were needing to put the fence in shape  luke would have talked of the murders which had been reported to the settlers of the island by the fishermen who were spoken from time to time but mark bade him keep at his chopping and in silence the two worked until susan after an unusually long absence returned  there are seventeen logs missing she reported and two more which are decayed so badly that they should be replaced i walked slowly around the fence and tried every one to make certain it stood firm  we should be able to cut that number and get them in place before the afternoon is very old mark replied as he swung his axe yet more vigorously did you go down to the shore  yes and everything there is as it was before your mother thinks it is a wicked waste of time for both to stay on guard when it would be possible for them to do so much toward helping in getting out the timbers  the moment will soon come when she can lend a hand but just now she is doing more good by staying where she is for while those two are idle the indians will not suspect that we are strengthening our defences the other boys might help in dragging the logs down sue for weve got five or six ready  mary and i with ellen to steady them through the bushes can soon catch up with you and the boys would be more bother than good susan replied as she raised one end of a heavy timber  during the next hour the five young people worked as industriously as their elders could have done and then susan announced that her mother was intending to make ready the noonday meal for it was in the highest degree necessary that those who were laboring so energetically and who would be called upon perhaps to spend the night in watching should have an ample supply of food  the boys ate dinner as they worked ellen bringing it out to them and while mistress harding cooked for both families mistress pemberton remained on guard  during all that time very little had been learned regarding the savages now and then a painted face had been seen momentarily from behind one of the rocks on the harbor island but nothing more and the defenders of the stockade had no means of knowing when the attack might be expected  it was about two hours past noon when the boys had cut the necessary number of timbers and now was come the time when the enemy would get an inkling that the settlers were making ready to defend themselves  you cant help us very much sue when we are driving the posts into place mark said leave ellen here while you overhaul our muskets see to it that each one is loaded and where we can get at it readily after that has been done you had best stand by the gateway to give the work if any move is made by the villains  then the boys began the task of setting the timbers in place fearing each instant to hear the word that the savages were crossing over from the small island  when the third timber had been driven in place mark said grimly as he raised another stick to fit it into the palisade  if they come now we shall be in a bad scrape but in case they are foolish enough to wait until after dark i reckon we can give a good account of ourselves  in order to drive the logs sufficiently deep into the earth to prevent the possibility of their being pulled out by the foe it was necessary  for one of the boys to stand on an upended cask and while in suck position a view of the tiny island at the mouth of the harbor could readily be had  it was mark who swung the heavy wooden maul or mallet and he strove to keep his eyes fixed upon that point of land behind which he knew the indians lurked  to his great relief no change was apparent in the position of the enemy although those in hiding must have known what was being done and the boys worked unmolested  after she had make ready the muskets for immediate use susan stationed herself at the gateway of the palisade with a weapon leaning against the logs on the inside watching intently and after half an hour had passed mark called to her  theres little chance now that theyll begin the mischief before dark if the noise of our pounding hasnt started them mother and aunt may come back here and do some more cooking for once the abenakis begin work we shall need to have all hands on duty you can keep an eye on the island from where you are  illustration susan stood guard at the gateway  this change was welcomed by the women who came up from the shore quickly stopping at the palisade to see how the lads were getting along when mistress pemberton said to mark  i have been thinking that we had better gather in one of the buildings which can be barricaded on the inside instead of trying to occupy both  its a good idea mother dear and while youre making the changes see to it that we have plenty of water in the house  what about the cows  we cant take the chances of going after them for no one can say that there are not more indians hidden in the woods if the beasts come home well have a mess of milk to help out on the supplies  now it was that every member of the two families was actively engaged while susan stood guard at the gateway  the harding house was stripped of everything which could be readily moved and the rude furniture served admirably as a barricade for the windows and one door of the pemberton dwelling  the sun had not set when mark had put the palisade into the best condition possible with the materials at his command and then after cautioning susan to keep her eyes open very wide the two boys began making loopholes in the house which was to shelter both families this last was being done as mark explained to his mother that they might have a final place of refuge in case the indians succeeded in scaling the palisade     chapter ii  the first assault   not until the shadows of night were beginning to lengthen was susan relieved from guard duty and then the gate had been closed and barred by mark who said to his cousin  there is little chance an attack will be made until after night has come when they count on finding us asleep mayhap although it would be queer people who could close their eyes in rest while a crowd of men was waiting for a good opportunity to kill them  why am i to go off duty susan asked surely it can do us no harm to stand guard and even though the savages do not make any move we should act as if believing they might do so at any moment  you are right sue and i warrant you wont have many idle minutes your mother and mine want all the children together while they pray for the good god to help us and surely he is the only one to whom we can appeal now  the girl made no further parley but marched directly toward the pemberton house stopping very suddenly however as a low sound not unlike the call of a human being was heard from the woods in the rear of the dwellings  there are the cows mark and surely they must be brought inside the enclosure if for no other reason than that we may need the milk before those murderers  susan did not finish the sentence for the thought had come that it was not unlikely those who were skulking on the harbor island might succeed in their purpose as they had done so many times before when setting forth to capture and to murder  ill go after the beasts and you shall stand here to keep watch over the harbor for i am not minded to take the chances of being surprised ever though we have good reason to believe no mischief will be attempted until late in the night  to this susan would not agree she insisted that having been charged with the care of the cows during so many years they would follow her more readily than any other and it might be possible something would happen to frighten them  mark who feared there were indians hidden in the thicket would have prevented her from venturing out of the stockade but she put an end to the controversy by slipping through the gate immediately he had opened it and the lad could do no less than remain on guard while she was absent  the animals followed the girl contentedly when she appeared before them even though they were not accustomed to being brought within the enclosure during the warm season and as they filed through the gate mark felt decidedly more comfortable in mind for now in case they were able to hold the indians in check there was no possibility of a lack of food if the siege should be prolonged  with the cows in the shed that served as stable during the winter months where was a plentiful supply of hay which had been made during the summer the children went into the house which seemed strangely changed by the addition of mistress hardings belongings and preparations already made for defence  nearly all the rude furniture was piled against the two windows and one of the doors and the beds had been spread on the floor where they would best be screened from any stray bullets a supply of fuel was stacked up near the fireplace to the end that it might be possible to prepare food without necessity of going out of doors and as mark had suggested every available vessel was filled with water  when the three children who had been doing such valiant work in strengthening the defences entered the building they found the women and smaller children gathered close beside each other as if such near companionship lessened the danger and mark said gently  it is not well that we stay indoors many minutes mother dear for much remains to be done before night has fully come  then it was and without delay that mistress pemberton knelt amid the frightened brood pouring forth her supplications for strength and guidance in this their time of peril and the children listened to the petition as they had never done before it was as if the prayer had a different meaning than ever before for unless it should be answered then was the time of suffering or of death come very near  even the youngest children understood that this was the only appeal for help which could be made and never a question was asked or a word spoken when mark luke and susan rising to their feet immediately the petition had been brought to a close went outofdoors muskets in hand  when they were in the open air once more mark proposed that they make such platforms behind the palisade as was practical with the limited amount of material at hand in order that in event of an attack it would be possible to use their weapons with good effect to prevent the enemy from scaling the barricade  two upended casks formed as many stations while at other points the washbenches tubs horses for woodsawing and household utensils were piled up or pushed unto position at such height as would afford a view of the harbor island and the intervening space  when this work had been completed the children had eight improvised platforms whereon they could stand while defending the stockade and the night was fully come  illustration the children had improvised platforms  as susan had said the moon was in the third quarter therefore it would be impossible for the indians to paddle across the waters of the harbor without exposing themselves to the view of the island defenders  it was a portion of marks plan that a guard should be stationed on the shore in full sight of those who might approach and in event of an advance the battle would be begun while the enemy was in the canoes  this much he explained to his companions as they stood by the gate ready to face the more immediate danger to the end that their loved ones might the better be protected and he added in conclusion  after all weve seen it would be foolish to pretend we do not know why the abenakis have come therefore when they put out from the island i shall hail them once warning all hands to stay where they are until the sun has risen after which we will open fire trying to do the greatest possible amount of execution in order to show what may be expected ive got four of five charges of ammunition and if the rest of you have as much we shall be able to make quite a showing  at that moment the noise of someone moving across the enclosure startled the children but an instant later they saw that mistress harding was going toward the shed to milk the cows  now come on mark said opening the gate after learning the cause of his momentary alarm and the children went boldly forth to do battletwo boys and a girl who counted on defending the island against fifteen or twenty savages  it was not to e supposed that the indians seeing the sentinels would come directly across from the island but might be expected to dart swiftly toward one or the other headlands and therefore it was that mark divided his small force sending luke to patrol the northern point while he paced to and fro on the southern side of the harbor where it was more reasonable to suppose a landing would be attempted susan was to walk back and forth on the shore between the two lads  once this division of forces had been made the children began their vigil on the alert for any suspicious noises either behind or in front of them for there was yet a possibility that a force of indians was already secreted near the stockade  no sooner had he begun to pace his beat than mark realized to what danger the occupants of the dwelling were exposed in case the savages had already landed on mount desert for the gate of the palisade was unlocked and unguarded and then susan was sent back to warn her mother and aunt that the entrance must be secured  when she returned to the shore it was with the report that the gate was barred on the inside and mary pemberton standing close beside it in case the sentinels outside should be forced to beat a hasty retreat  now indeed had the lad done all within his power to protect those whom he considered were entrusted to his charge and it only remained to keep careful watch for the first show of mischief  and this came in a manner wholly unexpected although it seemed to the young leader as if he had taken into consideration every method which might be adopted by the savages  during three hours or more the children had paced to and fro on the shore each making certain meanwhile that the other two were on the alert and then mark saw a canoe put off from the harbor island heading toward pulpit rock as if to gain the shelter of that headland before coming to land  uttering a low cry to attract the attention of his companions he would have hurried on to the point in order to fire at least one shot before the indians could disembark but at that moment an exclamation from luke caused him to gaze across the harbor when he saw a second canoe setting out toward the northward  a moment later a third craft was paddled straight across the water in the direction of susans post of duty  it seemed certain that the abenakis understood how small and weak was the force opposed to them and therefore counted on bringing their bloody work to a speedy conclusion regardless of their ordinary methods of warfare  illustration mark saw a canoe put off from the harbor island  a landing would be made at three different places simultaneously and the young defenders must perforce give all their attention to one party leaving the others to do as they pleased or by attempting to guard every point place themselves in the greatest possible danger  make ready to run for the house when i give the word mark cried to his companions come this way sue and luke do the best you can at peppering the canoe in front of us  susan speedily joined her cousin on the southerly side of the harbor while luke stood his ground but with the disagreeable knowledge that in a few moments the savages would probably be creeping up behind him  now mark understood that he could not afford to spend many moments on this portion of the defence it was necessary the three should be inside the stockade before those who were landing at either point of the harbor could come up within range and he said to susan  we must get in our work quickly for i reckon these villains in front of us will take good care to move so slowly as to keep at a safe distance until the others are ready for work  for reply the girl raised her musket on the crutchlike rest which was used in those days took careful aim and pulled the trigger  it was possible to see the bullet as it struck the moonlit water hardly more than three paces in advance of the canoe with its freight of painted terrors and instantly the indians ceased paddling thus proving that they had no intention of coming within range until their comrades from the other craft were in position to prosecute their murderous work  there is little sense in our staying here mark said bitterly those scoundrels dont intend to give us any show at them and we are foolish if we remain yonder canoe put off boldly only to keep us occupied until the others could make a landing  are we to go back susan asked striving to prevent a tremor of fear from  being perceptible in her voice  ay it is high time you start on ahead and ill call luke  i shall walk by your side the girl said stoutly we will share the danger equally as you promised  you are a good girl sue just the kind that will do a full half of the work of defending the island and mark kissed her on the cheek more tenderly than he had ever done before as one would who was whispering a final goodbye  close in luke we must get back to the house theres no show of our being able to do anything here mark cried to his brother as he set the example by leading susan in the direction of the stockade  the canoe came forward more swiftly as the little party of children retreated but it could be seen that its occupants did not count on approaching within range and mark hastened his brothers movements by shouting  run for it lad we must be in position behind the fence when the brutes first come within view  then the three went toward the place of refuge at full speed and behind the gate having been warned by the report of her cousins musket mary pemberton stood ready to let down the heavy bar when the little party was near at hand  the retreat had been begun none too soon as was seen when the children came within the enclosure for while mark was replacing the bar which locked the gate his mother standing on one of the improvised platforms discharged a musket  what have you seen the lad cried as the gate having been fastened he ran toward that portion of the stockade where was his mother  an indian came out just beyond the dead tree over there  did you hit him  im afraid not mark i never could send a bullet straight and am now blaming myself for not having practiced more often after your father insisted that the time might come when i would need to handle a musket deftly  by this time mark stood by his mothers side peering cautiously out over the top of the palisade which was not a simple matter since he took the risk of presenting the enemy with a target  he could see nothing suspicious and was yet peering eagerly around when the report of a musket rang out on the other side of the stockade  it was susan who fired the shot at the same moment mark clambered up beside his mother the girl had taken her station on one of the casks at a point overlooking the thicket and the result showed that she had arrived there none too soon  did you see an indian luke asked as he mounted one of the washbenches near the gate  ay and hit him too susan replied grimly as she turned to recharge her weapon but mistress harding took the empty musket from her hands as she said  your aunt and i cannot shoot as well as you children but we may at least be of service in loading the guns  from this moment there was little delay in making the assault contrary to their custom the abenakis pressed forward immediately after the first shot was fired doubtless hoping to gain an advantage while the defenders were reloading the weapons and each of the three children fired two shots as rapidly as the muskets could be handed to them  three times had a piercing scream followed the report of the weapon thus telling that an equal number of bullets had hit the targets and then the savages became more cautious  until this moment the indians had not fired a shot but now the bullets began to whistle over the heads of those who were exposed to view as the abenakis themselves screened by the bushes began the real attack  be careful of yourselves mark cried forgetting to set his companions an example keep down behind the posts as much as possible we can count on their staying under cover  while doing so much shooting then turning to his mother he added there is no reason why all the children should be outofdoors where a stray bullet may find them why not order them into the house  this mistress pemberton did and when the younger members of the company were in comparative safety mark looked anxiously around at his army of two  luke was crouching behind the palisade where a wide crevice between two of the posts afforded him a view of the outside without his being obliged to expose himself and susan was leaning against the timbers only partially sheltered as she appeared to be tying something around her arm  what are you doing sue mark cried in alarm  standing guard here but just now i cant see anything that looks like an indian  what is the matter with your arm  its only a scratch the girl replied in a matteroffact tone it bleeds a little and ive wrapped a piece of my gown around it  youre wounded mark cried and he made as if to jump down from the platform when susan said sharply  stay where you are even though i was hurt badly which im not you have no right to leave the fence unguarded  mark stepped back with a certain sense of shame that it had been necessary for susan to remind him of his duty and then mistress harding went to her daughters side  it is a slight wound on the left arm the good woman said after insisting on an examination of the injury i will take her to the house while i tie it up properly and ellen may stand here in her place  but ellen cant use a musket as well as i and were needed here susan cried more concerned lest she be forced to leave her station at the palisade than on account of the wound  mistress harding might have insisted on her daughters going into the building if at that moment the assault had not been renewed and during the next ten minutes the defenders were actively employed  the indians profiting by the teachings and example of the frenchmen whose allies they were had divided the force a portion remaining hidden in the thicket to fire at the children while the remainder made a rush for the gate as if believing it might be forced open  now it was that the defenders were obliged to move quickly and it was impossible for them to remain under cover all the while  pour all the fire into those fellows who are coming up with the log mark cried as half a dozen abenakis carrying a heavy treetrunk to be used as a batteringram made ready to advance at full speed  this command was obeyed with such good effect that three of the savages fell and their fellows dropping the timber ran to cover with the greatest possible haste  at the same moment the children fired the indians in hiding discharged their weapons detonations being echoed and reëchoed from mountain to mountain until it sounded as if a severe engagement was in progress  any one hurt mark cried and susan and luke replied cheerily in the negative  one of the three indians wounded while advancing with the treetrunk succeeded in crawling off to the shelter of the underbrush but the other two remained where they had fallen  when two or three minutes later an abenakis darted out from his place of concealment mark raised his weapon quickly but susan cried warningly  dont fire it can do us no harm if they take away the wounded and its possible theyll go back to the harbor island if the injured can be carried off  im beginning to think it is you who should be in command here mark said half to himself as he lowered his weapon youve got more sound sense than luke and i together then raising his voice he cried loudly listen ye abenakis whom our fathers have fed when you were hungry and sheltered when you were cold but who would murder us now take away your wounded if you are minded to go back to the harbor island and no one shall harm you while so doing the white men of mount desert have never broken faith with you nor will we their children  then was done that which proves how much stranger than fiction is truth the abenakis although they had come there to kill or make prisoners the wives and children of those men who had ever been their friends did not question the faith of the lad when he announced that they might bear off the wounded in safety but boldly advanced within short range to the aid of their fellows  why do you seek to kill us who have never done you harm mark cried when four of the band stood in full view while lifting the wounded from the ground do indians kill their friends do they speak soft words only while the men of the family are at home being too cowardly to make an attack until the fathers have gone away  there was no reply to this speech until the indians were hidden once more by the bushes and then a voice cried  give us the cow and two boys then we will go away telling the frenchmen that all have been killed  you shall not have the smallest chicken inside this stockade mark cried angrily and i promise that there shall be few left to report to the cowardly frenchmen if you remain here very long you shall be shot down like dogs and from this out our squaws will not interfere to let you carry off those who have been crippled  while speaking mark had unconsciously raised himself to his full height instead of being partially sheltered by remaining in a crouching position as during the short fight and the reply to his words came in the form of bullets one of which grazed his cheek raising a red ridge as if he had been scored by a whiplash  susan and luke both fired in the direction from which had been seen the flash of the muskets but no one could say if the missiles thus sent at random took effect  five minutes later while the watchers still gazed through the crevices of the palisade believing the enemy to be near at hand a canoe was seen putting off from the shore directly in front of the dwellings and after such delay as was necessary in order to enable them to reach the other craft all three divisions of the attacking force were headed for the harbor island  illustration you shall not have the smallest chicken inside this stockade  the first assault had been made and successfully resisted it now remained to be seen whether the abenakis were willing to accept this as defeat of if new tactics were to be tried  theyve gone susan cried joyfully weve beaten them  yes child her mother said despondently and if they had not been sent by frenchmen we might believe the worst was over  do you think theyll come back mark the girl cried as she leaped down from her post of duty  ay that i do susan and for the very reason aunt has given if we could only know what the next move would be i have heard father say that once upon a time the english drove away from mount desert french settlers and now those who are stirring the indians up to this kind of business are trying to make things even we can count on having peace during the rest of the night i believe and the sooner you go into the house were that wound of yours can be looked after the better i shall be pleased  indeed there was no good reason why all the defenders save one to stand guard behind the palisade should not get such repose as might be had under the circumstances  a sentinel on one of the hastily constructed platforms could keep the harbor island well in view therefore the savages would not be able to leave it secretly and mark proposed that he remain on duty for a certain time while the others slept  you shall have my place in a couple of hours luke the lad said to his brother  and when do i take my turn susan asked showing that she was determined to do a full share in the defence regardless of her wound  you may stand guard when it is time for luke to lie down mark replied intending that she should not be awakened if he could prevent it     chapter iii  a day of suspense   while mark stood on guard able to see the entire broad expanse of water thanks to the light of the moon he knew that so long as a careful watch was kept the abenakis could not leave the harbor island secretly but he also realized that if the clouds should gather or a fog settle down over the waters then of a verity would they be at the mercy of a foe from whom no mercy could be expected  the fact that they had been able to resist the first assault did not give him encouragement for the future the indians had advanced foolishly understanding that the white people knew full well what they were about and after this first repulse it was reasonable to suppose the murderous scoundrels would bring all their cunning into play when the next attack was made  there were six muskets in the stockade and ammunition sufficient to last during an ordinary siege provided none was wasted yet but three personssusan luke and himselfcould be depended upon to man the walls the others would have served faithfully of that there was no question but none of them were so expert with a musket as to be counted on for any great execution  although the lad would not have admitted as much to either of his companions the fear in his heart that the enemy might succeed in accomplishing his purpose was very great  we can count on it that at the next attack they will succeed in getting inside the palisade he said unconsciously giving words to his thoughts and he started almost in alarm as a familiar voice behind him asked reproachfully  if you lose heart how can the rest of us be expected to show courage  what are you doing out here sue he asked in turn not minded to answer her question if it could be avoided  ive come to take lukes place he is sleeping so soundly that it is a pity to awaken him and the pain in my arm keeps my eyes open very wide  but i havent been here two hours yet  nearly half that time has passed since you came on duty and there is no reason why you should remain awake when its impossible for me to sleep i can keep a sharp watch  so you can sue but it is my place to take the biggest end and i dont fancy the idea of letting a woman do my work  if i could go to sleep it would be different but since i cant i shall stay here therefore you might as well take advantage of the opportunity  mark made no move toward leaving the platform from which he could have a full view of the harbor and seeing that he was not disposed to act upon her suggestion susan clambered up beside him  now tell me what you meant by saying that the next time they come the indians will get inside the fence  theres no sense in talking about that i didnt count on speaking aloud  you did however and now it will be treating me no more than fairly if you tell me exactly what is in your mind  mark had no desire to discuss the situation just then when it looked very dark to him and in order to avoid answering the question he proposed to take advantage of susans proposition  since you are determined to stay here i may as well get what sleep i can call luke when you are tired he said and before she could detain him he had slipped down from the improvised platform walking rapidly toward the dwelling  the girl could do guard duty as well as either of her cousins and was eager to perform a full share of the labor devolving upon those who were striving to hold the savages in check perhaps she magnified the pain of her wound in order to be allowed to take marks place and if such was the case the defence would be in no wise weakened through her  until the first faint light of a new day could be seen did susan harding stand on the narrow platform watching eagerly for any signs of life from the harbor island and unable to change her position save by taking two or three paces to the right or left even then she would have remained on duty longer but that mark came hurriedly out of the house crying angrily  it was not fair for you to stay on watch all night sue you the same as promised to call luke when you were tired  i didnt really agree and im not tired yet theres no need of your coming up here for now that it is daylight ellen can be trusted to keep a lookout over the island  when she has eaten her breakfast i will let her take my place mark replied as he literally forced the girl to descend and a few moments later all the occupants of the stockade were astir  the cows were milked but kept within the enclosure the young boys feeding and watering them the hens were allowed to stray here or there at will and save for the sentinels on the palisade one might have thought that the scene presented there represented perfect peace and happiness  when the morning meal had been prepared ellen harding took marks station on the stockade being enjoined by him to keep her eyes fixed constantly on the harbor island without heeding what might be happening around her as the little company gathered in the pemberton house where thanks were given for their preservation during the night  while breakfast was in progress no reference was made to the danger which menaced it seemed as if the women feared to alarm the younger children and the three to whom the defence of the island had been committed were not desirous of starting a conversation which might lead up to the possibilities of the future  susan was forced to submit to a second treatment of her wound as soon as the meal had had come to an end and mistress harding peremptorily insisted on her going to bed since she had not closed her eyes in slumber during the night just passed  mistress pemberton set about melting lead for bullets the store of missiles being smaller than that of powder and mark and luke went out to make a more thorough examination of the palisade  it isnt very likely that the abenakis will make any move during this day the elder lad said and while ellen is standing watch it would be wicked to lose any chance of making our position yet more secure  luke was ready to act upon his brothers suggestion but appeared to have no desire for conversation and mark did not urge him to talk for the same reason that had caused him to hold his peace during the breakfast hour  there was much that had been overlooked during the hurry and excitement of the previous day which could be done to strengthen the palisade as for example driving stakes at the foot of such posts as were not standing firmly and securing the tops of others with braces on the inside  in order to do a portion of this work it was necessary the lads should go into the thicket for material but while ellen remained on watch to give the alarm in case she saw any signs of life on the harbor island they did not hesitate to leave the stockade  it was while they were chopping down small trees in the rear of the dwellings that the flock of fourteen sheep came in sight and these mark decided to drive into the enclosure  it would be a serious blow to the settlers if these woolgrowers should be killed by the enemy for it might be a difficult task to replace them and without the fleeces each summer the children would be destitute of materials for clothing  by catching the leader of the flock and dragging him along by the horns the lads had little trouble in getting the animals within the stockade and mark announced his success by saying in a tone of mild triumph  the family is all behind one fence now and unless the abenakis get inside they cant do us a great deal of harm  but the sheep will pull heavily on our store of hay luke suggested and his brother replied cheerily  they can pick up a good bit around the place and it wont do any very great harm to let them go hungry now and then its better than taking good chances of losing the whole drove  there was no further discussion as to the advisability of bringing the sheep into the stockade for at that moment a cry from ellen caused both the boys to run with all speed to her side  look look a vessel it must be that fishermen are coming here and now the indians will be driven away  illustration look look a vessel  to their great surprise and delight the boys saw a small schooner coming as if from the mainland on the northward heading directly for the harbor island  were saved god be thanked mark cried in a tone so loud as to be heard by the inmates of the house all of whom came swiftly toward him to learn the cause of the fervent exclamation  what is it my son mistress pemberton asked sharply and luke shouted as he pointed seaward  a fishingvessel mother and those on board must soon know that the indians are besieging us  but she appears to be going directly to the harbor island the crew should be warned lest the abenakis make an attack upon them  this possibility had not entered marks mind but while his mother was yet speaking he darted out of the stockade running with all speed to the shore waving his arms and shouting to attract the attention of the newcomers  he was followed by the two families including susan who had been awakened by the joyful cries and the little party ran swiftly along the beach until they were come to the nearest point of the island which was the small bluff or incline on the westernmost end  here it was possible to have in view the schooners deck and that their signals had been seen seemed positive although no attention was taken of them  had you not better pull out in the small boat mistress pemberton asked of mark when the strangers failed to pay any heed to the gestures of warning it would be dreadful if the men went on shore and were murdered  there seemed to be no reason why the lads should not visit the vessel and in fact such an idea had entered marks mind before his mother spoke but yet he hesitated to act upon her suggestion although it would have been impossible for him to explain why he remained idle  the schooner carries a big crew for a fisherman susan said thoughtfully there must be as many as twentyfive or thirty on her deck  shes no fisherman mark cried becoming perplexed as he observed the truth of what susan had said so many people never could work on a craft of that size  but what else can she be luke asked curiously i dont know as it makes much difference to us though so long as she carries a crew of white people why dont we pull out to her mark look shes coming to anchor and if her crew lands without knowing of the abenakis they will all be killed  there are the indians susan cried as three canoes filled with savages were seen putting out from the shore  they are going to make an attack on the vessel and we can do nothing to help the poor people mistress pemberton cried in an agony of grief while an expression of terror overspread marks face as he began to have an inkling of the true situation  cant you boys do something to aid the men mistress harding asked and mark replied  it isnt likely theyre needing any help those on the vessel outnumber the abenakis three to one and im afraid they wont have any trouble in taking care of themselves  no one save susan gave any particular heed to marks words but watched with feverish interest as the canoes approached the vessel and then when the indians clambered aboard without any attempt being made to prevent them the expression of the face of the spectators changed from that of sympathy to perplexity  the abenakis seem to know the fishermen mistress pemberton said to herself and mark replied bitterly  ay mother that they do and now instead of being called upon to defend ourselves against indians only we shall have that crowd of frenchmen against us  god forbid that white people could attack women and children mistress harding cried fervently and mark added  he hasnt forbidden it so far aunt dont you remember what father and uncle heard from those aboard of the last vessel they spoke with they were told that when master peabody and his wife were murdered there were ten french soldiers with the indians  can it be that they have come to aid the savages against us and mistress hardings face grew pale  ay that is the way the french king fights us in this country and if we are murdered it will be because his agents have decided upon it in revenge for that which was done here so many years ago to the missionaries  and now while the little party of besieged stands on the shore facing this new and unexpected peril suppose we set down that which mr williamson wrote in his history of maine  a communication was received at boston in august 1758 from brigadiergeneral monkton stationed in nova scotia which stated that a body of frenchmen in conjunction with the indians of the rivers st john penobscot and probably passamaquoddy were meditating an attempt upon the fort at st georges and the destruction of all the settlements on the coast  immediately governor pownal collected such a military force as was at command and embarked with them on board the king george and the sloop massachusetts arriving he threw these auxiliaries with some warlike stores into the fort at a most fortunate juncture for within thirtysix hours after the departure the fort was actually assailed by a body of four hundred french and indians  but so well prepared was the garrison to receive them that they were unable to make the least impression nor did any representations of their numbers nor any threats communicated to the fort by a captive woman whom they purposely permitted to escape hither occasion the least alarm hence the besiegers gave vent to their resentiments and rage by killing the neighboring cattle about sixty of which they shot or butchered  it was well for the little families who were so sorely beset that they remained in ignorance of what the french assisted by the indians of several tribes were trying to do otherwise their despair would have been even greater than it was as they watched the reception of the abenakis by those on board the schooner  it will never be known whether this attack on mount desert was made in revenge for what had been done by argall to the french missionaries but certain it was that all the settlements on the coast large or small had been marked for destruction under the guise of legitimate warfare  during five minutes or more while the besieged watched the movements on the deck of the schooner until there was no longer any question but that the number of their enemies had been largely increased not a word was spoken and then mistress harding broke the painful stillness by exclaiming  there is nothing left us to do but submit with french soldiers at hand it is not probable the savages will be allowed to murder their prisoners and to surrender the island is better than being killed  the french have never done anything toward preventing the indians from working their will on the helpless captives do you remember the story father tells of falmouth when these same frenchmen pledged their words of honor that no blood should be spilled and yet many of those who surrendered were murdered in cold blood  but what other can we do save give ourselves up mistress harding cried helplessly and susan stepped proudly by the side of mark as he replied stoutly  we can fight to the last and die with muskets in our hands instead of going willingly to meet the scalpingknife or the tomahawk it may be that those on the mainland will learn what is being done here and come to our relief  do not put faith in such a possibility my son it is better to face the worst than build on hopes which must be dashed and mistress pemberton laid her hand on marks shoulder as if in pride because of the courage he displayed we will do battle against these people white and red and when our best has been done the end will be no worse than if we submitted tamely  thats the way to put it mark cried kissing his mothers hand we had planned to defend ourselves against the savages and now let us see what shall be done since they have had such a large reinforcement certain it is that we must not stand here for they may have muskets aboard the schooner which will carry a ball farther than ours  mistress pemberton led the way back to the stockade and there in the open air near the gateway where a close watch might be kept over both the island and the vessel she commended the little party to the care of him who watches over even the sparrows fall  it was to the distressed company as if the entire situation had been suddenly changed as if their means of defence were totally inadequate leaving them to the mercy of the french and indians who were making the attack simply because the king of england and the king of france had sundry differences of opinion which might be settled by spilling the blood of innocent people  susan who had been the most courageous seemed to have grown timorous when she asked while she and mark were where the words could not be overheard  what shall we do is there any hope we can hold back such a force as is being arrayed against us  it doesnt seem possible sue and yet we must fight to the last rather than give over our mothers and you girls to what we know will follow if we show the white feather  i am not afraid of your ever doing anything of that kind mark and the girl laid her hand on his shoulder with a loving gesture you will always be brave and true but what i am asking is whether we may do anything which as yet has not been tried  i exhausted all my ideas in arranging for a defence against the abenakis and now we must stand up like images fighting until we are destroyed anything is better than tame surrender when we know by the terrible experiences of others what will follow  in that i am of your mind mark dear but i am asking if there isnt something else which as yet we have neglected that can be done our mothers depend on you as do i which is only natural since you are the eldest and should of right take your fathers place  it is just that sue dear which causes me to be afraid of my own ideas if i make a mistake it may be fatal to you all for you will follow my advice  that is true mark and yet you should not be timid because of it for you are best fitted to act the part of leader and we know full well you will only do that which seems safest  are you agreed that we cannot surrender and mark asked the question in an angry tone as if expecting she would refuse to view the situation in the same light he did  of course i am could i say otherwise after all the stories we have heard from the mainland  then we must fight  of course and to the last i would rather see mother and the children killed by musketballs than to have them fall unharmed into the hands of those who await us there and she motioned toward the harbor island how long can we hold the stockade against such a force  four and twenty hours it may be and a much shorter time if you or luke or i should be killed early in the fight  and we will hope that our fathers do not come back until all is over  ay sue dear that is what we must hope unless we would have them come in time to meet their death two more men on the stockade would not greatly prolong the struggle and i fail to see how they without other aid could help us very much  if it should be mark dear that i am wounded again will you see to it that the indians do not take me prisoner  ay sue though the moment will be a terrible one when i turn my musket against you but it shall be done  and if you are left until the last you will see that the children are not taken alive  if i am left sue dear it shall be as the last of our families on the island for i believe death is more pleasant than can be life in the hands of such as those who are counting soon to hold us in their power  then the two children kissed each other as if in a last farewell and mark trying to assume a careless air said with a feeble attempt at a smile  since you were the last to awaken it is no more than fair you should be among the first on duty you luke and i will stand guard alone until the attack is made as we can count it will be this night and then our mothers must charge the muskets remember sue dear that i havent yet despaired of holding the whole wicked crew in check it doesnt seem possible that god would withhold his hand while we are being beaten  and yet it has been that many people in this country whose cause was as just as ours have been overcome by the same merciless foe who await us  ay sue and since we can only take what comes as stoutly as decent english people should well seem to be brave however timorous our hearts may become when the last moment is at hand  then these two children striving to fill the places of their parents began that vigil which both believed would be ended with their death  mark made the announcement to his mother and aunt after the gate had been shut and closely barred that they and the children should remain in the dwelling until the moment came when they could be of assistance in loading the weapons and in the meanwhile the task of guarding the stockade would devolve upon his brother cousin and himself  we are not so much worse off than before except that many more will come against us he said as the women and children went toward the pemberton house we shall fight until the last and if god is kind it may be we can hold the villains in check four and twenty hours if no more get what rest you can and remember that tears are of no avail when bullets are needed     chapter iv  an attack   when the women and smaller children were inside the dwelling mark said to his companions  it is better to have something in the way of work on hand than remain idle and it has come into my mind that we might improve our condition if we raised the top of the stockade so that we could stand on the platforms without being seen by those outside  how would you set about it luke asked with mild curiosity  a heavy timber might be made fast to the top of the palisade and by making loopholes between the upper ends of the logs we would be hidden from view and at the same time be able to keep watch  do you count that we should go after logs taking the chances that the enemy will make a landing right away  i intend to go alone while you and susan stand guard shout if you see a single boat putting off from the harbor island and then i can get inside the enclosure before the enemy will be able to paddle over here  mark did not wait to learn if his companions had any criticism to make on his proposition but set off in search of the axe without delay and the others had no choice but to mount guard  illustration he returned with a heavy log  when the lad went through the gate he directed that it be barred behind him lest there might be indians in the thicket and a few moments later it was possible to hear the sound of his sturdy blows as he felled the trees  in less than half an hour he returned with a heavy log that had been squared on one side and after having been given admittance he laid this on the posts above the platform on which susan was stationed by chopping either side of the uprights close to the top he made vshaped apertures of sufficient size to admit of a musketbarrel being thrust through thus forming five or six loopholes for the sentinel  therefore it was one could remain on the platform without being exposed to view of the enemy directly in front and such shelter would be of great value to the defenders while the attacking party was a short distance away  by means of wooden pins mark secured the log in place although not very firmly and the three children who were to defend the stockade believed their position had been decidedly strengthened by such a device  another hour was spent in felling trees fitting the timbers and putting them in place then mark occupied himself with making a careful examination of every portion of the palisade after which he said with a longdrawn sigh  i can think of nothing else that is likely to improve the defences and it only remains to wait until the enemy is ready to begin operations what has been done aboard the schooner  many of the men have gone ashore on the harbor island luke replied the sails are furled and everything snugged down as if for a long stay  have you seen the abenakis  two or three of them yet remain aboard the schooner but the larger number are on shore  then mark clambered up on one of the platforms straining his eyes to learn what the strangers were doing with the hope of being able to make some guess as to when another attack would be made but in this last he was unsuccessful the men were lounging on the vessel or ashore as if their only purpose was to pass the time pleasantly and utterly heedless as to whether they were seen by those inside the stockade  whoever is in command of the frenchmen will direct the next assault mark said sufficiently loud to be heard by his companions at their several posts of duty it is known that we count on defending ourselves and we may expect to see the entire force before us within the coming ten or twelve hours  what about the powder luke asked  we have none too much but enough i believe if we are careful in making every shot count to last us during two assaults after that if were alive therell be a short allowance  a boat is putting off from the schooner and heading this way susan announced and the boys gave no further heed as to speculations regarding the future for it seemed as if the enemy was about to begin operations  in a very short time however it could be understood that there was no danger of an immediate attack for the craft coming shoreward from the vessel was a canoe in which were but three men  the sentinels were unable to understand the meaning of this movement it did not seem probable the enemy counted on boldly reconnoitering the island nor was it reasonable to suppose any attack was to be made with so small a force and mark said in perplexity  i cant make out why they are coming but well be ready for whatever turn affairs may take  shall we fire on them if they get too near susan asked  unless they claim to be friends which isnt likely well treat them exactly as we would the abenakis if they were bold enough to land in broad day mark replied and as assurance of his intentions he made certain his musket was ready for immediate use  the strangers paddled directly toward the spot where were kept the boats of the settlers beached the canoe and straightway approached the stockade as friends might have done  the three children on guard watched the newcomers curiously until they were within fifty or sixty paces of the gate and then mark hailed  it will be safer to halt where you are until we understand the reason for this visit he cried showing himself above the palisade with musket in hand  are you in command of the stockade one of the visitors asked as all three came to a full stop  ay for the time being  how many have you in garrison one of the newcomers asked as he advanced a single pace to show that he was authorized to act as spokesman for his party  that is for you to find out mark replied with a smile you must take us for simples if it is in your mind that we will give all the information demanded  i did not ask to gain information for we know exactly the number of women and children here i desired that you yourself should state it in order to the better understand how entirely you are at our mercy the man said and his manner of speech told that he was french  i do not need to repeat it having seen your force and knowing my own full well  then you can understand that when i offer good quarter if you surrender without resistance it should do away with any necessity for a conflict  are you ready to give the same quarter your people promised at falmouth when the defenceless prisoners were murdered by you frenchmen mark cried angrily  i give you my word of honor as a soldier than no one shall be harmed if you surrender this place immediately the officer replied sharply  if i have heard rightly the baron de castine gave the same pledge at falmouth and afterward excused himself by saying that he could not restrain the indian allies mark said stoutly since then it is difficult to believe that french officers have any too much honor otherwise perhaps they would not fight side by side with savages  do you refuse to surrender the visitor asked angrily  illustration do you refuse to surrender  ay that i do and all here are of the same mind with me it is better to die fighting than be put to the torture by your allies whom mayhap you could not restrain  my force is so large that you will be crushed in a twinkling and if you resist no mercy may be expected i have come in the effort to save your lives  why should it be necessary mark asked what have we done that you strive to take possession of our homes  that is not a question to be discussed the officer replied impatiently it is my intention to clear this island of settlers and i hope at such time to aid you  it is a brave piece of business to wait until our fathers have gone away and then come here to fight women and children susan cried sharply are all french officers so valiant  it was impossible for the visitor to see the speaker but he knew from the voice that the words were uttered by a girl and his face reddened as he bit his lip to hold back a retort  i offer you good quarter and to that pledge my word if you submit at once he said after a brief pause in case you are so foolish as to dream of holding out against us much loss of blood must ensue  that is bound to come mark replied gravely we are resolved to hold this stockade as long as there is one left alive to fire a musket and when you succeed in the noble work of murdering women and children there will be none left alive for the savages your very good friends to torture  and that is your last word the officer asked halfturning on his heel  the last mark replied  the frenchman stood irresolutely while one might have counted ten and then wheeling about he marched toward the shore looking back from time to time as if believing the young defenders might repent of having given such an answer  we have shut off all chance of making a bargain with them luke said half to himself and susan replied stoutly  it would have shamed me had mark treated with them why should they offer us quarter we have done nothing to warrant their making an attack upon us and it is well they should hear the truththat it is nothing less than murder people dont make war in such a fashion as this  mark gave no heed to what his companions were saying his eyes were fixed on the canoe in which the three men had embarked and it was in his mind that when they regained the schooner there would be a decided change in the position of affairs  and in this he was not mistaken within half an hour the boats belonging to the schooner and the canoes of the indians were engaged in transporting the men to the shore of mount desert half a mile or more north of the stockade  theres one satisfaction to be had in arousing the frenchmans temper mark said grimly when the work of disembarkation was well under way we wont need to expect a night attack and hang around in suspense waiting for it because the assault is to be begun some time before sunset we had best get out our supply of ammunition and warn the others that they will soon be needed  it was susan who went to summon her mother and aunt and when she returned carrying a heavy burden of powder and bullets it was to report  the children are to be kept in the house under charge of ellen the others will be here in a minute or two  they cant come any too soon luke said nervously the frenchmen are already marching along the shore with the abenakis trailing on behind  susan was at her post of duty in a twinkling and looking out through the rough loopholes she saw no less than twenty white men ten of whom were armed with muskets and the others carrying pikes the head of which glittered in the sun marching in soldierly array down the beach in their rear slouched nine indians and it was safe to assume that the remainder of the redskinned party had been disabled during the first assault  it was a positive relief to mark when he saw that the enemy was intending to march directly upon the stockade most likely counting on carrying the place by the first assault if the force had been divided so that a portion might attack from the rear at the same time the others were in front the task of holding them in check would have been wellnigh hopeless  even as it was with everything in the childrens favor it did not seem possible they could defend themselves against such a force but mark said as if believing the chances for success were very good  remember that we cant afford to waste any bullets if each of us could hit the target three times in succession i warrant you those valiant frenchmen would be eager to gain the shelter of their vessel both of you can strike four squirrels out of five at fifty paces and surely you should be able to do as well when the mark is so much larger and moving slowly dont shoot until you are certain of hitting your man and well soon see those fellows backs  mistress pemberton and mistress harding had come to do their share in the onesided battle both the women looked pale and distressed as was but natural under the desperate circumstances but a single glance at their faces would have told that they believed the only course to be a stout resistance even though it should cost the lives of all  at the shore directly in front of the stockade the indians forced a halt of the white men by seemingly insisting that some other method of procedure be adopted and during two or three minutes it appeared as if they would carry their point  mark drew a long breath of relief however when the officer who had demanded the surrender pushed his way past the savages with a threatening gesture as he ordered the men forward again  they are coming straight on in a body he said in a low tone when you are certain of hitting the mark shoot and have the second musket where it can be got at quickly if we could get in six fair shots at the start it would be a big advantage  each of the children on the platforms had two muskets loaded and the women stood ready to take every weapon as soon as it was empty the ammunition divided into three portions was near the sharpshooters and nothing remained to be done save take part in the life or death struggle so near at hand  steadily the french marched toward the stockade evidently intending to begin the attack near the gate and it was susan who fired the first shot  as the report of her musket rang out one of the foremost men plunged forward to the ground and five seconds later mark brought another of the enemy down  luke fired but failed of doing execution he seized the second musket hurriedly however and crippled his foe thus doing half as much as mark had required  three down in four shots isnt so bad the leader cried encouragingly and the words were hardly more than spoken before both he and susan fired the second time each of the bullets finding its billet  now it was that the frenchmen halted without the word of command and opened fire  during three or four minutes it was as if a perfect hailstorm of lead raged around the stockade but the stout logs afforded good protection never a missile found its way inside and the spirits of the besieged rose rapidly  acting under marks orders neither susan nor luke had attempted to make reply to the furious shooting lest a bullet accidentally come through one of the loopholes and when because their weapons were empty the soldiers ceased the aimless firing the childrens muskets had been recharged  if we can do as well as we did before those fellows will soon show their backs mark cried cheerily himself setting the example by wounding the officer  now the bullets came thick and fast during a full minute and then the foremost of the assailants began to fall back carrying the officer with them and an instant later the entire party was in full and disorderly retreat  three children had actually beaten back twenty white men and nine indians without having received a scratch  not until the fainthearted men were at the waters edge beyond range of those in the stockade was a halt made and then it appeared as if they were holding a council of war  illustration an instant later the entire party was in retreat  the officer was laid in one of the boats and the soldiers gathered around him the ablebodied gesticulating furiously and the wounded seated on the sand attending to their injuries none had been killed outright but the majority of those who had been hit would not be likely to take part in another attack unless it was delayed for a considerable time  it seemed as if the white men gave but little attention to what the indians said during this council for the savages were shouldered aside with scant ceremony and after a few moments all the abenakis for none had been wounded stalked gravely southward where they were soon lost to view amid the bushes  were going to have trouble from those fellows and it wont be long coming mark said as he leaped down from the platform and ran toward that portion of the stockade immediately in the rear of the dwellings keep a sharp watch over the frenchmen and let me know what they are doing  then he began putting up a platform at that point where he could overlook the thicket which last had been allowed to grow dangerously near the buildings and had hardly mounted for the purpose of making a hasty survey when a bullet imbedded itself in one of the posts against which he leaned  what is the matter susan cried  the abenakis have sneaked around here where they can shoot while remaining under cover let mother come to load my muskets  the report of marks weapon followed the words and from the thicket two or three muskets were discharged thus showing that the entire force of indians was lurking amid the underbrush  susan came running toward her cousin carrying a weapon in each hand and the latter asked sharply  why have you left your post the abenakis wont kick up much of a row until after dark  there is nothing to be done at the other side susan replied as she set about dragging two or three lobsterpots toward the palisade the frenchmen are paddling back to the schooner not leaving one behind and luke is watching to see when they leave the vessel again  another bullet from the thicket whistled uncomfortably near marks head and he understood that the most dangerous portion of the attack was now to be met for it was impossible to see a single foe the swaying of the branches or the tiny curls of smoke were the only tokens of an enemy save when a weapon was discharged  keep down under cover mark cried when susan would have mounted the collection of lobsterpots they are shooting close and if you should be disabled we would be in even worse trouble than we are now  but you are showing them a target  some one must be here to hold them back  then i have the same right as you and the courageous girl clambered up on the shaky platform until it was possible for her to look over the palisade  it was a most dangerous position and fearing lest she should be killed mark left his station to chop away the ends of the posts to make loopholes  now you can have a view of the woods without showing yourself he said and would have gone back to his previous position exposed though it was but that she stopped him by asking  will you do the same at your end of the fence as you have here  there isnt so much need for me to keep under cover  there is ten times more reason why you should be careful than for me to skulk behind the posts unless you hew the timbers at your station as you have these i shall change places with you  mistress pemberton added her commands to susans entreaties with the result that mark was forced to protect himself so far as possible but while he chopped at the  posts half a dozen bullets struck close around the axe showing that the indians were on the alert  when half an hour had passed neither mark nor susan had seen one of their enemies several times they fired at the places where the branches were waving as if some person was walking beneath them but no cry of pain was heard to tell that the bullet had taken effect  during this time luke had reported more than once that the frenchmen yet remained on board their vessel and when the sun was sinking behind the hills mark said to his cousin  were wasting too much powder and lead sue i dont believe one of our bullets has gone home and we have sent far too many at random the frenchmen are not beaten yet and we must have plenty of ammunition when they come again  what then are we to do  i will stay here keeping guard lest the abenakis attempt to scale the fence you and our mothers shall attend to the household duties holding yourselves in readiness to come whenever i shout  but there is nothing for me to do in the house  then take advantage of the opportunity to get a  little rest for it is certain that we shall have our hands full during all this night get supper if nothing more and then bring me something to drink  ill do that first and then look after myself susan said as she went toward the house and a moment later mark heard from her a cry of distress  whats the matter he shouted wildly fearing for the instant that some of the savages had gained entrance to the dwelling despite his careful watch  the water the water susan cried mournfully and then came a hum of voices raised high in excitement and fear amid which the sentinel could distinguish no words  come here susan mark shouted peremptorily and as the girl appeared he demanded now tell me what has gone wrong  the children have spilled all the water we took into the house and theres not a drop to be had  but they couldnt have carried the spring away mark replied with a laugh able to make merry even amid the terrible surroundings so great was his relief at learning that nothing more serious had caused the cry which startled him  the sheep have gathered there until the entire place is a mass of filthy mud  well well dont let that distress you so sorely well soon be able to clear it out for i reckon these beggarly abenakis wont keep me busy more than twelve hours  but if the frenchmen should come in the meantime  well take our chances of that and get along without water a little while     chapter v  fire   mark was disposed to make light of that which distressed susan and thus did he make his first mistake in the defence  to his mind there was nothing very serious in the loss of the water which had been carried into the dwelling because the spring was within the stockade and however much mischief the sheep had done it would be the work of but few moments to put everything in proper order once more  the chief thought in his mind was regarding the possible trouble which the abenakis might make while hidden in the thicket back of the palisade and after this the fear that the ablest of his assistants might become disabled because of her wound which had not received the attention such an injury required  therefore it was he said to susan speaking almost sharply to the end that she might feel forced to obey without argument  the first thing for you to look after is that wound have your mother dress it once more while you can be spared from the palisade then seeing that she hesitated he added it is necessary for the safety of all that you look after yourself because if you were disabled we would be in most serious plight you being the best marksman among us  susan hesitated no longer but went toward the house even though she did not believe it necessary to give very much attention to her arm which was not so badly injured but that she could use it with comparative ease  when she had disappeared within the dwelling mark watching through the loophole for a target cried to his brother  how is everything over your way luke  there has been no change the frenchmen are sticking close to their vessel  i reckon it would be safe for you to come here a few minutes ill send mary to take your place  the lad obeyed promptly and after cautioning him not to expose himself to the aim of the enemy although it was essential he keep close lookout over the thicket mark went toward the spring  the damage done by the sheep was greater than he had supposed the earth in the immediate vicinity had been ploughed up by the feet of the animals until the spring was nearly choked and mark realized that a full hours work would be required to repair the mischief  we cant spend much time at it while the abenakis are in the woods he said to himself later in the might perhaps i shall have a chance to do the job  then he went to where mary was taking lukes place as sentinel near the gate instructing her to raise an alarm immediately she saw any movement on the part of the frenchmen  keep your eyes open wide he said and while watching the schooner give some attention to what may be going on close at hand i dont believe the indians will come out of the thicket to show themselves where no shelter can be found but at the same time it is possible remember that all our lives might pay the forfeit of your carelessness  you can trust me as you do susan although i cant shoot so well but my eyes are as good as hers  true for you sister mine and between now and morning im counting on your doing a full share of standing guard  then mark ascended the platform for one look at the vessel which remained at her moorings with but few men showing on deck after which he went into the dwelling where his mother was preparing supper  susans arm was being rebandaged after having been bound up with simples which had been gathered in the woods against just such an emergency and the smaller children were huddled in one corner like frightened sheep  i have left luke in my place the lad said in reply to his mothers question the abenakis are taking good care to keep out of sight and it is only a waste of ammunition to fire at a waving bush or curl of smoke ill get something to eat now that im here and then go on duty again  susan declared she would stand watch near the gate in order that mary might take care of the children and to that end ate supper with mark after which the two went out to their weary dangerous vigil once more with the disheartening knowledge that there was no probability of receiving aid from any quarter  illustration susans arm was being rebandaged  we wont talk about it sue mark said when his cousin bewailed the fact that even though a fishingvessel should pass near at hand her crew would not come ashore when it was seen that the future hopes had left her anchorage we cant afford to look on the dark side of affairs lest we grow fainthearted for you know that once our courage is gone we are the same as beaten  susan did not reply as she might have done with truth that they were then very nearly in that deplorable condition but shut her teeth tightly as if to prevent the escape of a single word while she walked rapidly toward the gate to take her station as sentinel  mary begged to stand guard an hour or two longer but susan insisted that she was needed in the house and reluctantly the girl descended from the platform  then mark relieved luke from duty instructing him to first get his supper and then if the indians remained inactive to set about cleaning out the spring  by this time the night had fully come and mark noted with apprehension that clouds were gathering in the sky while the moon shone brightly it was as easy to guard against surprise as at noonday but once that light was obscured the enemy might creep up at a dozen places on the palisade without being detected  two hours of blackness and we are done for mark said to himself with a sigh and then remembering what he had told susan he added weve got to take whatever comes and the only manly way is to make the best of it in case it is very dark tonight mary and ellen must both stand watch with the rest of us  the report of a musket interrupted his train of gloomy thoughts and involuntarily he ducked his head when a bullet came singing over the fence so near that he felt the wind of it  you cant tempt me to shoot till i see something to fire at he said grimly watching through the loophole at the underbrush which was merged by the shadows into one single mass of gloom amid which not even a movement among the branches could be distinguished  two more shots which caused him to wonder why the abenakis were growing so active and then he caught a glimpse of a faint spark in the thicket which at first sight appeared to him like the glow from an indians pipe  he had raised his musket intending to fire at the bright spot when it suddenly increased in size and while he stood speculating as to what it could be a long tongue of flame leaped upward from branch to branch  no need for speculation now nor was it well that he stand very much longer on guard for the terrible truth was all to plain  the abenakis had fired the woods counting on burning the palisade and thus giving them free entrance for the bloody business upon which they had come  his first thought was to run for water and then even before he could make a movement toward the spring came the realization that it was impossible to effect anything by such a course  he would not be able to throw water upon the fire in the thicket even though he exposed himself to full view over the top of the palisade and this was probably exactly what the indians hoped he might do  it begins to look as if we had about come to an end of the defence and that nothing remains but to sell our lives as dearly as possible he said gloomily to himself everything around here is as dry as it well can be and once the fire gains headway even the houses must go  mark descended doggedly from the platform and as he did so susan cried from her post of duty near the gate  what is on fire  the abenakis have started a blaze in the woods  will the fence burn think you  ay when the fire is well under way  cant we do anything toward putting out the blaze  nothing unless we want the indians to shoot us down before we can fire a shot  then what is to be done and in her distress susan leaped down from the platform to approach her cousin  better stay where you are the lad cried warningly i dont suppose it will make any great difference to us and yet we should know if the frenchmen come ashore after seeing the fire  the girl returned immediately to her station and even though he was at a considerable distance from her mark could hear the choking sob which escaped her lips  keep up a stout heart sue we can make a last stand inside the house  ay mark but it will be the last  the lad made no reply he stood at some distance from the palisade as if trying to decide upon a course of action and while he thus remained irresolute his mother came from the house  there was no need that she ask for information the blaze was so bright by this time that it must have been seen by those on the vessel and mistress pemberton inquired in a low tone but with no tremor in her voice  are the logs dry  ay mother but it will be some time before the flames can eat in very deeply weve got fifteen or twenty minutes yet  what is to be done  well take refuge in the house and shoot down as many as possible before the fire drives us out  if there is nothing more before us why not come inside now the indians can climb up on the posts on either side and shoot you down while you stand here in the light  the frenchmen are coming ashore susan cried one boatload has pushed off already  we are going into the house mark said hesitatingly as if even now when prudence demanded that they should seek shelter as soon as possible he was questioning whether he might effect something by remaining in the open  but if we dont stand guard the indians will soon be over the fence the girl cried nervously  ay and if you stand there in the glow of the fire they can creep up under cover of the shadows to one side or the other and shoot you down weve done all we can here sue and the remainder of our fight must be made from the house  the report of a musket from the southern side of the stockade and the humming of a bullet close beside susans head gave emphasis to the lads words causing the sentinel to obey without further parley  once inside the dwelling with the door strongly barred the older members of the little party strove to appear unconcerned each hoping to cheer the other and at no time since the island was besieged did they display more courage than now when there seemed no ray of hope remaining  through the crevices of the logs and the windowshutters could be seen the glow of the flames which were increasing each instant fanned as they were by short furious gusts of wind which came from the gathering clouds  we must get under the roof where i made the loopholes mark said to susan and luke theres no question but that the indians will make a try at coming over the stockade before the fire has destroyed it else they have changed their natures completely and we wont give them full swing even though we are cooped up here like rats in a trap  the boys want water ellen who had been attending to the younger children said at this moment and the elders of the party looked at each other in dismay  the new danger which confronted them had driven for the time being everything else from their minds but now all realized that even though they might not be permitted to remain long in that frail refuge they would suffer severely from thirst before the end came  get into the loft one on each side and shoot with good aim if you see a painted face over the fence mark cried as he took up one of the buckets and went swiftly toward the door  you must not go out his mother said as she barred the way it is certain by this time that the abenakis are where they can have a view of the enclosure and you will be shot down better that the children should suffer from thirst  we will all soon be needing something to drink for its bound to be hot inside here when the palisade catches fire one bucketful of water will save us a good deal of suffering and im bound to take the chances  then before his mother could prevent him mark opened the door running at full speed to the spring which was not more than twenty feet distant  that the abenakis were on the alert could be told when half a dozen shots were fired in rapid succession but fortunately for the defenders of the island not a bullet took effect owing to marks rapid movements  to those who were watching him in agonizing suspense from the house it seemed as if the lad no more than wheeled about when he gained the spring and then came toward the building in a zigzag course well calculated to confuse the most skilful marksman  illustration he reëntered the house with a bucket twothirds full of muddy water  he reëntered the house with a bucket twothirds full of muddy water and while barring the door once more said in a tone of triumph  i reckoned it might be done if a fellow used his legs well that stuff doesnt look fit to drink but after the mud has settled a bit it will be better than nothing i am to blame for not cleaning the spring out when i first knew that the children had wasted the supply  you have nothing with which to reproach yourself mark his aunt said as she laid her hand affectionately on his shoulder you have taken the place of both your father and uncle and there is not a man grown who could have done more or better work  the lads face flushed with pleasure at this praise but he affected to give no heed to the words as he clambered into the loft musket in hand calling out when he was on the timbers above  give us the ammunition up here and well load our own guns until the enemy comes too fast  mistress pemberton handed him only a portion of the powder and bullets after which she stood on the top of a table ready to take the empty weapons when the sharpshooters required her services  mark was the first to discharge his musket and a cry of pain followed the report telling that the ammunition had not been wasted  what did you see his mother asked anxiously  an indians head over the top of the fence near the gate theres one villain the less to trouble us  at this moment susan and luke both fired the reports coming so near together as to sound like one and the girl cried triumphantly  ive hit another what did you do luke  i dont know he went backward at the flash like a loon but it seems as if i must have struck him for i had a fair aim  mistress pemberton now had work to perform for those in the loft soon learned that it would be impossible to recharge the weapons and at the same time keep close watch on what might be happening outside  seven shots had been fired from the dwelling three of which were known to have found their targets when a heavy pounding at the gate told of additional danger  what is it mistress harding cried and mark replied quietly as if it was of no especial consequence  the frenchmen have come and are battering down the gate  how long will it take them to do it susan asked her voice quivering despite all efforts to render it steady  it will be a good halfhours job with what timber they can pick up near at hand if they should cut down a stout tree the work might be done in half that time keep your eyes on the top of the fence for if one fellow gets inside he might succeed in pulling out the bars before we could stop him  twice more the children fired and then it was as if the abenakis had tired of a game at which they were rapidly being worsted without an opportunity to inflict any injury  theyve made up their minds to wait till the gate is down mark said grimly we must have all the muskets ready when the rush comes and shoot with good aim for it will be our last fair chance  all this while the flames had been increasing in volume and the heat inside the dwelling filled with the smoke of burning powder as it was seemed stifling  the younger children had drank of the muddy water eagerly giving no heed to its disagreeable appearance and the older members of the little company were already suffering with thirst but never one of them ventured to claim a portion of the scanty supply  the fence is on fire mark said as he left his station at the front of the loft to survey the scene in the rear the wind is getting up in great shape and coming from the east otherwise these housed would be on fire by this time  there goes the upper part of the gate luke cried two or three more fair blows and the whole will be down  mark came back to where he could overlook the scene of what he believed would be the final struggle and the three children crouched muskets in hand ready to empty the six weapons before the enemy could approach the house sufficiently near to find shelter under its walls  the two women were standing on a table where they could reach the weapons when they were empty in one corner of the room seated on a bed which was laid on the floor behind the barricade of the door were the other children some crying for water and others weeping with fear  the powder smoke hung heavily in the small apartment which was illumined by the glow of the flames now not more than thirty feet distant and the heat was almost overpowering  the bucket in which mark had brought the muddy water from the spring was empty and the throats of the three children in the loft were literally parched with a thirst that could not be allayed  they were beset by danger on every hand and the supreme moment seemed very near for once the gate was demolished however desperately they might fight the end was come  we are not to leave here alive susan whispered softly in marks ear and he replied pressing her hand  that part of it shant be forgotten sue dear  a cry from luke the crashing and splintering of wood a shock which could be felt by the refugees as the heavy timbers fell inward and the passage was open to the foe  take good aim mark shouted shoot at the foremost and work quickly  while one might have counted ten the enemy hung back as if fearing that a party of women and children might have planned an ambush and then with a yell of triumph the opening in the palisade was filled with armed men  the defenders in the loft fired at almost the same instant then delaying only sufficiently long to fling back the empty weapons and take up those that were loaded three more reports rang out  the frenchmen halted irresolutely for an instant as four of their number fell to the ground and had the children been able to fire one more volley immediately it is quite certain the entire party would have beaten a retreat even at the moment of victory  as the men recovering courage dashed forward a heavy peal of thunder seemed to shake the very earth and on the moment rain fell in torrents coming as suddenly and in such volume as if having been poured from some immense reservoir  the enemy recoiled as if confronted by an overwhelming force and as they wavered the children in the loft discharged three muskets each bullet seemingly taking effect  then suddenly it was as if a black mantel had been dropped over the terrible scene a certain portion of the enormous downpour of water was converted into clouds of steam by the flames which were literally beaten down and those who had struggled so bravely to defend the island could distinguish nothing  illustration again the crash of thunder drowned all sounds  what is the matter ellen cried in alarm at thus being suddenly plunged into profound darkness and the younger children screamed with terror  a deafening peal of thunder seemingly came in answer to the question followed a second later by a vivid blinding flash of lightning which illumined the interior of the loft through the few crevices between the logs until the defenders could see each others faces gleaming ghastly pale  the water trickling through the roof restored them to their senses somewhat and mark said speaking as if with an effort  the storm has been gathering since afternoon now while we are cooped up here in the darkness the enemy can work his will  again the crashing of thunder drowned all other sounds once more the jagged rifts of unearthly fire breaking though the clouds illumined the scene and susan cried as if unable to believe her own statement  the men are running away they are running away  mark and luke sprang to her side waiting for another flash of lightning and when it came preceded by crashing thunder which caused the house of logs to tremble the enclosure was deserted  its true that some of them have gone perhaps all mark announced but the whole crew will come back when the storm is over and there will be nothing save our muskets to prevent them from marching in at their pleasure  let us give thanks for the mercies which have already been bestowed upon us mistress pemberton said devoutly the fire is extinguished and we need no longer fear being burned to death  that might not be the worst that will befall us mark thought recalling to mind the fate of those settlers of maine who had been put to death by torture  because of the fury of the tempest it seemed as if its force must be quickly spent and the besieged waited in painful suspense fearing that the downpour of water would speedily cease but the moments went by amid the flashing of lightning and crashing of thunder without any abatement of the tempest save as the wind lulled for a few seconds to come in yet more spiteful gusts  when half an hour had passed mistress pemberton insisted that the three children should come down from the loft in order that they might all be together during this respite from the cruel foe and when they were in the room below freed from the fear of immediate death thanks were given to him who ruleth the tempest for this new lease of life brief though it might prove to be     chapter vi  the wreck   hope once more sprang up in the hearts of those who had been so sorely tried when the storm continued with greal fury the electrical portion of the tempest appeared to have passed away leaving the raging wind and pelting rain to guard the settlers who of a verity had descended into the very valley of the shadow of death  when it was understood that that which was at first supposed to be a summer gale had developed into a furious northeast storm giving no token of subsiding mark said as he rose to his feet  when the rain first came it seemed as if my throat was parched dry with thirst and now that water is to be had in abundance all hands of us appear to have forgotten that we wanted a drink  we might catch some of the water that is finding its way through the roof mistress pemberton said as if such a possibility had never occurred to her before  we can do better than that mother dear ill go to the spring for a full bucket and when it has been strained we shall have what will be an improvement on rainwater  but possibly some of the enemy may be lurking outside mistress harding said becoming timorous once more now that the imminent danger had passed  whoever has been out in the storm all this while will be harmless aunt for his musket would be filled with something other than powder mark replied with a laugh and then he unbarred the door surprised to find that it was only with difficulty he could make headway against the furious blasts  so powerful was the wind that it became necessary for susan and luke to unite their strength in order to close the door while mark was absent and when he returned with a brimming bucket of discolored water the three had no little difficulty in putting the bars into place again  it is the fiercest storm i ever saw mark exclaimed as he dashed the raindrops from his face well pray that the future hopes is in a snug harbor otherwise she will have to scud for i dont believe they could heave her to  do you think there is any probability your father and uncle may be out in this tempest mistress pemberton asked more anxious now for the safety of the absent ones then she previously had been concerning herself  they are too good sailors mother dear to take many chances and we had fair warning of this storm if we hadnt been in such sore straits theres no question but that we would have been prepared for it i noticed the clouds gathering but at the time thought only that it would be our misfortune since we could not keep watch of the indians closereefed and with plenty of searoom the future hopes will ride out this gale without doing more harm to herself than the straining of a seam perhaps  the frenchmen could not have had time to get their vessel under way mistress pemberton said as if thinking aloud and mark sprang to his feet in excitement  of course they couldnt and it is well for them if they didnt succeed in getting on board for the craft never had been built that can ride at anchor to the eastward of the brook while the wind is so heavy it would have been impossible to get under way for shed be on the rocks before her nose could be brought around into the wind  do you suppose they are yet on the island  i think unless all hands are good sailors that theyd try to get on board and that could have been done because the sea wouldnt grow heavy in an instant  further speculation as to the fate of their foes was checked very suddenly by what sounded like the groaning of a human being in deepest distress coming from one corner of the room in which they were seated  instinctively the inmates of the dwelling clutched each other for it was impossible to see anything in that profound darkness and during many seconds no one spoke  then the dismal sound could be heard once more and mark forcing himself to beat down the fear which assailed him said with an effort  can you find one of the candles mother some one here must be dying where are the children  johnny and jimmie are with me ellen said and mary added  im here with luke  no one could have got inside without our knowing it mistress pemberton said as she groped around for the scanty store of candles which were reserved for use on especial occasions  mark did not reply until his mother succeeded after many fruitless efforts in striking a spark from the steel and flint on the tinder and as the feeble flame of the candle flickered and flared in the wind which made its way through the crevices the lad began to tear away the barricade of household goods which had been thrown up to screen the window  it is useless to search there mistress pemberton said quickly as if a sudden thought had come to her one of those whom you wounded is lying outside and we hear his moans because he is close beside the building  mark was at the door in an instant forgetting that he was hastening to the succor of one who a short hour previous was bent on killing him and susan seized the lad by the arm as she said in a tone of caution  it may be some trick to get you outside be careful what you do we have heard that the indians often make use of such means to get a victim in their clutches  ill warrant there is no indian living who could stay out in this storm an hour or more and then be able to do very much mischief mark replied as he unfastened the bar waiting only long enough for luke and susan to get hold of the door lest it should be torn from its hinges by the wind before he darted out into the blackness  a moment later it was possible to hear his voice as if he spoke to someone and then all was still save for the raging of the tempest until he cried from the outside  open the door youngsters ive got a frenchman here who must be very near death  then as luke and susan gave him admittance he came staggering into the room with an apparently lifeless body in his arms while mistress pemberton shielded the candle as best she might lest the wind extinguish the feeble flame  mark laid his burden on the bed heeding not the fact that the water was running from every angle of the strangers garments  like mark the two women forgot that a bitter enemy was before them but with gentle care set about ministering to his wants if indeed he would have any more in this world  now all the occupants of the dwelling were too much engrossed with the work of saving the life which had so nearly been taken by one of their number to be able to tell whether the storm was yet raging or if the morning had come  in a very short time it was learned that the man lived although how he survived after being exposed to the fury of the tempest so long could not be understood he had an uglylooking wound in the thigh and another in the left breast but mistress pemberton gave it as her opinion that he was not mortally hurt  with good nursing i doubt not but that he will live she said as she dressed the wounds to the best of her ability but if he does what shall we do with him  there is no need to answer that question now mother dear mark said gently well try to pull him through even if we have already done our best to kill him and then hell know what it is to have coals of fire heaped on his head that is he added after a brief pause if his comrades allow us to live long enough to do the job  a fire was built tea of herbs made and administered to the sufferer and before morning came it was possible for him to speak  he was sufficiently acquainted with the english language to make them understand him and his first words were expressive of surprise  save when you attack us without cause we have no desire for your death mistress pemberton replied now you are no longer a soldier striving to do us grievous injury but a suffering fellow creature and so long as it is in our power we will do whatsoever we may toward giving you aid  the wounded man turned his face away as if ashamed to look the good woman in the face and after a time mark questioned him as to how the chanced to be so near the house  from his story told little by little because of the difficulty experienced in talking the facts were soon known  he had been among the first to burst through the gate and was not wounded until when the last shot was fired then instinct prompted him to gain a shelter under the wall of the building where it would not be possible for those on the inside to see him immediately after which he lost consciousness during a long while he remained as if dead and it is probable that the deluge of rain served to revive him after a time but he was ignorant of having made any outcry he remembered of realizing that he was alone exposed to the storm and the next knowledge was that the women were striving to nurse him back to life  illustration the next knowledge was that the women were trying to nurse him back to life  it was morning before the inmates of the dwelling gave much heed to anything save the wounded soldier and then mark after cautioning the remainder of the family to stay inside the dwelling unless they heard his cry for help ventured out into the tempest which continued with but little decrease of violence  the sun had not yet risen and it the gray light of early dawn it was not possible to distinguish objects at any great distance he had in the immediate vicinity of the stockade however good proof of the violence with which the storm raged  a portion of the palisade itself had been overthrown leaving an opening through which the entire force of the enemy might have marched shoulder to shoulder trees were uprooted the small boat which had been drawn beyond reach of the tide was now within ten feet of the battered gate having been carried there by the wind  that the buildings within the stockade remained uninjured was due doubtless to the thicket in the rear which served to shield them from the full fury of the elements  turn where he might the same scene of devastation met his gaze and he understood that if any of the frenchmen remained on the island they would be powerless to depart for their vessel could not have outlived the night  the wind was yet so violent that only with difficulty could he make his way from one point to another and the rain beat upon his face until it became necessary to shield his eyes in order to see anything twenty paces distant but he struggled against the elements making his way along the shore toward the place where the frenchmens schooner had been moored  the vessel no longer remained at her anchorage nor did he expect to see her there but he was not quite prepared for that which met his gaze when he was where a view of the most northerly point of the harbor island could be had  between where he stood and the opposite shore was the hull of the schooner keel uppermost tossing on the short waves now completely submerged and again rising high in the air until the greater portion of the planking could be seen clinging to this restless wreck were six or eight human beings and on the beach at his feet lay the bodies of two men who had been beaten down to death during the conflict of the elements  after watching for several moments the plunging rolling remnant of what had been a seagoing vessel fitted to withstand almost any buffeting of wave or wind mark became convinced that the wreck was moored in some fashion and then it was possible to guess very nearly how the disaster had occurred  it seemed probable that when the first of the frenchmen gained the schooners deck after the fury of the tempest had forced them to retreat from the stockade the wild tossing of the craft as the waves were beginning to rise induced them to let go every anchor on board under the belief that she could be held at moorings until the storm had subsided sufficiently to admit of her clawing away from the shore  illustration he gazed at the struggling wretches on the bottom of the wreck  when the tempest was at its height and after the attacking party had succeeded in getting on board the little craft must have been literally blown down until the water rushing into the open hatches had caused her to completely upset  the wounded and all others who were in the cabin must have been drowned offhand and that some of those who tried to save themselves by clinging to the hulk had suffered a like fate could be told by the lifeless bodies at marks feet  aid had come to the defenders of the island on the wings of the tempest and at the very time when it seemed as if all hope of succor was vain the enemy had been overcome by him who holdeth the waters in the hollow of his hand  as he gazed at the struggling wretches on the bottom of the wreck some of whom waved their hands feebly as if nearly exhausted and imploring him to help them mark forgot that but a few hours previous these same men had been thirsting for his blood and thought only that they were in sore need of his assistance  he ran with all speed to the stockade shouting as he approached and when the women and children hastened outside believing him to be in distress he hurriedly told of what he had seen  of all those who made the attack i am satisfied that only the men on the hulk remain alive it is for us to help them if we can there should be enough of us here to drag our boat to the water and luke and i will see what can be done in the way of lifesaving  sorely beset though they had been no one thought at that moment of the suffering which had been endured because of these men who were now so near death but all even the youngest children laid hold of the boat to launch her  it was no slight task to drag the craft small though she was over the sand to the waters edge but the task was finally accomplished and then many moments were spent trying to find the oars which had been blown out of the boat during such time as the tempest forced her upon the shore  a full halfhour must have elapsed from the moment mark discovered the wreck until he and his brother were ready to set off on their mission of mercy and then it was an open question as to whether they would succeed in the battle against the boisterous waves  the members of both families stood near the waters edge regardless of the furious storm which was raging as they watched with anxious eyes the efforts of the lads they had set out to save lives but very many times did it seem as if their own must of a certainty be sacrificed  fortunately they were partially sheltered from the wind by the harbor island otherwise the task could never have been accomplished and not until both the lads were wellnigh exhausted did they arrive at the plunging hulk  now it was that the most dangerous portion of the work must be performed only at imminent risk of swamping the small boat could she be taken sufficiently near the wreck to permit of a rescue and then it was necessary to handle her with the utmost skill otherwise she would have been stove to kindling against the side of the hulk  when the boat came close at hand all the frenchmen gathered at one point as if counting on leaping aboard at the same moment and mark shouted peremptorily  youll swamp us if more than one comes at a time lay back there you fellows who are the strongest and help the weakest first  then they quarreled among themselves each insisting that he was in the greatest need of help and mark finally becoming impatient cried sternly  if you cant come aboard like decent people well leave the whole boiling of you to get along as may be possible  there is not one of us who can cling to this wreck half an hour longer a man cried piteously already five have been washed away and drowned  two of you take hold and send aboard that fellow who is lying across the keel he seems to be in the worst shape stand back the lad added as four men made ready to seize the small boat at the first opportunity if you come in other order than i give the word ill leave all hands  by dint of scolding pulling the boat forward or back as the waves threatened and otherwise handling his small craft in a sailorly fashion mark succeeded in getting four of the men aboard leaving three to be rescued later  the boat would carry no more of a load than she then had while the storm was so furious and the lads pulled shoreward aided greatly when going in this direction by the wind  the members of both families gathered on the beach near about where a landing would be made and when the shipwrecked men had been set ashore they were helped toward the stockade by the women and children for the frenchmen were so nearly exhausted that it was impossible to walk unaided  then mark and luke started on the second journey battling quite as desperately as before and the day was fully halfspent when they brought the last of the survivors ashore  it was not until the seven frenchmen were being cared for in the apartment of the pemberton house where the wounded soldier lay that the lad began to realize the possible danger these eight men after having recovered might easily take possession of the stockade and mark was inclined to believe that people who were willing to make war on women and children could not be trusted to play a manly part even toward those who had saved them from death  what shall we do with them all susan asked as she came out of the house which had much the appearance of a hospital to where mark stood studying the matter seriously  it has just come into my mind that we might herd them in your fathers house the greater portion of the things have been taken from there and we can arrange it to bar the doors and shutters on the outside  are you counting on holding them as prisoners susan asked in surprise  that is the only way we may be certain of a crew like that after all that has happened i wouldnt believe in any promises that might be made and they shall be guarded like so many wildcats  every one of whom appears to be grateful  ay i suppose they are now before having recovered but it may be a different matter once theyre in good shape  do you believe there can be any on the harbor island  im satisfied there are no others alive out of all the crew of french and indians luke and i counted on burying the bodies which have been washed ashore and while we are at that work you had better gather up all the muskets and ammunition hiding the lot in the stable until we have the men secured  then calling his brother mark set off toward the beach to perform the last rites over those who had lost their lives while trying to commit murder most foul and that having been done the two lads began transforming the harding house into a prison which last was done by fastening all the shutters and one of the doors on the outside the other door was to be barred in such a manner that it could be readily opened by those who were charged with the care of the frenchmen  these tasks were not completed until nightfall and then mark told the rescued party exactly what it was his purpose to do explaining that he was not ready to believe in any protestations they might make  you must be held prisoners until our fathers return and it is to be remembered that if we find one of you attempting to leave the building which will be given over to your use we shall shoot him down without the slightest feeling of pity or remorse  the men swore most solemnly that they would obey every command which might be given by those who had saved them from death and mark armed with a loaded musket lost no time in escorting them to the harding house  it was his intention to have them closely guarded during every hour of the day and night and to such end luke was stationed at the front of the building where through a crevice which had been made between the logs by mark he could keep his charges in view  mistress pemberton would not consent to having the wounded man removed with the others he was given a bed in one corner of the room after the furniture piled up as a barricade had been put in place and mary and ellen were instructed to watch him not with the idea that he might try to escape but because his condition was such owing to the wounds and subsequent exposure that the most careful nursing and attention was needed  the storm subsided at sunset the clouds disappeared and the first night after the besieged were turned jailers was as calm and peaceful as if the harmony of nature had never been disturbed by the clash of arms  luke remained on duty until about ten oclock in the evening when susan took his place and shortly after midnight mark took his turn at guarding the prisoners  the frenchmen had shown no signs of a disposition to do other than as they were commanded but mark would not put faith in them and kept his watch as if knowing they had already formed a plan for capturing those who succored them  the lad paced to and fro in front of the dwelling looking in upon the men every five minutes until a new day had come and then as he gazed across the waters watching for the sun to rise he saw the dingy canvas of the future hopes glistening like silver in the early light  the fresh breeze was bearing the little vessel swiftly on and before any inmate of the pemberton house was astir she swung to her anchor close inside the harbor while the two men listened to the story which mark had to tell  the fishermen had not been able to gain a shelter when the storm burst upon them therefore the future hopes scudded before the wind during the four and twenty hours which explained why she had arrived so much sooner than had been expected  it would be a labor of love to follow the fortunes of these two families who in 1758 defended the island of mount desert so bravely against the combined attacks of french and indians but historians make no further mention of them after setting forth in the fewest possible words their deeds therefore this tale must perforce come to an end  we do know however from the records of pemaquid that masters pemberton and harding carried to the fort eight frenchmen as prisoners and that the authorities of massachusetts took them in charge several weeks later  it is also known that in 1769 one mark pemberton with his wife susan settled on penobscot bay near where the town of camden now stands and it is reasonable to infer that this man was the same who aided by susan harding so bravely defended the island
