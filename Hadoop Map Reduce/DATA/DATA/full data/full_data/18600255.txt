18600255	much darker days  by andrew lang  aka a huge longway    1884     preface  a belief that modern christmas fiction is too cheerful in tone too artistic in construction and too original in motive has inspired the author of this tale of middleclass life he trusts that he has escaped at least the errors he deplores and has set an example of a more seasonable and sensational style of narrative    contents  chapter ithe curse registered  chapter iia villains byblow  chapter iiimes gages mes gages  chapter ivas a hatter  chapter vthe white groom  chapter vihard as nails  chapter viirescue and retire  chapter viiilocal colour  chapter ixsaved saved  chapter xnot too mad but just mad enough  chapter xia terrible temptation  chapter xiijudge juggins  chapter xiiicleared up from the green park gazette     much darker days     chapter ithe curse registered  when this story of my life or of such parts of it as are not deemed wholly unfit for publication is read and no doubt a public which devoured scrawled black will stand almost anything it will be found that i have sometimes acted without prim cautiousnessthat i have in fact wallowed in crime stillicide and mayhem i rare old crimes are childs play to me who have been an accessory after the fact in excuse i can but plead two thingsthe excellence of the opportunity to do so and the weakness of the resistance which my victim offered  if you cannot allow for these throw the book out of the railwaycarriage window you have paid your money and to the verdict of your pale morality or absurd sense of art in fiction i am therefore absolutely indifferent you are too angelic for me i am too fiendish for you let us agree to differ i say nothing about my boyhood twentyfive years ago a poor boybut no matter i was that boy i hurry on to the soaring period of manhood when the strength the nerve the intellect is or should be at its height or are or should be at their height if you must have grammar in a christmas annual my nerve was at its height i was thirty  yet what was i then a miserable moonstruck mortal duly entitled to write md of tarrytown college alaska after my namefor the title of doctor is useful in the professionbut with no other source of enjoyment or emotional recreation in a cold casual world often and often have i written md after my name till the glowing pleasure palled and i have sunk back asking has life then no more than this to offer  bear with me if i write like this for ever so many pages bear with me it is such easy writing and only thus can i hope to make you understand my subsequent and slightly peculiar conduct  how rare was hers the loveliness of the woman i lostof her whose loss brought me down to the condition i attempt to depict  how strange was her rich beauty she was at once dark and fairla blonde et la brune how different from the spotted girls and twoheaded nightingales whom i have often seen exhibited and drawing money too as the types of physical imperfections warm southern blood glowed darkly in one of philippas cheeksthe left pale teutonic grace smiled in the otherthe right her mother was a fair blonde englishwoman but it was old calabar that gave her daughter those curls of sable wool contrasting so exquisitely with her silkengolden tresses her english mother may have lent philippa many exquisite graces but it was from her father a pureblooded negro that she inherited her classic outline of profile  philippa in fact was a natural arrangement in black and white viewed from one side she appeared the venus of the gold coast from the other she outshone the hellenic aphrodite from any point of view she was an extraordinarily attractive addition to the exhibition and menagerie which at that time i was running in the midland counties  her father the nature of whose avocation i never thought it necessary to inquire into was a sea cook on board a peninsular and oriental steamer his profession thus prevented him from being a permanent resident in this or indeed in any other country  our first meeting was brought about in a most prosaic way her mother consulted me professionally about philippas prospects we did not at that time come to terms i thought i might conclude a more advantageous arrangement if philippas heart was touched if she would be mine but she did not love me moreover she was ambitious she knew small blame to her how unique she was  the fact is she would observe when i pressed my suit the fact is i look higher than a mere showman even if he can write md after his name philippa soon left the circuit to better herself  in a short time a telegram from her apprised me that she was an orphan i flew to where she lodged in a quiet respectable street near ratcliff highway she expressed her intention of staying here for some time  but alone philippa  she was but eightandthirty  not so much alone as you suppose she replied archly  this should have warned me but again i passionately urged my plea i offered most attractive inducements a line to herself in the bills everything found  basil she observed blushing in her usual partial manner you are a day after the fair  but there are plenty of fairs i cried all of which we attend regularly what can you mean has another  he hev said philippa demurely but decidedly  you are engaged she raised her lovely hand and was showing me a gold wedding circlet when the door opened and a strikingly handsome man of some forty summers entered  there was something written in his face a dark contusion in fact under the left eye which told me that he could not be a pure and highsouled christian gentleman  basil south md said philippa introducing us mr baby farmer obviously a name of endearment and again a rosy blush crept round her neck in the usual partial manner which made one of her most peculiar charms  i bowed mechanically and amid a few dishevelled remarks on the weather left the house the most disappointed showman in england  cur sneak coward villain i hissed when i felt sure i was well out of hearing farewell farewell philippa  to drown remembrance and regret i remained in town striving in a course of what moralists call gaiety to forget what i had lost  how many try the same prescription and seem rather to like it i often met my fellowpatients  one day on the steps of the aquarium i saw the man whom i suspected of not being philippas husband  who is that cove i asked  him with the gardenia replied a friend idiomatically that is sir runan errand the amateur showmanhim that runs the live mermaid the missing link and koot hoomi the mahatma of the mountain  what kind of man is he  just about the usual kind of man you see generally here just about as hot as they make them mad about having a show of his own crazed on twoheaded calves  is he married  if every lady who calls herself lady errand had a legal title to do so the baronetage would have to be extended to several supplementary volumes  and this was philippas husband  what was she among so many  my impulse was to demand an explanation from the baronet but for reasons not wholly unconnected with my height and fighting weight i abstained  i did better i went to my hotel called for the hotel book and registered an oath which is therefore copyright i swore that in twentyfive years i would be even with him i hated i prayed rather inconsistently that honour and happiness might be the lot of her i had lost after that i felt better     chapter iia villains byblow  philippa was anothers life was no longer worth living hope was evaluated ambition was blunted the interest which i had hitherto felt in my profession vanished all the spring the elasticity seemed taken out of my two bounding brothers from the gutta percha coast for months i did my work in a perfunctory manner i added a tattooed man to my exhibition and a twoheaded snake also a whiteeyed botocudo who played the guitar and a pair of siamese twins who were fired out of a doublebarrelled cannon and then did the lofty trapeze business they drew but success gave me no pleasure so long as i made money enough for my daily needs and whisky was cheap what recked i my mood was none of the sweetest my friends fell off from me ay they fell like ninepins whenever i could get within reach of them i was alone in the world  you will not be surprised to hear it the wretched have no friends so things went on for a year i became worse instead of better my gloom deepened my liver grew more and more confirmed in its morbid inaction these are not lovers rhapsodies they merely show the state of my body and mind and explain what purists may condemn in this condition i heard without hypocritical regret that a distant relative a longlost uncle had conveniently left me his vast property i cared only because it enabled me to withdraw from the profession i disposed of my exhibition or rather i let it go for a song i simply handed over the tattooed man the artillery twins and the doubleheaded serpent to the firstcomer who happened to be a rural dean far in the deeps of the country near the little town of roding on a lonely highway where no man ever came i took a pike here i dwelt like a hermit refusing to give change to the rare passersby in carts and gigs and attended by a handy fellow william evans stolid as the sphynx which word for reasons that may or may not appear later in this narrative i prefer to spell with a y contrary to the best authorities and usual custom  it was midwinter and midnight my room lay in darkness heavy snow was falling i went to the window and flattened my nose against the pane  what i asked myself is most like a cat looking out of a window  a cat looking in at a window answered a silvery voice from the darkness  flattened against the selfsame pane was another nose a womans it was the lovely organ of mixed architecture belonging to philippa with a low cry of amazement i broke the pane it was no idle vision no case of the horrors the cold cold nose of my philippa encountered my own the ice was now broken she swept into my chamber lovelier than ever in her strange unearthly beauty and a new sealskin coat then she seated herself with careless grace tilting back her chair and resting her feet on the chimneypiece  dear philippa i exclaimed politely how is your husband  husband i have none she hissed tell me basil did you ever hate a fellow no end  yes i answered truly for like mr carlyle i just detested most people and him who had robbed me of philippa most of all  do you know what he did basil he insisted on having a latchkey did you ever hate a man  i threw out my arms my heart was full of bitterness  he did more he has refused to pay my last quarters salary basil didnt you ever hate a man  my brain reeled at these repeated outrages  and where are you staying at present philippa i hope you are pretty comfortable i inquired anxiously  philippa went on my husband as was has chucked me i was about to have a baby i bored him i was in the wayin the familyway basil did you ever hate a fellow if not read this letter  she threw a letter towards me she chucked it with all her old gracious dexterity it was dated from monte carlo and ran thus  as we dont seem quite to hit it off i think i may as well finish this business of our marriage the shortest way to make things clear to your very limited intelligence is to assure you that you are not my wife at all before i married you i was the husband of the live mermaid she has died since then and i might have married you over and over again but i was not quite so infatuated i shall just run across and settle up about this little affair on wednesday as you are five miles from the station as the weather is perfectly awful as moreover i am a luxurious selfindulgent baronet and as this story would never get on unless i walked dont send to meet me i would rather walk  here was a pretty letter from a fond husband but ha proud noble i whispered to my heart you and me shall meet tomorrow  and where are you staying philippa i repeated to lead the conversation into a more agreeable channel  with a mrs thompson she replied a lady connected with sir runan  very well let me call for your things tomorrow i can pass myself off as your brother you know  my halfbrother said philippa blushing on the mothers side  the brave girl thought of everything the child of white parents i should have in vain pretended to be philippas full brother they would not have believed me had i sworn it  dont you think philippa continued as a sudden thought occurred to her that as it is almost midnight and snowing heavily it would be more proper for me to return to mrs thompsons  there was no contesting this  we walked together to the house of that lady and at my suggestion philippa sought her couch i sat down and awaited the advent of mrs thompson she soon appeared  a woman of about fiveandthirty with an aquiline face and a long dark silky beard sweeping down to her waist whatever this womans charms might have been for me when i was still in the profession she could now boast of very few doubtless she had been in sir runans show and was one of his victims  i apologised for the lateness of my call and entered at once on business  mrs thompson remarked that my sisters health was not as it should benot all she could wish  i do not wish to alarm you no doubt you her brother are used to it but for a girl as mad as a hatterwell ill trouble you  i myself can write md after my name i replied and you are related i think to sir runan errand  we are connections she said not taking the point of my sarcasm his conduct rarely astonishes me when i found however that this lady your sister was his wife i own for once i was surprised  feeling that this woman had the better of it with her calm polished highbred sarcasms i walked back to the pike full of hopes of a sweet revenge  as however i had never spoken to a baronet before i could not but fear that his lofty air of superior rank might daunt me when we met tomorrow     chapter iiimes gages mes gages  next morning came chill and grey and reminded me that i had two duties i was to wait at home till philippa came over from mrs thompsons and i was also to hang about the road from the station and challenge sir runan to mortal combat can duties clash they can they did the hours lagged slowly by while i read sir runans letter read and reread it registered and reregistered a pretty term of my own invention this vow of vengeance  philippas things her boxes with all her propertiesarrived in due time  philippa did not  i passed a distracted day now bounding forth half way to the railway station to meet sir runan now speeding back at the top of my pace to welcome philippa at the pike  as i knew not by what train sir runan would reach roding nor when philippa might be looked for i thus obtained exercise enough to make up for months of inaction  finally the last train was due  it was now pitchdark and snowing heavily the very time which philippa generally chose for a quiet evening walk  i rushed halfway to roding changed my mind headed back and arrived at the pike  has a lady called for me i asked the sphynx  now is it likely sir answered my fellow with rough humour  well i must go and meet her i cried and hastily snatching a bullseye lantern and policemans rattle from the sphynx i plunged into the darkness  first i hurried to mrs thompsons where i learned that philippa had just gone out for a stroll after a somewhat prolonged luncheon this was like philippa i recognised that shrinking modesty which always made her prefer to veil her charms by walking about after nightfall  turning from mrs thompsons i felt the snow more sharply on my face furiously blindly madly it whirled here and drifted there  should i go for sir runan should i wait where i was should i whistle for a cab should i return to the pike  suddenly out of the snow came a peal of silvery laughter philippa waltzed gracefully by in a long ulster whitened with snow  i detected her solely by means of my dark lantern  i rushed on her i seized her i said philippa come back with me  no all the funs in the front shrieked philippa my quarters salary oh my last quarters salary  with these wild words like bullets from a gatling gun rattling in my ears i seized philippas hand  something fell and would have rattled on the hard high road had it not been for the snow  i stooped to pick up this shining object and with one more wild yell of my quarters salary philippa waltzed again into the darkness  fatigued with the somewhat exhausting and unusual character of the days performances and out of training as i was i could not follow her  mechanically i still groped on the ground and picked up a small chill object  it was a latchkey i thrust it in my pocket with my other keys  then a thought occurred to me and i chucked it over the hedge to serve as circumstantial evidence next i turned and went up the road springing my rattle and flashing my bullseye lantern on every side like mr pickwick when he alarmed the scientific gentleman  suddenly with a cry of horror i stopped short at my very feet in the little circle of concentrated light thrown by the lantern lay a white crushed cylindrical mass  that mass i had seen before in the warm summer weatherthat mass once a white hat had adorned the brows of that masher  it was sir runans topper     chapter ivas a hatter  yes the white hat lying there all battered and crushed on the white snow must be the hat of sir runan who else but the tigerish aristocrat that disdained the homely fourwheeler and preferred to walk five miles to his victim on this night of dreadwho else would wear the gay gossamer of july in stormy december  in that hat thanks doubtless to its airy insouciant grace he had won philippa in that hat he would have bearded her defied her and cast her off the cruelty of man the larger and bulkier crumpled heap which lay on the road a little beyond the hat that heap with all its outlines already blurred by snow that heap must be the baronet himself  oh but this was vengeance swift deadly vengeance  but how but how had she wreaked it she already my heart whispered she  was my peerless philippa then a murderess  oh say not so call hers ye would do so an she had been an irish felon the wild justice of revenge or the speedy execution of the outraged creditor  killed by philippa  yes and why the answer was only too obvious she must have gone forth to meet him and to wring from him by what means she might that quarters salary which the dastard had left unpaid then my thoughts flew to the doorkey the cause of that fierce family hatred which burned between philippa and her betrayer that latchkey she had wrested from him it had fallen from her hand and ii had pitched it into space  overcome with emotion i staggered in the direction of the pike all the way in the blinding whirling snow i traced the unobliterated prints of a small fairy foot  this was a dreary comfort philippa had gone before me the prints of the one small foot were hers she must then have hopped all the way could such a mode of progression be consistent with a feeling of guilt could remorse step so gaily  my man william the sphynx opened the door to me assuming a natural air i observed  miss south is at home  yes sir just come in sir  where is she now  well sir she just is on the rampage ill make is fur fly she up and sez sez she when she heard as you was hout not a nice young lady for a small teaparty sir he added lowering his voice a regular outandouter your sister is to be sure  the sphynx in spite of his stolidity occasionally ventured upon some slight liberty when addressing me  i made a gay rejoinder reflecting on the character of his own unmarried female relations and entered the room  philippa was sitting on the lofty dark oak chimneypiece with her feet dangling unconventionally over the fireplace the snow melting from her little boots and her hair had made a large puddle on the floor  i came up and stood waiting for her to speak but she kept pettishly swinging her small feet as one who by the action means to signify displeasure  philippa i said sternly speak to me  well heres a gay old flareup cried philippa leaping from the chimneypiece and folding her arms fiercely akimbo  who are you wheres the baby you a brother youre a pretty brother is this the way you keep pointments with a poor girl who killed the baby you didyou all did it  her words ran one into the other as with an eloquence which i cannot hope to reproduce and indeed my excellent publisher would not permit it for a moment she continued to dance derisively at me and to heap reproaches of the most vexatious and frivolous nature on my head  philippa i remarked at last you frivol too much  a sullen look settled on her face and with the aid of a chair she reseated herself in her former listless drooping attitude upon the chimneypiece  on beholding these symptoms on hearing these reproaches a great wave of joy swept over my heart manifestly philippa was indeed as mrs thompson had said as mad as a hatter whatever she might have done did not count and was all right we would plead insanity  she had fallen a victim to a mental disease the source of which i have no hesitation in saying has not yet been properly investigated so far as i know there is no monograph on the subject or certainly i would have read it up carefully for the purpose of this christmas annual i cannot get on without a mad woman in my stories and if i cant find a proper case in the medical books why i invent one or take it from the french this one i have invented  the details of philippas case though of vast and momentous professional interest i shall reserve for a communication to some journal of science  as for the treatment i measured out no less than sixty drops of laudanum with an equal amount of very old brandy in a separate vessel but preparing a dose and getting a patient like this to take it are two different things i succeeded by the following device  i sent for some hot water and sugar and a lemon i mixed the boiling element carefully with the brandy and separately with the laudanum  i took a little of the former beverage philippa with unaffected interest beheld me repeat this action again and again a softer more contented look stole over her beautiful face i seized the moment once more i pressed the potion the other potion upon her  this time successfully  softly murmuring more sugar philippa sank into a sleepsound as the sleep of death  philippa might awaken i hoped with her memory free from the events of the day  as princess toto in the weird old elizabethan tragedy quite forgot the circumstance of her marriage so philippa might entirely forget her murder  when we remember what women are the latter instance of obliviousness appears the more probable     chapter vthe white groom  i shall i am sure scarcely be credited when i say that philippas unconsciousness lasted for sixteen days i had wished her to sleep so long that the memory of her deeds on the awful night should fade from her memory she seemed likely to do so  all the time she slept i felt more and more secure because the snow never ceased falling it must have been thirty feet deep above all that was mortal of sir runan errand the deeper the better the baronet was never missed by any one curious to say no inquiries were made and this might have puzzled a person less unacquainted than myself with the manners of baronets and their friends  sometimes an awful fascination led me along the road where i had found the broken battered mass i fancied i could see the very drift where the thing lay and a dreary temptation dating probably from the old times when i had some wild beasts in the exhibition urged me to stir it up with a long pole i resisted it and bitterly weeping i turned away towards philippas bedside  as i walked i met mrs thompson  does she hate him she asked suddenly  forgiveness is a christian virtue i answered evasively  i could not trust this woman  listen she said and try to understand if i thought she hated him i would tell her something if she thought you hated them he would tell me something if ye or you thought he hated her i would tell him something i will wait and see  she left me to make the best which was not much of her enigmatical words  she was evidently a strange woman  i felt that she was mixed up in sir runans early life and that we were mixed up in sir runans early deathin fact that everything was very mixed indeed  she came back give me your name and college she said not necessarily for publication and i divined that she had once been a proctor at girton i gave her my address at the publichouse round the corner and we parted mrs thompson whispering that she would write  on reaching home i leaped to philippas apartment  a great change had come over her  she was awake  i became at once a prey to the wildest anxiety  the difficulties of my position for the first time revealed themselves to me if philippa remained insane how was i to remove her from the scene of heralas of her crime if philippa had become sane her position under my roof was extremely compromising again if she were insane a jury might acquit her when the snow melted and revealed all that was left of the baronet but in that case what pleasure or profit could i derive from the society of an insane philippa supposing on the other hand she was sane then was i not an accessory after the fact and liable to all the pains and penalties of such a crime  here the final question arose and shook its ghostly finger at me can a sane man be an accessory after the fact in a murder committed by an insane woman  so far as i know there is no monograph on this subject or certainly i would have consulted it for the purpose of this christmas annual  all these questions swept like lightning through my brain as i knelt by philippas bedside and awaited her first word  bon jour philippine i said  basil she replied where am i  under my roofyour brothers roof i said  brother oh stow that bosh she said turning languidly away  there could not be a doubt of it philippa was herself again  i rose pensively and wandered out towards the stables  covered with white snow over a white macintosh i met by the coachhouse door william the sphynx  the white groom  twiddling a small object a doorkey of peculiar make in his hand he grinned stolidly at me  shes a rum un squire your sister she be chuckled the sphynx  william i said go to roding and bring back two nurses even if they have to hire twenty drags to draw them here and william bring some drugs in the drags  by setting him on this expedition i got rid of the sphynx was he a witness he was certainly acquainted with the nature of an oath     chapter vihard as nails  of course when i woke next morning my first thought was of philippa my second was of the weather always interesting meteorological observation becomes peculiarly absorbing when it entirely depends on the thermometer whether you shall or shall not be arrested as an accessory after the fact or as lawyers say postmortem my heart sank into my boots or rather for i had not yet dressed into my slippers when i found that for the first time during sixteen days the snow had ceased falling i threw up the sash the cold air cut me like a knife mechanically i threw up the sponge it struck hard against the ceiling and fell back a mass of brittle jingling icicles so severe was the iron frost that had bound it  i gathered up a handful of snow from the windowsill it crumbled in my fingers like patent camphorated toothpowder for which purpose i instantly proceeded to use it necessity is the mother of invention then i turned as a final test to my bath oh joy it was frozen ten inches thick no tub for me today i ran downstairs gleefully and glanced at the thermometer outside my study window hooray it registered twenty degrees below zero it registered that reminded me of my oath i registered it once more regardless of legal expenses  my spirits rose as rapidly as the glass had fallen the wind was due east not generally a matter for indecent exultation  but while the wind was due east so long the frost would last and that white mass on the roadside would remain in statu quo  so long philippa was safe  after that her fate and mine too depended on the eccentricities of a jury the chartered libertinism of an ermined judge the humour of the law on a series of points without precedent concerning which no monograph had as yet been written and as a last desperate resource on the letters of a sympathetic british public in the penny papers the penny papers the criminals latest broadsheet anchor under the exasperating circumstances philippa remained as well as could be expected she spoke little but ate and drank a good deal day after day the brave black frost lasted and the snowy grave hid all that it would have been highly inconvenient for me to have discovered the heavens themselves seemed to be shielding us and working for us do the heavens generally shield accessories after the fact and ladies who have shortened the careers of their lords these questions i leave to the casuist the meteorologist the compilers of weather forecasts and other constituted authorities on matters connected with theology and the state of the barometer  i have not given the year in which these unobtrusive events occurred  many who can remember that mighty fall of snow exceeding aught in the recollection of the oldest inhabitant and the time during which the frost kept it on the earth will be able and willing to fix the date  i do not object to their thus occupying their leisure with chronological research  if they feel at all baffled by the difficulties of the problem i will give them an additional light since that year there has been no weather like it  answers may be sent to the puzzle editor of truth  day by day philippa grew better and better this appears to be the usual result of excessively seasonable weather acting on a constitution previously undermined by bigamy murder and similar excesses  i spare all technical summary of the case sufficient to say that this was one of the rare instances in which the mind totally unhinged is restored to its balance by sixty drops of laudanum taken fasting with a squeeze of lemon after violent exercise on an empty stomach  the case is almost unique but had things fallen out otherwise this story could never have been got ready in time to romp in before the other christmas annuals  matters would have become really too complicated  as philippa recovered it became more and more evident even to the most dilatory mind that the sooner she left the scene of her late unrehearsed performance the better  the baronet had not yet been missedindeed he never was missed and that is one of the very most remarkable points in the whole affair  when he did come to be missed however he would naturally be sought for in the neighbourhood of the most recent and attractive of his wives  that wife was philippa  everything pointed to instant flight  but how was i to get philippa to see this ex hypothesi she knew nothing of the murder on the other hand all her pure though passionate nature would revolt against sharing my home longer than was necessary but would not the same purity prevent her from accompanying me abroad  brother and sister we had called ourselves but philippa had never been the dupe of this terminology  besides was not her position in any case just a little shady  an idea now occurred to me for the first time many men would long ere now have asked their mothers to chaperon them it flashed across me that i had a mother  he who says mother says chaperon  i would take my philippa to my mother philippa was now completely convalescent  i can only attribute my lingering to the sense of fatality that all things would come round and be all square  love i had laid aside till i could see my way a little clearer in the certainly perplexing combination of circumstances nevertheless philippa i say it advisedly seemed to me a good deal more pure and innocent than when we first met true she had been secretly married to a man under a name which she knew to be false  true she had given birth to a baby whose later fate remains a mystery even to this day true her hands were stained with the blood of sir runan errand  but why speak of redistribution why agitate for womans suffrage if trifles like these are to obstruct a girls path in society  philippas wrongs had goaded her to madness her madness was responsible for the act she was not mad any longer therefore she was not responsible therefore philippa was innocent  if she became mad again then it would be time to speak of guilt  but would these arguments be as powerful with a british as they certainly would have proved with a french jury  once philippa seemed to awaken to a sense of the situation  once she asked me how she came to my home that night  you came out of the whirling snow and in a high state of delirium i answered epigrammatically  i thought i came on foot she replied dreamily  but basil she went on what afterwards whats the next move my noble sportsman  what indeed philippa had me there  clearly it was time to move  in order to avert suspicion i thought it was better not to shut up my house  for the same purpose i did a little in crime on my own account  a man tires of only being an accessory  william the sphynx obviously was in the know as sporting characters say was in the know of what was in the snow i must silence william  i took my measures quietly  first i laid in two dozen of very curious pale sherry at halfacrown  i bought each bottle at a separate shop in a different disguise making twentyfour in all that my proceedings might not attract attention  i laid down the deadly fluid with all proper caution in the cellar  at parting from william i gave him five shillings and the cellar key telling him to be very careful and await my instructions  i knew well that long before my instructions could reach him the faithful william would be speechless and far beyond the reach of human science  his secret would sleep with the white groom  then philippa and i drove to town philippa asking me conundrums like nebuchadnezzar  there was something i dreamed of tell me what it was she asked  but though better informed than the wise men and soothsayers of old i did not gratify her unusual desire  on reaching town i drove straight to the hotel at which my mother was staying  it was one of those highlypriced private hotels in the new out  as however i had no desire to purchase this place of entertainment the exorbitant value set on it by its proprietors did not affect my spirits  in a few minutes i had told my mother all save two things the business of the baby and the fate which had overtaken sir runan  with these trifling exceptions she knew all  to fall into philippas arms was to my still active parent the work of a moment  then philippa looked at me with an artless wink  basil my brother you are really too good  ah how happy i should have felt could that one dark nights work have been undone     chapter viirescue and retire  hitherto i have said little about my mother and i may even seem to have regarded that lady in the light of a temporary convenience my readers will however already have guessed that my mother was no common character  consider for a moment the position which she so readily consented to occupy  the trifling details about the sudden decease of sir runan and the affair of the baby as we have seen i had thought it better not to name to her  matters therefore in her opinion stood thus  philippa was the victim of a baronets wiles  when off with the new love she had promptly returned and passed a considerable time under the roof of the old love that is of myself  then i had suddenly arrived with this eligible prospective daughterinlaw at my mothers highpriced hotel and i kept insisting that we should at once migrate we three to foreign partsthe more foreign the better  i had especially dilated on the charms of the scenery and the salubrity of the climate in countries where there was no extradition treaty with england  even if there was nothing in these circumstances to arouse the watchful jealousy of a mother it must be remembered that as a chaperon she did seem to come a little late in the day  as you have lived together so long without me some parents would have observed you can do without me altogether  none of these trivial objections occurred to my mother  she was goodnature itself  just returned from a professional tour on the continent she was i should have said in the profession herself and admirably filled the exigeant part of stout lady in a highly respectable exhibition my mother at once began to pack up her properties and make ready to accompany us  never was there a more goodhumoured chaperon if one of us entered the room where she was sitting with the other she would humorously give me a push and observing two is company young people three is none would toddle off with all the alacrity that her figure and age permitted  i learned from inquiries addressed to the family herald correspondence column that the soudan was then even as it is now the land safest against english law spain in this respect was reckoned a bad second  the very next day i again broached the subject of foreign travel to my mother it was already obvious that the frost would not last for ever once the snow melted once the crushed mass that had been a baronet was discovered circumstantial evidence would point to philippa true there was no one save myself who could positively swear that philippa had killed sir runan again though i could positively swear it my knowledge was only an inference of my own philippa herself had completely forgotten the circumstance but the suspicions of the bearded woman and of the white groom were sure to be aroused and the soudan i resolved to seek without an hours delay  i reckoned without my hostess  my mother at first demurred  you certainly dont look well basil but why the soudan  a whim a sick mans fancy perhaps because it is not so very remote from old calabar the country of philippas own father mother tell me how do you like her  she is the woman you love and however shady her antecedents however peculiar her style of conversation she is she must be blameless to say more after so short an acquaintance might savour of haste and exaggeration  a womans logic  then you will come to the soudan with us tomorrow  no my child further south than spain i will not go not this journey  here philippa entered  well whats the next news old man she said  to spain tomorrow       rain rain go to spain      be sure you dont come back again  sang sweet philippa in childish high spirits  i had rarely seen her thus  alas philippas nursery charm against the rain proved worse than unavailing  that afternoon after several months of brave black frost which had gripped the land in its stern clasp the rain began to fall heavily  the white veil of snow gradually withdrew  all that night i dreamed of the white snow slowly vanishing from the white hat  next morning the snow had vanished and the white hat must have been obvious to the wayfaring man though a fool  next morning and the next and the next found me still in london  why  my mother was shopping  oh the awful torture of having a gay mother shopping the solemn hours away when each instant drew her son nearer to the doom of an accessory after the fact  my mother did not object to travel but she did like to have her little comforts about her  she occupied herself in purchasing  a waterbed  a boule or hotwater bottle  a portable stove  a travelling kitchenrange  a medicine chest  a complete set of ollendorff  ten thousand pots of dundee marmalade and such other articles as she deemed essential to her comfort and safety during the expedition in vain i urged that our motto was rescue and retire and that such elaborate preparations might prevent our retiring from our native shore and therefore make rescue exceedingly problematical  my tory mother only answered by quoting the example of lord wolseley and the nile expedition  how long did they tarry among the potsthe marmalade pots said my mother did they start before every mess had its proper share of extra teaspoons in case of accident and a double supply of patent respirators for the drummerboys and of snowshoes for the canadian boatmen in case the climate proved uncertain  my mothers historical knowledge and the unique example of provident and exhaustive equipment which she cited reduced me to silence but did not diminish my anxiety the delay made me nervous excited and chippy  tomorrow morning we were to start  tomorrow morning was too late  with an effort i opened the morning paperthe morning post as it happenedand ran hastily up and down the columns active exercise having been recommended to me what cared i for politics foreign news or even the sportive intelligence all i sought for was a paragraph headed horrible disclosures or awful death of a baronet i ran up and down the columns in vain  no such item of news met my eye joyously i rose to go when my eye fell on the standard  mechanically i opened it  those words were written or so they seemed to me to be written in letters of fire though the admirable press at shoe lane did not really employ that suitable medium  horrible discovery near roding  at once the truth flashed across me the morning post had not contained the intelligence because  the government had boycotted the morning post  only journals which more or less supported the government were permitted to obtain copy of such thrilling interest  and yet they speak of a free press and a free country  tearing myself away from these reflections i bent my mind on the awful paragraph  the melting of the snow has thrown a lurid light on the mysterious disappearance which up to this moment had attracted no attention of an eccentric baronet well known in sporting circles yesterday afternoon a gentlemans groom wading down the highway discovered the white hat of a gentleman floating on the muddy stream into which the unparalleled weather and the negligence of the road trustees has converted our thoroughfare an inscription in red ink within the lining leaves no doubt that this article of dress is all that is left of the late sir runan errand the unfortunate noblemans friends have been communicated with the active and intelligent representative of the local police believes that he is in possession of a clue to the author of the crime probably the body of the murdered noble has been carried down by the flooded road to the sea  i tore that paper to pieces and used it to wrap up sandwiches for the journey  once again i say if you cannot feel with me throw this tale aside heaven knows it is a sombre one and it goes on getting sombrer and sombrer but probably by this time you have either tossed the work away or looked at the end to see what happened to them all  the morning dawned  i filled my bag with hanover pieces which i thought might come in handy on the spanish turf and packed up three or four yellow red green and blue opera hats so useful to the adventurous bookmaker  at this very moment the postman arrived and gave me a letter in a womans hand  i thrust it in my breast pocket recklessly  the cab rattled away  at last we were off  i am sure that no one who could have seen us that morning would have dreamt that out of that party of threea more than comfortablelooking english matron a girl whose strange beauty has been sufficiently dwelt upon and a gentleman in a yellow crush hat and a bookmakers bagtwo were flying from the hands of justice  our appearance was certainly such as to disarm all suspicion  but appearances are proverbially deceitful were ours deceitful enough  but where are we going said my mother with the short memory of old age  to paris first then to spain and if needful down to khartoum  then you young people will have to go alone i draw the line at dongola  i glanced at philippa  then for the first time since her malady i saw philippa blushing her long curved eyelashes hid her eyes which presumably were also pink but certainly my mothers broad pleasantry had called a telltale blush to the cheek of the young person  as we drew near folkestone i remembered the letter but the sight of the roding postmark induced me to defer opening it till we should be on board the steamer when philippa was battling with the agonies of the voyage then undisturbed i might ascertain what mrs thompson for it was sure to be mrs thompson had to say  we were now on board philippa and my mother fled to the depths of the saloon and i opened the fateful missive it began without any conventional formalities and the very first words blanched a cheek already pale  i see yer  this strange epistle commenced  i know why sir runan never reached my house i know the reason it was only too obvious for her strange excited state i know how he met the death he deserved  i never had the pluck none of the rest of us ever had the pluck we all swore wed swing for him as one after another he wedded and deserted us the twoheaded nightingale swore it and the missing link and the spotted girl and the strong woman who used to double up horseshoes now she doubles up her perambulator with her children in it but she never doubled up him  as to your sister tell her from me that she is all right she has made herself his widow she is the dowager lady errand  the fact is the live mermaid was never alive at all she was a putup thing of waxwork and a stuffed salmo ferox his pretended marriage with her is therefore a mere specious excuse to enable him to avoid your sisters claims  now he is dead your sister can take the name title and estates i wish she may get them     chapter viiilocal colour  i read the womans letter again and again read it with feelings of the most mingled description first i reflected with solemn pride that philippa was more than an honest woman that she really was a baronets lady after we were married she should keep her title many people do how well it would sound when we entered a room together dr south and lady errand yet on second thoughts would not this conjunction of names rather set people asking questions  yes disagreeable associations might be revived  my second thought was that if mrs thompson kept her word we might as well go home at once without bothering about the soudan the white groom i felt certain had long been speechless there was thus no one to connect lady errand with the decease of sir runan  moreover philippas selfrespect was now assured she had lost it when she learned that she was not sir runans wife she would regain it when she became aware that she had made herself sir runans widow such is the character of feminine morality as i understand the workings of womans heart  i had reached this point in my soliloquy when i reflected that perhaps i had better not tell philippa anything about it  you see things were so very mixed because philippas memory was so curiously constructed that she had entirely forgotten the murder which she had committed and even if i proved to her by documentary evidence that she had only murdered her own husband it might not help to relieve her burdened conscience as much as i had hoped there are times when i almost give up this story in despair to introduce a heroine who is mad in and out so to speak and forgets and remembers things exactly at the right moment seems a delightfully simple artifice  but upon my word i am constantly forgetting what it is that philippa should remember and on the point of making her remember the very things she forgets  so puzzled had i become that i consoled myself by cursing sir runans memory de mortuis nil nisi bonum  what a lot of trouble a single little murder of which one thinks little enough at the time often gives a fellow  all this while we were approaching paris  the stains of travel washed away my mother gave a sigh of satisfaction as she seated herself at the dinner table as any one might guess who looked at her she was no despiser of the good things of this life that very night we went to the hippodrome where we met many old acquaintances my own artillery twins were there and kissed their hands to me as they flew gracefully over our heads towards the desired trapeze here also was the tattooed man and i grasped his variegated and decorative hand with an emotion i have rarely felt without vanity i may say that philippa and my mother had a succès fou  from the moment when they entered their box every lorgnette was fixed upon them  all paris was there the tout paris of premières of les courses the tout paris of clubsman of belles petites of ladies à chignon jaune here were the booksmen the gommeux they who font courir the journalists and here i observed with peculiar interest my great masters m fortuné du boisgobey and m xavier de montépin  in the intervals of the performance tout le monde crowded into our loge and i observed that my mother and lady errand made an almost equal impression on many a gallant and enterprising young impresario  we supped at the cafe bignon toasts were carried i also was carried home  next morning i partly understood the mental condition of philippa i had absolutely forgotten the events of the later part of the entertainment  several bills arrived for windows which it seems i had broken in a moment of effusion  gendarmes arrived and would have arrested me on a charge of having knocked down some thirtyseven of their number  this little matter was easily arranged  i apologised separately and severally to each of the thirtyseven braves hommes and collectively to the whole corps the french army the president the republic and the statue of strasbourg in the place de la concorde these duties over i was at leisure to reflect on the injustice of english law  certain actions which i had entirely forgotten i expiated at the cost of a few thousand francs and some dozen apologies  for only one action about which she remembered nothing at all philippa had to fly from english justice and give up her title and place in society both ladies now charmed me with a narrative of the compliments that had been paid them both absolutely declined to leave paris  i want to look at the shops said my mother  i want the gommeux to look at me said philippa  neither of them saw the least fun in my proposed expedition to spain  weeks passed and found us still in the capital of pleasure  my large fortune except a few insignificant thousands had passed away in the fleeting exhilaration of baccarat  we must do something to restore our wealth  my mother had an idea  basil she said you speak of spain you long to steep yourself in local colour you sigh for hidalgos sombreros carbonados and carboncillos why not combine business with pleasure  why not take the alhambra  this was an idea  where could we be safer than under the old moorish flag  philippa readily fell in with my mothers proposal when woman has once tasted of public admiration when once she has stepped on the boards she retires without enthusiasm even at the age of forty  i had thought said philippa of exhibiting myself at the social science congress and lecturing on selfadvertisement and the ethical decline of the moral show business with some remarks on waxworks but the alhambra sounds ever so much more toney  it was decided on  i threw away the baedeker and murray and fords spain on which i had been relying for three chapters of padding and local colour i ceased to think of the very old churches of st croix and st seurin and a variety of other interesting objects i did not bother about st sebastian and the valley of the giralda and burgos the capital of the old castilian kingdom and the absorbing glories of the departed moore gladly gaily i completed the necessary negotiations and found myself with philippa my mother and many of my old troupe in the dear old alhambra safe under the shelter of the gay old moorish flag  shake off black gloom basil south and make things skip  you have conquered fate     chapter ixsaved saved  glorious wonderful alhambra magical cuadrado de leicestero philippa and i were as happy as children and the house was full every night  we called everything by spanish names and played perpetually at being spaniards  the foyer we named a patioa space fragrant with the perfume of oranges which the public were always sucking and perilous with peel add to this a refreshmentroom refectorio full of the rarest old cigarros and redolent of aqua de soda and aguardiente here the botellas of aqua de soda were continually popping and the corchos flying with a murmur of merry voices and of mingling waters here half through the night you could listen to       the delight of happy laughter      the delight of low replies  with such surroundings almost those of a sybarite who can blame me for being lulled into security and telling myself that my troubles were nearly at an end who can wonder at the cháteaux en espagne that i built as i lounged in the patio and assisted my customers to consume the media aqua de soda or split soda of the country sometimes we roamed as far as the alcazar sometimes we wandered to the oxford or laughed lightheartedly in the stalls of the alegria  such was our life so in calm and peace for we had secured a tory chuckerouto from birmingham passed the even tenor of out days  as to marrying philippa it had always been my intention  whether she was or was not lady errand whether she had or had not precipitated the hour of her own widowhood made no kind of difference to me  a moment of illjudged haste had been all her crime  that moment had passed philippa was not that moment i was not marrying that moment but philippa  picture then your basil naming and insisting on the day yet somehow the day had not yet arrived it did however arrive at last  the difficulty now arose under which name was philippa to be married  to tell you the truth i cannot remember under which name philippa was married it was a difficult point if she wedded me under her maiden name and if mrs thompsons letter contained the truth then would the wedding be legal and binding  if she married me under the name of lady errand and if mrs thompsons letter was false then would the wedding be all square  so far as i know there is no monograph on the subject or there was none at the time  be it as it may wedded we were  morality was now restored to the show business the legitimate drama began to look up and the hopes of the social science congress were fulfilled  but evil days were at hand  one day philippa and i were lounging in the patio when i heard the young hidalgosor macheros as they are calledtalking as they smoked their princely cigaritos  sir runan errand said one of them where hes gone under a rare bad lot he was  murdered replied the other nothing ever found of him but his hat  what a rum go replied the other  i looked at philippa she had heard all i saw her dark brow contract in anguish she was beating her breast furiouslyher habit in moments of agitation  then i seem to remember that i and the two hidalgos bore philippa to a couch in the patio while i smiled and smiled and talked of the heat of the weather  when philippa came back to herself she looked at me with her wondrous eyes and said  basil tell me the square truth honest injun what had i been up to that night     chapter xnot too mad but just mad enough  it was out she knew  what was i to say how evade her impulsive crossexaminations i fell back upon evasions  why do i want to know she echoed because i choose to i hated him he took a walk i took a walk and i had taken something before i took a walk if we met i was bound to have words with him basil did i dream it or read it long ago in some old penny dreadful of the past  philippa occasionally broke into blank verse like this but not often  dearest it must have been a dream  i said catching at this hope of soothing her  no no she screamed nono dream not any more thank you i can see myself standing now over that crushed white mass basil i could never bear him in that hat and i must have gone for him  i consoled philippa as well as i could but she kept screaming  how did i kill him  goodness only knows philippa i replied but you had a key in your handa doorkey  ah that fatal latchkey she said the cause of our final quarrel where is it what have you done with it she shouted  i threw it away i replied this was true but i could not think of anything better to say  you threw it away didnt you know it would become a pièce justificatif said my poor philippa who had not read gaboriau to no purpose  i passed the night wrestling in argument with philippa she reproached me for having returned from spain which was quite safe you knowit is the place city men go to when they bust up she remarked in her peculiarly idiomatic style she reproved me for not having told her all about it before in which case she would never have consented to return to england  they will try methey will hang me she repeated  not a bit i answered i can prove that you were quite out of your senses when you did for him  you prove it she sneered a pretty lawyer you are why they wont take a husbands evidence for or against a wife in a criminal case this comes of your insisting on marrying me  but i doubt if we are married philippa dear as we never could remember whether you were wedded under your maiden name or as philippa errand besides i was going to say that william the white groom late the sphynx could show to her having been as he once expressed it as crazy as a loon but i remembered in time william had doubtless long been speechless  the sherry must have done its fatal work  this is the worst of committing crimes they do nothing very often but complicate matters  had i not got rid of williambut it was too late for remorse as to the evidence of her nurses i forgot all about that i tried to console philippa on another line  i remarked that if she had gone for sir runan she had only served him right  then i tried to restore her selfrespect by quoting the bearded womans letter  i pointed out that she had been lady errand after all  this gave philippa no comfort  it makes things worse she said i thought i had only got rid of my betrayer and now you say i have killed my husband you men have no tact  besides philippa went on after pausing to reflect i have not bettered myself one bit if i had not gone for him i would be lady errand and no end of a swell and now im only plain mrs basil south speaking thus philippa wept afresh and refused to be comforted  her remarks were not flattering to my selfesteem  at this time i felt with peculiar bitterness the blanks in philippas memory nothing is more difficult than to make your heroine not too mad but just mad enough  had philippa been a trifle saner or less under the influence of luncheon at first she would either never have murdered sir runan at all which perhaps would have been the best course or she would have known how she murdered him  the entire absence of information on this head added much to my perplexities  on the other hand had philippa been a trifle madder or more under the influence of luncheon nothing could ever have recalled the event to her memory at all  as it is my poor wife if she was my wife a subject on which i intend to submit a monograph to a legal contemporary my poor wife was almost provoking in what she forgot and what she remembered  one day as my dear patient was creeping about the patio she asked me if i saw all the papers  i said i saw most of them  well look at them all for who knows how many may be boycotted by the present government in a boycotted print you dont know but you may miss an account of how some fellow was hanged for what i did i believe two people cant be executed for the same crime now if any one swings for sir runan i am safe but it might happen and you never know it  dear philippa ever thoughtful for others i promised to read every one of the papers and i was soon rewarded for the unparalleled tedium of these studies     chapter xia terrible temptation  i hate looking back and reading words which i have written when the printers devil was waiting for copy in the hall but i fancy i have somewhere called this tale a confession if not i meant to do so it has no more claim to be called a work of art than the cheapest penny dreadful how could it  it holds but two characters a man and a woman  all the rest are the merest supers perhaps you may wonder that i thus anticipate criticism but reviewwriting is so easy that i may just as well fill up with this as with any other kind of padding  my publisher insists on so many pages of copy when he does not get what he wants the language rich and powerful enough to serve his needs has yet to be invented  but he struggles on with the help of a dictionary of american expletives  however we are coming to the conclusion and that i think will waken the public up and yet this chapter will be a short one it will be the review of a struggle against a temptation to commit not perhaps crime but an act of the grossest bad taste  to that temptation i succumbed we both succumbed  it is a temptation to which i dare think poor human nature has rarely been subjected  the temptation to go and see a man a fellowcreature tried for a crime which ones wife committed and to which one is an accessory after the fact  oh that morning  how well i remember it  breakfast was just oyer the table with its relics of fragrant bloaters and terrine of paté still stood in the patio  i was alone i loafed lazily and at my ease  then i lighted a princely havanna blaming myself for profaning the scented air from el cuadro de leicester  you see i have such a sensitive aesthetic conscience  then i took from my pocket the sporting times and set listlessly to work to skim its lengthy columns  this was owing to my vow to philippa that i would read every journal published in england as the day went on i often sat with them up to my shoulders and littering all the patio  i ran down the topics of the day this scene is an understudy by the way of the other scene in which i read of the discovery of sir runans hat at last i turned my attention to the provincial news column a name a familiar name caught my eye the name of one who i had fondly fancied had longlain unburied in my cellar at the pike my princely havanna fell unheeded on the marble pavement of the patio as with indescribable amazement i read the following par  william evans the man accused of the murder of sir runan errand will be tried at the newnham assizes on the 20th the case which excites considerable interest among the élite of boding and district will come on the tapis the first day of the meeting the evidence will be of a purely circumstantial kind  every word of that par was a staggerer i sat as one stunned dazed stupid motionless with my eye on the sheet  was ever man in such a situation before  your wife commits a murder  you become an accessory after the fact  you take steps to destroy one of the two people who suspect the truth  and then you find that the man on whom you committed murder is accused of the murder which you and your wife committed  the sound of my mothers voice scolding philippa wakened me from my stupor they were coming  i could not face them  doubling up the newspaper i thrust it into my pocket and sped swiftly out of the patio  where did i go i scarcely remember i think it must have been to one of the public gardens or publichouses i am not certain which all sense of locality left me i found at last some lonely spot and there i threw myself on the ground dug my fingernails into the dry ground and held on with all the tenacity of despair in the wild whirl of my brain i feared that i might be thrown off into infinite space this sensation passed off at first i thought i had gone mad then i felt pretty certain that it must be the other people who had gone mad  i had killed william evans  my wife had killed runan errand  how then could runan errand have been killed by william evans  which is absurd i found myself saying in the language of eukleides the grand old greek  human justice what is justice see how it can err was there ever such a boundless unlimited blunder in the whole annals of penny fiction probably not i remember nothing like it in all the learned pages of the london journal and the family herald mrs henry wood and miss braddon never dreamed of aught like this philippa must be told it was too good a joke would she laugh would she be alarmed  picture me lying on the ground with the intelligence fresh in my mind  i felt confidence on the whole in philippas sense of humour  then rose the temptation  trust this man william evans late the sphynx to the vaunted array of justice  let him have a run for his money  nay more  go down and see the fun  why hesitate you cannot possibly be implicated in the deed you will enjoy a position nearly unique in human history you will see the man of whose murder you thought you were guilty tried for the offence which you know was committed by your wife  every sin is not easy my sense of honour arose against this temptation i struggled but i was mastered i would go and see the trial home i went and broached the subject to philippa the brave girl never blenched she had no hesitations no scruples to conquer  oh basil she exclaimed with sparkling eyes wot larx when do we start  the reader will admit that i did myself no injustice when at the commencement of this tale i said i had wallowed in crime     chapter xiijudge juggins  we got down to newnham where the sizes were held on the morning of september 20th there we discovered that we had an hour or two for refreshment and i may say that both philippa and i employed that time to the best advantage while at the hotel i tried to obtain the file of the times i wanted to look back and see if i could find the account of the magisterial proceedings against the truly unlucky william evans  after all should i call him unlucky he had escaped the snare i had laid for him and perhaps such things have been even a newnham jury might find him not guilty  but the file of the times was not forthcoming  i asked the sleepyeyed teutonic waiter for it he merely answered with the fatuous patronising grin of the german kellner  you vant  i want the file of the times  i have the corkscrew of the good landlord but the file of the times i have it not have you your boots your fishsauce your currycomb he went on then lapsing into irrelevant local gossip the granddaughter of the blacksmith has the landingnet of the bad tailor  i want my bill my note my addition my consommation i answered angrily  very good bed very good posthorse he replied at random and i left the county hotel without being able to find out why suspicion had fallen on william evans  we hailed one of the cabs which stood outside the hotel door when a heavy hand was laid on my shoulder and a voice strange but not unfamiliar exclaimed dr south as i am a baronet  i turned round suddenly and found myself face to face with  sir runan errand  my brain once more began to reel here were the real victim and the true perpetrators of a murder come to view the trial of the man who was charged with having committed it  though i was trembling like an aspen leaf i remembered that we lived in an age of telepathy and psychical research  sir runan was doubtless what messrs myers and gurney call a visible apparition as distinguished from the common invisible apparition  if a real judge confesses like sir e hornby to having seen a ghost why should not a mere accessory after the fact  regaining my presence of mind i asked what brings you here  oh to see the fun he replied fellow being tried for killing me the morbid interest excited round here is very great doubt your getting front seats  cant you manage it for me i asked imploringly  daresay i can here take my card and just mention my name and theyll let you in case for the prosecution by the way most feeble  here the appearance handing me a card nodded and vanished in the crowd  i returned to philippa where i had left her in the fourwheeler we drove off and found ourselves before a doubleswinging ay ominous as it seemed swinging plain oak door over which in old english letters was written  criminal court  i need not describe the aspect of the court probably most of my readers have at some time in their lives found themselves in such a place  true to the minute the redrobed judge appears it is sir joshua juggins well known for his severity as gibbeting juggins  ah there is little hope for william evans  i have learned from a neighbour in court the evidence against evans is purely circumstantial he has been found in possession of a peculiar key believed to have belonged to sir runan  well may they call the case for the prosecution weak  william must have found that fatal key which philippa took from the slain man  on that accident the whole presumption of his guilt is founded  the grand jury country gentlemenidiots all find a true bill  the clerk reads the indictment that he william evans did feloniously wilfully and of malice aforethought kill and murder sir runan errand baronet  as the reading goes on philippa is strangely moved  basil she whispered dont you see the splendid unequalled chance for an advertisement ill get up and make a speech and say i did it of course they cant prove it but it will set every one talking and bring hundreds of pounds into the house every night  i now observed that philippa had half slipped off her mantle and bonnet beneath these coverings she was dressed in wig and gown like mrs weldon in the photographs  for goodness sake philippa dont i whispered  the clerk turned to william evans the prisoner at the bar  are you guilty or not guilty  in the silence a cigaretteash might have been heard to drop if any one had been smoking  the long silence was broken but not by the prisoner  by philippa  rising to all her stately height with her flowing robes around her she stood at bay then her clear deep voice rang out  my lord i was the party that did it  order in the court order in the court cried the ushers  i commit you i commit you thundered lord justice juggins take her away five years and hard labour  struggling violently philippa was dragged away by the minions of the law  i notice one visitor turn round and gaze at the commotion  it is mrs thompson the bearded woman  silence has scarcely been restored when it is again broken  a manly form rises a deep voice exclaims  my lord the prisoner is innocent i am the person whom he is said to have murdered  the form the voiceit is sir runan errand  again i hear the sharp accents of mr justice juggins  is this court a beargarden or the house of commons take that man out give him five years and two dozen lashes  scarcely had the court resumed its wonted aspect of business scarcely had the prisoner again been asked to plead when a shrill voice shattered the stillness  my lord the key found in the prisoners possession is my cellarkey  this time the bold interrupter was mrs thompson the bearded woman  five years as usual and hard labour said sir joshua juggins wearily he was tiring of his task please my lord it warnt none of me came a hoarse whisper from the prisoner at the bar  who asked you to speak is that the way to plead snapped the judge give him five years also for contempt of court  william evans was carried out in hysterics  the plot the mystery had thickened  i now felt that there was only one way of fathoming the secret of the crime i also must get myself committed then i would be able to rejoin the other actors in this strange drama and learn their motives and the real facts of the case  in a moment my resolution was taken  springing to my feet i exclaimed in clarion tones  my lord i am an accessory after the fact  sir joshua juggins gave a cry of despair then mastering himself he whispered  take that idiot away and give him penal servitude for life  as i left the court in chains i heard the next case being called     chapter xiiicleared up from the green park gazette  the legitimate public interest in the nownham mystery suggested to us the propriety of sending one of our young men down to interview all parties after having visited the maori king mrs weldon several eminent advertisers and the crew of the mignonette he felt that his present task was a light one he had to see the murderer william evans the murderess mrs south or lady errand the accessory after the fact dr south the victim sir runan errand and mrs thompson the owner of the key on which the case for the prosecution hinged  his adventures in the various asylums where those unhappy persons are unconfined have little public interest we print the confessions just as our young man took them down in shorthand from the lips of the sufferers  the confession of sir runan errand  i need not tell you that i never was even the husband of the woman phllippa at all she stood in no relation to me except as one of the persons in the troupe which i was foolish enough to manage instead of visiting her in january last to settle her pecuniary claims against me i sent my valet it appears that the man wore an old hat of mine which he lost in the storm that was not the only article of property belonging to me he carried off i have since had a penitent letter from him he is doing well in the united states and has been elected to the legislature i have given up the freak of dabbling in the show business and merely keep a private theatre at such a distance from human abodes that no one can complain of it as a nuisance since the disappearance of my valet i have been travelling in my own yacht i reached england the day before the trial no i never read the newspapers thank goodness i am no bookworm   the confession of philippa south calling herself lady errand  i tell you again as i told you before i know nothing about what i did that night go back to your employers  nothing more of a nature suited to our columns could be extracted from this lady   the confession of mrs thompson  i lost my cellar key the night philippa left my roof i now recognise it as the key in the possession of william evans how he got it i have no idea whatever   the confession of basil south md  i begin to understand it all at last the key which i took from philippa on the night of the storm and supposed murder had not been taken by her from sir runan  she had brought it with her from the house of mrs thompson with whom she had been residing  when i threw away a key which i believed to be the one i had taken from philippa i made a mistake  i threw away a key of my own when i thought i was giving william evans the key of my cellar with fatal intentions and designs hoping that he would never survive the contents of that cellar i really gave him the key i had taken from philippa  consequently the key would not fit the cellar lock  consequently william evans never tasted the fatal fluid and so escaped his doom  i have nothing to add to this confession except that i am deeply penitent and will never again offer a thoughtless public a christmas annual so absurd morbid and incoherent  this last statement made it unnecessary to interview william evans  all the other persons in this dismal affair are detained during her majestys displeasure
