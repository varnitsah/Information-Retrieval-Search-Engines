23540861	great catherine whom glory still adores  by george bernard shaw        in catherines reign whom glory still adores                                            byron     the authors apology for great catherine  exception has been taken to the title of this seeming tomfoolery on the ground that the catherine it represents is not great catherine but the catherine whose gallantries provide some of the lightest pages of modern history great catherine it is said was the catherine whose diplomacy whose campaigns and conquests whose plans of liberal reform whose correspondence with grimm and voltaire enabled her to cut such a magnificent figure in the eighteenth century in reply i can only confess that catherines diplomacy and her conquests do not interest me it is clear to me that neither she nor the statesmen with whom she played this mischievous kind of political chess had any notion of the real history of their own times or of the real forces that were moulding europe the french revolution which made such short work of catherines voltairean principles surprised and scandalized her as much as it surprised and scandalized any provincial governess in the french chateaux  the main difference between her and our modern liberal governments was that whereas she talked and wrote quite intelligently about liberal principles before she was frightened into making such talking and writing a flogging matter our liberal ministers take the name of liberalism in vain without knowing or caring enough about its meaning even to talk and scribble about it and pass their flogging bills and institute their prosecutions for sedition and blasphemy and so forth without the faintest suspicion that such proceedings need any apology from the liberal point of view  it was quite easy for patiomkin to humbug catherine as to the condition of russia by conducting her through sham cities run up for the occasion by scenic artists but in the little world of european court intrigue and dynastic diplomacy which was the only world she knew she was more than a match for him and for all the rest of her contemporaries in such intrigue and diplomacy however there was no romance no scientific political interest nothing that a sane mind can now retain even if it can be persuaded to waste time in reading it up but catherine as a woman with plenty of character and as we should say no morals still fascinates and amuses us as she fascinated and amused her contemporaries they were great sentimental comedians these peters elizabeths and catherines who played their tsarships as eccentric character parts and produced scene after scene of furious harlequinade with the monarch as clown and of tragic relief in the torture chamber with the monarch as pantomime demon committing real atrocities not forgetting the indispensable love interest on an enormous and utterly indecorous scale catherine kept this vast guignol theatre open for nearly half a century not as a russian but as a highly domesticated german lady whose household routine was not at all so unlike that of queen victoria as might be expected from the difference in their notions of propriety in sexual relations  in short if byron leaves you with an impression that he said very little about catherine and that little not what was best worth saying i beg to correct your impression by assuring you that what byron said was all there really is to say that is worth saying his catherine is my catherine and everybodys catherine the young man who gains her favor is a spanish nobleman in his version i have made him an english country gentleman who gets out of his rather dangerous scrape by simplicity sincerity and the courage of these qualities by this i have given some offence to the many britons who see themselves as heroes what they mean by heroes being theatrical snobs of superhuman pretensions which though quite groundless are admitted with awe by the rest of the human race they say i think an englishman a fool when i do they have themselves to thank  i must not however pretend that historical portraiture was the motive of a play that will leave the reader as ignorant of russian history as he may be now before he has turned the page nor is the sketch of catherine complete even idiosyncratically leaving her politics out of the question for example she wrote bushels of plays i confess i have not yet read any of them the truth is this play grew out of the relations which inevitably exist in the theatre between authors and actors if the actors have sometimes to use their skill as the authors puppets rather than in full selfexpression the author has sometimes to use his skill as the actors tailor fitting them with parts written to display the virtuosity of the performer rather than to solve problems of life character or history feats of this kind may tickle an authors technical vanity but he is bound on such occasions to admit that the performer for whom he writes is the onlie begetter of his work which must be regarded critically as an addition to the debt dramatic literature owes to the art of acting and its exponents those who have seen miss gertrude kingston play the part of catherine will have no difficulty in believing that it was her talent rather than mine that brought the play into existence i once recommended miss kingston professionally to play queens now in the modern drama there were no queens for her to play and as to the older literature of our stage did it not provoke the veteran actress in sir arthur pineros trelawny of the wells to declare that as parts queens are not worth a tinkers oath miss kingstons comment on my suggestion though more elegantly worded was to the same effect and it ended in my having to make good my advice by writing great catherine history provided no other queen capable of standing up to our joint talents  in composing such bravura pieces the author limits himself only by the range of the virtuoso which by definition far transcends the modesty of nature if my russians seem more muscovite than any russian and my english people more insular than any briton i will not plead as i honestly might that the fiction has yet to be written that can exaggerate the reality of such subjects that the apparently outrageous patiomkin is but a timidly bowdlerized ghost of the original and that captain edstaston is no more than a miniature that might hang appropriately on the walls of nineteen out of twenty english country houses to this day an artistic presentment must not condescend to justify itself by a comparison with crude nature and i prefer to admit that in this kind my dramatic personae are as they should be of the stage stagey challenging the actor to act up to them or beyond them if he can the more heroic the overcharging the better for the performance  in dragging the reader thus for a moment behind the scenes i am departing from a rule which i have hitherto imposed on myself so rigidly that i never permit myself even in a stage direction to let slip a word that could bludgeon the imagination of the reader by reminding him of the boards and the footlights and the sky borders and the rest of the theatrical scaffolding for which nevertheless i have to plan as carefully as if i were the head carpenter as well as the author but even at the risk of talking shop an honest playwright should take at least one opportunity of acknowledging that his art is not only limited by the art of the actor but often stimulated and developed by it no sane and skilled author writes plays that present impossibilities to the actor or to the stage engineer if as occasionally happens he asks them to do things that they have never done before and cannot conceive as presentable or possible as wagner and thomas hardy have done for example it is always found that the difficulties are not really insuperable the author having foreseen unsuspected possibilities both in the actor and in the audience whose willtomakebelieve can perform the quaintest miracles thus may authors advance the arts of acting and of staging plays but the actor also may enlarge the scope of the drama by displaying powers not previously discovered by the author if the best available actors are only horatios the authors will have to leave hamlet out and be content with horatios for heroes some of the difference between shakespeares orlandos and bassanios and bertrams and his hamlets and macbeths must have been due not only to his development as a dramatic poet but to the development of burbage as an actor playwrights do not write for ideal actors when their livelihood is at stake if they did they would write parts for heroes with twenty arms like an indian god indeed the actor often influences the author too much for i can remember a time i am not implying that it is yet wholly past when the art of writing a fashionable play had become very largely the art of writing it round the personalities of a group of fashionable performers of whom burbage would certainly have said that their parts needed no acting everything has its abuse as well as its use  it is also to be considered that great plays live longer than great actors though little plays do not live nearly so long as the worst of their exponents the consequence is that the great actor instead of putting pressure on contemporary authors to supply him with heroic parts falls back on the shakespearean repertory and takes what he needs from a dead hand in the nineteenth century the careers of kean macready barry sullivan and irving ought to have produced a group of heroic plays comparable in intensity to those of aeschylus sophocles and euripides but nothing of the kind happened these actors played the works of dead authors or very occasionally of live poets who were hardly regular professional playwrights sheridan knowles bulwer lytton wills and tennyson produced a few glaringly artificial high horses for the great actors of their time but the playwrights proper who really kept the theatre going and were kept going by the theatre did not cater for the great actors they could not afford to compete with a bard who was not for an age but for all time and who had moreover the overwhelming attraction for the actormanagers of not charging authors fees the result was that the playwrights and the great actors ceased to think of themselves as having any concern with one another tom robertson ibsen pinero and barrie might as well have belonged to a different solar system as far as irving was concerned and the same was true of their respective predecessors  thus was established an evil tradition but i at least can plead that it does not always hold good if forbes robertson had not been there to play caesar i should not have written caesar and cleopatra if ellen terry had never been born captain brassbounds conversion would never have been effected the devils disciple with which i won my cordon bleu in america as a potboiler would have had a different sort of hero if richard mansfield had been a different sort of actor though the actual commission to write it came from an english actor william terriss who was assassinated before he recovered from the dismay into which the result of his rash proposal threw him for it must be said that the actor or actress who inspires or commissions a play as often as not regards it as a frankensteins monster and will have none of it that does not make him or her any the less parental in the fecundity of the playwright  to an author who has any feeling of his business there is a keen and whimsical joy in divining and revealing a side of an actors genius overlooked before and unsuspected even by the actor himself when i snatched mr louis calvert from shakespeare and made him wear a frock coat and silk hat on the stage for perhaps the first time in his life i do not think he expected in the least that his performance would enable me to boast of his tom broadbent as a genuine stage classic mrs patrick campbell was famous before i wrote for her but not for playing illiterate cockney flowermaidens and in the case which is provoking me to all these impertinences i am quite sure that miss gertrude kingston who first made her reputation as an impersonator of the most delightfully featherheaded and inconsequent ingenues thought me more than usually mad when i persuaded her to play the helen of euripides and then launched her on a queenly career as catherine of russia  it is not the whole truth that if we take care of the actors the plays will take care of themselves nor is it any truer that if we take care of the plays the actors will take care of themselves there is both give and take in the business i have seen plays written for actors that made me exclaim how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds makes deeds ill done but burbage may have flourished the prompt copy of hamlet under shakespeares nose at the tenth rehearsal and cried how oft the sight of means to do great deeds makes playwrights great i say the tenth because i am convinced that at the first he denounced his part as a rotten one thought the ghosts speech ridiculously long and wanted to play the king anyhow whether he had the wit to utter it or not the boast would have been a valid one the best conclusion is that every actor should say if i create the hero in myself god will send an author to write his part for in the long run the actors will get the authors and the authors the actors they deserve  great catherine was performed for the first time at the vaudeville theatre in london on the 18th november 1913 with gertrude kingston as catherine miriam lewes as yarinka dorothy massingham as claire norman mckinnell as patiomkin edmond breon as edstaston annie hill as the princess dashkoff and eugene mayeur and f cooke beresford as naryshkin and the sergeant     great catherine     the first scene  1776 patiomkin in his bureau in the winter palace st petersburgh huge palatial apartment style russia in the eighteenth century imitating the versailles du roi soleil extravagant luxury also dirt and disorder  patiomkin gigantic in stature and build his face marred by the loss of one eye and a marked squint in the other sits at the end of a table littered with papers and the remains of three or four successive breakfasts he has supplies of coffee and brandy at hand sufficient for a party of ten his coat encrusted with diamonds is on the floor it has fallen off a chair placed near the other end of the table for the convenience of visitors his court sword with its attachments is on the chair his threecornered hat also bejewelled is on the table he himself is half dressed in an unfastened shirt and an immense dressinggown once gorgeous now foodsplashed and dirty as it serves him for towel handkerchief duster and every other use to which a textile fabric can be put by a slovenly man it does not conceal his huge hairy chest nor his halfbuttoned knee breeches nor his legs these are partly clad in silk stockings which he occasionally hitches up to his knees and presently shakes down to his shins by his restless movement his feet are thrust into enormous slippers worth with their crust of jewels several thousand roubles apiece  superficially patiomkin is a violent brutal barbarian an upstart despot of the most intolerable and dangerous type ugly lazy and disgusting in his personal habits yet ambassadors report him the ablest man in russia and the one who can do most with the still abler empress catherine ii who is not a russian but a german by no means barbarous or intemperate in her personal habits she not only disputes with frederick the great the reputation of being the cleverest monarch in europe but may even put in a very plausible claim to be the cleverest and most attractive individual alive now she not only tolerates patiomkin long after she has got over her first romantic attachment to him but esteems him highly as a counsellor and a good friend his love letters are among the best on record he has a wild sense of humor which enables him to laugh at himself as well as at everybody else in the eyes of the english visitor now about to be admitted to his presence he may be an outrageous ruffian in fact he actually is an outrageous ruffian in no matter whose eyes but the visitor will find out as everyone else sooner or later fends out that he is a man to be reckoned with even by those who are not intimidated by his temper bodily strength and exalted rank  a pretty young lady yarinka his favorite niece is lounging on an ottoman between his end of the table and the door very sulky and dissatisfied perhaps because he is preoccupied with his papers and his brandy bottle and she can see nothing of him but his broad back  there is a screen behind the ottoman  an old soldier a cossack sergeant enters   the sergeant softly to the lady holding the door handle little darling honey is his highness the prince very busy  varinka his highness the prince is very busy he is singing out of tune he is biting his nails he is scratching his head he is hitching up his untidy stockings he is making himself disgusting and odious to everybody and he is pretending to read state papers that he does not understand because he is too lazy and selfish to talk and be companionable  patiomkin growls then wipes his nose with his dressinggown  varinka pig ugh she curls herself up with a shiver of disgust and retires from the conversation  the sergeant stealing across to the coat and picking it up to replace it on the back of the chair little father the english captain so highly recommended to you by old fritz of prussia by the english ambassador and by monsieur voltaire whom crossing himself may god in his infinite mercy damn eternally is in the antechamber and desires audience  patiomkin deliberately to hell with the english captain and to hell with old fritz of prussia and to hell with the english ambassador and to hell with monsieur voltaire and to hell with you too  the sergeant have mercy on me little father your head is bad this morning you drink too much french brandy and too little good russian kvass  patiomkin with sudden fury why are visitors of consequence announced by a sergeant springing at him and seizing him by the throat what do you mean by this you hound do you want five thousand blows of the stick where is general volkonsky  the sergeant on his knees little father you kicked his highness downstairs  patiomkin flinging him dawn and kicking him you lie you dog you lie  the sergeant little father life is hard for the poor if you say it is a lie it is a lie he fell downstairs i picked him up and he kicked me they all kick me when you kick them god knows that is not just little father  patiomkin laughs ogreishly then returns to his place at the table chuckling  varinka savage boot it is a disgrace no wonder the french sneer at us as barbarians  the sergeant who has crept round the table to the screen and insinuated himself between patiomkins back and varinka do you think the prince will see the captain little darling  patiomkin he will not see any captain go to the devil  the sergeant be merciful little father god knows it is your duty to see him to varinka intercede for him and for me beautiful little darling he has given me a rouble  patiomkin oh send him in send him in and stop pestering me am i never to have a moments peace  the sergeant salutes joyfully and hurries out divining that patiomkin has intended to see the english captain all along and has played this comedy of fury and exhausted impatience to conceal his interest in the visitor  varinka have you no shame you refuse to see the most exalted persons you kick princes and generals downstairs and then you see an english captain merely because he has given a rouble to that common soldier it is scandalous  patiomkin darling beloved i am drunk but i know what i am doing i wish to stand well with the english  varinka and you think you will impress an englishman by receiving him as you are now half drunk  patiomkin gravely it is true the english despise men who cannot drink i must make myself wholly drunk he takes a huge draught of brandy  varinka sot  the sergeant returns ushering a handsome strongly built young english officer in the uniform of a light dragoon he is evidently on fairly good terms with himself and very sure of his social position he crosses the room to the end of the table opposite patiomkins and awaits the civilities of that statesman with confidence the sergeant remains prudently at the door  the sergeant paternally little father this is the english captain so well recommended to her sacred majesty the empress god knows he needs your countenance and protec he vanishes precipitately seeing that patiomkin is about to throw a bottle at him the captain contemplates these preliminaries with astonishment and with some displeasure which is not allayed when patiomkin hardly condescending to look at his visitor of whom he nevertheless takes stock with the corner of his one eye says gruffly well  edstaston my name is edstaston captain edstaston of the light dragoons i have the honor to present to your highness this letter from the british ambassador which will give you all necessary particulars he hands patiomkin the letter  patiomkin tearing it open and glancing at it for about a second what do you want  edstaston the letter will explain to your highness who i am  patiomkin i dont want to know who you are what do you want  edstaston an audience of the empress patiomkin contemptuously throws the letter aside edstaston adds hotly also some civility if you please  patiomkin with derision ho  varinka my uncle is receiving you with unusual civility captain he has just kicked a general downstairs  edstaston a russian general madam  varinka of course  edstaston i must allow myself to say madam that your uncle had better not attempt to kick an english officer downstairs  patiomkin you want me to kick you upstairs eh you want an audience of the empress  edstaston i have said nothing about kicking sir if it comes to that my boots shall speak for me her majesty has signified a desire to have news of the rebellion in america i have served against the rebels and i am instructed to place myself at the disposal of her majesty and to describe the events of the war to her as an eyewitness in a discreet and agreeable manner  patiomkin psha i know you think if she once sets eyes on your face and your uniform your fortune is made you think that if she could stand a man like me with only one eye and a cross eye at that she must fall down at your feet at first sight eh  edstaston shocked and indignant i think nothing of the sort and ill trouble you not to repeat it if i were a russian subject and you made such a boast about my queen id strike you across the face with my sword patiomkin with a yell of fury rushes at him hands off you swine as patiomkin towering over him attempts to seize him by the throat edstaston who is a bit of a wrestler adroitly backheels him he falls amazed on his back  varinka rushing out help call the guard the englishman is murdering my uncle help help  the guard and the sergeant rush in edstaston draws a pair of small pistols from his boots and points one at the sergeant and the other at patiomkin who is sitting on the floor somewhat sobered the soldiers stand irresolute  edstaston stand off to patiomkin order them off if you dont want a bullet through your silly head  the sergeant little father tell us what to do our lives are yours but god knows you are not fit to die  patiomkin absurdly selfpossessed get out  the sergeant little father  patiomkin roaring get out get out all of you they withdraw much relieved at their escape from the pistol patiomkin attempts to rise and rolls over here help me up will you dont

behind him up to the table and snatches at the green bottle from which he takes a copious draught its effect is appalling his wry faces and agonized belchings are so heartrending that they almost upset edstaston when the victim at last staggers to his feet he is a pale fragile nobleman aged and quite sober extremely dignified in manner and address though shaken by his recent convulsions young man it is not better to be drunk than sober but it is happier goodness is not happiness that is an epigram but i have overdone this i am too sober to be good company let me redress the balance he takes a generous draught of brandy and recovers his geniality aha thats better and now listen darling you must not come to court with pistols in your boots  edstaston i have found them useful  patiomkin nonsense im your friend you mistook my intention because i was drunk now that i am soberin moderationi will prove that i am your friend have some diamonds roaring hullo there dogs pigs hullo

goblet and kicks the sergeant out not maliciously but from habit indeed not noticing that he does it darling have some diamonds have a fistful he takes up a handful and lets them slip back through his fingers into the goblet which he then offers to edstaston  edstaston thank you i dont take presents  patiomkin amazed you refuse  edstaston i thank your highness but it is not the custom for english gentlemen to take presents of that kind  patiomkin are you really an englishman  edstaston bows  patiomkin you are the first englishman i ever saw refuse anything he could get he puts the goblet on

i am in the vein today  edstaston embarrassed and a little offended i must ask your highness to change the subject as a visitor in russia i am the guest of the empress and i must tell you plainly that i have neither the right nor the disposition to speak lightly of her majesty  patiomkin you have conscientious scruples  edstaston i have the scruples of a gentleman  patiomkin in russia a gentleman has no scruples in russia we face facts  edstaston in england sir a gentleman never faces any facts if they are unpleasant facts  patiomkin in real life darling all facts are unpleasant greatly pleased with himself another epigram where is my accursed chancellor these gems should be written down and recorded for posterity he rushes to the table sits down and snatches up a pen then recollecting himself but i have not asked you to sit down he rises and goes to the other chair i am a savage a barbarian he throws the shirt and coat over the table on to the floor and puts his sword on the table be seated captain  edstaston thank you  they bow to one another ceremoniously patiomkins tendency to grotesque exaggeration costs him his balance he nearly falls over edstaston who rescues him and takes the proffered chair  patiomkin resuming his seat by the way what was the piece of advice i was going to give you  edstaston as you did not give it i dont know allow me to add that i have not asked for your advice  patiomkin i give it to you unasked delightful englishman i remember it now it was this dont try to become tsar of russia  edstaston in astonishment i havent the slightest intention  patiomkin not now but you will have take my words for it it will strike you as a splendid idea to have conscientious scruplesto desire the blessing of the church on your union with catherine  edstaston racing in utter amazement my union with catherine youre mad  patiomkin unmoved the day you hint at such a thing will be the day of your downfall besides it is not lucky to be catherines husband you know what happened to peter  edstaston shortly sitting down again i do not wish to discuss it  patiomkin you think she murdered him  edstaston i know that people have said so  patiomkin thunderously springing to his feet it is a lie orloff murdered him subsiding a little he also knocked my eye out but sitting down placidly i succeeded him for all that and patting edstastons hand very affectionately im sorry to say darling that if you become tsar i shall murder you  edstaston ironically returning the caress thank you the occasion will not arise rising i have the honor to wish your highness good morning  patiomkin jumping up and stopping him on his way to the door tut tut im going to take you to the empress now this very instant  edstaston in these boots impossible i must change  patiomkin nonsense you shall come just as you are you shall show her your calves later on  edstaston but it will take me only half an hour to  patiomkin in half an hour it will be too late for the petit lever come along damn it man i must oblige the british ambassador and the french ambassador and old fritz and monsieur voltaire and the rest of them he shouts rudely to the door

courtseying monsieur le capitaine  edstaston i must apologize for the disturbance i made madam  patiomkin behind the screen you must not call her madam you must call her little mother and beautiful

look through the keyhole of the imperial bedchamber and bring me word whether the empress is awake yet  varinka fi donc i do not look through keyholes  patiomkin emerging having arranged his shirt and put on his diamonded coat you have been badly brought up little darling would any lady or gentleman walk unannounced into a room without first looking through the keyhole taking his sword from the table and putting it on the great thing in life is to be simple and the perfectly simple thing is to look through keyholes another epigram the fifth this morning where is my fool of a chancellor where

through them find on their left on a dais of two broad steps a magnificent curtained bed beyond it a door in the panelling leads to the empresss cabinet near the foot of the bed in the middle of the room stands a gilt chair with the imperial arms carved and the imperial monogram embroidered  the court is in attendance standing in two melancholy rows down the side of the room opposite to the bed solemn bored waiting for the empress to awaken the princess dashkoff with two ladies stands a little in front of the line of courtiers by the imperial chair silence broken only by the yawns and whispers of the courtiers naryshkin the chamberlain stands by the head of the bed  a loud yawn is heard from behind the curtains  naryshkin holding up a warning hand ssh  the courtiers hastily cease whispering dress up their lines and stiffen dead silence a bell tinkles within the curtains naryshkin and the princess solemnly draw them and reveal the empress  catherine turns over on her back and stretches herself  catherine yawning heighoahyahahowwhat oclock is it her accent is german  naryshkin formally her imperial majesty is awake the court falls on its knees  all good morning to your

morning before it begins yawning again and relapsing sleepily against her pillows why do they do it naryshkin  naryshkin god knows it is not for your sake little mother but you see if you were not a great queen they would all be nobodies  catherine sitting up they make me do it to keep up their own little dignities so  naryshkin exactly also because if they didnt you might have them flogged dear little mother  catherine springing energetically out of bed and seating herself on the edge of it flogged i a liberal empress a philosopher you are a barbarian naryshkin she rises and turns to the courtiers and then as if i cared she turns again to naryshkin you should know by this time that i am frank and original in character like an englishman she walks about restlessly no what maddens me about all this ceremony is that i am the only person in russia who gets no fun out of my being empress you all glory in me you bask in my smiles you get titles and honors and favors from me you are dazzled by my crown and my robes you feel splendid when you have been admitted to my presence and when i say a gracious word to you you talk about it to everyone you meet for a week afterwards but what do i get out of it nothing she throws herself into the chair naryshkin deprecates with a gesture she hurls an emphatic repetition at him nothing i wear a crown until my neck aches i stand looking majestic until i am ready to drop i have to smile at ugly old ambassadors and frown and turn my back on young and handsome ones nobody gives me anything when i was only an archduchess the english ambassador used to give me money whenever i wanted itor rather whenever he wanted to get anything out of my sacred predecessor elizabeth the court bows to the ground but now that i am empress he never gives me a kopek when i have headaches and colics i envy the scullerymaids and you are not a bit grateful to me for all my care of you my work my thought my fatigue my sufferings  the princess

high spirits this morning little mother  catherine with sudden levity i am always in high spirits even when people do not bring me my slippers she runs to the chair and sits down thrusting her feet

antechamber useless to struggle come along beautiful baby darling come to little mother he sings  march him baby baby baby little baby bumpkins  varinka joining in to the same doggerel in canon a

catherine listening that is prince patiomkin  naryshkin calling from the door little mother a stranger  catherine plunges into bed again and covers herself up patiomkin followed by varinka carries edstaston in dumps him down on the foot of the bed and staggers past it to the cabinet door varinka joins the courtiers at the opposite side of the room catherine blazing with wrath pushes edstaston off her bed on to the floor gets out of bed and turns on patiomkin with so terrible an expression that all kneel down hastily except edstaston who is sprawling on the carpet in angry confusion  catherine patiomkin how dare you looking at edstaston what is this  patiomkin on his knees tearfully i dont know i am drunk what is this varinka  edstaston scrambling to his feet madam this drunken

pulling him back no no patiomkin what are you thinking of he falls like a log on the floor apparently dead drunk  the princess dashkoff scandalous an insult to your imperial majesty  catherine dashkoff you have no sense of humor she steps down to the door level and looks indulgently at patiomkin he gurgles brutishly she has an impulse of disgust hog she kicks him as hard as she can oh you have broken my toe brute beast dashkoff is quite right do you hear  patiomkin if you ask my pipinion of dashkoff my pipinion is that dashkoff is drunk scanlous poor patiomkin go bye bye he relapses into drunken slumbers  some of the courtiers move to carry him away  catherine stopping them let him lie let him sleep it off if he goes out it will be to a tavern and low company for the rest of the day indulgently there she takes a pillow from the bed and puts it under his head then turns to edstaston surveys him with perfect dignity and asks in her queenliest manner varinka who is this gentleman  varinka a foreign captain i cannot pronounce his name i think he is mad he came to the prince and said he must see your majesty he can talk of nothing else we could not prevent him  edstaston overwhelmed by this apparent betrayal oh madam i am perfectly sane i am actually an englishman i should never have dreamt of approaching your majesty without the fullest credentials i have letters from the english ambassador from the prussian ambassador naively but everybody assured me that prince patiomkm is allpowerful with your majesty so i naturally applied to him  patiomkin interrupts the conversation by an agonized wheezing groan as of a donkey beginning to bray  catherine like a fishfag schweig du hund resuming her impressive royal manner have you never been taught sir how a gentleman should enter the presence of a sovereign  edstaston yes madam but i did not enter your presence i was carried  catherine but you say you asked the prince to carry you  edstaston certainly not madam i protested against it with all my might i appeal to this lady to confirm me  varinka pretending to be indignant yes you protested but all the same you were very very very anxious to see her imperial majesty you blushed when the prince spoke of her you threatened to strike him across the face with your sword because you thought he did not speak enthusiastically enough of her to catherine trust me he has seen your imperial majesty before  catherine to edstaston you have seen us before  edstaston at the review madam  varinka triumphantly aha i knew it your majesty wore the hussar uniform he saw how radiant how splendid your majesty looked oh he has dared to admire your majesty such insolence is not to be endured  edstaston all europe is a party to that insolence madam  the princess dashkoff all europe is content to do so at a respectful distance it is possible to admire her majestys policy and her eminence in literature and philosophy without performing acrobatic feats in the imperial bed  edstaston i know nothing about her majestys eminence in policy or philosophy i dont pretend to understand such things i speak as a practical man and i never knew that foreigners had any policy i always thought that policy was mr pitts business  catherine lifting her eyebrows so  varinka what else did you presume to admire her majesty for pray  edstaston addled well iiithat is ihe stammers himself dumb  catherine after a pitiless silence we are waiting for your answer  edstaston but i never said i admired your majesty the lady has twisted my words  varinka you dont admire her then  edstaston well inaturallyof course i cant deny that the uniform was very becomingperhaps a little unfemininestilldead silence catherine and the court watch him stonily he is wretchedly embarrassed  catherine with cold majesty well sir is that all you have to say  edstaston surely there is no harm in noticing that erthat erhe stops again  catherine noticing that er he gazes at her speechless like a fascinated rabbit she repeats fiercely that er  edstaston startled into speech well that your majesty waswassoothingly well let me put it this way that it was rather natural for a man to admire your majesty without being a philosopher  catherine suddenly smiling and extending her hand to him to be kissed courtier  edstaston kissing it not at all your majesty is very good i have been very awkward but i did not intend it i am rather stupid i am afraid  catherine stupid by no means courage captain we are pleased he falls on his knee she takes his cheeks in her hands turns up his face and adds we are greatly pleased she slaps his cheek coquettishly he bows almost to his knee the petit lever is over she turns to go into the cabinet and stumbles against the supine patiomkin ach edstaston springs to her assistance seizing patiomkins heels and shifting him out of the empresss path we thank you captain  he bows gallantly and is rewarded by a very gracious smile then catherine goes into her cabinet followed by the princess dashkoff who turns at the door to make a deep courtsey to edstaston  varinka happy little father remember i did this for you she runs out after the empress  edstaston somewhat dazed crosses the room to the courtiers and is received with marked deference each courtier making him a profound bow or curtsey before withdrawing through the central doors he returns each obeisance with a nervous jerk and turns away from it only to find another courtier bowing at the other side the process finally reduced him to distraction as he bumps into one in the act of bowing to another and then has to bow his apologies but at last they are all gone except naryshkin  edstaston ouf  patiomkin jumping up vigorously you have done it darling superbly beautifully  edstaston astonished do you mean to say you are not drunk  patiomkin not dead drunk darling only diplomatically drunk as a drunken hog i have done for you in five minutes what i could not have done in five months as a sober man your fortune is made she likes you  edstaston the devil she does  patiomkin why arent you delighted  edstaston delighted gracious heavens man i am engaged to be married  patiomkin what matter she is in england isnt she  edstaston no she has just arrived in st petersburg  the princess dashkoff returning captain edstaston the empress is robed and commands your presence  edstaston say i was gone before you arrived with the message he hurries out the other three too taken aback to stop him stare after him in the utmost astonishment  naryshkin turning from the door she will have him knouted he is a dead man  the princess dashkoff but what am i to do i cannot take such an answer to the empress  patiomkin ppppppwwwwwrrrrrr a long puff turning into a growl he spits i must kick somebody  naryshkin flying precipitately through the central doors no no please  the princess dashkoff throwing herself recklessly in front of patiomkin as he starts in pursuit of the chamberlain kick me disable me it will be an excuse for not going back to her kick me hard  patiomkin yah he flings her on the bed and dashes after naryshkin     the third scene  in a terrace garden overlooking the neva claire a robust young english lady is leaning on the river wall she turns expectantly on hearing the garden gate opened and closed edstaston hurries in with a cry of delight she throws her arms round his neck  claire darling  edstaston making a wry face dont call me darling  claire amazed and chilled why  edstaston i have been called darling all the morning  claire with a flash of jealousy by whom  edstaston by everybody by the most unutterable swine and if we do not leave this abominable city now do you hear now i shall be called darling by the empress  claire with magnificent snobbery she would not dare did you tell her you were engaged to me  edstaston of course not  claire why  edstaston because i didnt particularly want to have you knouted and to be hanged or sent to siberia myself  claire what on earth do you mean  edstaston well the long and short of it isdont think me a coxcomb claire it is too serious to mince mattersi have seen the empress and  claire well you wanted to see her  edstaston yes but the empress has seen me  claire she has fallen in love with you  edstaston how did you know  claire dearest as

claire may i tell her she will be knouted if we stay  edstaston do dearest  he kisses her and lets her go expecting her to run into the house  claire pausing thoughtfully is sheis she goodlooking when

out when naryshkin enters with the sergeant and a squad of soldiers what do you want here  the sergeant goes to edstaston plumps down on his knees and takes out a magnificent pair of pistols with gold grips he proffers them to edstaston holding them by the barrels  naryshkin captain edstaston his highness prince patiomkin sends you the pistols he promised you  the sergeant take them little father and do not forget us poor soldiers who have brought them to you for god knows we get but little to drink  edstaston irresolutely but i cant take these valuable things by jiminy though theyre beautiful look at them claire  as he is taking the pistols the kneeling sergeant suddenly drops them flings himself forward and embraces edstastons hips to prevent him from drawing his own pistols from his boots  the sergeant lay hold of him there pin his arms i have his pistols the soldiers seize edstaston  edstaston ah would you damn you he drives his knee into the sergeants epigastrium and struggles furiously with his captors  the sergeant rolling on the ground gasping and groaning owgh murder holy nicholas owwwgh  claire help help they are killing charles help  naryshkin seizing her and clapping his hand over her mouth tie him neck and crop ten thousand blows of the stick if you let him go claire twists herself loose turns on him and cuffs him furiously yowow have mercy little mother  claire you wretch help help police we are being murdered help  the sergeant who has risen comes to naryshkins rescue and grasps claires hands enabling naryshkin to gag her again by this time edstaston and his captors are all rolling on the ground together they get edstaston on his back and fasten his wrists together behind his knees next they put a broad strap round his ribs finally they pass a pole through this breast strap and through the waist strap and lift him by it helplessly trussed up to carry him of meanwhile he is by no means suffering in silence  edstaston gasping you shall hear more of this damn you will you untie me i will complain to the ambassador i will write to the gazette england will blow your trumpery little fleet out of the water and sweep your tinpot army into siberia for this will you let me go damn you curse you what the devil do you mean by it illillill he is carried out of hearing  naryshkin snatching his hands from claires face with a scream and shaking his finger frantically agh the sergeant amazed lets go her hands she has bitten me the little vixen  claire spitting and wiping her mouth disgustedly how dare you put your dirty paws on my mouth ugh psha  the sergeant be merciful little angel mother  claire do not presume to call me your little angel mother where are the police  naryshkin we are the police in st petersburg little spitfire  the sergeant god knows we have no orders to harm you little mother our duty is done you are well and strong but i shall never be the same man again he is a mighty and terrible fighter as stout as a bear he has broken my sweetbread with his strong knees god knows poor folk should not be set upon such dangerous adversaries  claire serve you right where have they taken captain edstaston to  naryshkin spitefully to the empress little beauty he has insulted the empress he will receive a hundred and one blows of the knout he laughs and goes out nursing his bitten finger  the sergeant he will feel only the first twenty and he will be mercifully dead long before the end little darling  claire sustained by an invincible snobbery they dare not touch an english officer i will go to the empress myself she cannot know who captain edstaston iswho we are  the sergeant do so in the name of the holy nicholas little beauty  claire dont be impertinent how can i get admission to the palace  the sergeant everybody goes in and out of the palace little love  claire but i must get into the empresss presence i must speak to her  the sergeant you shall dear little mother you shall give the poor old sergeant a rouble and the blessed nicholas will make your salvation his charge  claire impetuously i will give you she is about to say fifty roubles but checks herself cautiouslywell i dont mind giving you two roubles if i can speak to the empress  the sergeant joyfully i praise heaven for you little mother come he leads the way out it was the temptation of the devil that led your young man to bruise my vitals and deprive me of breath we must be merciful to one anothers faults     the fourth scene  a triangular recess communicating by a heavily curtained arch with the huge ballroom of the palace the light is subdued by red shades on the candles in the wall adjoining that pierced by the arch is a door the only piece of furniture is a very handsome chair on the arch side in the ballroom they are dancing a polonaise to the music of a brass band  naryshkin enters through the door followed by the soldiers carrying edstaston still trussed to the pole exhausted and dogged he makes no sound  naryshkin halt get that pole clear of the prisoner they dump edstaston on the floor and detach the pole naryshkin stoops over him and addresses him insultingly well are you ready to be tortured this is the empresss private torture chamber can i do anything to make you quite comfortable you have only to mention it  edstaston have you any back teeth  naryshkin surprised why  edstaston his majesty king george the third will send for six of them when the news of this reaches london so look out damn your eyes  naryshkin frightened oh i assure you i am only obeying my orders personally i abhor torture and would save you if i could but the empress is proud and what woman would forgive the slight you put upon her  edstaston as i said before damn your eyes  naryshkin almost in tears well it isnt my fault to the soldiers insolently you know your orders you remember what you have to do when the empress gives you the word the soldiers salute in assent  naryshkin passes through the curtains admitting a blare of music and a strip of the brilliant white candlelight from the chandeliers in the ballroom as he does so the white light vanishes and the music is muffled as the curtains fall together behind him presently the band stops abruptly and naryshkin comes back through the curtains he makes a warning gesture to the soldiers who stand at attention then he moves the curtain to allow catherine to enter she is in full imperial regalia and stops sternly just where she has entered the soldiers fall on their knees  catherine obey your orders  the soldiers seize edstaston and throw him roughly at the feet of the empress  catherine looking down coldly on him also the german word you have put me to the trouble of sending for you twice you had better have come the first time  edstaston exsufflicate and pettishly angry i havent come either time ive been carried i call it infernal impudence  catherine take care what you say  edstaston no use i daresay you look very majestic and very handsome but i cant see you and i am not intimidated i am an englishman and you can kidnap me but you cant bully me  naryshkin remember to whom you are speaking  catherine violently furious at his intrusion remember that dogs should be dumb he shrivels and do you captain remember that famous as i am for my clemency there are limits to the patience even of an empress  edstaston how is a man to remember anything when he is trussed up in this ridiculous fashion i can hardly breathe he makes a futile struggle to free himself here dont be unkind your majesty tell these fellows to unstrap me you know you really owe me an apology  catherine you think you can escape by appealing like prince patiomkin to my sense of humor  edstaston sense of humor ho ha ha i like that would anybody with a sense of humor make a guy of a man like this and then expect him to take it seriously i say do tell them to loosen these straps  catherine seating herself why should i pray  edstaston why why why because theyre hurting me  catherine people sometimes learn through suffering manners for instance  edstaston oh well of course if youre an illnatured woman hurting me on purpose i have nothing more to say  catherine a monarch sir has sometimes to employ a necessary and salutary severity  edstaston interrupting her petulantly quack quack quack  catherine donnerwetter  edstaston continuing recklessly this isnt severity its tomfoolery and if you think its reforming my character or teaching me anything youre mistaken it may be a satisfaction to you but if it is all i can say is that its not an amiable satisfaction  catherine turning suddenly and balefully on naryshkin what are you grinning at  naryshkin falling on his knees in terror be merciful little mother my heart is in my mouth  catherine your heart and your mouth will be in two separate parts of your body if you again forget in whose presence you stand go and take your men with you naryshkin crawls to the door the soldiers rise stop roll that indicating edstaston nearer the soldiers obey not so close did i ask you for a footstool she pushes edstaston away with her foot  edstaston with a sudden squeal agh i must really ask your majesty not to put the point of your imperial toe between my ribs i am ticklesome  catherine indeed all the more reason for you to treat me with respect captain to the others begone how many times must i give an order before it is obeyed  naryshkin little mother they have brought some instruments of torture will they be needed  catherine indignantly how dare you name such abominations to a liberal empress you will always be a savage and a fool naryshkin these relics of barbarism are buried thank god in the grave of peter the great my methods are more civilized she extends her toe towards edstastons ribs  edstaston shrieking hysterically yagh ah furiously if your majesty does that again i will write to the london gazette  catherine to the soldiers leave us quick do you hear five thousand blows of the stick for the soldier who is in the room when i speak next the soldiers rush out naryshkin are you waiting to be knouted naryshkin backs out hastily  catherine and edstaston are now alone catherine has in her hand a sceptre or baton of gold wrapped round it is a new pamphlet in french entitled lhomme aux quarante ecus she calmly unrolls this and begins to read it at her ease as if she were quite alone several seconds elapse in dead silence she becomes more and more absorbed in the pamphlet and more and more amused by it  catherine greatly pleased by a passage and turning over the leaf ausgezeiehnet  edstaston ahem  silence catherine reads on  catherine wie komisch  edstaston ahem ahem  silence  catherine soliloquizing enthusiastically what a wonderful author is monsieur voltaire how lucidly he exposes the folly of this crazy plan for raising the entire revenue of the country from a single tax on land how he withers it with his irony how he makes you laugh whilst he is convincing you how sure one feels that the proposal is killed by his wit and economic penetration killed never to be mentioned again among educated people  edstaston for heavens sake madam do you intend to leave me tied up like this while you discuss the blasphemies of that abominable infidel agh she has again applied her toe oh oo  catherine calmly do i understand you to say that monsieur voltaire is a great philanthropist and a great philosopher as well as the wittiest man in europe  edstaston certainly not i say that his books ought to be burnt by the common hangman her toe touches his ribs yagh oh dont i shall faint i cant bear it  catherine have you changed your opinion of monsieur voltaire  edstaston but you cant expect me as a member of the church of england she tickles him agh ow oh lord he is anything you like he is a philanthropist a philosopher a beauty he ought to have a statue damn him she tickles him no bless him save him victorious happy and glorious oh let eternal honors crown his name voltaire thrice worthy on the rolls of fame exhausted now will you let me up and look here i can see your ankles when you tickle me its not ladylike  catherine sticking out her toe and admiring it critically is the spectacle so disagreeable  edstaston its agreeable enough only with intense expression for heavens sake dont touch me in the ribs  catherine putting aside the pamphlet captain edstaston why did you refuse to come when i sent for you  edstaston madam i cannot talk tied up like this  catherine do you still admire me as much as you did this morning  edstaston how can i possibly tell when i cant see you let me get up and look i cant see anything now except my toes and yours  catherine do you still intend to write to the london gazette about me  edstaston not if you will loosen these straps quick loosen me im fainting  catherine i dont think you are tickling him  edstaston agh cat  catherine what she tickles him again  edstaston with a shriek no angel angel  catherine tenderly geliebter  edstaston i dont know a word of german but that sounded kind becoming hysterical little mother beautiful little darling angel mother dont be cruel untie me oh i beg and implore you dont be unkind i shall go mad  catherine you are expected to go mad with love when an empress deigns to interest herself in you when an empress allows you to see her foot you should kiss it captain edstaston you are a booby  edstaston indignantly i am nothing of the kind i have been mentioned in dispatches as a highly intelligent officer and let me warn your majesty that i am not so helpless as you think the english ambassador is in that ballroom a shout from me will bring him to my side and then where will your majesty be  catherine i should like to

get the straps off  claire keep quiet dear i cannot get them off if you move  catherine calmly keep quite still captain she tickles him  edstaston ow agh ahowyow  claire stopping dead in the act of unbuckling the straps and turning sick with jealousy as she grasps the situation was that what i thought was your being tortured  catherine urbanely that is the favorite torture of catherine the second mademoiselle i think the captain enjoys it very much  claire then he can have as much more of it as he wants i am sorry i intruded she rises to go  edstaston catching her train in his teeth and holding on like a bulldog dont go dont leave me in this horrible state loosen me this is what he is saying but as he says it with the train in his mouth it is not very intelligible  claire let go you

haughtiness why  edstaston to oblige me  catherine laughs goodhumoredly and goes to the curtains and opens them the band strikes up a redowa  catherine calling imperiously patiomkin the music stops suddenly here to me go on with your music there you fools the redowa is resumed  the sergeant rushes from the ballroom to relieve the empress of the curtain patiomkin comes in dancing with yarinka  catherine to patiomkin the english captain wants you little darling  catherine resumes her seat as patiomkin intimates by a grotesque bow that he is at edstastons service yarinka passes behind edstaston and claire and posts herself on claires right  edstaston precisely to claire  you observe my love little darling well if her majesty calls him a darling is it my fault that she calls me one too  claire i dont care i dont think you ought to have done it i am very angry and offended  edstaston they tied me up dear i couldnt help it i fought for all i was worth  the sergeant at the curtains he fought with the strength of lions and bears god knows i shall carry a broken sweetbread to my grave  edstaston you cant mean to throw me over claire urgently claire claire  varinka in a transport of sympathetic emotion pleading with clasped hands to claire oh sweet little angel lamb he loves you it shines in his darling eyes pardon him pardon him  patiomkin rushing from the empresss side to

mighty man bring his whip to you god knows we all need pardon  claire at the top of her voice i pardon him i pardon him  patiomkin springing up joyfully and going behind claire whom he raises in his arms embrace her victor of bunkers hill kiss her till she swoons  the sergeant receive her in the name of the holy nicholas  varinka she begs you for a thousand dear little kisses all over her body  claire vehemently i do not patiomkin throws her into edstastons arms oh the pair awkward and shamefaced recoil from one another and remain utterly inexpressive  catherine pushing edstaston towards claire there is no help for it captain this is russia not england  edstaston plucking up some geniality and kissing claire ceremoniously on the brow i have no objection  varinka disgusted only one kiss and on the forehead fish see how i kiss though it is only my horribly ugly old uncle she throws her arms round patiomkins neck and covers his face with kisses  the sergeant moved to tears sainted nicholas bless your lambs  catherine do you wonder now that i love russia as i love no other place on earth  naryshkin appearing at the door majesty the model for the new museum has arrived  catherine rising eagerly and making for the curtains let us go i can think of nothing but my museum in the archway she stops and turns to edstaston who has hurried to lift the curtain for her captain i wish you every happiness that your little angel can bring you for his ear alone i could have brought you more but you did not think so farewell  edstaston kissing her hand which instead of releasing he holds
