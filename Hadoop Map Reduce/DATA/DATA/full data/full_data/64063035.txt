edition december 1919     preface   said a friend of mine to me some months ago well now why dont you write a sensible book  i should like to see you make people think  do you believe it can be done then i asked  well try he replied  accordingly i have tried  this is a sensible book  i want you to understand that  this is a book to improve your mind  in this book i tell you all about germanyat all events all i know about germanyand the oberammergau passion play  i also tell you about other things  i do not tell you all i know about all these other things because i do not want to swamp you with knowledge  i wish to lead you gradually  when you have learnt this book you can come again and i will tell you some more  i should only be defeating my own object did i by making you think too much at first give you a perhaps lasting dislike to the exercise  i have purposely put the matter in a light and attractive form so that i may secure the attention of the young and the frivolous i do not want them to notice as they go on that they are being instructed and i have therefore endeavoured to disguise from them so far as is practicable that this is either an exceptionally clever or an exceptionally useful work  i want to do them good without their knowing it  i want to do you all goodto improve your minds and to make you think if i can  what you will think after you have read the book i do not want to know indeed i would rather not know  it will be sufficient reward for me to feel that i have done my duty and to receive a percentage on the gross sales  london march 1891     monday 19th   my friend binvitation to the theatrea most unpleasant regulationyearnings of the embryo travellerhow to make the most of ones own countryfriday a lucky daythe pilgrimage decided on  my friend b called on me this morning and asked me if i would go to a theatre with him on monday next  oh yes certainly old man i replied  have you got an order then  he said  no they dont give orders  we shall have to pay  pay  pay to go into a theatre i answered in astonishment  oh nonsense  you are joking  my dear fellow he rejoined do you think i should suggest paying if it were possible to get in by any other means  but the people who run this theatre would not even understand what was meant by a free list the uncivilised barbarians  it is of no use pretending to them that you are on the press because they dont want the press they dont think anything of the press  it is no good writing to the acting manager because there is no acting manager  it would be a waste of time offering to exhibit bills because they dont have any billsnot of that sort if you want to go in to see the show youve got to pay  if you dont pay you stop outside thats their brutal rule  dear me i said what a very unpleasant arrangement  and whereabouts is this extraordinary theatre  i dont think i can ever have been inside it  i dont think you have he replied it is at oberammergaufirst turning on the left after you leave ober railwaystation fifty miles from munich  um rather out of the way for a theatre i said  i should not have thought an outlying house like that could have afforded to give itself airs  the house holds seven thousand people answered my friend b and money is turned away at each performance  the first production is on monday next  will you come  i pondered for a moment looked at my diary and saw that aunt emma was coming to spend saturday to wednesday next with us calculated that if i went i should miss her and might not see her again for years and decided that i would go  to tell the truth it was the journey more than the play that tempted me to be a great traveller has always been one of my cherished ambitions  i yearn to be able to write in this sort of strain  i have smoked my fragrant havana in the sunny streets of old madrid and i have puffed the rude and not sweetsmelling calumet of peace in the draughty wigwam of the wild west i have sipped my evening coffee in the silent tent while the tethered camel browsed without upon the desert grass and i have quaffed the fiery brandy of the north while the reindeer munched his fodder beside me in the hut and the pale light of the midnight sun threw the shadows of the pines across the snow i have felt the stab of lustrous eyes that ghostlike looked at me from out veilcovered faces in byzantiums narrow ways and i have laughed back though it was wrong of me to do so at the saucy wanton glances of the blackeyed girls of jedo i have wandered where goodbut not too goodharoun alraschid crept disguised at nightfall with his faithful mesrour by his side i have stood upon the bridge where dante watched the sainted beatrice pass by i have floated on the waters that once bore the barge of cleopatra i have stood where caesar fell i have heard the soft rustle of rich rare robes in the drawingrooms of mayfair and i have heard the teethnecklaces rattle around the ebony throats of the belles of tongataboo i have panted beneath the suns fierce rays in india and frozen under the icy blasts of greenland i have mingled with the teeming hordes of old cathay and deep in the great pine forests of the western world i have lain wrapped in my blanket a thousand miles beyond the shores of human life  b to whom i explained my leaning towards this style of diction said that exactly the same effect could be produced by writing about places quite handy  he said  i could go on like that without having been outside england at all  i should say  i have smoked my fourpenny shag in the sanded bars of fleet street and i have puffed my twopenny manilla in the gilded balls of the criterion i have quaffed my foaming beer of burton where islingtons famed angel gathers the little thirsty ones beneath her shadowing wings and i have sipped my tenpenny ordinaire in many a garlicscented salon of soho on the back of the strangelymoving ass i have urgedor to speak more correctly the proprietor of the ass or his agent from behind has urgedmy wild career across the sandy heaths of hampstead and my canoe has startled the screaming wildfowl from their lonely haunts amid the subtropical regions of battersea  adown the long steep slope of one tree hill have i rolled from top to foot while laughing maidens of the east stood round and clapped their hands and yelled and in the oldworld garden of that pleasant court where played the fairhaired children of the illstarred stuarts have i wandered long through many paths my arm entwined about the waist of one of eves sweet daughters while her mother raged around indignantly on the other side of the hedge and never seemed to get any nearer to us  i have chased the lodginghouse norfolk howard to his watery death by the pale lamps light i have shivering followed the leaping flea oer many a mile of pillow and sheet by the great atlantics margin  round and round till the heartand not only the heartgrows sick and the mad brain whirls and reels have i ridden the small but extremely hard horse that may for a penny be mounted amid the plains of peckham rye and high above the heads of the giddy throngs of barnet though it is doubtful if anyone among them was half so giddy as was i have i swung in highlycoloured car worked by a man with a rope  i have trod in stately measure the floor of kensingtons town hall the tickets were a guinea each and included refreshmentswhen you could get to them through the crowd and on the green sward of the forest that borders eastern anglia by the oftsung town of epping i have performed quaint ceremonies in a ring i have mingled with the teeming hordes of drury lane on boxing night and during the run of a highclass piece i have sat in lonely grandeur in the front row of the gallery and wished that i had spent my shilling instead in the oriental halls of the alhambra  there you are said b that is just as good as yours and you can write like that without going more than a few hours journey from london  we will discuss the matter no further i replied  you cannot i see enter into my feelings  the wild heart of the traveller does not throb within your breast you cannot understand his longings  no matter suffice it that i will come this journey with you  i will buy a german conversation book and a checksuit and a blue veil and a white umbrella and suchlike necessities of the english tourist in germany this very afternoon  when do you start  well he said it is a good two days journey  i propose to start on friday  is not friday rather an unlucky day to start on i suggested  oh good gracious he retorted quite sharply what rubbish next  as if the affairs of europe were going to be arranged by providence according to whether you and i start for an excursion on a thursday or a friday  he said he was surprised that a man who could be so sensible occasionally as myself could have patience to even think of such oldwomanish nonsense  he said that years ago when he was a silly boy he used to pay attention to this foolish superstition himself and would never upon any consideration start for a trip upon a friday  but one year he was compelled to do so  it was a case of either starting on a friday or not going at all and he determined to chance it  he went prepared for and expecting a series of accidents and misfortunes  to return home alive was the only bit of pleasure he hoped for from that trip  as it turned out however he had never had a more enjoyable holiday in his life before  the whole event was a tremendous success  and after that he had made up his mind to always start on a friday and he always did and always had a good time  he said that he would never upon any consideration start for a trip upon any other day but a friday now  it was so absurd this superstition about friday  so we agreed to start on the friday and i am to meet him at victoria station at a quarter to eight in the evening     thursday 22nd   the question of luggagefirst friends suggestionsecond friends suggestionthird friends suggestionmrs briggs adviceour vicars advicehis wifes advicemedical adviceliterary advicegeorges recommendationmy sisterinlaws helpyoung smiths counselmy own ideasbs idea  i have been a good deal worried today about the question of what luggage to take with me  i met a man this morning and he said  oh if you are going to oberammergau mind you take plenty of warm clothing with you  youll need all your winter things up there  he said that a friend of his had gone up there some years ago and had not taken enough warm things with him and had caught a chill there and had come home and died  he said  you be guided by me and take plenty of warm things with you  i met another man later on and he said  i hear you are going abroad  now tell me what part of europe are you going to  i replied that i thought it was somewhere about the middle  he said  well now you take my advice and get a calico suit and a sunshade never mind the look of the thing  you be comfortable  youve no idea of the heat on the continent at this time of the year  english people will persist in travelling about the continent in the same stuffy clothes that they wear at home  thats how so many of them get sunstrokes and are ruined for life  i went into the club and there i met a friend of minea newspaper correspondentwho has travelled a good deal and knows europe pretty well  i told him what my two other friends had said and asked him which i was to believe  he said  well as a matter of fact they are both right  you see up in those hilly districts the weather changes very quickly  in the morning it may be blazing hot and you will be melting and in the evening you may be very glad of a flannel shirt and a fur coat  why that is exactly the sort of weather we have in england i exclaimed  if thats all these foreigners can manage in their own country what right have they to come over here as they do and grumble about our weather  well as a matter of fact he replied they havent any right but you cant stop themthey will do it  no you take my advice and be prepared for everything  take a cool suit and some thin things for if its hot and plenty of warm things in case it is cold  when i got home i found mrs briggs there she having looked in to see how the baby was  she said  oh if youre going anywhere near germany you take a bit of soap with you  she said that mr briggs had been called over to germany once in a hurry on business and had forgotten to take a piece of soap with him and didnt know enough german to ask for any when he got over there and didnt see any to ask for even if he had known and was away for three weeks and wasnt able to wash himself all the time and came home so dirty that they didnt know him and mistook him for the man that was to come to see what was the matter with the kitchen boiler  mrs briggs also advised me to take some towels with me as they give you such small towels to wipe on  i went out after lunch and met our vicar  he said  take a blanket with you  he said that not only did the german hotelkeepers never give you sufficient bedclothes to keep you warm of a night but they never properly aired their sheets  he said that a young friend of his had gone for a tour through germany once and had slept in a damp bed and had caught rheumatic fever and had come home and died  his wife joined us at this point  he was waiting for her outside a drapers shop when i met him  he explained to her that i was going to germany and she said  oh take a pillow with you  they dont give you any pillowsnot like our pillowsand its so wretched youll never get a decent nights rest if you dont take a pillow  she said you can have a little bag made for it and it doesnt look anything  i met our doctor a few yards further on  he said  dont forget to take a bottle of brandy with you  it doesnt take up much room and if youre not used to german cooking youll find it handy in the night  he added that the brandy you get at foreign hotels was mere poison and that it was really unsafe to travel abroad without a bottle of brandy he said that a simple thing like a bottle of brandy in your bag might often save your life  coming home i ran against a literary friend of mine  he said  youll have a goodish time in the train old fellow  are you used to long railway journeys  i said  well ive travelled down from london into the very heart of surrey by a south eastern express  oh thats a mere nothing compared with what youve got before you now he answered  look here ill tell you a very good idea of how to pass the time  you take a chessboard with you and a set of men  youll thank me for telling you that  george dropped in during the evening  he said  ill tell you one thing youll have to take with you old man and thats a box of cigars and some tobacco  he said that the german cigarthe better class of german cigarwas of the brand that is technically known over here as the penny pickwickspring crop and he thought that i should not have time during the short stay i contemplated making in the country to acquire a taste for its flavour  my sisterinlaw came in later on in the evening she is a thoughtful girl and brought a box with her about the size of a teachest  she said  now you slip that in your bag youll be glad of that  theres everything there for making yourself a cup of tea  she said that they did not understand tea in germany but that with that i should be independent of them  she opened the case and explained its contents to me  it certainly was a wonderfully complete arrangement  it contained a little caddy full of tea a little bottle of milk a box of sugar a bottle of methylated spirit a box of butter and a tin of biscuits also a stove a kettle a teapot two cups two saucers two plates two knives and two spoons if there had only been a bed in it one need not have bothered about hotels at all  young smith the secretary of our photographic club called at nine to ask me to take him a negative of the statue of the dying gladiator in the munich sculpture gallery  i told him that i should be delighted to oblige him but that i did not intend to take my camera with me  not take your camera he said  you are going to germanyto rhineland  you are going to pass through some of the most picturesque scenery and stay at some of the most ancient and famous towns of europe and are going to leave your photographic apparatus behind you and you call yourself an artist  he said i should never regret a thing more in my life than going without that camera  i think it is always right to take other peoples advice in matters where they know more than you do  it is the experience of those who have gone before that makes the way smooth for those who follow  so after supper i got together the things i had been advised to take with me and arranged them on the bed adding a few articles i had thought of all by myself  i put up plenty of writing paper and a bottle of ink along with a dictionary and a few other books of reference in case i should feel inclined to do any work while i was away  i always like to be prepared for work one never knows when one may feel inclined for it  sometimes when i have been away and have forgotten to bring any paper and pens and ink with me i have felt so inclined for writing and it has quite upset me that in consequence of not having brought any paper and pens and ink with me i have been unable to sit down and do a lot of work but have been compelled instead to lounge about all day with my hands in my pockets  accordingly i always take plenty of paper and pens and ink with me now wherever i go so that when the desire for work comes to me i need not check it  that this craving for work should have troubled me so often when i had no paper pens and ink by me and that it never by any chance visits me now when i am careful to be in a position to gratify it is a matter over which i have often puzzled  but when it does come i shall be ready for it  i also put on the bed a few volumes of goethe because i thought it would be so pleasant to read him in his own country  and i decided to take a sponge together with a small portable bath because a cold bath is so refreshing the first thing in the morning  b came in just as i had got everything into a pile  he stared at the bed and asked me what i was doing  i told him i was packing  great heavens he exclaimed  i thought you were moving  what do you think we are going to docamp out  no i replied  but these are the things i have been advised to take with me  what is the use of people giving you advice if you dont take it  he said  oh take as much advice as you like that always comes in useful to give away  but for goodness sake dont get carrying all that stuff about with you  people will take us for gipsies  i said  now its no use your talking nonsense  half the things on this bed are lifepreserving things  if people go into germany without these things they come home and die  and i related to him what the doctor and the vicar and the other people had told me and explained to him how my life depended upon my taking brandy and blankets and sunshades and plenty of warm clothing with me  he is a man utterly indifferent to danger and riskincurred by other peopleis b  he said  oh rubbish  youre not the sort that catches a cold and dies young you leave that cooperative stores of yours at home and pack up a toothbrush a comb a pair of socks and a shirt  thats all youll want                                        i have packed more than that but not much  at all events i have got everything into one small bag  i should like to have taken that tea arrangementit would have done so nicely to play at shop with in the trainbut b would not hear of it  i hope the weather does not change     friday 23rd   early risingballast should be stowed away in the hold before putting to seaannoying interference of providence in matters that it does not understanda socialistic societyb misjudges mean uninteresting anecdotewe lay in ballasta moderate sailora playful boat  i got up very early this morning  i do not know why i got up early  we do not start till eight oclock this evening  but i dont regret itthe getting up early i mean  it is a change  i got everybody else up too and we all had breakfast at seven  i made a very good lunch  one of those seafaring men said to me once  now if ever you are going a short passage and are at all nervous you lay in a good load  its a good load in the hold what steadies the ship its them halfempty cruisers as goes arollin and apitchin and aheavin all over the place with their stern upards half the time you lay in ballast  it seemed very reasonable advice  aunt emma came in the afternoon  she said she was so glad she had caught me  something told her to change her mind and come on friday instead of saturday  it was providence she said  i wish providence would mind its own business and not interfere in my affairs it does not understand them  she says she shall stop till i come back as she wants to see me again before she goes  i told her i might not be back for a month  she said it didnt matter she had plenty of time and would wait for me  the family entreat me to hurry home  i ate a very fair dinnerlaid in a good stock of ballast as my seafaring friend would have said wished goodbye to everybody and kissed aunt emma promised to take care of myselfa promise which please heaven i will faithfully keep cost me what it mayhailed a cab and started  i reached victoria some time before b  i secured two corner seats in a smokingcarriage and then paced up and down the platform waiting for him  when men have nothing else to occupy their minds they take to thinking having nothing better to do until b arrived i fell to musing  what a wonderful piece of socialism modern civilisation has becomenot the socialism of the socalled socialistsa system modelled apparently upon the methods of the convict prisona system under which each miserable sinner is to be compelled to labour like a beast of burden for no personal benefit to himself but only for the good of the communitya world where there are to be no men but only numberswhere there is to be no ambition and no hope and no fearbut the socialism of free men working side by side in the common workshop each one for the wage to which his skill and energy entitle him the socialism of responsible thinking individuals not of statedirected automata  here was i in exchange for the result of some of my labour going to be taken by society for a treat to the middle of europe and back  railway lines had been laid over the whole 700 or 800 miles to facilitate my progress bridges had been built and tunnels made an army of engineers and guards and signalmen and porters and clerks were waiting to take charge of me and to see to my comfort and safety  all i had to do was to tell society here represented by a railway bookingclerk where i wanted to go and to step into a carriage all the rest would be done for me  books and papers had been written and printed so that if i wished to beguile the journey by reading i could do so  at various places on the route thoughtful society had taken care to be ready for me with all kinds of refreshment her sandwiches might be a little fresher but maybe she thinks new bread injurious for me  when i am tired of travelling and want to rest i find society waiting for me with dinner and a comfortable bed with hot and cold water to wash in and towels to wipe upon  wherever i go whatever i need society like the enslaved genii of some eastern tale is ready and anxious to help me to serve me to do my bidding to give me enjoyment and pleasure  society will take me to oberammergau will provide for all my wants on the way and when i am there will show me the passion play which she has arranged and rehearsed and will play for my instruction will bring me back any way i like to come explaining by means of her guidebooks and histories everything upon the way that she thinks can interest me will while i am absent carry my messages to those i have left behind me in england and will bring me theirs in return will look after me and take care of me and protect me like a motheras no mother ever could  all that she asks in return is that i shall do the work she has given me to do  as a man works so society deals by him  to me society says you sit at your desk and write that is all i want you to do  you are not good for much but you can spin out yards of what you and your friends i suppose call literature and some people seem to enjoy reading it  very well you sit there and write this literature or whatever it is and keep your mind fixed on that  i will see to everything else for you  i will provide you with writing materials and books of wit and humour and paste and scissors and everything else that may be necessary to you in your trade and i will feed you and clothe you and lodge you and i will take you about to places that you wish to go to and i will see that you have plenty of tobacco and all other things practicable that you may desireprovided that you work well  the more work you do and the better work you do the better i shall look after you  you writethat is all i want you to do  but i say to society i dont like work i dont want to work  why should i be a slave and work  all right answers society dont work  im not forcing you  all i say is that if you dont work for me i shall not work for you  no work from you no dinner from meno holidays no tobacco  and i decide to be a slave and work  society has no notion of paying all men equally  her great object is to encourage brain  the man who merely works by his muscles she regards as very little superior to the horse or the ox and provides for him just a little better  but the moment he begins to use his head and from the labourer rises to the artisan she begins to raise his wages  of course hers is a very imperfect method of encouraging thought  she is of the world and takes a worldly standard of cleverness  to the shallow showy writer i fear she generally pays far more than to the deep and brilliant thinker and clever roguery seems often more to her liking than honest worth  but her scheme is a right and sound one her aims and intentions are clear her methods on the whole work fairly well and every year she grows in judgment  one day she will arrive at perfect wisdom and will pay each man according to his deserts  but do not be alarmed  this will not happen in our time  turning round while still musing about society i ran against b literally  he thought i was a clumsy ass at first and said so but on recognising me apologised for his mistake  he had been there for some time also waiting for me  i told him that i had secured two corner seats in a smokingcarriage and he replied that he had done so too  by a curious coincidence we had both fixed upon the same carriage  i had taken the corner seats near the platform and he had booked the two opposite corners  four other passengers sat huddled up in the middle we kept the seats near the door and gave the other two away  one should always practise generosity  there was a very talkative man in our carriage  i never came across a man with such a fund of utterly uninteresting anecdotes  he had a friend with himat all events the man was his friend when they startedand he talked to this friend incessantly from the moment the train left victoria until it arrived at dover  first of all he told him a long story about a dog  there was no point in the story whatever  it was simply a bald narrative of the dogs daily doings  the dog got up in the morning and barked at the door and when they came down and opened the door there he was and he stopped all day in the garden and when his wife not the dogs wife the wife of the man who was telling the story went out in the afternoon he was asleep on the grass and they brought him into the house and he played with the children and in the evening he slept in the coalshed and next morning there he was again  and so on for about forty minutes  a very dear chum or near relative of the dogs might doubtless have found the account enthralling but what possible interest a strangera man who evidently didnt even know the dogcould be expected to take in the report it was difficult to conceive  the friend at first tried to feel excited and murmured wonderful very strange indeed  how curious and helped the tale along by such ejaculations as no did he though  and what did you do then or was that on the monday or the tuesday then  but as the story progressed he appeared to take a positive dislike to the dog and only yawned each time that it was mentioned  indeed towards the end i think though i trust i am mistaken i heard him mutter oh damn the dog  after the dog story we thought we were going to have a little quiet but we were mistaken for with the same breath with which he finished the dog rigmarole our talkative companion added  but i can tell you a funnier thing than that  we all felt we could believe that assertion  if he had boasted that he could tell a duller more uninteresting story we should have doubted him but the possibility of his being able to relate something funnier we could readily grasp  but it was not a bit funnier after all  it was only longer and more involved  it was the history of a man who grew his own celery and then later on it turned out that his wife was the niece by the mothers side of a man who had made an ottoman out of an old packingcase  the friend glanced round the carriage apologetically about the middle of this story with an expression that said  im awfully sorry gentlemen but it really is not my fault  you see the position im in  dont blame me  dont make it worse for me to bear than it is  and we each replied with pitying sympathetic looks that implied  thats all right my dear sir dont you fret about that  we see how it is  we only wish we could do something to help you  the poor fellow seemed happier and more resigned after that  b and i hurried on board at dover and were just in time to secure the last two berths in the boat and we were glad that we had managed to do this because our idea was that we should after a good supper turn in and go comfortably to sleep  b said  what i like to do during a sea passage is to go to sleep and then wake up and find that i am there  we made a very creditable supper  i explained to b the ballast principle held by my seafaring friend and he agreed with me that the idea seemed reasonable and as there was a fixed price for supper and you had as much as you liked we determined to give the plan a fair trial  b left me after supper somewhat abruptly as it appeared to me and i took a stroll on deck by myself  i did not feel very comfortable  i am what i call a moderate sailor  i do not go to excess in either direction  on ordinary occasions i can swagger about and smoke my pipe and lie about my channel experiences with the best of them  but when there is what the captain calls a bit of a sea on i feel sad and try to get away from the smell of the engines and the proximity of people who smoke green cigars  there was a man smoking a peculiarly mellow and unctuous cigar on deck when i got there  i dont believe he smoked it because he enjoyed it he did not look as if he enjoyed it  i believe he smoked it merely to show how well he was feeling and to irritate people who were not feeling very well  there is something very blatantly offensive about the man who feels well on board a boat  i am very objectionable myself i know when i am feeling all right  it is not enough for me that i am not ill  i want everybody to see that i am not ill  it seems to me that i am wasting myself if i dont let every human being in the vessel know that i am not ill  i cannot sit still and be thankful like youd imagine a sensible man would  i walk about the shipsmoking of courseand look at people who are not well with mild but pitying surprise as if i wondered what it was like and how they did it  it is very foolish of me i know but i cannot help it  i suppose it is the human nature that exists in even the best of us that makes us act like this  i could not get away from this mans cigar or when i did i came within range of the perfume from the engineroom and felt i wanted to go back to the cigar  there seemed to be no neutral ground between the two  if it had not been that i had paid for saloon i should have gone fore it was much fresher there and i should have been much happier there altogether  but i was not going to pay for firstclass and then ride thirdthat was not business  no i would stick to the swagger part of the ship and feel aristocratic and sick  a mate or a boatswain or an admiral or one of those sort of peoplei could not be sure in the darkness which it wascame up to me as i was leaning with my head against the paddlebox and asked me what i thought of the ship  he said she was a new boat and that this was her first voyage  i said i hoped she would get a bit steadier as she grew older  he replied yes she is a bit skittish tonight  what it seemed to me was that the ship would try to lie down and go to sleep on her right side and then before she had given that position a fair trial would suddenly change her mind and think she could do it better on her left  at the moment the man came up to me she was trying to stand on her head and before he had finished speaking she had given up this attempt in which however she had very nearly succeeded and had apparently decided to now play at getting out of the water altogether  and this is what he called being a bit skittish  seafaring people talk like this because they are silly and do not know any better  it is no use being angry with them  i got a little sleep at last  not in the bunk i had been at such pains to secure i would not have stopped down in that stuffy saloon if anybody had offered me a hundred pounds for doing so  not that anybody did nor that anybody seemed to want me there at all  i gathered this from the fact that the first thing that met my eye after i had succeeded in clawing my way down was a boot  the air was full of boots  there were sixty men sleeping thereor as regards the majority i should say trying to sleep theresome in bunks some on tables and some under tables  one man was asleep and was snoring like a hippopotamuslike a hippopotamus that had caught a cold and was hoarse and the other fiftynine were sitting up throwing their boots at him  it was a snore very difficult to locate  from which particular berth in that dimlylighted evilsmelling place it proceeded nobody was quite sure at one moment it appeared to come wailing and sobbing from the larboard and the next instant it thundered forth seemingly from the starboard  so every man who could reach a boot picked it up and threw it promiscuously silently praying to providence as he did so to guide it aright and bring it safe to its desired haven  i watched the weird scene for a minute or two and then i hauled myself on deck again and sat downand went to sleep on a coil of rope and was awakened in the course of time by a sailor who wanted that coil of rope to throw at the head of a man who was standing doing no harm to anybody on the quay at ostend     saturday 24th   arrival at ostendcoffee and rollsdifficulty of making french waiters understand germanadvantages of possessing a conscience that does not get up too earlyvillainy triumphantvirtue ordered outsidea homely english row  when i say i was awakened at ostend i do not speak the strict truth i was not awakenednot properly  i was only halfawakened  i never did get fairly awake until the afternoon  during the journey from ostend to cologne i was threeparts asleep and onepart partially awake  at ostend however i was sufficiently aroused to grasp the idea that we had got somewhere and that i must find my luggage and b and do something or other in addition to which a strange vague instinct but one which i have never yet known deceive me hovering about my mind and telling me that i was in the neighbourhood of something to eat and drink spurred me to vigour and action  i hurried down into the saloon and there found b  he excused himself for having left me alone all nighthe need not have troubled himself  i had not pined for him in the least  if the only woman i had ever loved had been on board i should have sat silent and let any other fellow talk to her that wanted to and that felt equal to itby explaining that he had met a friend and that they had been talking  it appeared to have been a trying conversation  i also ran against the talkative man and his companion  such a complete wreck of a once strong man as the latter looked i have never before seen mere seasickness however severe could never have accounted for the change in his appearance since happy and hopeful he entered the railwaycarriage at victoria six short hours ago  his friend on the other hand appeared fresh and cheerful and was relating an anecdote about a cow  we took our bags into the custom house and opened them and i sat down on mine and immediately went to sleep  when i awoke somebody whom i mistook at first for a fieldmarshal and from force of habiti was once a volunteersaluted was standing over me pointing melodramatically at my bag  i assured him in picturesque german that i had nothing to declare  he did not appear to comprehend me which struck me as curious and took the bag away from me which left me nothing to sit upon but the floor  but i felt too sleepy to be indignant  after our luggage had been examined we went into the buffet  my instinct had not misled me there i found hot coffee and rolls and butter  i ordered two coffees with milk some bread and some butter  i ordered them in the best german i knew  as nobody understood me i went and got the things for myself  it saves a deal of argument that method people seem to know what you mean in a moment then  b suggested that while we were in belgium where everybody spoke french while very few indeed knew german i should stand a better chance of being understood if i talked less german and more french  he said  it will be easier for you and less of a strain upon the natives  you stick to french he continued as long as ever you can  you will get along much better with french  you will come across people now and thensmart intelligent peoplewho will partially understand your french but no human being except a thoughtreader will ever obtain any glimmering of what you mean from your german  oh are we in belgium i replied sleepily i thought we were in germany  i didnt know  and then in a burst of confidence i added feeling that further deceit was useless i dont know where i am you know  no i thought you didnt he replied  that is exactly the idea you give anybody  i wish youd wake up a bit  we waited about an hour at ostend while our train was made up  there was only one carriage labelled for cologne and four more passengers wanted to go there than the compartment would hold  not being aware of this b and i made no haste to secure places and in consequence when having finished our coffee we leisurely strolled up and opened the carriage door we saw that every seat was already booked a bag was in one space and a rug in another an umbrella booked a third and so on  nobody was there but the seats were gone  it is the unwritten law among travellers that a mans luggage deposited upon a seat shall secure that seat to him until he comes to sit upon it himself  this is a good law and a just law and one that in my normal state i myself would die to uphold and maintain  but at three oclock on a chilly morning ones moral sensibilities are not properly developed  the average mans conscience does not begin work till eight or nine oclocknot till after breakfast in fact  at three am he will do things that at three in the afternoon his soul would revolt at  under ordinary circumstances i should as soon have thought of shifting a mans bag and appropriating his seat as an ancient hebrew squatter would have thought of removing his neighbours landmark but at this time in the morning my better nature was asleep  i have often read of a mans better nature being suddenly awakened  the business is generally accomplished by an organgrinder or a little child i would back the latter at all eventsgive it a fair chanceto awaken anything in this world that was not stone deaf or that had not been dead for more than twentyfour hours and if an organgrinder or a little child had been around ostend station that morning things might have been different  b and i might have been saved from crime  just as we were in the middle of our villainy the organgrinder or the child would have struck up and we should have burst into tears and have rushed from the carriage and have fallen upon each others necks outside on the platform and have wept and waited for the next train  as it was after looking carefully round to see that nobody was watching us we slipped quickly into the carriage and making room for ourselves among the luggage there sat down and tried to look innocent and easy  b said that the best thing we could do when the other people came would be to pretend to be dead asleep and too stupid to understand anything  i replied that as far as i was concerned i thought i could convey the desired impression without stooping to deceit at all and prepared to make myself comfortable  a few seconds later another man got into the carriage  he also made room for himself among the luggage and sat down  i am afraid that seats taken sir said b when he had recovered his surprise at the mans coolness  in fact all the seats in this carriage are taken  i cant help that replied the ruffian cynically  ive got to get to cologne some time today and there seems no other way of doing it that i can see  yes but so has the gentleman whose seat you have taken got to get there i remonstrated what about him  you are thinking only of yourself  my sense of right and justice was beginning to assert itself and i felt quite indignant with the fellow  two minutes ago as i have explained i could contemplate the taking of another mans seat with equanimity  now such an act seemed to me shameful  the truth is that my better nature never sleeps for long  leave it alone and it wakens of its own accord heaven help me i am a sinful worldly man i know but there is good at the bottom of me  it wants hauling up but its there  this man had aroused it  i now saw the sinfulness of taking another passengers place in a railwaycarriage  but i could not make the other man see it  i felt that some service was due from me to justice in compensation of the wrong i had done her a few moments ago and i argued most eloquently  my rhetoric was however quite thrown away  oh its only a viceconsul he said heres his name on the bag  theres plenty of room for him in with the guard  it was no use my defending the sacred cause of right before a man who held sentiments like that so having lodged a protest against his behaviour and thus eased my conscience i leant back and dozed the doze of the just  five minutes before the train started the rightful owners of the carriage came up and crowded in  they seemed surprised at finding only five vacant seats available between seven of them and commenced to quarrel vigorously among themselves  b and i and the unjust man in the corner tried to calm them but passion ran too high at first for the voice of reason to be heard  each combination of five possible among them accused each remaining two of endeavouring to obtain seats by fraud and each one more than hinted that the other six were liars  what annoyed me was that they quarrelled in english  they all had languages of their ownthere were four belgians two frenchmen and a germanbut no language was good enough for them to insult each other in but english  finding that there seemed to be no chance of their ever agreeing among themselves they appealed to us  we unhesitatingly decided in favour of the five thinnest who thereupon evidently regarding the matter as finally settled sat down and told the other two to get out  these two stout ones howeverthe german and one of the belgiansseemed inclined to dispute the award and called up the stationmaster  the stationmaster did not wait to listen to what they had to say but at once began abusing them for being in the carriage at all  he told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves for forcing their way into a compartment that was already more than full and inconveniencing the people already there  he also used english to explain this to them and they got out on the platform and answered him back in english  english seems to be the popular language for quarrelling in among foreigners  i suppose they find it more expressive  we all watched the group from the window  we were amused and interested in the middle of the argument an early gendarme arrived on the scene the gendarme naturally supported the stationmaster  one man in uniform always supports another man in uniform no matter what the row is about or who may be in the rightthat does not trouble him  it is a fixed tenet of belief among uniform circles that a uniform can do no wrong  if burglars wore uniform the police would be instructed to render them every assistance in their power and to take into custody any householder attempting to interfere with them in the execution of their business the gendarme assisted the stationmaster to abuse the two stout passengers and he also abused them in english  it was not good english in any sense of the word  the man would probably have been able to give his feelings much greater variety and play in french or flemish but that was not his object  his ambition like every other foreigners was to become an accomplished english quarreller and this was practice for him  a customs house clerk came out and joined in the babel  he took the part of the passengers and abused the stationmaster and the gendarme and he abused them in english  b said he thought it very pleasant here far from our native shores in the land of the stranger to come across a little homely english row like this     saturday 24thcontinued   a man of familyan eccentric trainoutrage on an englishmanalone in europedifficulty of making german waiters understand scandinaviandanger of knowing too many languagesa wearisome journeycologne ahoy  there was a very wellinformed belgian in the carriage and he told us something interesting about nearly every town through which we passed  i felt that if i could have kept awake and have listened to that man and remembered what he said and not mixed things up i should have learnt a good deal about the country between ostend and cologne  he had relations in nearly every town had this man  i suppose there have been and are families as large and as extensive as his but i never heard of any other family that made such a show  they seemed to have been planted out with great judgment and were now all over the country  every time i awoke i caught some such scattered remark as  brugesyou can see the belfry from this sideplays a polka by haydn every hour  my aunt lives here  ghenthotel de ville some say finest specimen of gothic architecture in europewhere my mother lives you could see the house if that church wasnt there  just passed alostgreat hop centre  my grandfather used to live there hes dead now  theres the royal chateauhere just on this side  my sister is married to a man who lives therenot in the palace i dont mean but in laeken  thats the dome of the palais de justicethey call brussels paris in littlei like it better than paris myselfnot so crowded i live in brussels  louvaintheres van de weyers statue the 1830 revolutionist  my wifes mother lives in louvain  she wants us to come and live there  she says we are too far away from her at brussels but i dont think so  leigesee the citadel  got some cousins at leigeonly second ones  most of my first ones live at maestricht and so on all the way to cologne  i do not believe we passed a single town or village that did not possess one or more specimens of this mans relatives  our journey seemed not so much like a tour through belgium and part of northern germany as a visit to the neighbourhood where this mans family resided  i was careful to take a seat facing the engine at ostend  i prefer to travel that way  but when i awoke a little later on i found myself going backwards  i naturally felt indignant  i said  whos put me over here  i was over there you know  youve no right to do that  they assured me however that nobody had shifted me but that the train had turned round at ghent  i was annoyed at this  it seemed to me a mean trick for a train to start off in one direction and thus lure you into taking your seat or somebody elses seat as the case might be under the impression that you were going to travel that way and then afterwards turn round and go the other way  i felt very doubtful in my own mind as to whether the train knew where it was going at all  at brussels we got out and had some more coffee and rolls  i forget what language i talked at brussels but nobody understood me  when i next awoke after leaving brussels i found myself going forwards again  the engine had apparently changed its mind for the second time and was pulling the carriages the other way now  i began to get thoroughly alarmed  this train was simply doing what it liked  there was no reliance to be placed upon it whatever  the next thing it would do would be to go sideways  it seemed to me that i ought to get up and see into this matter but while pondering the business i fell asleep again  i was very sleepy indeed when they routed us out at herbesthal to examine our luggage for germany  i had a vague idea that we were travelling in turkey and had been stopped by brigands  when they told me to open my bag i said never and remarked that i was an englishman and that they had better be careful  i also told them that they could dismiss any idea of ransom from their minds at once unless they were prepared to take ious as it was against the principles of our family to pay cash for anythingcertainly not for relatives  they took no notice of my warning and caught hold of my gladstone  i resisted feebly but was overpowered and went to sleep again  on awakening i discovered myself in the buffet  i have no recollection of going there  my instinct must have guided me there during my sleep  i ordered my usual repast of coffee and rolls  i must have been full of coffee and rolls by this time  i had got the idea into my head now that i was in norway and so i ordered them in broken scandinavian a few words of which i had picked up during a trip through the fiords last summer  of course the man did not understand but i am accustomed to witnessing the confusion of foreigners when addressed in their native tongue and so forgave himespecially as the victuals being well within reach language was a matter of secondary importance  i took two cups of coffee as usualone for b and one for myselfand bringing them to the table looked round for b  i could not see him anywhere  what had become of him  i had not seen him that i could recollect for hours  i did not know where i was or what i was doing i had a hazy knowledge that b and i had started off togetherwhether yesterday or six months ago i could not have said to save my lifewith the intention if i was not mistaken of going somewhere and seeing something  we were now somewhere abroadsomewhere in norway was my idea though why i had fixed on norway is a mystery to me to this dayand i had lost him  how on earth were we ever to find each other again  a horrible picture presented itself to my mind of our both wandering distractedly up and down europe perhaps for years vainly seeking each other  the touching story of evangeline recurred to me with terrible vividness  something must be done and that immediately  somehow or another i must find b  i roused myself and summoned to my aid every word of scandinavian that i knew  it was no good these people pretending that they did not understand their own language and putting me off that way  they had got to understand it this time  this was no mere question of coffee and rolls this was a serious business  i would make that waiter understand my scandinavian if i had to hammer it into his head with his own coffeepot  i seized him by the arm and in scandinavian that must have been quite pathetic in its tragic fervour i asked him if he had seen my friendmy friend b  the man only stared  i grew desperate  i shook him  i said  my friendbig great tall largeis he where  have you him to see where  here  i had to put it that way because scandinavian grammar is not a strong point with me and my knowledge of the verbs is as yet limited to the present tense of the infinitive mood  besides this was no time to worry about grace of style  a crowd gathered round us attracted by the mans terrified expression i appealed to them generally  i said  my friend bhead redboots yellow brown goldcoat little squaresnose much large  is he where  him to seeanybodywhere  not a soul moved a hand to help me  there they stood and gaped  i repeated it all over again louder in case anybody on the outskirts of the mob had not heard it and i repeated it in an entirely new accent  i gave them every chance i could  they chatted excitedly among themselves and then a bright idea seemed to strike one of them a little more intelligentlooking than the rest and he rushed outside and began running up and down calling out something very loudly in which the word norwegian kept on occurring  he returned in a few seconds evidently exceedingly pleased with himself accompanied by a kindlylooking old gentleman in a white hat  way was made in the crowd and the old gentleman pressed forward  when he got near he smiled at me and then proceeded to address to me a lengthy but no doubt kindly meant speech in scandinavian  of course it was all utterly unintelligible to me from beginning to end and my face clearly showed this  i can grasp a word or two of scandinavian here and there if pronounced slowly and distinctly but that is all  the old gentleman regarded me with great surprise  he said in scandinavian of course  you speak norwegian  i replied in the same tongue  a little a very littlevery  he seemed not only disappointed but indignant  he explained the matter to the crowd and they all seemed indignant  why everybody should be indignant with me i could not comprehend there are plenty of people who do not understand scandinavian  it was absurd to be vexed with me because i did not  i do know a little and that is more than some people do  i inquired of the old gentleman about b  he did understand me  i must give him credit for that  but beyond understanding me he was of no more use than the others and why they had taken so much trouble to fetch him i could not imagine  what would have happened if the difficulty had continued much longer for i was getting thoroughly wild with the lot of them i cannot say fortunately at this moment i caught sight of b himself who had just entered the room  i could not have greeted him more heartily if i had wanted to borrow money of him  well i am glad to see you again i cried  well this is pleasant  i thought i had lost you  why you are english cried out the old gentleman in the white hat in very good saxon on hearing me speak to b  well i know that i replied and im proud of it  have you any objection to my being english  not in the least he answered if youd only talk english instead of norwegian  im english myself and he walked away evidently much puzzled  b said to me as we sat down  ill tell you whats the matter with you jyou know too many languages for this continent  your linguistic powers will be the ruin of us if you dont hold them in a bit  you dont know any sanscrit or chaldean do you  i replied that i did not  any hebrew or chinese  not a word  sure  not so much as a full stop in any of them  thats a blessing said b much relieved  you would be trying to palm off one or other of them on some simpleminded peasant for german if you did  it is a wearisome journey through the long hot hours of the morning to cologne  the carriage is stifling  railway travellers i have always noticed regard fresh air as poison  they like to live on the refuse of each others breath and close up every window and ventilator tight  the sun pours down through glass and blind and scorches our limbs  our heads and our bodies ache  the dust and soot drift in and settle on our clothes and grime our hands and face  we all doze and wake up with a start and fall to sleep again upon each other  i wake and find my neighbour with his head upon my shoulder  it seems a shame to cast him off he looks so trustful  but he is heavy  i push him on to the man the other side  he is just as happy there  we roll about and when the train jerks we butt each other with our heads  things fall from the rack upon us  we look up surprised and go to sleep again  my bag tumbles down upon the head of the unjust man in the corner  is it retribution  he starts up begs my pardon and sinks back into oblivion  i am too sleepy to pick up the bag  it lies there on the floor  the unjust man uses it for a footstool  we look out through halfclosed eyes upon the parched level treeless land upon the little patchwork farms of corn and beetroot oats and fruit growing undivided side by side each looking like a little garden dropped down into the plain upon the little dull stone houses  a steeple appears far away upon the horizon  the first thing that we ask of men is their faith what do you believe  the first thing that they show us is their church this we believe  then a tall chimney ranges itself alongside  first faith then works  then a confused jumble of roofs out of which at last stand forth individual houses factories streets and we draw up in a sleeping town  people open the carriage door and look in upon us  they do not appear to think much of us and close the door again quickly with a bang and we sleep once more  as we rumble on the country slowly wakes  rude vshaped carts drawn by yoked oxen and even sometimes by cows wait patiently while we cross the long straight roads stretching bare for many a mile across the plain peasants trudge along the fields to work  smoke rises from the villages and farmhouses  passengers are waiting at the wayside stations  towards midday on looking out we see two tiny spires standing side by side against the sky  they seem to be twins and grow taller as we approach  i describe them to b and he says they are the steeples of cologne cathedral and we all begin to yawn and stretch and to collect our bags and coats and umbrellas     half of saturday 24th and some of sunday 25th   difficulty of keeping this diarya big washthe german bedits goings onmanners and customs of the german armybs besetting sincologne cathedralthoughts without wordsa curious custom  this diary is getting mixed  the truth is i am not living as a man who keeps a diary should live  i ought of course to sit down in front of this diary at eleven oclock at night and write down all that has occurred to me during the day  but at eleven oclock at night i am in the middle of a long railway journey or have just got up or am just going to bed for a couple of hours  we go to bed at odd moments when we happen to come across a bed and have a few minutes to spare  we have been to bed this afternoon and are now having another breakfast and i am not quite sure whether it is yesterday or tomorrow or what day it is  i shall not attempt to write up this diary in the orthodox manner therefore but shall fix in a few lines whenever i have halfanhour with nothing better to do  we washed ourselves in the rhine at cologne we had not had a wash since we had left our happy home in england  we started with the idea of washing ourselves at the hotel but on seeing the basin and water and towel provided i decided not to waste my time playing with them  as well might hercules have attempted to tidy up the augean stables with a squirt  we appealed to the chambermaid  we explained to her that we wanted to washto clean ourselvesnot to blow bubbles  could we not have bigger basins and more water and more extensive towels  the chambermaid a staid old lady of about fifty did not think that anything better could be done for us by the hotel fraternity of cologne and seemed to think that the river was more what we wanted  i fancied that the old soul was speaking sarcastically but b said no she was thinking of the baths alongside the river and suggested that we should go there  i agreed  it seemed to me that the riverthe rhinewould if anything could meet the case  there ought to be plenty of water in it now after the heavy spring rains  when i saw it i felt satisfied  i said to b  thats all right old man thats the sort of thing we need  that is just the sized river i feel i can get myself clean in this afternoon  i have heard a good deal in praise of the rhine and i am glad to be able to speak well of it myself  i found it most refreshing  i was however sorry that we had washed in it afterwards  i have heard from friends who have travelled since in germany that we completely spoiled that river for the rest of the season  not for business purposes i do not mean  the barge traffic has been comparatively speaking uninterfered with  but the tourist trade has suffered terribly  parties who usually go up the rhine by steamer have after looking at the river gone by train this year  the boat agents have tried to persuade them that the rhine is always that colour that it gets like that owing to the dirt and refuse washed down into it during its course among the mountains  but the tourists have refused to accept this explanation  they have said  no  mountains will account for a good deal we admit but not for all that  we are acquainted with the ordinary condition of the rhine and although muddy and at times unpleasant it is passable  as it is this summer however we would prefer not to travel upon it  we will wait until after next years springfloods  we went to bed after our wash  to the blase english bedgoer accustomed all his life to the same old hackneyed style of bed night after night there is something very pleasantly piquant about the experience of trying to sleep in a german bed  he does not know it is a bed at first  he thinks that someone has been going round the room collecting all the sacks and cushions and antimacassars and such articles that he has happened to find about and has piled them up on a wooden tray ready for moving  he rings for the chambermaid and explains to her that she has shown him into the wrong room  he wanted a bedroom  she says this is a bedroom  he says wheres the bed  there she says pointing to the box on which the sacks and antimacassars and cushions lie piled  that he cries  how am i going to sleep in that  the chambermaid does not know how he is going to sleep there never having seen a gentleman go to sleep anywhere and not knowing how they set about it but suggests that he might try lying down flat and shutting his eyes  but it is not long enough he says  the chambermaid thinks he will be able to manage if he tucks his legs up  he sees that he will not get anything better and that he must put up with it  oh very well he says  look sharp and get it made then  she says it is made  he turns and regards the girl sternly  is she taking advantage of his being a lonely stranger far from home and friends to mock him  he goes over to what she calls the bed and snatching off the topmost sack from the pile and holding it up says  perhaps youll tell me what this is then  that says the girl thats the bed  he is somewhat nonplussed at the unexpected reply  oh he says  oh the bed is it  i thought it was a pincushion well if it is the bed then what is it doing out here on the top of everything else  you think that because im only a man i dont understand a bed  thats the proper place for it responds the chambermaid  what on top  yes sir  well then where are the clothes  underneath sir  look here my good girl he says you dont understand me or i dont understand you one or the other  when i go to sleep i lie on a bed and pull the clothes over me  i dont want to lie on the clothes and cover myself with the bed  this isnt a comic ballet you know  the girl assures him that there is no mistake about the matter at all there is the bed made according to german notions of how a bed should be made  he can make the best of it and try to go to sleep upon it or he can be sulky and go to sleep on the floor  he is very much surprised  it looks to him the sort of bed that a man would make for himself on coming home late from a party  but it is no use arguing the matter with the girl  all right he says bring me a pillow and ill risk it  the chambermaid explains that there are two pillows on the bed already indicating as she does so two flat cushions each one a yard square placed one on top of the other at one end of the mixture  these exclaims the weary traveller beginning to feel that he does not want to go to bed at all  these are not pillows  i want something to put my head on not a thing that comes down to the middle of my back dont tell me that ive got to sleep on these things  but the girl does tell him so and also implies that she has something else to do than to stand there all day talking bedgossip with him  well just show me how to start he says which way you get into it and then i wont keep you any longer ill puzzle out the rest for myself  she explains the trick to him and leaves and he undresses and crawls in  the pillows give him a good deal of worry  he does not know whether he is meant to sit on them or merely to lean up against them  in experimenting upon this point he bumps his head against the top board of the bedstead  at this he says oh and shoots himself down to the bottom of the bed  here all his ten toes simultaneously come into sharp contact with the board at the bottom  nothing irritates a man more than being rapped over the toes especially if he feels that he has done nothing to deserve it  he says oh damn this time and spasmodically doubles up his legs thus giving his knees a violent blow against the board at the side of the bed  the german bedstead be it remembered is built in the form of a shallow open box and the victim is thus completely surrounded by solid pieces of wood with sharp edges  i do not know what species of wood it is that is employed it is extremely hard and gives forth a curious musical sound when struck sharply with a bone  after this he lies perfectly still for a while wondering where he is going to be hit next  finding that nothing happens he begins to regain confidence and ventures to gently feel around with his left leg and take stock of his position  for clothes he has only a very thin blanket and sheet and beneath these he feels decidedly chilly  the bed is warm enough so far as it goes but there is not enough of it  he draws it up round his chin and then his feet begin to freeze  he pushes it down over his feet and then all the top part of him shivers  he tries to roll up into a ball so as to get the whole of himself underneath it but does not succeed there is always some of him left outside in the cold  he reflects that a boneless wonder or a man serpent would be comfortable enough in this bed and wishes that he had been brought up as a contortionist  if he could only tie his legs round his neck and tuck his head in under his arm all would yet be well  never having been taught to do any really useful tricks such as these however he has to be content to remain spread out warming a bit of himself at a time  it is perhaps foolish of him amid so many real troubles to allow a mere aesthetical consideration to worry him but as he lies there on his back looking down at himself the sight that he presents to himself considerably annoys him  the puffedup bed resting on the middle of him gives him the appearance of a man suffering from some monstrous swelling or else of some exceptionally welldeveloped frog that has been turned up the wrong way and does not know how to get on to its legs again  another vexation that he has to contend with is that every time he moves a limb or breathes extra hard the bed which is only of down tumbles off on to the floor  you cannot lean out of a german bed to pick up anything off the floor owing to its boxlike formation so he has to scramble out after it and of course every time he does this he barks both his shins twice against the sides of the bed  when he has performed this feat for about the tenth time he concludes that it was madness for him a mere raw amateur at the business to think that he could manage a complicated tricky bed of this sort that must take even an experienced man all he knows to sleep in it and gets out and camps on the floor  at least that is what i did  b is accustomed to german beds and doubled himself up and went off to sleep without the slightest difficulty  we slept for two hours and then got up and went back to the railwaystation where we dined  the railway refreshmentroom in german towns appears to be as much patronised by the inhabitants of the town as by the travellers passing through  it is regarded as an ordinary restaurant and used as such by the citizens  we found the diningroom at cologne station crowded with cologneists  all classes of citizens were there but especially soldiers  there were all sorts of soldierssoldiers of rank and soldiers of rank and file attached soldiers very much attached apparently and soldiers unattached stout soldiers thin soldiers old soldiers young soldiers four very young soldiers sat opposite us drinking beer  i never saw such young soldiers out by themselves before  they each looked about twelve years old but may have been thirteen and they each looked also ready and willing to storm a battery if the order were given to them to do it  there they sat raising and lowering their huge mugs of beer discussing military matters and rising every now and again to gravely salute some officer as he passed and to receive as gravely his grave salute in return  there seemed to be a deal of saluting to be gone through  officers kept entering and passing through the room in an almost continual stream and every time one came in sight all the military drinkers and eaters rose and saluted and remained at the salute until the officer had passed  one young soldier who was trying to eat a plate of soup near us i felt quite sorry for  every time he got the spoon near his mouth an officer invariably hove in view and down would have to go the spoon soup and all and up he would have to rise  it never seemed to occur to the silly fellow to get under the table and finish his dinner there  we had halfanhour to spare between dinner and the starting of our train and b suggested that we should go into the cathedral  that is bs one weakness churches  i have the greatest difficulty in getting him past a churchdoor  we are walking along a street arm in arm talking as rationally and even as virtuously as need be when all at once i find that b has become silent and abstracted  i know what it is he has caught sight of a church  i pretend not to notice any change in him and endeavour to hurry him on  he lags more and more behind however and at last stops altogether  come come i say to him encouragingly pull yourself together and be a man  dont think about it  put it behind you and determine that you wont be conquered  come we shall be round the corner in another minute where you wont be able to see it  take my hand and lets run  he makes a few feeble steps forward with me and then stops again  its no good old man he says with a sickly smile so full of pathos that it is impossible to find it in ones heart to feel anything but pity for him  i cant help it  i have given way to this sort of thing too long  it is too late to reform now  you go on and get a drink somewhere ill join you again in a few minutes  dont worry about me its no good  and back he goes with tottering steps while i sadly pass on into the nearest cafe and over a glass of absinthe or cognac thank providence that i learnt to control my craving for churches in early youth and so am not now like this poor b  in a little while he comes in and sits down beside me  there is a wild unhealthy excitement in his eye and under a defiant air of unnatural gaiety he attempts to hide his consciousness of guilt  it was a lovely altarcloth he whispers to me with an enthusiasm that only makes one sorrow for him the more so utterly impossible does it cause all hope of cure to seem  and theyve got a coffin in the north crypt that is simply a poem  i never enjoyed a sarcophagus more in all my life  i do not say much at the time it would be useless  but after the day is done and we are standing beside our little beds and all around is as silent as one can expect it to be in an hotel where people seem to be arriving all night long with heavy luggage and to be all more or less in trouble i argue with him and gently reprove him  to avoid the appearance of sermonising as much as possible i put it on mere grounds of expediency  how are we to find time i say to go to all the places that we really ought to go toto all the cafes and theatres and musichalls and beergardens and dancingsaloons that we want to visitif you waste half the precious day loafing about churches and cathedrals  he is deeply moved and promises to swear off  he vows with tears in his voice that he will never enter a churchdoor again  but next morning when the temptation comes all his good resolutions are swept away and again he yields  it is no good being angry with him because he evidently does really try but there is something about the mere odour of a church that he simply cannot withstand  not knowing then that this weakness of his for churches was so strong i made no objection to the proposed visit to cologne cathedral and accordingly towards it we wended our way  b has seen it before and knows all about it  he tells me it was begun about the middle of the thirteenth century and was only completed ten years ago  it seems to me that there must have been gross delay on the part of the builder  why a plumber would be ashamed to take as long as that over a job  b also asserts that the two towers are the highest church towers in the world  i dispute this and deprecate the towers generally  b warmly defends them  he says they are higher than any building in europe except the eiffel tower  oh dear no i say there are many buildings higher than they in europeto say nothing of asia and america  i have no authority for making this assertion  as a matter of fact i know nothing whatever about the matter  i merely say it to irritate b he appears to take a sort of personal interest in the building and enlarges upon its beauties and advantages with as much fervour as if he were an auctioneer trying to sell the place  he retorts that the towers are 512 feet high  i say  nonsense  somebody has imposed upon you because they see you are a foreigner  he becomes quite angry at this and says he can show me the figures in the guidebook  the guidebook i reply scornfully  youll believe a newspaper next  b asks me indignantly what height i should say they are then  i examine them critically for a few minutes and then give it as my opinion that they do not exceed 510 feet at the very outside  b seems annoyed with me and we enter the church in silence  there is little to be said about a cathedral  except to the professional sightseer one is very much like another  their beauty to me lies not in the paintings and sculpture they give houseroom to nor in the bones and bricabrac piled up in their cellars but in themselvestheir echoing vastness their deep silence  above the little homes of men above the noisy teeming streets they rise like some soft strain of perfect music cleaving its way amid the jangle of discordant notes  here where the voices of the world sound faint here where the citys glamour comes not in it is good to rest for a whileif only the pestering guides would leave one aloneand think  there is much help in silence  from its touch we gain renewed life silence is to the soul what his mother earth was to briareus  from contact with it we rise healed of our hurts and strengthened for the fight  amid the babel of the schools we stand bewildered and affrighted silence gives us peace and hope  silence teaches us no creed only that gods arms are around the universe  how small and unimportant seem all our fretful troubles and ambitions when we stand with them in our hand before the great calm face of silence  we smile at them ourselves and are ashamed  silence teaches us how little we arehow great we are  in the worlds marketplaces we are tinkers tailors apothecaries thievesrespectable or otherwise as the case may bemere atoms of a mighty machinemere insects in a vast hive  it is only in silence that it comes home to us that we are something much greater than thisthat we are men with all the universe and all eternity before us  it is in silence we hear the voice of truth  the temples and the marts of men echo all night and day to the clamour of lies and shams and quackeries  but in silence falsehood cannot live  you cannot float a lie on silence  a lie has to be puffed aloft and kept from falling by mens breath  leave a lie on the bosom of silence and it sinks  a truth floats there fair and stately like some stout ship upon a deep ocean  silence buoys her up lovingly for all men to see  not until she has grown wornout and rotten and is no longer a truth will the waters of silence close over her  silence is the only real thing we can lay hold of in this world of passing dreams  time is a shadow that will vanish with the twilight of humanity but silence is a part of the eternal  all things that are true and lasting have been taught to mens hearts by silence  among all nations there should be vast temples raised where the people might worship silence and listen to it for it is the voice of god  these fair churches and cathedrals that men have reared around them throughout the world have been built as homes for mere creedsthis one for protestantism that one for romanism another for mahomedanism  but gods silence dwells in all alike only driven forth at times by the tinkling of bells and the mumbling of prayers and in them it is good to sit awhile and have communion with her  we strolled round before we came out  just by the entrance to the choir an official stopped me and asked me if i wanted to go and see a lot of fallal things he had got on showrelics and bones and old masters and suchlike wardourstreet rubbish  i told him no and attempted to pass on but he said  no no  you dont pay you dont go in there and shut the gate  he said this sentence in english and the precision and fluency with which he delivered it rather suggested the idea that it was a phrase much in request and one that he had had a good deal of practice in  it is very prevalent throughout germany this custom of not allowing you to go in to see a thing unless you pay     end of saturday 24th and beginning of sunday 25thcontinued   the rhinehow history is writtencomplicated villageshow a peaceful

experiencesa natural mistakefree acrobatic performance by the guardthe railway authorities little jokewhy we should think of the sorrows of others  we returned to the station just in time to secure comfortable seats and at 510 steamed out upon our fifteen hours run to munich  from bonn to mayence the line keeps by the side of the rhine nearly the whole of the way and we had a splendid view of the river with the oldworld towns and villages that cluster round its bank the misty mountains that make early twilight upon its swiftly rolling waves the castled crags and precipices that rise up sheer and majestic from its margin the wooded rocks that hang with threatening frown above its sombre depths the ruined towers and turrets that cap each point along its shores the pleasant isles that stud like gems its broad expanse of waters  few things in this world come up to expectation especially those things of which one has been led to expect much and about which one has heard a good deal  with this philosophy running in my head i was prepared to find the rhine a much overrated river  i was pleasantly disappointed  the panorama which unfolded itself before our eyes as we sped along through the quiet twilight that was deepening into starry night was wonderfully beautiful entrancing and expressive  i do not intend to describe it to you  to do justice to the theme i should have to be even a more brilliant and powerful writer than i am to attempt the subject without doing it justice would be a waste of your time sweet reader and of minea still more important matter  i confess it was not my original intention to let you off so easily  i started with the idea of giving you a rapid but glowing and eloquent wordpicture of the valley of the rhine from cologne to mayence  for background i thought i would sketch in the historical and legendary events connected with the district and against this for a foreground i would draw in vivid colours the modern aspect of the scene with remarks and observations thereon  here are my rough notes made for the purpose  mems for chapter on rhine constantine the great used to come hereso did agrippa  nbtry and find out something about agrippa  caesar had a good deal to do with the rhinealso neros mother  to the readerthe brevity of these memoranda renders their import at times confusing  for instance this means that caesar and neros mother both had a good deal to do with the rhine not that caesar had a good deal to do with neros mother  i explain this because i should be sorry to convey any false impression concerning either the lady or caesar scandal is a thing abhorrent to my nature  notes continued the ubii did something on the right bank of the rhine at an early period and afterwards were found on the other side  expect the ubii were a tribe but make sure of this as they might be something in the fossil line  cologne was the cradle of german art  talk about art and the old masters  treat them in a kindly and gentle spirit  they are dead now  saint ursula was murdered at cologne with eleven thousand virgin attendants  there must have been quite a party of them  draw powerful and pathetic imaginary picture of the slaughter  nbfind out who murdered them all  say something about the emperor maximilian call him the mighty maximilian  mention charlemagne a good deal should be made out of charlemagne and the franks  find out all about the franks and where they lived and what has become of them  sketch the various contests between the romans and the goths  read up gibbon for this unless you can get enough out of mangnalls questions  give picturesque accountwith commentsof the battles between the citizens of cologne and their haughty archbishops  nblet them fight on a bridge over the rhine unless it is distinctly stated somewhere that they didnt  bring in the minnesingers especially walter von vogelweid make him sing under a castlewall somewhere and let the girl die  talk about albert durer  criticise his style  say its flat  if possible find out if it is flat  the rat tower on the rhine near bingen describe the place and tell the whole story  dont spin it out too long because everybody knows it  the brothers of bornhofen story connected with the twin castles of sterrenberg and liebenstein conrad and heinrichbrothersboth love hildegarde  she was very beautiful heinrich generously refuses to marry the beautiful hildegarde and goes away to the crusades leaving her to his brother conrad  conrad considers over the matter for a year or two and then he decides that he wont marry her either but will leave her for his brother heinrich and he goes off to the crusades from whence he returns a few years later on with a grecian bride  the beautiful h muddled up between the pair of them and the victim of too much generosity gets sulky dont blame her and shuts herself up in a lonely part of the castle and wont see anybody for years  chivalrous heinrich returns and is wild that his brother c has not married the beautiful h  it does not occur to him to marry the girl even then  the feverish yearning displayed by each of these two brothers that the other one should marry the beloved hildegarde is very touching  heinrich draws his sword and throws himself upon his brother c to kill him  the beautiful hildegarde however throws herself between them and reconciliates them and then convinced that neither of them means business and naturally disgusted with the whole affair retires into a nunnery  conrads grecian bride subsequently throws herself away on another man upon which conrad throws himself on his brother hs breast and they swear eternal friendship make it pathetic  pretend you have sat amid the ruins in the moonlight and give the scenewith ghosts  rolandseck near bonn  tell the story of roland and hildegunde see baedeker p 66  dont make it too long because it is so much like the other  describe the funeral the watch tower on the rhine below audernach  query isnt there a song about this  if so put it in  coblentz and ehrenbreitstein  great fortresses  call them the frowning sentinels of the state  make reflections on the german army also on war generally  chat about frederick the great  read carlyles history of him and pick out the interesting bits  the drachenfels  quote byron  moralise about ruined castles generally and describe the middle ages with your views and opinions on same  there is much more of it but that is sufficient to let you see the scheme i had in my head  i have not carried out my scheme because when i came to reflect upon the matter it seemed to me that the idea would develop into something that would be more in the nature of a history of europe than a chapter in a tourists diary and i determined not to waste my time upon it until there arose a greater public demand for a new history of europe than there appears to exist at present  besides i argued to myself such a work would be just the very thing with which to beguile the tedium of a long imprisonment  at some future time i may be glad of a labour of this magnitude to occupy a period of involuntary inaction  this is the sort of thing i said to myself to save up for holloway or pentonville  it would have been a very enjoyable ride altogether that evenings spin along the banks of the rhine if i had not been haunted at the time by the idea that i should have to write an account of it next day in my diary  as it was i enjoyed it as a man enjoys a dinner when he has got to make a speech after it or as a critic enjoys a play  we passed such odd little villages every here and there  little places so crowded up between the railway and the river that there was no room in them for any streets  all the houses were jumbled up together just anyhow and how any man who lived in the middle could get home without climbing over half the other houses in the place i could not make out they were the sort of villages where a mans motherinlaw coming to pay him a visit might wander around all day hearing him and even now and then seeing him yet never being able to get at him in consequence of not knowing the way in  a drunken man living in one of these villages could never hope to get home  he would have to sit down outside and wait till his head was clear  we witnessed the opening scenes of a very amusing little comedy at one of the towns where the train drew up  the chief characters were played by an active young goat a small boy an elderly man and a woman parents of the small boy and owners of the goat and a dog  first we heard a yell and then from out a cottage opposite the station bounded an innocent and happy goat and gambolled around  a long rope one end of which was fastened to his neck trailed behind him  after the goat in the double sense of the phrase came a child  the child tried to catch the goat by means of the rope caught itself in the rope instead and went down with a bump and a screech  whereupon a stout woman the boys mother apparently ran out from the cottage and also made for the goat  the goat flew down the road and the woman flew after it  at the first corner the woman trod on the rope and then she went down with a bump and a screech  then the goat turned and ran up the street and as it passed the cottage the father ran out and tried to stop it  he was an old man but still seemed to have plenty of vigour in him  he evidently guessed how his wife and child had gone down and he endeavoured to avoid the rope and to skip over it when it came near him but the goats movements were too erratic for him  his turn came and he trod on the rope and went down in the middle of the road opposite his own door with a thud that shook us all up against each other as we stood looking out of the carriagewindow and sat there and cursed the goat then out ran a dog barking furiously and he went for the goat and got the end of the rope in his teeth and held on to it like grim death  away went the goat at his end of the rope and with him the dog at the other end  between them they kept the rope about six inches above the ground and with it they remorselessly mowed down every living thing they came across in that once peaceful village  in the course of less than half a minute we counted fourteen persons sitting down in the middle of the road  eight of them were cursing the goat four were cursing the dog and two of them were cursing the old man for keeping the goat one of these two and the more violent one being the mans own wife  the train left at this juncture  we entreated the railway officials to let us stop and see the show out  the play was becoming quite interesting  it was so full of movement  but they said that we were halfanhour late as it was and that they dared not  we leaned out of the window and watched for as long as we could and after the village was lost to view in the distance we could still by listening carefully hear the thuds as one after another of the inhabitants sat down and began to swear  at about eleven oclock we had some beeryou can generally obtain such light refreshment as bottled beer and coffee and rolls from the guard on a through longdistance train in germanytook off our boots and saying goodnight to each other made a great show of going to sleep  but we never succeeded in getting there  they wanted to see ones ticket too often for one to get fairly off  every few minutes so it seemed to me though in reality the intervals may perhaps have been longer a ghostly face would appear at the carriagewindow and ask to see our tickets  whenever a german railwayguard feels lonesome and does not know what else to do with himself he takes a walk round the train and gets the passengers to show him their tickets after which he returns to his box cheered and refreshed  some people rave about sunsets and mountains and old masters but to the german railwayguard the world can show nothing more satisfying more inspiring than the sight of a railwayticket  nearly all the german railway officials have this same craving for tickets  if only they get somebody to show them a railwayticket they are happy  it seemed a harmless weakness of theirs and b and i decided that it would be only kind to humour them in it during our stay  accordingly whenever we saw a german railway official standing about looking sad and weary we went up to him and showed him our tickets  the sight was like a ray of sunshine to him and all his care was immediately forgotten  if we had not a ticket with us at the time we went and bought one  a mere single third to the next station would gladden him sufficiently in most cases but if the poor fellow appeared very woebegone and as if he wanted more than ordinary cheering up we got him a secondclass return  for the purpose of our journey to oberammergau and back we each carried with us a folio containing some ten or twelve firstclass tickets between different towns covering in all a distance of some thousand miles and one afternoon at munich seeing a railway official a cloakroom keeper who they told us had lately lost his aunt and who looked exceptionally dejected i proposed to b that we should take this man into a quiet corner and both of us show him all our tickets at oncethe whole twenty or twentyfour of themand let him take them in his hand and look at them for as long as he liked  i wanted to comfort him  b however advised against the suggestion  he said that even if it did not turn the mans head and it was more than probable that it would so much jealousy would be created against him among the other railway people throughout germany that his life would be made a misery to him  so we bought and showed him a firstclass return to the next station but one and it was quite pathetic to watch the poor fellows face brighten up at the sight and to see the faint smile creep back to the lips from which it had so long been absent  but at times one wishes that the german railway official would control his passion for ticketsor at least keep it within due bounds  even the most kindlyhearted man grows tired of showing his ticket all day and night long and the middle of a wearisome journey is not the proper time for a man to come to the carriagewindow and clamour to see your billet  you are weary and sleepy  you do not know where your ticket is  you are not quite sure that you have got a ticket or if you ever had one somebody has taken it away from you  you have put it by very carefully thinking that it would not be wanted for hours and have forgotten where  there are eleven pockets in the suit you have on and five more in the overcoat on the rack  maybe it is in one of those pockets  if not it is possibly in one of the bagssomewhere or in your pocketbook if you only knew where that was or your purse  you begin a search  you stand up and shake yourself  then you have another feel all over  you look round in the course of the proceedings and the sight of the crowd of curious faces watching you and of the man in uniform waiting with his eye fixed severely upon you convey to you in your then state of confusion the momentary idea that this is a policecourt scene and that if the ticket is found upon you you will probably get five years  upon this you vehemently protest your innocence  i tell you i havent got it you exclaimnever seen the gentlemans ticket  you let me go  i  here the surprise of your fellowpassengers recalls you to yourself and you proceed on your exploration  you overhaul the bags turning everything out on to the floor muttering curses on the whole railway system of germany as you do so  then you feel in your boots  you make everybody near you stand up to see if they are sitting upon it and you go down on your knees and grovel for it under the seat  you didnt throw it out of the window with your sandwiches did you asks your friend  no  do you think im a fool you answer irritably  what should i want to do that for  on going systematically over yourself for about the twentieth time you discover it in your waistcoat pocket and for the next halfhour you sit and wonder how you came to miss it on the previous nineteen occasions  meanwhile during this trying scene the conduct of the guard has certainly not tended to allay your anxiety and nervousness  all the time that you have been looking for your ticket he has been doing silly tricks on the step outside imperilling his life by every means that experience and ingenuity can suggest  the train is going at the rate of thirty miles an hour the express speed in germany and a bridge comes in sight crossing over the line  on seeing this bridge the guard holding on by the window leans his body as far back as ever it will go  you look at him and then at the rapidlynearing bridge and calculate that the arch will just take his head off without injuring any other part of him whatever and you wonder whether the head will be jerked into the carriage or will fall outside  when he is three inches off the bridge he pulls himself up straight and the brickwork as the train dashes through kills a fly that was trespassing on the upper part of his right ear  then when the bridge is passed and the train is skirting the very edge of a precipice so that a stone dropped just outside the window would tumble straight down 300 feet he suddenly lets go and balancing himself on the footboard without holding on to anything commences to dance a sort of teutonic cellarflap and to warm his body by flinging his arms about in the manner of cabmen on a cold day  the first essential to comfortable railway travelling in germany is to make up your mind not to care a rap whether the guard gets killed in the course of the journey or not  any tender feeling towards the guard makes railway travelling in the fatherland a simple torture  at five am how fair and sweet and fresh the earth looks in the early morning  those lazy people who lie in bed till eight or nine miss half the beauty of the day if they but knew it  it is only we who rise early that really enjoy nature properly i gave up trying to get to sleep and made my way to the dressingroom at the end of the car and had a wash  it is difficult to wash in these little places because the cars shake so and when you have got both your hands and half your head in the basin and are unable to protect yourself the sides of the room and the watertap and the soapdish and other cowardly things take a mean advantage of your helplessness to punch you as hard as ever they can and when you back away from these the door swings open and slaps you from behind  i succeeded however in getting myself fairly wet all over even if i did nothing else and then i looked about for a towel  of course there was no towel  that is the trick  the idea of the railway authorities is to lure the passenger by providing him with soap and water and a basin into getting himself thoroughly soaked and then to let it dawn upon him that there is no towel  that is their notion of fun  i thought of the handkerchiefs in my bag but to get to them i should have to pass compartments containing ladies and i was only in early morning dress  so i had to wipe myself with a newspaper which i happened to have in my pocket and a more unsatisfactory thing to dry oneself upon i cannot conceive  i woke up b when i got back to the carriage and persuaded him to go and have a wash and in listening to the distant sound of his remarks when he likewise discovered that there was no towel the recollection of my own discomfiture passed gently away  ah how true it is as good people tell us that in thinking of the sorrows of others we learn to forget our own  for fifty miles before one reaches munich the land is flat stale and apparently very unprofitable and there is little to interest the lookerout  he sits straining his eyes towards the horizon eagerly longing for some sign of the city to come in sight  it lies very low however and does all it can to escape observation and it is not until he is almost within its streets that he discovers it     the rest of sunday the 25th   we seek breakfasti air my

and aspirationssunday in munichhans and gretchenhigh life v low lifea beercellar  at munich we left our luggage at the station and went in search of breakfast  of course at eight oclock in the morning none of the big cafes were open but at length beside some gardens we found an oldfashioned looking restaurant from which came a pleasant odour of coffee and hot onions and walking through and seating ourselves at one of the little tables placed out under the trees we took the bill of fare in our hands and summoned the waiter to our side  i ordered the breakfast  i thought it would be a good opportunity for me to try my german  i ordered coffee and rolls as a groundwork  i got over that part of my task very easily  with the practice i had had during the last two days i could have ordered coffee and rolls for forty  then i foraged round for luxuries and ordered a green salad  i had some difficulty at first in convincing the man that it was not a boiled cabbage that i wanted but succeeded eventually in getting that silly notion out of his head  i still had a little german left even after that  so i ordered an omelette also  tell him a savoury one said b or he will be bringing us something full of hot jam and chocolatecreams  you know their style  oh yes i answered  of course  yes  let me see  what is the german for savoury  savoury mused b  oh ah hum  bothered if i know  confound the thingi cant think of it  i could not think of it either  as a matter of fact i never knew it we tried the man with french  we said  une omelette aux fines herbes  as he did not appear to understand that we gave it him in bad english we twisted and turned the unfortunate word savoury into sounds so quaint so sad so unearthly that you would have thought they might have touched the heart of a savage  this stoical teuton however remained unmoved  then we tried pantomime  pantomime is to language what marmalade according to the label on the pot is to butter an excellent occasional substitute  but its powers as an interpreter of thought are limited  at least in real life they are so  as regards a ballet it is difficult to say what is not explainable by pantomime  i have seen the bad man in a ballet convey to the premiere danseuse by a subtle movement of the left leg together with some slight assistance from the drum the heartrending intelligence that the lady she had been brought up to believe was her mother was in reality only her aunt by marriage  but then it must be borne in mind that the premiere danseuse is a lady whose quickness of perception is altogether unique  the premiere danseuse knows precisely what a gentleman means when he twirls round fortyseven times on one leg and then stands on his head  the average foreigner would in all probability completely misunderstand the man  a friend of mine once during a tour in the pyrenees tried to express gratitude by means of pantomime  he arrived late one evening at a little mountain inn where the people made him very welcome and set before him their best and he being hungry appreciated their kindness and ate a most excellent supper  indeed so excellent a meal did he make and so kind and attentive were his hosts to him that after supper he felt he wanted to thank them and to convey to them some idea of how pleased and satisfied he was  he could not explain himself in language  he only knew enough spanish to just ask for what he wantedand even to do that he had to be careful not to want much  he had not got as far as sentiment and emotion at that time  accordingly he started to express himself in action  he stood up and pointed to the empty table where the supper had been then opened his mouth and pointed down his throat  then he patted that region of his anatomy where so scientific people tell us supper goes to and smiled  he has a rather curious smile has my friend  he himself is under the impression that there is something very winning in it though also as he admits a touch of sadness  they use it in his family for keeping the children in order  the people of the inn seemed rather astonished at his behaviour  they regarded him with troubled looks and then gathered together among themselves and consulted in whispers  i evidently have not made myself sufficiently clear to these simple peasants said my friend to himself  i must put more vigour into this show  accordingly he rubbed and patted that part of himself to which i have previously alludedand which being a modest and properly broughtup young man nothing on earth shall induce me to mention more explicitlywith greater energy than ever and added another inch or two of smile and he also made various graceful movements indicative as he thought of friendly feeling and contentment  at length a ray of intelligence burst upon the faces of his hosts and they rushed to a cupboard and brought out a small black bottle  ah thats done it thought my friend  now they have grasped my meaning  and they are pleased that i am pleased and are going to insist on my drinking a final friendly bumper of wine with them the good old souls  they brought the bottle over and poured out a wineglassful and handed it to him making signs that he should drink it off quickly  ah said my friend to himself as he took the glass and raised it to the light and winked at it wickedly this is some rare old spirit peculiar to the districtsome old heirloom kept specially for the favoured guest  and he held the glass aloft and made a speech in which he wished long life and many grandchildren to the old couple and a handsome husband to the daughter and prosperity to the whole village  they could not understand him he knew but he thought there might be that in his tones and gestures from which they would gather the sense of what he was saying and understand how kindly he felt towards them all  when he had finished he put his hand upon his heart and smiled some more and then tossed the liquor off at a gulp  three seconds later he discovered that it was a stringent and trustworthy emetic that he had swallowed  his audience had mistaken his signs of gratitude for efforts on his part to explain to them that he was poisoned or at all events was suffering from acute and agonising indigestion and had done what they could to comfort him  the drug that they had given him was not one of those common cheap medicines that lose their effect before they have been in the system halfanhour  he felt that it would be useless to begin another supper then even if he could get one and so he went to bed a good deal hungrier and a good deal less refreshed than when he arrived at the inn  gratitude is undoubtedly a thing that should not be attempted by the amateur pantomimist  savoury is another  b and i very nearly did ourselves a serious internal injury trying to express it  we slaved like cabhorses at itfor about five minutes and succeeded in conveying to the mind of the waiter that we wanted to have a game at dominoes  then like a beam of sunlight to a man lost in some dark winding cave came to me the reflection that i had in my pocket a german conversation book  how stupid of me not to have thought of it before  here had we been racking our brains and our bodies trying to explain our wants to an uneducated german while all the time there lay to our hands a book specially written and prepared to assist people out of the very difficulty into which we had fallena book carefully compiled with the express object of enabling english travellers who like ourselves only spoke german in a dilettante fashion to make their modest requirements known throughout the fatherland and to get out of the country alive and uninjured  i hastily snatched the book from my pocket and commenced to search for dialogues dealing with the great food question  there were none  there were lengthy and passionate conversations with a laundress about articles that i blush to remember  some twenty pages of the volume were devoted to silly dialogues between an extraordinarily patient shoemaker and one of the most irritating and constitutionally dissatisfied customers that an unfortunate shopkeeper could possibly be cursed with a customer who after twaddling for about forty minutes and trying on apparently every pair of boots in the place calmly walks out with  ah well i shall not purchase anything today  goodmorning  the shopkeepers reply bytheby is not given  it probably took the form of a bootjack accompanied by phrases deemed useless for the purposes of the christian tourist  there was really something remarkable about the exhaustiveness of this conversation at the shoemakers  i should think the book must have been written by someone who suffered from corns  i could have gone to a german shoemaker with this book and have talked the mans head off  then there were two pages of watery chatter on meeting a friend in the streetgoodmorning sir or madam  i wish you a merry christmas how is your mother  as if a man who hardly knew enough german to keep body and soul together would want to go about asking after the health of a foreign persons mother  there were also conversations in the railway carriage conversations between travelling lunatics apparently and dialogues during the passage  how do you feel now  pretty well as yet but i cannot say how long it will last  oh what waves  i now feel very unwell and shall go below  ask for a basin for me  imagine a person who felt like that wanting to know the german for it  at the end of the book were german proverbs and idiomatic phrases by which latter would appear to be meant in all languages phrases for the use of idiotsa sparrow in the hand is better than a pigeon on the rooftime brings rosesthe eagle does not catch fliesone should not buy a cat in a sackas if there were a large class of consumers who habitually did purchase their cats in that way thus enabling unscrupulous dealers to palm off upon them an inferior cat and whom it was accordingly necessary to advise against the custom  i skimmed through all this nonsense but not a word could i discover anywhere about a savoury omelette  under the head of eating and drinking i found a short vocabulary but it was mainly concerned with raspberries and figs and medlars whatever they may be i never heard of them myself and chestnuts and such like things that a man hardly ever wants even when he is in his own country  there was plenty of oil and vinegar and pepper and salt and mustard in the list but nothing to put them on  i could have had a hardboiled egg or a slice of ham but i did not want a hardboiled egg or a slice of ham  i wanted a savoury omelette and that was an article of diet that the authors of this handy little guide as they termed it in their preface had evidently never heard of  since my return home i have out of curiosity obtained three or four englishgerman dialogues and conversation books intended to assist the english traveller in his efforts to make himself understood by the german people and i have come to the conclusion that the work i took out with me was the most sensible and practical of the lot  finding it utterly hopeless to explain ourselves to the waiter we let the thing go and trusted to providence and in about ten minutes the man brought us a steaming omelette with about a pound of strawberry jam inside and powdered sugar all over the outside  we put a deal of pepper and salt on it to try and counteract the flavour of the sweets but we did not really enjoy it even then  after breakfast we got a timetable and looked out for a train to oberammergau  i found one which started at 310  it seemed a very nice train indeed it did not stop anywhere  the railway authorities themselves were evidently very proud of it and had printed particulars of it in extra thick type  we decided to patronise it  to pass away the time we strolled about the city  munich is a fine handsome open town full of noble streets and splendid buildings but in spite of this and of its hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants an atmosphere of quiet and provincialism hovers over it  there is but little traffic on ordinary occasions along its broad ways and customers in its wellstocked shops are few and far between  this day being sunday it was busier than usual and its promenades were thronged with citizens and country folk in holiday attire among whom the southern peasants wearing their quaint centuriesold costume stood out in picturesque relief  fashion in its worldwide crusade against variety and its bitter contest with form and colour has recoiled defeated for the present from the mountain fastnesses of bavaria  still as sunday or galaday comes round the broadshouldered sunburnt shepherd of the oberland dons his gay greenembroidered jacket over his snowy shirt fastens his short kneebreeches with a girdle round his waist claps his high feathercrowned hat upon his waving curls and with bare legs shod in mighty boots strides over the hillsides to his gretchens door  she is waiting for him you may be sure ready dressed and a very sweet oldworld picture she makes standing beneath the great overhanging gables of the wooden chalet  she too favours the national green but as relief there is no lack of bonny red ribbons to flutter in the wind and underneath the ornamented skirt peeps out a brighthued petticoat around her ample breast she wears a dark tightfitting bodice laced down the front  i think this garment is called a stomacher but i am not sure as i have never liked to ask  her square shoulders are covered with the whitest of white linen  her sleeves are also white and being very full and of some soft lawnlike material suggest the idea of folded wings  upon her flaxen hair is perched a saucy round green hat  the buckles of her dainty shoes the big eyes in her pretty face are all four very bright  one feels one would like much to change places for the day with hans  arminarm looking like some china but exceedingly substantial china shepherd and shepherdess they descend upon the town  one rubs ones eyes and stares after them as they pass  they seem to have stepped from the pictured pages of one of those old storybooks that we learnt to love sitting beside the high brass guard that kept ourselves and the nurseryfire from doing each other any serious injury in the days when the world was much bigger than it is now and much more real and interesting  munich and the country round about it make a great exchange of peoples every sunday  in the morning trainload after trainload of villagers and mountaineers pour into the town and trainload after trainload of good and other citizens steam out to spend the day in wood and valley and upon lake and mountainside  we went into one or two of the beerhallsnot into the swell cafes crowded with tourists and munich masherdom but into the lowceilinged smokegrimed cellars where the life of the people is to be seen  the ungenteel people in a country are so much more interesting than the gentlefolks  one lady or gentleman is painfully like every other lady or gentleman  there is so little individuality so little character among the upper circles of the world  they talk like each other they think and act like each other they dress like each other and look very much like each other  we gentlefolks only play at living  we have our rules and regulations for the game which must not be infringed  our unwritten guidebooks direct us what to do and what to say at each turn of the meaningless sport  to those at the bottom of the social pyramid however who stand with their feet upon the earth nature is not a curious phenomenon to be looked down at and studied but a living force to be obeyed  they front grim naked life face to face and wrestle with it through the darkness and as did the angel that strove with jacob it leaves its stamp upon them  there is only one type of a gentleman  there are five hundred types of men and women  that is why i always seek out and frequent the places where the common people congregate in preference to the haunts of respectability  i have to be continually explaining all this to my friends to account to them for what they call my love of low life  with a mug of beer before me and a pipe in my mouth i could sit for hours contentedly and watch the life that ebbs and flows into and out of these old alekitchens  the brawny peasant lads bring in their lasses to treat them to the beloved nectar of munich together with a huge onion  how they enjoy themselves  what splendid jokes they have  how they laugh and roar and sing  at one table sit four old fellows playing cards  how full of character is each gnarled face  one is eager quick vehement  how his eyes dance  you can read his every thought upon his face  you know when he is going to dash down the king with a shout of triumph on the queen his neighbour looks calm slow and dogged but wears a confident expression  the game proceeds and you watch and wait for him to play the winning cards that you feel sure he holds  he must intend to win victory is written in his face  no he loses  a seven was the highest card in his hand  everyone turns to him surprised  he laughsa difficult man to deal with that in other matters besides cards  a man whose thoughts lie a good deal below his skin  opposite a crosslooking old woman clamours for sausages gets them and seems crosser than ever  she scowls round on everyone with a malignant expression that is quite terrifying  a small dog comes and sits down in front of her and grins at her  still with the same savage expression of hatred towards all living things she feeds him with sausage at the end of a fork regarding him all the while with an aspect of such concentrated dislike that one wonders it does not interfere with his digestion  in a corner a stout old woman talks incessantly to a solemnlooking man who sits silent and drinks steadily  it is evident that he can stand her conversation just so long as he has a mug of beer in front of him  he has brought her in here to give her a treat  he will let her have her talk out while he drinks  heavens how she does talk  she talks without movement without expression her voice never varies it flows on and on and on like a great resistless river  four young artisans come clamping along in their hobnailed boots and seating themselves at one of the rude wooden tables call for beer  with their arms round the waist of the utterly indifferent fraulein they shout and laugh and sing  nearly all the young folks here are laughinglooking forward to life  all the old folks are talking remembering it  what grand pictures some of these old seared faces round us would make if a man could only paint thempaint all that is in them all the tragedyand comedy that the great playwright life has written upon the withered skins  joys and sorrows sordid hopes and fears childlike strivings to be good mean selfishness and grand unselfishness have helped to fashion these old wrinkled faces  the curves of cunning and kindliness lurk round these fading eyes  the lines of greed hover about these bloodless lips that have so often been tightpressed in patient heroism     sunday 25thcontinued   we dinea curious disha feeling of sadness comes oer methe german cigarthe

romancearrival at oberauwise and foolish pilgrimsan interesting driveettal and its monasterywe reach the goal of our pilgrimage  at one oclock we turned into a restaurant for dinner  the germans themselves always dine in the middle of the day and a very substantial meal they make of it  at the hotels frequented by tourists table dhote is during the season fixed for about six or seven but this is only done to meet the views of foreign customers  i mention that we had dinner not because i think that the information will prove exciting to the reader but because i wish to warn my countrymen travelling in germany against undue indulgence in liptauer cheese  i am fond of cheese and of trying new varieties of cheese so that when i looked down the cheese department of the bill of fare and came across liptauer garnit an article of diet i had never before heard of i determined to sample it  it was not a temptinglooking cheese  it was an unhealthy sadlooking cheese  it looked like a cheese that had seen trouble  in appearance it resembled putty more than anything else  it even tasted like puttyat least like i should imagine putty would taste  to this hour i am not positive that it was not putty  the garnishing was even more remarkable than the cheese  all the way round the plate were piled articles that i had never before seen at a dinner and that i do not ever want to see there again  there was a little heap of splitpeas three or four remarkably small potatoesat least i suppose they were potatoes if not they were peanuts boiled softsome carawayseeds a very younglooking fish apparently of the stickleback breed and some red paint  it was quite a little dinner all to itself  what the red paint was for i could not understand  b thought that it was put there for suicidal purposes  his idea was that the customer after eating all the other things in the plate would wish he were dead and that the restaurant people knowing this had thoughtfully provided him with red paint for one so that he could poison himself off and get out of his misery  i thought after swallowing the first mouthful that i would not eat any more of this cheese  then it occurred to me that it was a pity to waste it after having ordered it and besides i might get to like it before i had finished  the taste for most of the good things of this world has to be acquired  i can remember the time when i did not like beer  so i mixed up everything on the plate all togethermade a sort of salad of it in factand ate it with a spoon  a more disagreeable dish i have never tasted since the days when i used to do willie evanss dags by walking twice through a sewer and was subsequently on returning home promptly put to bed and made to eat brimstone and treacle  i felt very sad after dinner  all the things i have done in my life that i should not have done recurred to me with painful vividness  there seemed to be a goodish number of them too  i thought of all the disappointments and reverses i had experienced during my career of all the injustice that i had suffered and of all the unkind things that had been said and done to me  i thought of all the people i had known who were now dead and whom i should never see again of all the girls that i had loved who were now married to other fellows while i did not even know their present addresses  i pondered upon our earthly existence upon how hollow false and transient it is and how full of sorrow  i mused upon the wickedness of the world and of everybody in it and the general cussedness of all things  i thought how foolish it was for b and myself to be wasting our time gadding about europe in this silly way  what earthly enjoyment was there in travellingbeing jolted about in stuffy trains and overcharged at uncomfortable hotels  b was cheerful and frivolously inclined at the beginning of our walk we were strolling down the maximilian strasse after dinner but as i talked to him i was glad to notice that he gradually grew more serious and subdued  he is not really bad you know only thoughtless  b bought some cigars and offered me one  i did not want to smoke smoking seemed to me just then a foolish waste of time and money  as i said to b  in a few more years perhaps before this very month is gone we shall be lying in the silent tomb with the worms feeding on us  of what advantage will it be to us then that we smoked these cigars today  b said  well the advantage it will be to me now is that if you have a cigar in your mouth i shant get quite so much of your chatty conversation  take one for my sake  to humour him i lit up  i do not admire the german cigar  b says that when you consider they only cost a penny you cannot grumble  but what i say is that when you consider they are dear at six a halfpenny you can grumble  well boiled they might serve for greens but as smoking material they are not worth the match with which you light them especially not if the match be a german one  the german match is quite a high art work  it has a yellow head and a magenta or green stem and can certainly lay claim to being the handsomest match in europe  we smoked a good many penny cigars during our stay in germany and that we were none the worse for doing so i consider as proof of our splendid physique and constitution  i think the german cigar test might with reason be adopted by life insurance officesquestion are you at present and have you always been of robust health  answer i have smoked a german cigar and still live  life accepted  towards three oclock we worked our way round to the station and began looking for our train  we hunted all over the place but could not find it anywhere  the central station at munich is an enormous building and a perfect maze of passages and halls and corridors  it is much easier to lose oneself in it than to find anything in it one may happen to want together and separately b and i lost ourselves and each other some twentyfour times  for about half an hour we seemed to be doing nothing else but rushing up and down the station looking for each other suddenly finding each other and saying why where the dickens have you been  i have been hunting for you everywhere  dont go away like that and then immediately losing each other again  and what was so extraordinary about the matter was that every time after losing each other we invariably met againwhen we did meetoutside the door of the thirdclass refreshment room  we came at length to regard the door of the thirdclass refreshment room as home and to feel a thrill of joy when in the course of our weary wanderings through faroff waitingrooms and lostluggage bureaus and lamp depots we saw its old familiar handle shining in the distance and knew that there beside it we should find our loved and lost one  when any very long time elapsed without our coming across it we would go up to one of the officials and ask to be directed to it  please can you tell me we would say the nearest way to the door of the thirdclass refreshment room  when three oclock came and still we had not found the 310 train we became quite anxious about the poor thing and made inquiries concerning it  the 310 train to oberammergau they said  oh weve not thought about that yet  havent thought about it we exclaimed indignantly  well do for heavens sake wake up a bit  it is 35 now  yes they answered 35 in the afternoon the 310 is a night train dont you see its printed in thick type  all the trains between six in the evening and six in the morning are printed in fat figures and the day trains in thin  you have got plenty of time  look around after supper  i do believe i am the most unfortunate man at a timetable that ever was born  i do not think it can be stupidity for if it were mere stupidity i should occasionally now and then when i was feeling well not make a mistake  it must be fate  if there is one train out of forty that goes on saturdays only to some place i want to get to that is the train i select to travel by on a friday  on saturday morning i get up at six swallow a hasty breakfast and rush off to catch a return train that goes on every day in the week except saturdays  i go to london brighton and south coast railwaystations and clamour for southeastern trains  on bank holidays i forget it is bank holiday and go and sit on draughty platforms for hours waiting for trains that do not run on bank holidays  to add to my misfortunes i am the miserable possessor of a demon timetable that i cannot get rid of a bradshaw for august 1887 regularly on the first of each month i buy and bring home with me a new bradshaw and a new abc  what becomes of them after the second of the month i do not know  after the second of the month i never see either of them again  what their fate is i can only guess  in their place is left to mislead me this wretched old 1887 corpse  for three years i have been trying to escape from it but it will not leave me  i have thrown it out of the window and it has fallen on peoples heads and those people have picked it up and smoothed it out and brought it back to the house and members of my familyfriends they call themselvespeople of my own flesh and bloodhave thanked them and taken it in again  i have kicked it into a dozen pieces and kicked the pieces all the way downstairs and out into the garden and personspersons mind you who will not sew a button on the back of my shirt to save me from madnesshave collected the pieces and stitched them carefully together and made the book look as good as new and put it back in my study  it has acquired the secret of perpetual youth has this timetable other timetables that i buy become dissipatedlooking wrecks in about a week  this book looks as fresh and new and clean as it did on the day when it first lured me into purchasing it  there is nothing about its appearance to suggest to the casual observer that it is not this months bradshaw  its evident aim and object in life is to deceive people into the idea that it is this months bradshaw  it is undermining my moral character this book is  it is responsible for at least ten per cent of the bad language that i use every year  it leads me into drink and gambling  i am continually finding myself with some three or four hours to wait at dismal provincial railway stations i read all the advertisements on both platforms and then i get wild and reckless and plunge into the railway hotel and play billiards with the landlord for threes of scotch  i intend to have that bradshaw put into my coffin with me when i am buried so that i can show it to the recording angel and explain matters i expect to obtain a discount of at least fiveandtwenty per cent off my bill of crimes for that bradshaw  the 310 train in the morning was of course too late for us  it would not get us to oberammergau until about 9 am  there was a train leaving at 730 i let b find out this by which we might reach the village some time during the night if only we could get a conveyance from oberau the nearest railwaystation  accordingly we telegraphed to cooks agent who was at oberammergau we all of us sneer at mr cook and mr gaze and suchlike gentlemen who kindly conduct travellers that cannot conduct themselves properly when we are at home but i notice most of us appeal on the quiet to one or the other of them the moment we want to move abroad to try and send a carriage to meet us by that train and then went to an hotel and turned into bed until it was time to start  we had another grand railwayride from munich to oberau  we passed by the beautiful lake of starnberg just as the sun was setting and gilding with gold the little villages and pleasant villas that lie around its shores  it was in the lake of starnberg near the lordly pleasurehouse that he had built for himself in that fair vale that poor mad ludwig the late king of bavaria drowned himself  poor king  fate gave him everything calculated to make a man happy excepting one thing and that was the power of being happy  fate has a mania for striking balances  i knew a little shoeblack once who used to follow his profession at the corner of westminster bridge  fate gave him an average of sixpence a day to live upon and provide himself with luxuries but she also gave him a power of enjoying that kept him jolly all day long  he could buy as much enjoyment for a penny as the average man could for a tenpound notemore i almost think  he did not know he was badly off any more than king ludwig knew he was well off and all day long he laughed and played and worked a littlenot more than he could helpand ate and drank and gambled  the last time i saw him was in st thomass hospital into which he had got himself owing to his fatal passion for walking along outside the stone coping of westminster bridge  he thought it was prime being in the hospital and told me that he was living like a fightingcock and that he did not mean to go out sooner than he could help  i asked him if he were not in pain and he said yes when he thought about it  poor little chap he only managed to live like a fightingcock for three days more  then he died cheerful up to the last so they told me like the plucky little english gamecock he was  he could not have been more than twelve years old when he crowed his last  it had been a short life for him but a very merry one  now if only this little beggar and poor old ludwig could have gone into partnership and so have shared between them the shoeblacks power of enjoying and the kings stock of enjoyments what a good thing it would have been for both of themespecially for king ludwig  he would never have thought of drowning himself thenlife would have been too delightful  but that would not have suited fate  she loves to laugh at men and to make of life a paradox  to the one she played ravishing strains having first taken the precaution to make him stonedeaf  to the other she piped a few poor notes on a cracked tinwhistle and he thought it was music and danced  a few years later on at the very same spot where king ludwig threw back to the gods their gift of life a pair of somewhat foolish young lovers ended their disappointments and finding they could not be wedded together in life wedded themselves together in death  the story duly reported in the newspapers as an item of foreign intelligence read more like some old rhinelegend than the record of a real occurrence in this prosaic nineteenth century  he was a german count if i remember rightly and like most german counts had not much money and her father as fathers will when proposed to by impecunious wouldbe sonsinlaw refused his consent  the count then went abroad to try and make or at all events improve his fortune he went to america and there he prospered  in a year or two he came back tolerably richto find however that he was too late  his lady persuaded of his death had been urged into a marriage with a rich somebody else  in ordinary life of course the man would have contented himself with continuing to make love to the lady leaving the rich somebody else to pay for her keep  this young couple however a little lighter headed or a little deeper hearted than the most of us whichever it may have been and angry at the mocking laughter with which the air around them seemed filled went down one stormy night together to the lake and sobered droll fate for an instant by turning her grim comedy into a somewhat grimmer tragedy  soon after losing sight of starnbergs placid waters we plunged into the gloom of the mountains and began a long winding climb among their hidden recesses  at times shrieking as if in terror we passed some ghostly hamlet standing out white and silent in the moonlight against the shadowy hills and now and then a dark still lake or mountain torrent whose foaming waters fell in a long white streak across the blackness of the night  we passed by murnau in the valley of the dragon a little town which possessed a passion play of its own in the olden times and which until a few years ago when the railwayline was pushed forward to partenkirchen was the nearest station to oberammergau  it was a tolerably steep climb up the road from murnau over mount ettal to ammergauso steep indeed that one stout pilgrim not many years ago died from the exertion while walking up  sturdylegged mountaineer and pulpy citizen both had to clamber up side by side for no horses could do more than drag behind them the empty vehicle  every season however sees the european tourist more and more pampered and the difficulties and consequent pleasure and interest of his journey more and more curtailed and spoilt  in a few years time he will be packed in cottonwool in his own backparlour labelled for the place he wants to go to and unpacked and taken out when he gets there  the railway now carries him round mount ettal to oberau from which little village a tolerably easy road as mountain roadways go of about four or five english miles takes him up to the valley of the ammer  it was midnight when our train landed us at oberau station but the place was far more busy and stirring than on ordinary occasions it is at midday  crowds of tourists and pilgrims thronged the little hotel wondering as also did the landlord where they were all going to sleep and wondering still more though this latter consideration evidently did not trouble their host how they were going to get up to oberammergau in the morning in time for the play which always begins at 8 am  some were engaging carriages at fabulous prices to call for them at five and others who could not secure carriages and who had determined to walk were instructing worried waiters to wake them at 230 and ordering breakfast for a quarterpast three sharp  i had no idea there were such times in the morning  we were fortunate enough to find our landlord a worthy farmer waiting for us with a tumbledown conveyance in appearance something between a circuschariot and a bathchair drawn by a couple of powerfullooking horses and in this after a spirited skirmish between our driver and a mob of twenty or so tourists who pretended to mistake the affair for an omnibus and who would have clambered into it and swamped it we drove away  higher and higher we climbed and grander and grander towered the frowning moonbathed mountains round us and chillier and chillier grew the air  for most of the way we crawled along the horses tugging us from side to side of the steep road but wherever our coachman could vary the monotony of the pace by a stretchgallopas for instance down the precipitous descents that occasionally followed upon some extra long and toilsome ascenthe thoughtfully did so  at such times the drive became really quite exciting and all our weariness was forgotten  the steeper the descent the faster of course we could go  the rougher the road the more anxious the horses seemed to be to get over it quickly  during the gallop b and i enjoyed in a condensed form all the advantages usually derived from crossing the channel on a stormy day riding on a switchback railway and being tossed in a blanketa hard nobbly blanket full of nasty corners and sharp edges  i should never have thought that so many different sensations could have been obtained from one machine  about halfway up we passed ettal at the entrance to the valley of the ammer  the great white temple standing surrounded by its little village high up amid the mountain solitudes is a famous place of pilgrimage among devout catholics  many hundreds of years ago one of the early bavarian kings built here a monastery as a shrine for a miraculous image of the virgin that had been sent down to him from heaven to help him when in a foreign land he had stood sore in need encompassed by his enemies  maybe the stout arms and hearts of his bavarian friends were of some service in the crisis also but the living helpers were forgotten  the old church and monastery which latter was a sort of ancient chelsea hospital for decayed knights was destroyed one terrible night some hundred and fifty years ago by a flash of lightning but the wonderworking image was rescued unhurt and may still be seen and worshipped beneath the dome of the present much less imposing church which has been reared upon the ruins of its ancestor  the monastery which was also rebuilt at the same time now serves the more useful purpose of a brewery  from ettal the road is comparatively level and jolting swiftly over it we soon reached oberammergau  lights were passing to and fro behind the many windows of the square stone houses and dark strangelooking figures were moving about the streets busy with preparations for the great business that would commence with the dawn  we rattled noisily through the village our driver roaring out good night to everyone he passed in a voice sufficient to wake up everybody who might be sleeping within a mile charged lightheartedly round halfadozen corners trotted down the centre path of somebodys front garden squeezed our way through a gate and drew up at an open door through which the streaming light poured out upon two tall comely lasses our hosts daughters who were standing waiting for us in the porch  they led us into a large comfortably furnished room where a tempting supper of hot vealchops they seem to live on veal in germany and white wine was standing ready  under ordinary circumstances i should have been afraid that such a supper would cause me to be more eager for change and movement during the ensuing six hours than for sleep but i felt that tonight it would take a dozen halfbaked firebricks to keep me awake five seconds after i had got my head on the pillowor what they call a pillow in germany and so without hesitation i made a very satisfactory meal  after supper our host escorted us to our bedroom an airy apartment adorned with various highlycoloured woodcarvings of a pious but somewhat ghastly character calculated i should say to exercise a disturbing influence upon the nights rest of a nervous or sensitive person  mind that we are called at proper time in the morning said b to the man  we dont want to wake up at four oclock in the afternoon and find that we have missed the play after coming all this way to see it  oh that will be all right answered the old fellow  you wont get much chance of oversleeping yourself  we shall all be up and about and the whole village stirring before five and besides the band will be playing at six just beneath the window here and the cannon on the kofel goes off at  look here i interrupted that wont do for me you know  dont you think that i am going to be woke up by mere riots outside the window and brassband contests and earthquakes and explosions and those sort of things because it cant be done that way  somebodys got to come into this room and haul me out of bed and sit down on the bed and see that i dont get into it again and that i dont go to sleep on the floor  that will be the way to get me up tomorrow morning  dont lets have any nonsense about stirring villages and guns and german bands  i know what all that will end in my going back to england without seeing the show i want to be roused in the morning not lulled off to sleep again  b translated the essential portions of this speech to the man and he laughed and promised upon his sacred word of honour that he would come up himself and have us both out and as he was a stalwart and determinedlooking man i felt satisfied and wished him goodnight and made haste to get off my boots before i fell asleep     tuesday the 27th   a pleasant morningwhat can one say about the passion playb lecturesunreliable description of

or to speak more truthfully i am sitting up on a green satin lacecovered pillow writing these notes  a green satin lacecovered bed is on the floor beside me  it is about eleven oclock in the morning  b is sitting up in his bed a few feet off smoking a pipe  we have just finished a light repast ofwhat do you think you will never guesscoffee and rolls  we intend to put the week straight by stopping in bed all day at all events until the evening  two english ladies occupy the bedroom next to ours  they seem to have made up their minds to also stay upstairs all day  we can hear them walking about their room muttering  they have been doing this for the last threequarters of an hour  they seem troubled about something  it is very pleasant here  an overflow performance is being given in the theatre today for the benefit of those people who could not gain admittance yesterday and through the open windows we can hear the rhythmic chant of the chorus  mellowed by the distance the wailing cadence of the plaintive songs mingled with the shrill haydnistic strains of the orchestra falls with a mournful sweetness on our ears  we ourselves saw the play yesterday and we are now discussing it  i am explaining to b the difficulty i experience in writing an account of it for my diary  i tell him that i really do not know what to say about it  he smokes for a while in silence and then taking the pipe from his lips he says  does it matter very much what you say about it  i find much relief in that thought  it at once lifts from my shoulders the oppressive feeling of responsibility that was weighing me down after all what does it matter what i say  what does it matter what any of us says about anything  nobody takes much notice of it luckily for everybody  this reflection must be of great comfort to editors and critics  a conscientious man who really felt that his words would carry weight and influence with them would be almost afraid to speak at all it is the man who knows that it will not make an ounce of difference to anyone what he says that can grow eloquent and vehement and positive it will not make any difference to anybody or anything what i say about the oberammergau passion play  so i shall just say what i want to  but what do i want to say  what can i say that has not been said and said much better already  an author must always pretend to think that every other author writes better than he himself does  he does not really think so you know but it looks well to talk as though he did what can i say that the reader does not know or that not knowing he cares to know  it is easy enough to talk about nothing like i have been doing in this diary hitherto  it is when one is confronted with the task of writing about something that one wishes one were a respectable welltodo sweepa sweep with a comfortable business of his own and a ponyinstead of an author  b says  well why not begin by describing oberammergau  i say it has been described so often  he says  so has the oxford and cambridge boat race and the derby day but people go on describing them all the same and apparently find other people to read their descriptions  say that the little village clustered round its mosquedomed church nestles in the centre of a valley surrounded by great firrobed hills which stand with the crosscrowned kofel for their chief like stern strong sentinels guarding its oldworld peace from the din and clamour of the outer world  describe how the square whitewashed houses are sheltered beneath great overhanging gables and are encircled by carved wooden balconies and verandahs where in the cool of the evening peasant woodcarver and peasant farmer sit to smoke the long bavarian pipe and chat about the cattle and the passion play and village politics and how in gaudy colours above the porch are painted glowing figures of saints and virgins and suchlike good folk which the rains have sadly mutilated so that a legless angel on one side of the road looks dejectedly across at a headless madonna on the other while at an exposed corner some unfortunate saint more cruelly dealt with by the weather than he ever was even by the heathen has been deprived of everything that he could call his own with the exception of half a head and a pair of extrasized feet  explain how all the houses are numbered according to the date they were built so that number sixteen comes next to number fortyseven and there is no number one because it has been pulled down  tell how unsophisticated visitors informed that their lodgings are at number fiftythree go wandering for days and days round fiftytwo under the not unreasonable impression that their house must be next door though as a matter of fact it is half a mile off at the other end of the village and are discovered one sunny morning sitting on the doorstep of number eighteen singing pathetic snatches of nursery rhymes and trying to plat their toes into doormats and are taken up and carried away screaming to end their lives in the madhouse at munich  talk about the weather  people who have stayed here for any length of time tell me that it rains at oberammergau three days out of every four the reason that it does not rain on the fourth day being that every fourth day is set apart for a deluge  they tell me also that while it will be pouring with rain just in the village the sun will be shining brightly all round about and that the villagers when the water begins to come in through their roofs snatch up their children and hurry off to the nearest field where they sit and wait until the storm is over  do you believe themthe persons that you say tell you these tales i ask  personally i do not he replies  i think people exaggerate to me because i look young and innocent but no doubt there is a groundwork of truth in their statements  i have myself left oberammergau under a steady drenching rain and found a cloudless sky the other side of the kofel  then he continues you can comment upon the hardihood of the bavarian peasant  how he or she walks about bareheaded and barefooted through the fiercest showers and seems to find the rain only pleasantly cooling how during the performance of the passion play they act and sing and stand about upon the uncovered stage without taking the slightest notice of the downpour of water that is soaking their robes and running from their streaming hair to make great pools upon the boards and how the audience in the cheaper unroofed portion of the theatre sit with equal stoicism watching them no one ever dreaming even of putting up an umbrellaor if he does dream of doing so experiencing a very rude awakening from the sticks of those behind  b stops to relight his pipe at this point and i hear the two ladies in the next room fidgeting about and muttering worse than ever  it seems to me they are listening at the door our room and theirs are connected by a door i do wish that they would either get into bed again or else go downstairs  they worry me  and what shall i say after i have said all that i ask b when at last he has started his pipe again  oh well after that he replies you can give the history of the passion play how it came to be played  oh but so many people have done that already i say again  so much the better for you is his reply  having previously heard precisely the same story from half a dozen other sources the public will be tempted to believe you when you repeat the account  tell them that during the thirty years war a terrible plague as if half a dozen different armies marching up and down their country fighting each other about the lord only knows what and living on them while doing it was not plague enough swept over bavaria devastating each town and hamlet of all the highland villages oberammergau by means of a strictly enforced quarantine alone kept for a while the black foe at bay  no soul was allowed to leave the village no living thing to enter it  but one dark night caspar schuchler an inhabitant of oberammergau who had been working in the plaguestricken neighbouring village of eschenlohe creeping low on his belly passed the drowsy sentinels and gained his home and saw what for many a day he had been hungering fora sight of his wife and bairns  it was a selfish act to do and he and his fellowvillagers paid dearly for it  three days after he had entered his house he and all his family lay dead and the plague was raging through the valley and nothing seemed able to stay its course  when human means fail we feel it is only fair to give heaven a chance the good people who dwelt by the side of the ammer vowed that if the plague left them they would every ten years perform a passion play the celestial powers seem to have at once closed with this offer  the plague disappeared as if by magic and every recurring tenth year since the oberammergauites have kept their promise and played their passion play  they act it to this day as a pious observance  before each performance all the characters gather together on the stage around their pastor and kneeling pray for a blessing upon the work then about to commence  the profits that are made after paying the performers a wage that just compensates them for their loss of timewoodcarver maier who plays the christ only receives about fifty pounds for the whole of the thirty or so performances given during the season to say nothing of the winters rehearsalsis put aside part for the temporal benefit of the community and the rest for the benefit of the church  from burgomaster down to shepherd lad from the mary and the jesus down to the meanest super all work for the love of their religion not for money  each one feels that he is helping forward the cause of christianity  and i could also speak i add of grand old daisenberger the gentle simple old priest the father of the valley who now lies in silence among his children that he loved so well  it was he you know that shaped the rude burlesque of a coarser age into the impressive reverential drama that we saw yesterday  that is a portrait of him over the bed  what a plain homely good face it is  how pleasant how helpful it is to come across a good face now and then  i do not mean a sainted face suggestive of stained glass and marble tombs but a rugged human face that has had the grit and rain and sunshine of life rubbed into it and that has gained its expression not by looking up with longing at the stars but by looking down with eyes full of laughter and love at the human things around it  yes assented b  you can put in that if you like  there is no harm in it  and then you can go on to speak of the play itself and give your impressions concerning it  never mind their being silly  they will be all the better for that  silly remarks are generally more interesting than sensible ones  but what is the use of saying anything about it at all i urge  the merest schoolboy must know all about the oberammergau passion play by this time  what has that to do with you answers b  you are not writing for cultured schoolboys  you are writing for mere simple men and women they will be glad of a little information on the subject and then when the schoolboy comes home for his holiday they will be able so far as this topic at all events is concerned to converse with him on his own level and not appear stupid  come he says kindly trying to lead me on what did you think about it  well i reply after musing for a while i think that a play of eighteen acts and some forty scenes which commences at eight oclock in the morning and continues with an interval of an hour and a half for dinner until six oclock in the evening is too long  i think the piece wants cutting  about a third of it is impressive and moving and what the earnest student of the drama at home is for ever demanding that a play should benamely elevating but i consider that the other twothirds are tiresome  quite so answers b  but then we must remember that the performance is not intended as an entertainment but as a religious service  to criticise any part of it as uninteresting is like saying that half the bible might very well have been omitted and that the whole story could have been told in a third of the space     tuesday the 27thcontinued   we talk onan argumentthe story that transformed the world  and now as to the right or wrong of the performance as a whole  do you see any objection to the play from a religious point of view  no i reply i do not nor do i understand how anybody else and least of all a really believing christian can either  to argue as some do that christianity should be treated as a sacred mystery is to argue against the whole scheme of christianity  it was christ himself that rent the veil of the temple and brought religion down into the streets and marketplaces of the world  christ was a common man  he lived a common life among common men and women  he died a common death  his own methods of teaching were what a saturday reviewer had he to deal with the case would undoubtedly term vulgar  the roots of christianity are planted deep down in the very soil of life amid all that is commonplace and mean and petty and everyday  its strength lies in its simplicity its homely humanness  it has spread itself through the world by speaking to the hearts rather than to the heads of men  if it is still to live and grow it must be helped along by such methods as these peasant players of oberammergau employ not by highclass essays and the learned discussions of the cultured  the crowded audience that sat beside us in the theatre yesterday saw christ of nazareth nearer than any book however inspired could bring him to them clearer than any words however eloquent could show him they saw the sorrow of his patient face  they heard his deep tones calling to them  they saw him in the hour of his socalled triumph wending his way through the narrow streets of jerusalem the multitude that thronged round him waving their branches of green palms and shouting loud hosannas  what a poor scene of triumpha poorclad palefaced man mounted upon the back of a shuffling unwilling little grey donkey passing slowly through the byways of a city busy upon other things  beside him a little band of worn anxious men clad in threadbare garmentsfishermen petty clerks and the like and following a noisy rabble shouting as crowds in all lands and in all times shout and as dogs bark they know not whybecause others are shouting or barking and that scene marks the highest triumph won while he lived on earth by the village carpenter of galilee about whom the world has been fighting and thinking and talking so hard for the last eighteen hundred years  they saw him angry and indignant driving out the desecrators from the temple  they saw the rabble who a few brief moments before had followed him shouting hosanna slinking away from him to shout with his foes  they saw the high priests in their robes of white with the rabbis and doctors all the great and learned in the land sitting late into the night beneath the vaulted roof of the sanhedrins councilhall plotting his death  they saw him supping with his disciples in the house of simon  they saw poor loving mary magdalen wash his feet with costly ointment that might have been sold for three hundred pence and the money given to the poorand us  judas was so thoughtful for the poor so eager that other people should sell all they had and give the money to the poorand us  methinks that even in this nineteenth century one can still hear from many a tub and platform the voice of judas complaining of all waste and pleading for the poorand us  they were present at the parting of mary and jesus by bethany and it will be many a day before the memory of that scene ceases to vibrate in their hearts  it is the scene that brings the humanness of the great tragedy most closely home to us  jesus is going to face sorrow and death at jerusalem  marys instinct tells her that this is so and she pleads to him to stay  poor mary  to others he is the christ the saviour of mankind setting forth upon his mighty mission to redeem the world  to loving mary mother he is her son the baby she has suckled at her breast the little one she has crooned to sleep upon her lap whose little cheek has lain against her heart whose little feet have made sweet music through the poor home at bethany he is her boy her child she would wrap her mothers arms around him and hold him safe against all the world against even heaven itself  never in any human drama have i witnessed a more moving scene than this  never has the voice of any actress and i have seen some of the greatest if any great ones are living stirred my heart as did the voice of rosa lang the burgomasters daughter  it was not the voice of one woman it was the voice of motherdom gathered together from all the world over  oliver wendell holmes in the autocrat of the breakfast table i think confesses to having been bewitched at different times by two womens voices and adds that both these voices belonged to german women i am not surprised at either statement of the good doctors  i am sure if a man did fall in love with a voice he would find on tracing it to its source that it was the voice of some homelylooking german woman  i have never heard such exquisite souldrawing music in my life as i have more than once heard float from the lips of some sweetfaced german fraulein when she opened her mouth to speak  the voice has been so pure so clear so deep so full of soft caressing tenderness so strong to comfort so gentle to soothe it has seemed like one of those harmonies musicians tell us that they dream of but can never chain to earth  as i sat in the theatre listening to the wondrous tones of this mountain peasantwoman rising and falling like the murmur of a sea filling the vast skycovered building with their yearning notes stirring like a great wind stirs aeolian strings the thousands of trembling hearts around her it seemed to me that i was indeed listening to the voice of the mother of the world of mother nature herself  they saw him as they had often seen him in pictures sitting for the last time with his disciples at supper  but yesterday they saw him not a mute moveless figure posed in conventional meaningless attitude but a living loving man sitting in fellowship with the dear friends that against all the world had believed in him and had followed his poor fortunes talking with them for the last sweet time comforting them  they heard him bless the bread and wine that they themselves to this day take in remembrance of him  they saw his agony in the garden of gethsemane the human shrinking from the cup of pain  they saw the false friend judas betray him with a kiss  alas poor judas  he loved jesus in a way like the rest did it was only his fear of poverty that made him betray his master  he was so poorhe wanted the money so badly  we cry out in horror against judas  let us pray rather that we are never tempted to do a shameful action for a few pieces of silver  the fear of poverty ever did and ever will make scamps of men  we would like to be faithful and noble and just only really times are so bad that we cannot afford it  as becky sharp says it is so easy to be good and noble on five thousand a year so very hard to be it on the mere five  if judas had only been a welltodo man he might have been saint judas this day instead of cursed judas  he was not bad  he had only one failingthe failing that makes the difference between a saint and a villain all the world overhe was a coward he was afraid of being poor  they saw him pale and silent dragged now before the priests of his own countrymen and now before the roman governor while the voice of the peoplethe people who had cried hosanna to himshouted crucify him crucify him  they saw him bleeding from the crown of thorns  they saw him still followed by the barking mob sink beneath the burden of his cross  they saw the woman wipe the bloody sweat from off his face  they saw the last long silent look between the mother and the son as journeying upward to his death he passed her in the narrow way through which he once had ridden in brieflived triumph  they heard her low sob as she turned away leaning on mary magdalen  they saw him nailed upon the cross between the thieves  they saw the blood start from his side they heard his last cry to his god  they saw him rise victorious over death  few believing christians among the vast audience but must have passed out from that strange playhouse with their belief and love strengthened the god of the christian for his sake became a man and lived and suffered and died as a man and as a man living suffering dying among other men he had that day seen him  the man of powerful imagination needs no aid from mimicry however excellent however reverent to unroll before him in its simple grandeur the great tragedy on which the curtain fell at calvary some eighteen and a half centuries ago  a cultivated mind needs no story of human suffering to win or hold it to a faith  but the imaginative and cultured are few and far between and the peasants of oberammergau can plead as their master himself once pleaded that they seek not to help the learned but the lowly  the unbeliever also passes out into the village street full of food for thought  the rude sermon preached in this hillside temple has shown to him clearer than he could have seen before the secret wherein lies the strength of christianity the reason why of all the faiths that nature has taught to her children to help them in their need to satisfy the hunger of their souls this faith born by the sea of galilee has spread the farthest over the world and struck its note the deepest into human life  not by his doctrines not even by his promises has christ laid hold upon the hearts of men but by the story of his life     tuesday the 27thcontinued   we discuss the performancea marvellous piece of workmanshipthe adam familysome living groupsthe chief performersa good man but a bad judaswhere the histrionic artist grows wildan alarm  and what do you think of the performance as a performance asks b  oh as to that i reply i think what everyone who has seen the play must think that it is a marvellous piece of workmanship  experienced professional stagemanagers with all the tricks and methods of the theatre at their fingers ends find it impossible out of a body of men and women born and bred in the atmosphere of the playhouse to construct a crowd that looks like anything else except a nervous group of brokendown paupers waiting for soup  at oberammergau a few village priests and representative householders who have probably never any one of them been inside the walls of a theatre in their lives dealing with peasants who have walked straight upon the stage from their carving benches and milkingstools produce swaying multitudes and clamouring mobs and dignified assemblages so natural and truthful so realistic of the originals they represent that you feel you want to leap upon the stage and strangle them  it shows that earnestness and effort can very easily overtake and pass mere training and technical skill  the object of the oberammergau super is not to get outside and have a drink but to help forward the success of the drama  the groupings both in the scenes of the play itself and in the various tableaux that precede each act are such as i doubt if any artist could improve upon  the tableau showing the life of adam and eve after their expulsion from eden makes a beautiful picture  father adam stalwart and sunbrowned clad in sheepskins rests for a moment from his delving to wipe the sweat from his brow  eve still looking fair and happythough i suppose she ought not tosits spinning and watching the children playing at helping father  the chorus from each side of the stage explained to us that this represented a scene of woe the result of sin but it seemed to me that the adam family were very contented and i found myself wondering in my common earthly way whether with a little trouble to draw them closer together and some honest work to keep them from getting into mischief adam and eve were not almost better off than they would have been mooning about paradise with nothing to do but talk  in the tableau representing the return of the spies from canaan some four or five hundred men women and children are most effectively massed the feature of the foreground is the sample bunch of grapes borne on the shoulders of two men which the spies have brought back with them from the promised land  the sight of this bunch of grapes we are told astonished the children of israel  i can quite understand its doing so the picture of it used to astonish me too when i was a child  the scene of christs entry into jerusalem surrounded by the welcoming multitude is a wonderful reproduction of life and movement and so also is the scene towards the end showing his last journey up to calvary all jerusalem seems to have turned out to see him pass and to follow him the many laughing the few sad  the people fill the narrow streets to overflowing and press round the spears of the roman guard  they throng the steps and balconies of every house they strain to catch a sight of christ above each others heads  they leap up on each others backs to gain a better vantageground from which to hurl their jeers at him  they jostle irreverently against their priests  each individual man woman and child on the stage acts and acts in perfect harmony with all the rest  of the chief members of the castmaier the gentle and yet kingly christ burgomaster lang the stern revengeful high priest his daughter rosa the sweetfaced sweetvoiced virgin rendl the dignified statesmanlike pilate peter rendl the beloved john with the purest and most beautiful face i have ever seen upon a man old peter hett the rugged loving weak friend peter rutz the leader of the chorus no sinecure his post and amalie deschler the magdalenit would be difficult to speak in terms of too high praise  themselves mere peasantsthere are those two women again spying round our door i am sure of it i exclaim breaking off and listening to the sounds that come from the next room  i wish they would go downstairs i am beginning to get quite nervous  oh i dont think we need worry answers b  they are quite old ladies both of them  i met them on the stairs yesterday  i am sure they look harmless enough  well i dont know i reply  we are all by ourselves you know nearly everyone in the village is at the theatre i wish we had got a dog  b reassures me however and i continue  themselves mere peasants i repeat they represent some of the greatest figures in the worlds history with as simple a dignity and as grand a bearing as could ever have been expected from the originals themselves  there must be a natural inborn nobility in the character of these highlanders  they could never assume or act that manner au grand seigneur with which they imbue their parts  the only character poorly played was that of judas  the part of judas is really the part of the piece so far as acting is concerned but the exemplary householder who essayed it seemed to have no knowledge or experience of the ways and methods of bad men  there seemed to be no side of his character sufficiently in sympathy with wickedness to enable him to understand and portray it  his amateur attempts at scoundrelism quite irritated me  it sounds conceited to say so but i am convinced i could have given a much more truthful picture of the blackguard myself  dear dear me i kept on saying under my breath he is doing it all wrong  a downright unmitigated villain would never go on like that he would do so and so he would look like this and speak like that and act like the other  i know he would  my instinct tells me so  this actor was evidently not acquainted with even the rudiments of knavery  i wanted to get up and instruct him in them  i felt that there were little subtleties of rascaldom little touches of criminality that i could have put that man up to which would have transformed his judas from woodenness into breathing life  as it was with no one in the village apparently who was worth his salt as a felon to teach him his performance was unconvincing and judas became a figure to laugh rather than to shudder at  with that exception the whole company from maier down to the donkey seemed to be fitted to their places like notes into a masters melody it would appear as though on the banks of the ammer the histrionic artist grew wild  they are real actors all of them murmurs b enthusiastically the whole village full and they all live happily together in one small valley and never try to kill each other  it is marvellous  at this point we hear a sharp knock at the door that separates the beforementioned ladies room from our own  we both start and turn pale and then look at each other  b is the first to recover his presence of mind  eliminating by a strong effort all traces of nervousness from his voice he calls out in a tone of wonderful coolness  yes what is it  are you in bed comes a voice from the other side of the door  yes answers b  why  oh  sorry to disturb you but we shall be so glad when you get up  we cant go downstairs without coming through your room  this is the only door  we have been waiting here for two hours and our train goes at three  great scott  so that is why the poor old souls have been hanging round the door terrifying us out of our lives  all right well be out in five minutes  so sorry  why didnt you call out before     friday 30th or saturday i am not sure which   troubles of a tourist agenthis views on touriststhe english woman abroadand at homethe ugliest cathedral in europeold masters and newvictualanddrinkscapesthe german banda beer gardennot the women to turn a mans headdifficulty of dining to musicwhy one should keep ones mug shut  i think myself it is saturday  b says it is only friday but i am positive i have had three cold baths since we left oberammergau which we did on wednesday morning  if it is only friday then i have had two morning baths in one day  anyhow we shall know tomorrow by the shops being open or shut  we travelled from oberau with a tourist agent and he told us all his troubles  it seems that a tourist agent is an ordinary human man and has feelings just like we have  this had never occurred to me before  i told him so  no he replied it never does occur to you tourists  you treat us as if we were mere providence or even the government itself  if all goes well you say what is the good of us contemptuously and if things go wrong you say what is the good of us indignantly  i work sixteen hours a day to fix things comfortably for you and you cannot even look satisfied while if a train is late or a hotel proprietor overcharges you come and bully me about it  if i see after you you mutter that i am officious and if i leave you alone you grumble that i am neglectful you swoop down in your hundreds upon a tiny village like oberammergau without ever letting us know even that you are coming and then threaten to write to the times because there is not a suite of apartments and a hot dinner waiting ready for each of you  you want the best lodgings in the place and then when at a tremendous cost of trouble they have been obtained for you you object to pay the price asked for them  you all try and palm yourselves off for dukes and duchesses travelling in disguise  you have none of you ever heard of a secondclass railway carriagedidnt know that such things were made you want a firstclass pullman car reserved for each two of you  some of you have seen an omnibus in the distance and have wondered what it was used for  to suggest that you should travel in such a plebeian conveyance is to give you a shock that takes you two days to recover from  you expect a private carriage with a footman in livery to take you through the mountains  you all of you must have the most expensive places in the theatre  the eightmark and sixmark places are every bit as good as the tenmark seats of which there are only a very limited number but you are grossly insulted if it is hinted that you should sit in anything but the dearest chairs  if the villagers would only be sensible and charge you ten marks for the eightmark places you would be happy but they wont  i must candidly confess that the englishspeaking people one meets with on the continent are taken as a whole a most disagreeable contingent one hardly ever hears the english language spoken on the continent without hearing grumbling and sneering  the women are the most objectionable  foreigners undoubtedly see the very poorest specimens of the female kind we anglosaxons have to show the average female english or american tourist is rude and selfassertive while at the same time ridiculously helpless and awkward  she is intensely selfish and utterly inconsiderate of others everlastingly complaining and in herself drearily uninteresting  we travelled down in the omnibus from oberammergau with three perfect specimens of the species accompanied by the usual miserablelooking man who has had all the life talked out of him  they were grumbling the whole of the way at having been put to ride in an omnibus  it seemed that they had never been so insulted in their lives before and they took care to let everybody in the vehicle know that they had paid for firstclass and that at home they kept their own carriage  they were also very indignant because the people at the house where they had lodged had offered to shake hands with them at parting  they did not come to oberammergau to be treated on terms of familiarity by german peasants they said  there are many women in the world who are in every way much better than angels  they are gentle and gracious and generous and kind and unselfish and good in spite of temptations and trials to which mere angels are never subjected  and there are also many women in the world who under the clothes and not unfrequently under the title of a lady wear the heart of an underbred snob  having no natural dignity they think to supply its place with arrogance  they mistake noisy bounce for selfpossession and supercilious rudeness as the sign of superiority they encourage themselves in sleepy stupidity under the impression that they are acquiring aristocratic repose  they would appear to have studied attitude from the pages of the london journal coquetry from barmaidsthe commoner class of barmaids i meanwit from threeact farces and manners from the servantshall  to be gushingly fawning to those above them and vulgarly insolent to everyone they consider below them is their idea of the way to hold and improve their position whatever it may be in society and to be brutally indifferent to the rights and feelings of everybody else in the world is in their opinion the hallmark of gentle birth  they are the women you see at private views pushing themselves in front of everybody else standing before the picture so that no one can get near it and shouting out their silly opinions which they evidently imagine to be brilliantly satirical remarks in strident tones the women who in the stalls of the theatre talk loudly all through the performance and who having arrived in the middle of the first act and made as much disturbance as they know how before settling down in their seats ostentatiously get up and walk out before the piece is finished the women who at dinnerparty and at homethat cheapest and most deadly uninteresting of all deadly uninteresting social functionsyou know the receipt for a fashionable at home dont you  take five hundred people twothirds of whom do not know each other and the other third of whom cordially dislike each other pack them on a hot day into a room capable of accommodating forty leave them there to bore one another to death for a couple of hours with drawingroom philosophy and secondhand scandal then give them a cup of weak tea and a piece of crumbly cake without any plate to eat it on or if it is an evening affair a glass of champagne of the youdontforgetyouvehaditforaweek brand and a hamsandwich and put them out into the street againcan do nothing but make spiteful remarks about everybody whose name and address they happen to know the women who in the penny bus for in her own country the lady of the new school is wonderfully economical and businesslike spreads herself out over the seat and looking indignant when a tired little milliner gets in would leave the poor girl standing with her bundle for an hour rather than make room for herthe women who write to the papers to complain that chivalry is dead  b who has been looking over my shoulder while i have been writing the foregoing after the manner of a family herald storytellers wife in the last chapter fancy a man having to write the story of his early life and adventures with his wife looking over his shoulder all the time no wonder the tales lack incident says that i have been living too much on sauerkraut and white wine but i reply that if anything has tended to interfere for a space with the deepseated love and admiration that as a rule i entertain for all man and womankind it is his churches and picturegalleries  we have seen enough churches and pictures since our return to munich to last me for a very long while  i shall not go to church when i get home again more than twice a sunday for months to come  the inhabitants of munich boast that their cathedral is the ugliest in europe and judging from appearances i am inclined to think that the claim must be admitted  anyhow if there be an uglier one i hope i am feeling well and strong when i first catch sight of it  as for pictures and sculptures i am thoroughly tired of them  the greatest art critic living could not dislike pictures and sculptures more than i do at this moment  we began by spending a whole morning in each gallery  we examined each picture critically and argued with each other about its form and colour and treatment and perspective and texture and atmosphere  i generally said it was flat and b that it was out of drawing  a stranger overhearing our discussions would have imagined that we knew something about painting  we would stand in front of a canvas for ten minutes drinking it in  we would walk round it so as to get the proper light upon it and to better realise the artists aim  we would back away from it on to the toes of the people behind until we reached the correct distance and then sit down and shade our eyes and criticise it from there and then we would go up and put our noses against it and examine the workmanship in detail  this is how we used to look at pictures in the early stages of our munich art studies  now we use picture galleries to practise spurts in  i did a hundred yards this morning through the old pantechnicon in twentytwo and a half seconds which for fair heelandtoe walking i consider very creditable  b took fiveeighths of a second longer for the same distance but then he dawdled to look at a raphael  the pantechnicon i should explain is the name we have for our own purposes given to what the munichers prefer to call the pinakothek  we could never pronounce pinakothek properly  we called it pynniosec pintactec and the happy tack  b one day after dinner called it the penny cock and then we both got frightened and agreed to fix up some sensible practical name for it before any mischief was done  we finally decided on pantechnicon which begins with a p and is a dignified oldestablished name and one that we can both pronounce  it is quite as long and nearly as difficult to spell before you know how as the other added to which it has a homely sound  it seemed to be the very word  the old pantechnicon is devoted to the works of the old masters i shall not say anything about these as i do not wish to disturb in any way the critical opinion that europe has already formed concerning them  i prefer that the art schools of the world should judge for themselves in the matter  i will merely remark here for purposes of reference that i thought some of the pictures very beautiful and that others i did not care for  what struck me as most curious about the exhibition was the number of canvases dealing with food stuffs  twentyfive per cent of the pictures in the place seem to have been painted as advertisements for somebodys homegrown seeds or as coloured supplements to be given away with the summer number of the leading gardening journal of the period  what could have induced these old fellows i said to b to choose such very uninteresting subjects  who on earth cares to look at the lifesized portrait of a cabbage and a peck of peas or at these no doubt masterly representations of a cut from the joint with bread and vegetables  look at that view in a hamandbeef shop no 7063 size sixty feet by forty  it must have taken the artist a couple of years to paint  who did he expect was going to buy it  and that christmashamper scene over in the corner was it painted do you think by some poor halfstarved devil who thought he would have something to eat in the house if it were only a picture of it  b said he thought that the explanation was that the ancient patrons of art were gentry with a very strong idea of the fitness of things  for their churches and cathedrals said b they had painted all those virgins and martyrs and overfed angels that you see everywhere about europe  for their bedrooms they ordered thosewell those bedroom sort of pictures that you may have noticed here and there and then i expect they used these victualanddrinkscapes for their banqueting halls  it must have been like a ginandbitters to them the sight of all that food  in the new pantechnicon is exhibited the modern art of germany  this appeared to me to be exceedingly poor stuff  it seemed to belong to the illustrated christmas number school of art  it was good sound respectable work enough  there was plenty of colour about it and you could tell what everything was meant for  but there seemed no imagination no individuality no thought anywhere  each picture looked as though it could have been produced by anyone who had studied and practised art for the requisite number of years and who was not a born fool  at all events this is my opinion and as i know nothing whatever about art i speak without prejudice  one thing i have enjoyed at munich very much and that has been the music  the german band that you hear in the square in london while you are trying to compose an essay on the civilising influence of music is not the sort of band that you hear in germany  the german bands that come to london are bands that have fled from germany in order to save their lives  in germany these bands would be slaughtered at the public expense and their bodies given to the poor for sausages  the bands that the germans keep for themselves are magnificent bands  munich of all places in the now united fatherland has i suppose the greatest reputation for its military bands and the citizens are allowed not only to pay for them but to hear them  two or three times a day in different parts of the city one or another of them will be playing pro bono publico and in the evening they are loaned out by the authorities to the proprietors of the big beergardens  go and dash are the chief characteristics of their method but when needed they can produce from the battered timeworn trumpets which have been handed down from player to player since the regiment was first formed notes as soft and full and clear as any that could start from the strings of some old violin  the german band in germany has to know its business to be listened to by a german audience  the bavarian artisan or shopkeeper understands and appreciates good music as he understands and appreciates good beer  you cannot impose upon him with an inferior article  a musichall audience in munich are very particular as to how their beloved wagner is rendered and the trifles from mozart and haydn that they love to take in with their sausages and salad and which when performed to their satisfaction they will thunderously applaud must not be taken liberties with or they will know the reason why  the german beergarden should be visited by everyone who would see the german people as well as their churches and castles  it is here that the workers of all kinds congregate in the evening  here after the labours of the day come the tradesman with his wife and family the young clerk with his betrothed andalso her mother alack and welladaythe soldier with his sweetheart the students in twos and threes the little grisette with her cousin the shopboy and the workman  here come greyhaired darby and joan and over the mug of beer they share between them they sit thinking of the childrenof little lisa married to clever karl who is pushing his way in the faroff land that lies across the great sea of laughing elsie settled in hamburg who has grandchildren of her own now of fairhaired franz his mothers pet who fell in sunny france fighting for the fatherland  at the next table sits a blushing happy little maid full of haughty airs and graces such as may be excused to a little maid who has just saved a no doubt promising but at present somewhat awkwardlooking youth from lifelong misery if not madness and suicide depend upon it that is the alternative he put before her by at last condescending to give him the plump little hand that he thinking nobody sees him holds so tightly beneath the tablecloth  opposite a family group sit discussing omelettes and a bottle of white wine  the father contented goodhumoured and laughing the small child grave and solemn eating and drinking in businesslike fashion the mother smiling at both yet not forgetting to eat  i think one would learn to love these german women if one lived among them for long  there is something so sweet so womanly so genuine about them  they seem to shed around them from their bright goodtempered faces a healthy atmosphere of all that is homely and simple and good looking into their quiet steadfast eyes one dreams of white household linen folded in great presses of sweetsmelling herbs of savoury appetising things being cooked for supper of brightpolished furniture of the patter of tiny feet of little highpitched voices asking silly questions of quiet talks in the lamplit parlour after the children are in bed upon important questions of house management and home politics while long stockings are being darned  they are not the sort of women to turn a mans head but they are the sort of women to lay hold of a mans heartvery gently at first so that he hardly knows that they have touched it and then with soft clinging tendrils that wrap themselves tighter and tighter year by year around it and draw him closer and closertill as one by one the false visions and hot passions of his youth fade away the plain homely figure fills more and more his daystill it grows to mean for him all the better more lasting true part of lifetill he feels that the strong gentle mothernature that has stood so long beside him has been welded firmly into his own and that they twain are now at last one finished whole  we had our dinner at a beergarden the day before yesterday  we thought it would be pleasant to eat and drink to the accompaniment of music but we found that in practice this was not so  to dine successfully to music needs a very strong digestionespecially in bavaria  the band that performs at a munich beergarden is not the sort of band that can be ignored  the members of a munich military band are big broadchested fellows and they are not afraid of work  they do not talk much and they never whistle  they keep all their breath to do their duty with  they do not blow their very hardest for fear of bursting their instruments but whatever pressure to the square inch the trumpet cornet or trombone as the case may be is calculated to be capable of sustaining without permanent injury and they are tolerably sound and wellseasoned utensils that pressure the conscientious german bandsman puts upon each square inch of the trumpet cornet or trombone as the case may be  if you are within a mile of a munich military band and are not stone deaf you listen to it and do not think of much else  it compels your attention by its mere noise it dominates your whole being by its sheer strength  your mind has to follow it as the feet of the little children followed the playing of the pied piper  whatever you do you have to do in unison with the band  all through our meal we had to keep time with the music  we ate our soup to slow waltz time with the result that every spoonful was cold before we got it up to our mouth  just as the fish came the band started a quick polka and the consequence of that was that we had not time to pick out the bones  we gulped down white wine to the blacksmiths galop and if the tune had lasted much longer we should both have been blind drunk  with the advent of our steaks the band struck up a selection from wagner  i know of no modern european composer so difficult to eat beefsteak to as wagner  that we did not choke ourselves is a miracle  wagners orchestration is most trying to follow  we had to give up all idea of mustard  b tried to eat a bit of bread with his steak and got most hopelessly out of tune  i am afraid i was a little flat myself during the valkyries ride  my steak was rather underdone and i could not work it quickly enough  after getting outside hard beefsteak to wagner putting away potato salad to the garden music out of faust was comparatively simple  once or twice a slice of potato stuck in our throat during a very high note but on the whole our rendering was fairly artistic  we rattled off a sweet omelette to a symphony in gor f or else k i wont be positive as to the precise letter but it was something in the alphabet i knowand bolted our cheese to the ballet music from carmen  after which we rolled about in agonies to all the national airs of europe  if ever you visit a german beerhall or gardento study character or anything of that kindbe careful when you have finished drinking your beer to shut the cover of the mug down tight  if you leave it with the cover standing open that is taken as a sign that you want more beer and the girl snatches it away and brings it back refilled  b and i very nearly had an accident one warm night owing to our ignorance of this custom  each time after we had swallowed the quart we left the pot standing before us with the cover up and each time it was in consequence taken away and brought back to us brimming full again after about the sixth time we gently remonstrated  this is very kind of you my good girl b said but really i dont think we can  i dont think we ought to  you must not go on doing this sort of thing  we will drink this one now that you have brought it but we really must insist on its being the last  after about the tenth time we expostulated still more strongly  now you know what i told you four quarts ago remarked b severely this cant go on for ever  something serious will be happening  we are not used to your german school of drinking  we are only foreigners  in our own country we are considered rather swagger at this elbowraising business and for the credit of old england we have done our best  but now there must be an end to it  i simply decline to drink any more  no do not press me  not even another gallon  but you both sit there with both your mugs open replies the girl in an injured tone  what do you mean we sit with our mugs open asks b  cant we have our mugs open if we like  ah yes she explains pathetically but then i think you want more beer  gentlemen always open their mugs when they want them filled with beer  we kept our mugs shut after that     monday june 9th   a long chapter but happily the lastthe pilgrims returna deserted townheidelbergthe common or bed sheet

travelling in germanyb is taken prisonerhis fortitudeadvantages of ignorancefirst impressions of germany and of the germans  we are at ostend  our pilgrimage has ended  we sail for dover in three hours time  the wind seems rather fresh but they say that it will drop towards the evening  i hope they are not deceiving us  we are disappointed with ostend  we thought that ostend would be gay and crowded  we thought that there would be bands and theatres and concerts and busy tabledhotes and lively sands and thronged parades and pretty girls at ostend  i bought a stick and a new pair of boots at brussels on purpose for ostend  there does not seem to be a living visitor in the place besides ourselvesnor a dead one either that we can find  the shops are shut up the houses are deserted the casino is closed  noticeboards are exhibited outside the hotels to the effect that the police have strict orders to take into custody anybody found trespassing upon or damaging the premises  we found one restaurant which looked a little less like a morgue than did the other restaurants in the town and rang the bell  after we had waited for about a quarter of an hour an old woman answered the door and asked us what we wanted  we said a steak and chipped potatoes for two and a couple of lagers  she said would we call again in about a fortnights time when the family would be at home  she did not herself know where the things were kept  we went down on to the sands this morning  we had not been walking up and down for more than half an hour before we came across the distinct imprint of a human foot  someone must have been there this very day  we were a good deal alarmed  we could not imagine how he came there  the weather is too fine for shipwrecks and it was not a part of the coast where any passing trader would be likely to land  besides if anyone has landed where is he  we have been able to find no trace of him whatever to this hour we have never discovered who our strange visitant was  it is a very mysterious affair and i am glad we are going away  we have been travelling about a good deal since we left munich  we went first to heidelberg  we arrived early in the morning at heidelberg after an allnight journey and the first thing that the proprietor of the royal suggested on seeing us was that we should have a bath  we consented to the operation and were each shown into a little marble bathroom in which i felt like a bit out of a picture by alma tadema  the bath was very refreshing but i should have enjoyed the whole thing much better if they had provided me with something more suitable to wipe upon than a thin linen sheet  the germans hold very curious notions as to the needs and requirements of a wet man  i wish they would occasionally wash and bath themselves and then they would perhaps obtain more practical ideas upon the subject  i have wiped upon a sheet in cases of emergency and so i have upon a pair of socks but there is no doubt that the proper thing is a towel  to dry oneself upon a sheet needs special training and unusual agility  a nautch girl or a dancing dervish would no doubt get through the performance with credit  they would twirl the sheet gracefully round their head draw it lightly across their back twist it in waving folds round their legs wrap themselves for a moment in its whirling maze and then lightly skip away from it dry and smiling  but that is not the manner in which the dripping untaught briton attempts to wipe himself upon a sheet  the method he adopts is to clutch the sheet with both hands lean up against the wall and rub himself with it  in trying to get the thing round to the back of him he drops half of it into the water and from that moment the bathroom is not big enough to enable him to get away for an instant from that wet half when he is wiping the front of himself with the dry half the wet half climbs round behind and in a spirit of offensive familiarity slaps him on the back  while he is stooping down rubbing his feet it throws itself with delirious joy around his head and he is black in the face before he can struggle away from its embrace  when he is least expecting anything of the kind it flies round and gives him a playful flick upon some particularly tender part of his body that sends him springing with a yell ten feet up into the air  the great delight of the sheet as a whole is to trip him up whenever he attempts to move so as to hear what he says when he sits down suddenly on the stone floor and if it can throw him into the bath again just as he has finished wiping himself it feels that life is worth living after all  we spent two days at heidelberg climbing the wooded mountains that surround that pleasant little town and that afford from their restaurant or ruincrowned summits enchanting farstretching views through which with many a turn and twist the distant rhine and nearer neckar wind or strolling among the crumbling walls and arches of the grand historylogged wreck that was once the noblest castle in all germany  we stood in awed admiration before the great tun which is the chief object of interest in heidelberg  what there is of interest in the sight of a big beerbarrel it is difficult in ones calmer moments to understand but the guide book says that it is a thing to be seen and so all we tourists go and stand in a row and gape at it  we are a sheepheaded lot  if by a printers error no mention were made in the guide book of the colosseum we should spend a month in rome and not think it worth going across the road to look at  if the guide book says we must by no means omit to pay a visit to some famous pincushion that contains eleven million pins we travel five hundred miles on purpose to see it  from heidelberg we went to darmstadt  we spent halfanhour at darmstadt  why we ever thought of stopping longer there i do not know it is a pleasant enough town to live in i should say but utterly uninteresting to the stranger  after one walk round it we made inquiries as to the next train out of it and being informed that one was then on the point of starting we tumbled into it and went to bonn  from bonn whence we made one or two rhine excursions and where we ascended twentyeight blessed steps on our kneesthe chapel people called them blessed steps we didnt after the first fourteen we returned to cologne  from cologne we went to brussels from brussels to ghent where we saw more famous pictures and heard the mighty roland ring oer lagoon and lake of sand  from ghent we went to bruges where i had the satisfaction of throwing a stone at the statue of simon stevin who added to the miseries of my schooldays by inventing decimals and from bruges we came on here  finding out and arranging our trains has been a fearful work  i have left the whole business with b and he has lost two stone over it  i used to think at one time that my own dear native bradshaw was a sufficiently hard nut for the human intellect to crack or to transpose the simile that bradshaw was sufficient to crack an ordinary human nut but dear old bradshaw is an axiom in euclid for stonewall obviousness compared with a through continental timetable  every morning b has sat down with the book before him and grasping his head between his hands has tried to understand it without going mad  here we are he has said  this is the train that will do for us leaves munich at 145 gets to heidelberg at 4just in time for a cup of tea  gets to heidelberg at 4 i exclaim  does the whole distance in two and a quarter hours  why we were all night coming down  well there you are he says pointing to the timetable  munich depart 145 heidelberg arrive 4  yes i say looking over his shoulder but dont you see the 4 is in thick type  that means 4 in the morning  oh ah yes he replies  i never noticed that  yes of course  no it cant be that either  why that would make the journey fourteen hours  it cant take fourteen hours  no of course not  thats not meant for thick type that 4  thats thin type got a little thick thats all  well it cant be 4 this afternoon i argue  it must be 4 tomorrow afternoon  thats just what a german express train would like to dotake a whole day over a six hours job  he puzzles for a while and then breaks out with  oh  i see it now  how stupid of me  that train that gets to heidelberg at 4 comes from berlin  he seemed quite delighted with this discovery  whats the good of it to us then i ask  that depresses him  no it is not much good im afraid he agrees  it seems to go straight from berlin to heidelberg without stopping at munich at all well then where does the 145 go to  it must go somewhere  five minutes more elapse and then he exclaims  drat this 145  it doesnt seem to go anywhere  munich depart 145 and thats all  it must go somewhere  apparently however it does not  it seems to be a train that starts out from munich at 145 and goes off on the loose  possibly it is a young romantic train fond of mystery  it wont say where its going to  it probably does not even know itself  it goes off in search of adventure  i shall start off it says to itself at 145 punctually and just go on anyhow without thinking about it and see where i get to  or maybe it is a conceited headstrong young train  it will not be guided or advised  the traffic superintendent wants it to go to st petersburg or to paris  the old greyheaded stationmaster argues with it and tries to persuade it to go to constantinople or even to jerusalem if it likes that betterurges it to at all events make up its mind where it is goingwarns it of the danger to young trains of having no fixed aim or object in life  other people asked to use their influence with it have talked to it like a father and have begged it for their sakes to go to kamskatka or timbuctoo or jericho according as they have thought best for it and then finding that it takes no notice of them have got wild with it and have told it to go to still more distant places  but to all counsel and entreaty it has turned a deaf ear  you leave me alone it has replied i know where im going to  dont you worry yourself about me  you mind your own business all of you  i dont want a lot of old fools telling me what to do  i know what im about  what can be expected from such a train  the chances are that it comes to a bad end  i expect it is recognised afterwards a brokendown unloved friendless old train wandering aimless and despised in some faroff country musing with bitter regret upon the day when full of foolish pride and ambition it started from munich with its boiler nicely oiled at 145  b abandons this 145 as hopeless and incorrigible and continues his search  hulloa whats this he exclaims  how will this do us  leaves munich at 4 gets to heidelberg 415  thats quick work  something wrong there  that wont do  you cant get from munich to heidelberg in a quarter of an hour  oh i see it  that 4 oclock goes to brussels and then on to heidelberg afterwards  gets in there at 415 tomorrow i suppose  i wonder why it goes round by brussels though  then it seems to stop at prague for ever so long  oh damn this timetable  then he finds another train that starts at 215 and seems to be an ideal train  he gets quite enthusiastic over this train  this is the train for us old man he says  this is a splendid train really  it doesnt stop anywhere  does it get anywhere i ask  of course it gets somewhere he replies indignantly  its an express munich he murmurs tracing its course through the timetable depart 215  first and second class only  nuremberg  no it doesnt stop at nuremberg  wurtzburg  no  frankfort for strasburg  no  cologne antwerp calais  well where does it stop  confound it it must stop somewhere  berlin paris brussels copenhagen  no  upon my soul this is another train that does not go anywhere  it starts from munich at 215 and thats all  it doesnt do anything else  it seems to be a habit of munich trains to start off in this purposeless way  apparently their sole object is to get away from the town  they dont care where they go to they dont care what becomes of them so long as they escape from munich  for heavens sake they say to themselves let us get away from this place  dont let us bother about where we shall go we can decide that when we are once fairly outside  lets get out of munich thats the great thing  b begins to grow quite frightened  he says  we shall never be able to leave this city  there are no trains out of munich at all  its a plot to keep us here thats what it is  we shall never be able to get away  we shall never see dear old england again  i try to cheer him up by suggesting that perhaps it is the custom in bavaria to leave the destination of the train to the taste and fancy of the passengers  the railway authorities provide a train and start it off at 215  it is immaterial to them where it goes to  that is a question for the passengers to decide among themselves  the passengers hire the train and take it away and there is an end of the matter so far as the railway people are concerned  if there is any difference of opinion between the passengers owing to some of them wishing to go to spain while others want to get home to russia they no doubt settle the matter by tossing up  b however refuses to entertain this theory and says he wishes i would not talk so much when i see how harassed he is  thats all the thanks i get for trying to help him  he worries along for another five minutes and then he discovers a train that gets to heidelberg all right and appears to be in most respects a model train the only thing that can be urged against it being that it does not start from anywhere  it seems to drop into heidelberg casually and then to stop there  one expects its sudden advent alarms the people at heidelberg station  they do not know what to make of it  the porter goes up to the stationmaster and says  beg pardon sir but theres a strange train in the station  oh answers the stationmaster surprised where did it come from  dont know replies the man it doesnt seem to know itself  dear me says the stationmaster how very extraordinary  what does it want  doesnt seem to want anything particular replies the other  its a curious sort of train  seems to be a bit dotty if you ask me  um muses the stationmaster its a rum go  well i suppose we must let it stop here a bit now  we can hardly turn it out a night like this oh let it make itself comfortable in the woodshed till the morning and then we will see if we can find its friends  at last b makes the discovery that to get to heidelberg we must go to darmstadt and take another train from there  this knowledge gives him renewed hope and strength and he sets to work afreshthis time to find trains from munich to darmstadt and from darmstadt to heidelberg  here we are he cries after a few minutes hunting  ive got it he is of a buoyant disposition  this will be it  leaves munich 10 gets to darmstadt 525  leaves darmstadt for heidelberg 520 gets to  that doesnt allow us much time for changing does it i remark  no he replies growing thoughtful again  no thats awkward  if it were only the other way round it would be all right or it would do if our train got there five minutes before its time and the other one was a little late in starting  hardly safe to reckon on that i suggest and he agrees with me and proceeds to look for some more fitable trains  it would appear however that all the trains from darmstadt to heidelberg start just a few minutes before the trains from munich arrive it looks quite pointed as though they tried to avoid us  bs intellect generally gives way about this point and he becomes simply drivelling  he discovers trains that run from munich to heidelberg in fourteen minutes by way of venice and geneva with halfanhours interval for breakfast at rome  he rushes up and down the book in pursuit of demon expresses that arrive at their destinations fortyseven minutes before they start and leave again before they get there  he finds out all by himself that the only way to get from south germany to paris is to go to calais and then take the boat to moscow before he has done with the timetable he doesnt know whether he is in europe asia africa or america nor where he wants to get to nor why he wants to go there  then i quietly but firmly take the book away from him and dress him for going out and we take our bags and walk to the station and tell a porter that please we want to go to heidelberg  and the porter takes us one by each hand and leads us to a seat and tells us to sit there and be good and that when it is time he will come and fetch us and put us in the train and this he does  that is my method of finding out how to get from one place to another it is not as dignified perhaps as bs but it is simpler and more efficacious  it is slow work travelling in germany  the german train does not hurry or excite itself over its work and when it stops it likes to take a rest  when a german train draws up at a station everybody gets out and has a walk  the enginedriver and the stoker cross over and knock at the stationmasters door  the stationmaster comes out and greets them effusively and then runs back into the house to tell his wife that they have come and she bustles out and also welcomes them effusively and the four stand chatting about old times and friends and the state of the crops  after a while the enginedriver during a pause in the conversation looks at his watch and says he is afraid he must be going but the stationmasters wife wont hear of it  oh you must stop and see the children she says  they will be home from school soon and theyll be so disappointed if they hear you have been here and gone away again  lizzie will never forgive you  the enginedriver and the stoker laugh and say that under those circumstances they suppose they must stop and they do so  meanwhile the bookingclerk has introduced the guard to his sister and such a very promising flirtation has been taking place behind the ticketoffice door that it would not be surprising if weddingbells were heard in the neighbourhood before long  the second guard has gone down into the town to try and sell a dog and the passengers stroll about the platform and smoke or partake of a light meal in the refreshmentroomthe poorer classes regaling themselves upon hot sausage and the more dainty upon soup  when everybody appears to be sufficiently rested a move onward is suggested by the enginedriver or the guard and if all are agreeable to the proposal the train starts  tremendous excitement was caused during our journey between heidelberg and darmstadt by the discovery that we were travelling in an express train they called it an express it jogged along at the rate of twenty miles an hour when it could be got to move at all most of its time it seemed to be half asleep with slowtrain tickets  the train was stopped at the next station and b was marched off between two sternlooking goldlaced officials to explain the matter to a sternlooking goldlaced stationmaster surrounded by three sternlooking goldlaced followers the scene suggested a drumhead courtmartial and i could see that b was nervous though outwardly calm and brave  he shouted back a lighthearted adieu to me as he passed down the platform and asked me if the worst happened to break it gently to his mother  however no harm came of it and he returned to the carriage without a stain upon his character he having made it clear to the satisfaction of the courtfirstly that he did not know that our tickets were only slowtrain tickets secondly that he was not aware that we were not travelling by a slow train and thirdly that he was ready to pay the difference in the fares  he blamed himself for having done this last however afterwards  he seemed to think that he could have avoided this expense by assuming ignorance of the german language  he said that two years ago when he was travelling in germany with three other men the authorities came down upon them in much the same way for travelling firstclass with secondclass tickets  why they were doing this b did not seem able to explain very clearly he said that if he recollected rightly the guard had told them to get into a firstclass or else they had not had time to get into a secondclass or else they did not know they were not in a secondclass i must confess his explanation appeared to me to be somewhat lame  anyhow there they were in a firstclass carriage and there was the collector at the door looking indignantly at their secondclass tickets and waiting to hear what they had to say for themselves  one of their party did not know much german but what little he did know he was very proud of and liked to air and this one argued the matter with the collector and expressed himself in german so well that the collector understood and disbelieved every word he said  he was also on his part able with a little trouble to understand what the collector said which was that he must pay eighteen marks  and he had to  as for the other three two at all events of whom were excellent german scholars they did not understand anything and nobody could make them understand anything  the collector roared at them for about ten minutes and they smiled pleasantly and said they wanted to go to hanover  he went and fetched the stationmaster and the stationmaster explained to them for another ten minutes that if they did not pay eighteen shillings each he should do the german equivalent for summonsing them and they smiled and nodded and told him that they wanted to go to hanover  then a very importantlooking personage in a cockedhat came up and was very angry and he and the stationmaster and the collector took it in turns to explain to b and his two friends the state of the law on the matter  they stormed and raged and threatened and pleaded for a quarter of an hour or so and then they got sick and slammed the door and went off leaving the government to lose the fiftyfour marks  we passed the german frontier on wednesday and have been in belgium since  i like the germans  b says i ought not to let them know this because it will make them conceited but i have no fear of such a result  i am sure they possess too much commonsense for their heads to be turned by praise no matter from whom  b also says that i am displaying more energy than prudence in forming an opinion of a people merely from a few weeks travel amongst them  but my experience is that first impressions are the most reliable  at all events in my case they are  i often arrive at quite sensible ideas and judgments on the spur of the moment  it is when i stop to think that i become foolish  our first thoughts are the thoughts that are given to us our second thoughts are the thoughts that we make for ourselves  i prefer to trust to the former  the germans are a big squareshouldered deepchested race  they do not talk much but look as though they thought  like all big things they are easygoing and goodtempered  antitobacconists teetotallers and suchlike faddists would fare badly in germany  a german has no antinature notions as to its being wicked for him to enjoy his life and still more criminal for him to let anybody else enjoy theirs  he likes his huge pipe and he likes his mug of beer and as these become empty he likes to have them filled again and he likes to see other people like their pipe and their mug of beer  if you were to go dancing round a german shrieking out entreaties to him to sign a pledge that he would never drink another drop of beer again as long as he lived he would ask you to remember that you were talking to a man not to a child or an imbecile and he would probably impress the request upon you by boxing your ears for your impertinence  he can conduct himself sensibly without making an ass of himself  he can be temperate without tying bits of coloured ribbon all about himself to advertise the fact and without rushing up and down the street waving a banner and yelling about it  the german women are not beautiful but they are lovable and sweet and they are broadbreasted and broadhipped like the mothers of big sons should be  they do not seem to trouble themselves about their rights but appear to be very contented and happy even without votes  the men treat them with courtesy and tenderness but with none of that exaggerated deference that one sees among more petticoatridden nations the germans are women lovers not women worshippers and they are not worried by any doubts as to which sex shall rule the state and which stop at home and mind the children  the german women are not politicians and mayors and county councillors they are housewives  all classes of germans are scrupulously polite to one another but this is the result of mutual respect not of snobbery  the tramcar conductor expects to be treated with precisely the same courtesy that he tenders the count raises his hat to the shopkeeper and expects the shopkeeper to raise his hat to him  the germans are hearty eaters but they are not like the french fussy and finicky over their food  their stomach is not their god and the cook with his sauces and pates and ragouts is not their high priest  so long as the dish is wholesome and there is sufficient of it they are satisfied  in the mere sensuous arts of painting and sculpture the germans are poor in the ennobling arts of literature and music they are great and this fact provides a key to their character  they are a simple earnest homely genuine people  they do not laugh much but when they do they laugh deep down  they are slow but so is a deep river  a placid look generally rests upon their heavy features but sometimes they frown and then they look somewhat grim  a visit to germany is a tonic to an englishman  we english are always sneering at ourselves and patriotism in england is regarded as a stamp of vulgarity  the germans on the other hand believe in themselves and respect themselves  the world for them is not played out  their country to them is still the fatherland  they look straight before them like a people who see a great future in front of them and are not afraid to go forward to fulfil it                          goodbye sir
