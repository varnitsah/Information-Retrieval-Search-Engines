love                      the biographer of kipps and the                       historian of the ages to come                     this simple tale of the xix century                         is affectionately offered     chapter i   mr verloc going out in the morning left his shop nominally in charge of his brotherinlaw  it could be done because there was very little business at any time and practically none at all before the evening  mr verloc cared but little about his ostensible business  and moreover his wife was in charge of his brotherinlaw  the shop was small and so was the house  it was one of those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of reconstruction dawned upon london  the shop was a square box of a place with the front glazed in small panes  in the daytime the door remained closed in the evening it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar  the window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines closed yellow paper envelopes very flimsy and marked twoandsix in heavy black figures a few numbers of ancient french comic publications hung across a string as if to dry a dingy blue china bowl a casket of black wood bottles of marking ink and rubber stamps a few books with titles hinting at impropriety a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers badly printed with titles like the torch the gong—rousing titles  and the two gas jets inside the panes were always turned low either for economy’s sake or for the sake of the customers  these customers were either very young men who hung about the window for a time before slipping in suddenly or men of a more mature age but looking generally as if they were not in funds  some of that last kind had the collars of their overcoats turned right up to their moustaches and traces of mud on the bottom of their nether garments which had the appearance of being much worn and not very valuable  and the legs inside them did not as a general rule seem of much account either  with their hands plunged deep in the side pockets of their coats they dodged in sideways one shoulder first as if afraid to start the bell going  the bell hung on the door by means of a curved ribbon of steel was difficult to circumvent  it was hopelessly cracked but of an evening at the slightest provocation it clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence  it clattered and at that signal through the dusty glass door behind the painted deal counter mr verloc would issue hastily from the parlour at the back  his eyes were naturally heavy he had an air of having wallowed fully dressed all day on an unmade bed  another man would have felt such an appearance a distinct disadvantage  in a commercial transaction of the retail order much depends on the seller’s engaging and amiable aspect  but mr verloc knew his business and remained undisturbed by any sort of æsthetic doubt about his appearance  with a firm steadyeyed impudence which seemed to hold back the threat of some abominable menace he would proceed to sell over the counter some object looking obviously and scandalously not worth the money which passed in the transaction a small cardboard box with apparently nothing inside for instance or one of those carefully closed yellow flimsy envelopes or a soiled volume in paper covers with a promising title  now and then it happened that one of the faded yellow dancing girls would get sold to an amateur as though she had been alive and young  sometimes it was mrs verloc who would appear at the call of the cracked bell  winnie verloc was a young woman with a full bust in a tight bodice and with broad hips  her hair was very tidy  steadyeyed like her husband she preserved an air of unfathomable indifference behind the rampart of the counter  then the customer of comparatively tender years would get suddenly disconcerted at having to deal with a woman and with rage in his heart would proffer a request for a bottle of marking ink retail value sixpence price in verloc’s shop oneandsixpence which once outside he would drop stealthily into the gutter  the evening visitors—the men with collars turned up and soft hats rammed down—nodded familiarly to mrs verloc and with a muttered greeting lifted up the flap at the end of the counter in order to pass into the back parlour which gave access to a passage and to a steep flight of stairs  the door of the shop was the only means of entrance to the house in which mr verloc carried on his business of a seller of shady wares exercised his vocation of a protector of society and cultivated his domestic virtues  these last were pronounced  he was thoroughly domesticated  neither his spiritual nor his mental nor his physical needs were of the kind to take him much abroad  he found at home the ease of his body and the peace of his conscience together with mrs verloc’s wifely attentions and mrs verloc’s mother’s deferential regard  winnie’s mother was a stout wheezy woman with a large brown face  she wore a black wig under a white cap  her swollen legs rendered her inactive  she considered herself to be of french descent which might have been true and after a good many years of married life with a licensed victualler of the more common sort she provided for the years of widowhood by letting furnished apartments for gentlemen near vauxhall bridge road in a square once of some splendour and still included in the district of belgravia  this topographical fact was of some advantage in advertising her rooms but the patrons of the worthy widow were not exactly of the fashionable kind  such as they were her daughter winnie helped to look after them  traces of the french descent which the widow boasted of were apparent in winnie too  they were apparent in the extremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark hair  winnie had also other charms her youth her full rounded form her clear complexion the provocation of her unfathomable reserve which never went so far as to prevent conversation carried on on the lodgers’ part with animation and on hers with an equable amiability  it must be that mr verloc was susceptible to these fascinations  mr verloc was an intermittent patron  he came and went without any very apparent reason he generally arrived in london like the influenza from the continent only he arrived unheralded by the press and his visitations set in with great severity  he breakfasted in bed and remained wallowing there with an air of quiet enjoyment till noon every day—and sometimes even to a later hour  but when he went out he seemed to experience a great difficulty in finding his way back to his temporary home in the belgravian square  he left it late and returned to it early—as early as three or four in the morning and on waking up at ten addressed winnie bringing in the breakfast tray with jocular exhausted civility in the hoarse failing tones of a man who had been talking vehemently for many hours together  his prominent heavylidded eyes rolled sideways amorously and languidly the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin and his dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much honeyed banter  in winnie’s mother’s opinion mr verloc was a very nice gentleman  from her life’s experience gathered in various “business houses” the good woman had taken into her retirement an ideal of gentlemanliness as exhibited by the patrons of privatesaloon bars  mr verloc approached that ideal he attained it in fact  “of course we’ll take over your furniture mother” winnie had remarked  the lodginghouse was to be given up  it seems it would not answer to carry it on  it would have been too much trouble for mr verloc  it would not have been convenient for his other business  what his business was he did not say but after his engagement to winnie he took the trouble to get up before noon and descending the basement stairs make himself pleasant to winnie’s mother in the breakfastroom downstairs where she had her motionless being  he stroked the cat poked the fire had his lunch served to him there  he left its slightly stuffy cosiness with evident reluctance but all the same remained out till the night was far advanced  he never offered to take winnie to theatres as such a nice gentleman ought to have done  his evenings were occupied  his work was in a way political he told winnie once  she would have he warned her to be very nice to his political friends  and with her straight unfathomable glance she answered that she would be so of course  how much more he told her as to his occupation it was impossible for winnie’s mother to discover  the married couple took her over with the furniture  the mean aspect of the shop surprised her  the change from the belgravian square to the narrow street in soho affected her legs adversely  they became of an enormous size  on the other hand she experienced a complete relief from material cares  her soninlaw’s heavy good nature inspired her with a sense of absolute safety  her daughter’s future was obviously assured and even as to her son stevie she need have no anxiety  she had not been able to conceal from herself that he was a terrible encumbrance that poor stevie  but in view of winnie’s fondness for her delicate brother and of mr verloc’s kind and generous disposition she felt that the poor boy was pretty safe in this rough world  and in her heart of hearts she was not perhaps displeased that the verlocs had no children  as that circumstance seemed perfectly indifferent to mr verloc and as winnie found an object of quasimaternal affection in her brother perhaps this was just as well for poor stevie  for he was difficult to dispose of that boy  he was delicate and in a frail way goodlooking too except for the vacant droop of his lower lip  under our excellent system of compulsory education he had learned to read and write notwithstanding the unfavourable aspect of the lower lip  but as errandboy he did not turn out a great success  he forgot his messages he was easily diverted from the straight path of duty by the attractions of stray cats and dogs which he followed down narrow alleys into unsavoury courts by the comedies of the streets which he contemplated openmouthed to the detriment of his employer’s interests or by the dramas of fallen horses whose pathos and violence induced him sometimes to shriek pierceingly in a crowd which disliked to be disturbed by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national spectacle  when led away by a grave and protecting policeman it would often become apparent that poor stevie had forgotten his address—at least for a time  a brusque question caused him to stutter to the point of suffocation  when startled by anything perplexing he used to squint horribly  however he never had any fits which was encouraging and before the natural outbursts of impatience on the part of his father he could always in his childhood’s days run for protection behind the short skirts of his sister winnie  on the other hand he might have been suspected of hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness  when he had reached the age of fourteen a friend of his late father an agent for a foreign preserved milk firm having given him an opening as officeboy he was discovered one foggy afternoon in his chief’s absence busy letting off fireworks on the staircase  he touched off in quick succession a set of fierce rockets angry catherine wheels loudly exploding squibs—and the matter might have turned out very serious  an awful panic spread through the whole building  wildeyed choking clerks stampeded through the passages full of smoke silk hats and elderly business men could be seen rolling independently down the stairs  stevie did not seem to derive any personal gratification from what he had done  his motives for this stroke of originality were difficult to discover  it was only later on that winnie obtained from him a misty and confused confession  it seems that two other officeboys in the building had worked upon his feelings by tales of injustice and oppression till they had wrought his compassion to the pitch of that frenzy  but his father’s friend of course dismissed him summarily as likely to ruin his business  after that altruistic exploit stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement kitchen and to black the boots of the gentlemen patronising the belgravian mansion  there was obviously no future in such work  the gentlemen tipped him a shilling now and then  mr verloc showed himself the most generous of lodgers  but altogether all that did not amount to much either in the way of gain or prospects so that when winnie announced her engagement to mr verloc her mother could not help wondering with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery what would become of poor stephen now  it appeared that mr verloc was ready to take him over together with his wife’s mother and with the furniture which was the whole visible fortune of the family  mr verloc gathered everything as it came to his broad goodnatured breast  the furniture was disposed to the best advantage all over the house but mrs verloc’s mother was confined to two back rooms on the first floor  the luckless stevie slept in one of them  by this time a growth of thin fluffy hair had come to blur like a golden mist the sharp line of his small lower jaw  he helped his sister with blind love and docility in her household duties  mr verloc thought that some occupation would be good for him  his spare time he occupied by drawing circles with compass and pencil on a piece of paper  he applied himself to that pastime with great industry with his elbows spread out and bowed low over the kitchen table  through the open door of the parlour at the back of the shop winnie his sister glanced at him from time to time with maternal vigilance     chapter ii   such was the house the household and the business mr verloc left behind him on his way westward at the hour of halfpast ten in the morning  it was unusually early for him his whole person exhaled the charm of almost dewy freshness he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned his boots were shiny his cheeks freshly shaven had a sort of gloss and even his heavylidded eyes refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber sent out glances of comparative alertness  through the park railings these glances beheld men and women riding in the row couples cantering past harmoniously others advancing sedately at a walk loitering groups of three or four solitary horsemen looking unsociable and solitary women followed at a long distance by a groom with a cockade to his hat and a leather belt over his tightfitting coat  carriages went bowling by mostly twohorse broughams with here and there a victoria with the skin of some wild beast inside and a woman’s face and hat emerging above the folded hood  and a peculiarly london sun—against which nothing could be said except that it looked bloodshot—glorified all this by its stare  it hung at a moderate elevation above hyde park corner with an air of punctual and benign vigilance  the very pavement under mr verloc’s feet had an oldgold tinge in that diffused light in which neither wall nor tree nor beast nor man cast a shadow  mr verloc was going westward through a town without shadows in an atmosphere of powdered old gold there were red coppery gleams on the roofs of houses on the corners of walls on the panels of carriages on the very coats of the horses and on the broad back of mr verloc’s overcoat where they produced a dull effect of rustiness  but mr verloc was not in the least conscious of having got rusty  he surveyed through the park railings the evidences of the town’s opulence and luxury with an approving eye  all these people had to be protected  protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury  they had to be protected and their horses carriages houses servants had to be protected and the source of their wealth had to be protected in the heart of the city and the heart of the country the whole social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be protected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour  it had to—and mr verloc would have rubbed his hands with satisfaction had he not been constitutionally averse from every superfluous exertion  his idleness was not hygienic but it suited him very well  he was in a manner devoted to it with a sort of inert fanaticism or perhaps rather with a fanatical inertness  born of industrious parents for a life of toil he had embraced indolence from an impulse as profound as inexplicable and as imperious as the impulse which directs a man’s preference for one particular woman in a given thousand  he was too lazy even for a mere demagogue for a workman orator for a leader of labour it was too much trouble  he required a more perfect form of ease or it might have been that he was the victim of a philosophical unbelief in the effectiveness of every human effort  such a form of indolence requires implies a certain amount of intelligence  mr verloc was not devoid of intelligence—and at the notion of a menaced social order he would perhaps have winked to himself if there had not been an effort to make in that sign of scepticism  his big prominent eyes were not well adapted to winking  they were rather of the sort that closes solemnly in slumber with majestic effect  undemonstrative and burly in a fatpig style mr verloc without either rubbing his hands with satisfaction or winking sceptically at his thoughts proceeded on his way  he trod the pavement heavily with his shiny boots and his general getup was that of a welltodo mechanic in business for himself  he might have been anything from a pictureframe maker to a locksmith an employer of labour in a small way  but there was also about him an indescribable air which no mechanic could have acquired in the practice of his handicraft however dishonestly exercised the air common to men who live on the vices the follies or the baser fears of mankind the air of moral nihilism common to keepers of gambling hells and disorderly houses to private detectives and inquiry agents to drink sellers and i should say to the sellers of invigorating electric belts and to the inventors of patent medicines  but of that last i am not sure not having carried my investigations so far into the depths for all i know the expression of these last may be perfectly diabolic i shouldn’t be surprised  what i want to affirm is that mr verloc’s expression was by no means diabolic  before reaching knightsbridge mr verloc took a turn to the left out of the busy main thoroughfare uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans in the almost silent swift flow of hansoms under his hat worn with a slight backward tilt his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness for his business was with an embassy  and mr verloc steady like a rock—a soft kind of rock—marched now along a street which could with every propriety be described as private  in its breadth emptiness and extent it had the majesty of inorganic nature of matter that never dies  the only reminder of mortality was a doctor’s brougham arrested in august solitude close to the curbstone  the polished knockers of the doors gleamed as far as the eye could reach the clean windows shone with a dark opaque lustre  and all was still  but a milk cart rattled noisily across the distant perspective a butcher boy driving with the noble recklessness of a charioteer at olympic games dashed round the corner sitting high above a pair of red wheels  a guiltylooking cat issuing from under the stones ran for a while in front of mr verloc then dived into another basement and a thick police constable looking a stranger to every emotion as if he too were part of inorganic nature surging apparently out of a lamppost took not the slightest notice of mr verloc  with a turn to the left mr verloc pursued his way along a narrow street by the side of a yellow wall which for some inscrutable reason had no 1 chesham square written on it in black letters  chesham square was at least sixty yards away and mr verloc cosmopolitan enough not to be deceived by london’s topographical mysteries held on steadily without a sign of surprise or indignation  at last with businesslike persistency he reached the square and made diagonally for the number 10  this belonged to an imposing carriage gate in a high clean wall between two houses of which one rationally enough bore the number 9 and the other was numbered 37 but the fact that this last belonged to porthill street a street well known in the neighbourhood was proclaimed by an inscription placed above the groundfloor windows by whatever highly efficient authority is charged with the duty of keeping track of london’s strayed houses  why powers are not asked of parliament a short act would do for compelling those edifices to return where they belong is one of the mysteries of municipal administration  mr verloc did not trouble his head about it his mission in life being the protection of the social mechanism not its perfectionment or even its criticism  it was so early that the porter of the embassy issued hurriedly out of his lodge still struggling with the left sleeve of his livery coat  his waistcoat was red and he wore kneebreeches but his aspect was flustered  mr verloc aware of the rush on his flank drove it off by simply holding out an envelope stamped with the arms of the embassy and passed on  he produced the same talisman also to the footman who opened the door and stood back to let him enter the hall  a clear fire burned in a tall fireplace and an elderly man standing with his back to it in evening dress and with a chain round his neck glanced up from the newspaper he was holding spread out in both hands before his calm and severe face  he didn’t move but another lackey in brown trousers and clawhammer coat edged with thin yellow cord approaching mr verloc listened to the murmur of his name and turning round on his heel in silence began to walk without looking back once  mr verloc thus led along a groundfloor passage to the left of the great carpeted staircase was suddenly motioned to enter a quite small room furnished with a heavy writingtable and a few chairs  the servant shut the door and mr verloc remained alone  he did not take a seat  with his hat and stick held in one hand he glanced about passing his other podgy hand over his uncovered sleek head  another door opened noiselessly and mr verloc immobilising his glance in that direction saw at first only black clothes the bald top of a head and a drooping dark grey whisker on each side of a pair of wrinkled hands  the person who had entered was holding a batch of papers before his eyes and walked up to the table with a rather mincing step turning the papers over the while  privy councillor wurmt chancelier d’ambassade was rather shortsighted  this meritorious official laying the papers on the table disclosed a face of pasty complexion and of melancholy ugliness surrounded by a lot of fine long dark grey hairs barred heavily by thick and bushy eyebrows  he put on a blackframed pincenez upon a blunt and shapeless nose and seemed struck by mr verloc’s appearance  under the enormous eyebrows his weak eyes blinked pathetically through the glasses  he made no sign of greeting neither did mr verloc who certainly knew his place but a subtle change about the general outlines of his shoulders and back suggested a slight bending of mr verloc’s spine under the vast surface of his overcoat  the effect was of unobtrusive deference  “i have here some of your reports” said the bureaucrat in an unexpectedly soft and weary voice and pressing the tip of his forefinger on the papers with force  he paused and mr verloc who had recognised his own handwriting very well waited in an almost breathless silence “we are not very satisfied with the attitude of the police here” the other continued with every appearance of mental fatigue  the shoulders of mr verloc without actually moving suggested a shrug and for the first time since he left his home that morning his lips opened  “every country has its police” he said philosophically  but as the official of the embassy went on blinking at him steadily he felt constrained to add “allow me to observe that i have no means of action upon the police here”  “what is desired” said the man of papers “is the occurrence of something definite which should stimulate their vigilance  that is within your province—is it not so”  mr verloc made no answer except by a sigh which escaped him involuntarily for instantly he tried to give his face a cheerful expression  the official blinked doubtfully as if affected by the dim light of the room  he repeated vaguely  “the vigilance of the police—and the severity of the magistrates  the general leniency of the judicial procedure here and the utter absence of all repressive measures are a scandal to europe  what is wished for just now is the accentuation of the unrest—of the fermentation which undoubtedly exists—”  “undoubtedly undoubtedly” broke in mr verloc in a deep deferential bass of an oratorical quality so utterly different from the tone in which he had spoken before that his interlocutor remained profoundly surprised “it exists to a dangerous degree  my reports for the last twelve months make it sufficiently clear”  “your reports for the last twelve months” state councillor wurmt began in his gentle and dispassionate tone “have been read by me  i failed to discover why you wrote them at all”  a sad silence reigned for a time  mr verloc seemed to have swallowed his tongue and the other gazed at the papers on the table fixedly  at last he gave them a slight push  “the state of affairs you expose there is assumed to exist as the first condition of your employment  what is required at present is not writing but the bringing to light of a distinct significant fact—i would almost say of an alarming fact”  “i need not say that all my endeavours shall be directed to that end” mr verloc said with convinced modulations in his conversational husky tone but the sense of being blinked at watchfully behind the blind glitter of these eyeglasses on the other side of the table disconcerted him  he stopped short with a gesture of absolute devotion  the useful hardworking if obscure member of the embassy had an air of being impressed by some newlyborn thought  “you are very corpulent” he said  this observation really of a psychological nature and advanced with the modest hesitation of an officeman more familiar with ink and paper than with the requirements of active life stung mr verloc in the manner of a rude personal remark  he stepped back a pace  “eh  what were you pleased to say” he exclaimed with husky resentment  the chancelier d’ambassade entrusted with the conduct of this interview seemed to find it too much for him  “i think” he said “that you had better see mr vladimir  yes decidedly i think you ought to see mr vladimir  be good enough to wait here” he added and went out with mincing steps  at once mr verloc passed his hand over his hair  a slight perspiration had broken out on his forehead  he let the air escape from his pursedup lips like a man blowing at a spoonful of hot soup  but when the servant in brown appeared at the door silently mr verloc had not moved an inch from the place he had occupied throughout the interview  he had remained motionless as if feeling himself surrounded by pitfalls  he walked along a passage lighted by a lonely gasjet then up a flight of winding stairs and through a glazed and cheerful corridor on the first floor  the footman threw open a door and stood aside  the feet of mr verloc felt a thick carpet  the room was large with three windows and a young man with a shaven big face sitting in a roomy armchair before a vast mahogany writingtable said in french to the chancelier d’ambassade who was going out with the papers in his hand  “you are quite right mon cher  he’s fat—the animal”  mr vladimir first secretary had a drawingroom reputation as an agreeable and entertaining man  he was something of a favourite in society  his wit consisted in discovering droll connections between incongruous ideas and when talking in that strain he sat well forward of his seat with his left hand raised as if exhibiting his funny demonstrations between the thumb and forefinger while his round and cleanshaven face wore an expression of merry perplexity  but there was no trace of merriment or perplexity in the way he looked at mr verloc  lying far back in the deep armchair with squarely spread elbows and throwing one leg over a thick knee he had with his smooth and rosy countenance the air of a preternaturally thriving baby that will not stand nonsense from anybody  “you understand french i suppose” he said  mr verloc stated huskily that he did  his whole vast bulk had a forward inclination  he stood on the carpet in the middle of the room clutching his hat and stick in one hand the other hung lifelessly by his side  he muttered unobtrusively somewhere deep down in his throat something about having done his military service in the french artillery  at once with contemptuous perversity mr vladimir changed the language and began to speak idiomatic english without the slightest trace of a foreign accent  “ah  yes  of course  let’s see  how much did you get for obtaining the design of the improved breechblock of their new fieldgun”  “five years’ rigorous confinement in a fortress” mr verloc answered unexpectedly but without any sign of feeling  “you got off easily” was mr vladimir’s comment  “and anyhow it served you right for letting yourself get caught  what made you go in for that sort of thing—eh”  mr verloc’s husky conversational voice was heard speaking of youth of a fatal infatuation for an unworthy—  “aha  cherchez la femme” mr vladimir deigned to interrupt unbending but without affability there was on the contrary a touch of grimness in his condescension  “how long have you been employed by the embassy here” he asked  “ever since the time of the late baron stottwartenheim” mr verloc answered in subdued tones and protruding his lips sadly in sign of sorrow for the deceased diplomat  the first secretary observed this play of physiognomy steadily  “ah ever since  well  what have you got to say for yourself” he asked sharply  mr verloc answered with some surprise that he was not aware of having anything special to say  he had been summoned by a letter—and he plunged his hand busily into the side pocket of his overcoat but before the mocking cynical watchfulness of mr vladimir concluded to leave it there  “bah” said that latter  “what do you mean by getting out of condition like this  you haven’t got even the physique of your profession  you—a member of a starving proletariat—never  you—a desperate socialist or anarchist—which is it”  “anarchist” stated mr verloc in a deadened tone  “bosh” went on mr vladimir without raising his voice  “you startled old wurmt himself  you wouldn’t deceive an idiot  they all are that bytheby but you seem to me simply impossible  so you began your connection with us by stealing the french gun designs  and you got yourself caught  that must have been very disagreeable to our government  you don’t seem to be very smart”  mr verloc tried to exculpate himself huskily  “as i’ve had occasion to observe before a fatal infatuation for an unworthy—”  mr vladimir raised a large white plump hand  “ah yes  the unlucky attachment—of your youth  she got hold of the money and then sold you to the police—eh”  the doleful change in mr verloc’s physiognomy the momentary drooping of his whole person confessed that such was the regrettable case  mr vladimir’s hand clasped the ankle reposing on his knee  the sock was of dark blue silk  “you see that was not very clever of you  perhaps you are too susceptible”  mr verloc intimated in a throaty veiled murmur that he was no longer young  “oh  that’s a failing which age does not cure” mr vladimir remarked with sinister familiarity  “but no  you are too fat for that  you could not have come to look like this if you had been at all susceptible i’ll tell you what i think is the matter you are a lazy fellow  how long have you been drawing pay from this embassy”  “eleven years” was the answer after a moment of sulky hesitation “i’ve been charged with several missions to london while his excellency baron stottwartenheim was still ambassador in paris  then by his excellency’s instructions i settled down in london  i am english”  “you are  are you  eh”  “a naturalborn british subject” mr verloc said stolidly  “but my father was french and so—”  “never mind explaining” interrupted the other  “i daresay you could have been legally a marshal of france and a member of parliament in england—and then indeed you would have been of some use to our embassy”  this flight of fancy provoked something like a faint smile on mr verloc’s face  mr vladimir retained an imperturbable gravity  “but as i’ve said you are a lazy fellow you don’t use your opportunities  in the time of baron stottwartenheim we had a lot of softheaded people running this embassy  they caused fellows of your sort to form a false conception of the nature of a secret service fund it is my business to correct this misapprehension by telling you what the secret service is not  it is not a philanthropic institution  i’ve had you called here on purpose to tell you this”  mr vladimir observed the forced expression of bewilderment on verloc’s face and smiled sarcastically  “i see that you understand me perfectly  i daresay you are intelligent enough for your work  what we want now is activity—activity”  on repeating this last word mr vladimir laid a long white forefinger on the edge of the desk  every trace of huskiness disappeared from verloc’s voice  the nape of his gross neck became crimson above the velvet collar of his overcoat  his lips quivered before they came widely open  “if you’ll only be good enough to look up my record” he boomed out in his great clear oratorical bass “you’ll see i gave a warning only three months ago on the occasion of the grand duke romuald’s visit to paris which was telegraphed from here to the french police and—”  “tut tut” broke out mr vladimir with a frowning grimace  “the french police had no use for your warning  don’t roar like this  what the devil do you mean”  with a note of proud humility mr verloc apologised for forgetting himself  his voice—famous for years at openair meetings and at workmen’s assemblies in large halls had contributed he said to his reputation of a good and trustworthy comrade  it was therefore a part of his usefulness  it had inspired confidence in his principles  “i was always put up to speak by the leaders at a critical moment” mr verloc declared with obvious satisfaction  there was no uproar above which he could not make himself heard he added and suddenly he made a demonstration  “allow me” he said  with lowered forehead without looking up swiftly and ponderously he crossed the room to one of the french windows  as if giving way to an uncontrollable impulse he opened it a little  mr vladimir jumping up amazed from the depths of the armchair looked over his shoulder and below across the courtyard of the embassy well beyond the open gate could be seen the broad back of a policeman watching idly the gorgeous perambulator of a wealthy baby being wheeled in state across the square  “constable” said mr verloc with no more effort than if he were whispering and mr vladimir burst into a laugh on seeing the policeman spin round as if prodded by a sharp instrument  mr verloc shut the window quietly and returned to the middle of the room  “with a voice like that” he said putting on the husky conversational pedal “i was naturally trusted  and i knew what to say too”  mr vladimir arranging his cravat observed him in the glass over the mantelpiece  “i daresay you have the social revolutionary jargon by heart well enough” he said contemptuously  “vox et   you haven’t ever studied latin—have you”  “no” growled mr verloc  “you did not expect me to know it  i belong to the million  who knows latin  only a few hundred imbeciles who aren’t fit to take care of themselves”  for some thirty seconds longer mr vladimir studied in the mirror the fleshy profile the gross bulk of the man behind him  and at the same time he had the advantage of seeing his own face cleanshaved and round rosy about the gills and with the thin sensitive lips formed exactly for the utterance of those delicate witticisms which had made him such a favourite in the very highest society  then he turned and advanced into the room with such determination that the very ends of his quaintly oldfashioned bow necktie seemed to bristle with unspeakable menaces the movement was so swift and fierce that mr verloc casting an oblique glance quailed inwardly  “aha  you dare be impudent” mr vladimir began with an amazingly guttural intonation not only utterly unenglish but absolutely uneuropean and startling even to mr verloc’s experience of cosmopolitan slums  “you dare  well i am going to speak plain english to you voice won’t do  we have no use for your voice  we don’t want a voice we want facts—startling facts—damn you” he added with a sort of ferocious discretion right into mr verloc’s face  “don’t you try to come over me with your hyperborean manners” mr verloc defended himself huskily looking at the carpet  at this his interlocutor smiling mockingly above the bristling bow of his necktie switched the conversation into french  “you give yourself for an ‘agent provocateur’  the proper business of an ‘agent provocateur’ is to provoke  as far as i can judge from your record kept here you have done nothing to earn your money for the last three years”  “nothing” exclaimed verloc stirring not a limb and not raising his eyes but with the note of sincere feeling in his tone  “i have several times prevented what might have been—”  “there is a proverb in this country which says prevention is better than cure” interrupted mr vladimir throwing himself into the armchair  “it is stupid in a general way  there is no end to prevention  but it is characteristic  they dislike finality in this country  don’t you be too english  and in this particular instance don’t be absurd  the evil is already here  we don’t want prevention—we want cure”  he paused turned to the desk and turning over some papers lying there spoke in a changed businesslike tone without looking at mr verloc  “you know of course of the international conference assembled in milan”  mr verloc intimated hoarsely that he was in the habit of reading the daily papers  to a further question his answer was that of course he understood what he read  at this mr vladimir smiling faintly at the documents he was still scanning one after another murmured “as long as it is not written in latin i suppose”  “or chinese” added mr verloc stolidly  “h’m  some of your revolutionary friends’ effusions are written in a charabia every bit as incomprehensible as chinese—”  mr vladimir let fall disdainfully a grey sheet of printed matter  “what are all these leaflets headed f p with a hammer pen and torch crossed  what does it mean this f p”  mr verloc approached the imposing writingtable  “the future of the proletariat  it’s a society” he explained standing ponderously by the side of the armchair “not anarchist in principle but open to all shades of revolutionary opinion”  “are you in it”  “one of the vicepresidents” mr verloc breathed out heavily and the first secretary of the embassy raised his head to look at him  “then you ought to be ashamed of yourself” he said incisively  “isn’t your society capable of anything else but printing this prophetic bosh in blunt type on this filthy paper eh  why don’t you do something  look here  i’ve this matter in hand now and i tell you plainly that you will have to earn your money  the good old stottwartenheim times are over no work no pay”  mr verloc felt a queer sensation of faintness in his stout legs  he stepped back one pace and blew his nose loudly  he was in truth startled and alarmed  the rusty london sunshine struggling clear of the london mist shed a lukewarm brightness into the first secretary’s private room and in the silence mr verloc heard against a windowpane the faint buzzing of a fly—his first fly of the year—heralding better than any number of swallows the approach of spring the useless fussing of that tiny energetic organism affected unpleasantly this big man threatened in his indolence  in the pause mr vladimir formulated in his mind a series of disparaging remarks concerning mr verloc’s face and figure  the fellow was unexpectedly vulgar heavy and impudently unintelligent  he looked uncommonly like a master plumber come to present his bill  the first secretary of the embassy from his occasional excursions into the field of american humour had formed a special notion of that class of mechanic as the embodiment of fraudulent laziness and incompetency  this was then the famous and trusty secret agent so secret that he was never designated otherwise but by the symbol delta in the late baron stottwartenheim’s official semiofficial and confidential correspondence the celebrated agent delta whose warnings had the power to change the schemes and the dates of royal imperial grand ducal journeys and sometimes caused them to be put off altogether  this fellow  and mr vladimir indulged mentally in an enormous and derisive fit of merriment partly at his own astonishment which he judged naive but mostly at the expense of the universally regretted baron stottwartenheim  his late excellency whom the august favour of his imperial master had imposed as ambassador upon several reluctant ministers of foreign affairs had enjoyed in his lifetime a fame for an owlish pessimistic gullibility  his excellency had the social revolution on the brain  he imagined himself to be a diplomatist set apart by a special dispensation to watch the end of diplomacy and pretty nearly the end of the world in a horrid democratic upheaval  his prophetic and doleful despatches had been for years the joke of foreign offices  he was said to have exclaimed on his deathbed visited by his imperial friend and master “unhappy europe  thou shalt perish by the moral insanity of thy children”  he was fated to be the victim of the first humbugging rascal that came along thought mr vladimir smiling vaguely at mr verloc  “you ought to venerate the memory of baron stottwartenheim” he exclaimed suddenly  the lowered physiognomy of mr verloc expressed a sombre and weary annoyance  “permit me to observe to you” he said “that i came here because i was summoned by a peremptory letter  i have been here only twice before in the last eleven years and certainly never at eleven in the morning  it isn’t very wise to call me up like this  there is just a chance of being seen  and that would be no joke for me”  mr vladimir shrugged his shoulders  “it would destroy my usefulness” continued the other hotly  “that’s your affair” murmured mr vladimir with soft brutality  “when you cease to be useful you shall cease to be employed  yes  right off cut short  you shall—” mr vladimir frowning paused at a loss for a sufficiently idiomatic expression and instantly brightened up with a grin of beautifully white teeth  “you shall be chucked” he brought out ferociously  once more mr verloc had to react with all the force of his will against that sensation of faintness running down one’s legs which once upon a time had inspired some poor devil with the felicitous expression “my heart went down into my boots”  mr verloc aware of the sensation raised his head bravely  mr vladimir bore the look of heavy inquiry with perfect serenity  “what we want is to administer a tonic to the conference in milan” he said airily  “its deliberations upon international action for the suppression of political crime don’t seem to get anywhere  england lags this country is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual liberty  it’s intolerable to think that all your friends have got only to come over to—”  “in that way i have them all under my eye” mr verloc interrupted huskily  “it would be much more to the point to have them all under lock and key england must be brought into line  the imbecile bourgeoisie of this country make themselves the accomplices of the very people whose aim is to drive them out of their houses to starve in ditches  and they have the political power still if they only had the sense to use it for their preservation  i suppose you agree that the middle classes are stupid”  mr verloc agreed hoarsely  “they are”  “they have no imagination  they are blinded by an idiotic vanity  what they want just now is a jolly good scare  this is the psychological moment to set your friends to work  i have had you called here to develop to you my idea”  and mr vladimir developed his idea from on high with scorn and condescension displaying at the same time an amount of ignorance as to the real aims thoughts and methods of the revolutionary world which filled the silent mr verloc with inward consternation  he confounded causes with effects more than was excusable the most distinguished propagandists with impulsive bomb throwers assumed organisation where in the nature of things it could not exist spoke of the social revolutionary party one moment as of a perfectly disciplined army where the word of chiefs was supreme and at another as if it had been the loosest association of desperate brigands that ever camped in a mountain gorge  once mr verloc had opened his mouth for a protest but the raising of a shapely large white hand arrested him  very soon he became too appalled to even try to protest  he listened in a stillness of dread which resembled the immobility of profound attention  “a series of outrages” mr vladimir continued calmly “executed here in this country not only planned here—that would not do—they would not mind  your friends could set half the continent on fire without influencing the public opinion here in favour of a universal repressive legislation  they will not look outside their backyard here”  mr verloc cleared his throat but his heart failed him and he said nothing  “these outrages need not be especially sanguinary” mr vladimir went on as if delivering a scientific lecture “but they must be sufficiently startling—effective  let them be directed against buildings for instance  what is the fetish of the hour that all the bourgeoisie recognise—eh mr verloc”  mr verloc opened his hands and shrugged his shoulders slightly  “you are too lazy to think” was mr vladimir’s comment upon that gesture “pay attention to what i say  the fetish of today is neither royalty nor religion  therefore the palace and the church should be left alone you understand what i mean mr verloc”  the dismay and the scorn of mr verloc found vent in an attempt at levity  “perfectly  but what of the embassies  a series of attacks on the various embassies” he began but he could not withstand the cold watchful stare of the first secretary  “you can be facetious i see” the latter observed carelessly  “that’s all right  it may enliven your oratory at socialistic congresses  but this room is no place for it  it would be infinitely safer for you to follow carefully what i am saying  as you are being called upon to furnish facts instead of cockandbull stories you had better try to make your profit off what i am taking the trouble to explain to you  the sacrosanct fetish of today is science  why don’t you get some of your friends to go for that woodenfaced panjandrum—eh  is it not part of these institutions which must be swept away before the f p comes along”  mr verloc said nothing  he was afraid to open his lips lest a groan should escape him  “this is what you should try for  an attempt upon a crowned head or on a president is sensational enough in a way but not so much as it used to be  it has entered into the general conception of the existence of all chiefs of state  it’s almost conventional—especially since so many presidents have been assassinated  now let us take an outrage upon—say a church  horrible enough at first sight no doubt and yet not so effective as a person of an ordinary mind might think  no matter how revolutionary and anarchist in inception there would be fools enough to give such an outrage the character of a religious manifestation  and that would detract from the especial alarming significance we wish to give to the act  a murderous attempt on a restaurant or a theatre would suffer in the same way from the suggestion of nonpolitical passion the exasperation of a hungry man an act of social revenge  all this is used up it is no longer instructive as an object lesson in revolutionary anarchism  every newspaper has readymade phrases to explain such manifestations away  i am about to give you the philosophy of bomb throwing from my point of view from the point of view you pretend to have been serving for the last eleven years  i will try not to talk above your head  the sensibilities of the class you are attacking are soon blunted  property seems to them an indestructible thing  you can’t count upon their emotions either of pity or fear for very long  a bomb outrage to have any influence on public opinion now must go beyond the intention of vengeance or terrorism  it must be purely destructive  it must be that and only that beyond the faintest suspicion of any other object  you anarchists should make it clear that you are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation  but how to get that appallingly absurd notion into the heads of the middle classes so that there should be no mistake  that’s the question  by directing your blows at something outside the ordinary passions of humanity is the answer  of course there is art  a bomb in the national gallery would make some noise  but it would not be serious enough  art has never been their fetish  it’s like breaking a few back windows in a man’s house whereas if you want to make him really sit up you must try at least to raise the roof  there would be some screaming of course but from whom  artists—art critics and such like—people of no account nobody minds what they say  but there is learning—science  any imbecile that has got an income believes in that  he does not know why but he believes it matters somehow  it is the sacrosanct fetish  all the damned professors are radicals at heart  let them know that their great panjandrum has got to go too to make room for the future of the proletariat  a howl from all these intellectual idiots is bound to help forward the labours of the milan conference  they will be writing to the papers  their indignation would be above suspicion no material interests being openly at stake and it will alarm every selfishness of the class which should be impressed  they believe that in some mysterious way science is at the source of their material prosperity they do  and the absurd ferocity of such a demonstration will affect them more profoundly than the mangling of a whole street—or theatre—full of their own kind  to that last they can always say ‘oh it’s mere class hate’  but what is one to say to an act of destructive ferocity so absurd as to be incomprehensible inexplicable almost unthinkable in fact mad  madness alone is truly terrifying inasmuch as you cannot placate it either by threats persuasion or bribes  moreover i am a civilised man  i would never dream of directing you to organise a mere butchery even if i expected the best results from it  but i wouldn’t expect from a butchery the result i want  murder is always with us  it is almost an institution  the demonstration must be against learning—science  but not every science will do  the attack must have all the shocking senselessness of gratuitous blasphemy  since bombs are your means of expression it would be really telling if one could throw a bomb into pure mathematics  but that is impossible  i have been trying to educate you i have expounded to you the higher philosophy of your usefulness and suggested to you some serviceable arguments  the practical application of my teaching interests you mostly  but from the moment i have undertaken to interview you i have also given some attention to the practical aspect of the question  what do you think of having a go at astronomy”  for sometime already mr verloc’s immobility by the side of the armchair resembled a state of collapsed coma—a sort of passive insensibility interrupted by slight convulsive starts such as may be observed in the domestic dog having a nightmare on the hearthrug  and it was in an uneasy doglike growl that he repeated the word  “astronomy”  he had not recovered thoroughly as yet from that state of bewilderment brought about by the effort to follow mr vladimir’s rapid incisive utterance  it had overcome his power of assimilation  it had made him angry  this anger was complicated by incredulity  and suddenly it dawned upon him that all this was an elaborate joke  mr vladimir exhibited his white teeth in a smile with dimples on his round full face posed with a complacent inclination above the bristling bow of his necktie  the favourite of intelligent society women had assumed his drawingroom attitude accompanying the delivery of delicate witticisms sitting well forward his white hand upraised he seemed to hold delicately between his thumb and forefinger the subtlety of his suggestion  “there could be nothing better  such an outrage combines the greatest possible regard for humanity with the most alarming display of ferocious imbecility  i defy the ingenuity of journalists to persuade their public that any given member of the proletariat can have a personal grievance against astronomy  starvation itself could hardly be dragged in there—eh  and there are other advantages  the whole civilised world has heard of greenwich  the very bootblacks in the basement of charing cross station know something of it  see”  the features of mr vladimir so well known in the best society by their humorous urbanity beamed with cynical selfsatisfaction which would have astonished the intelligent women his wit entertained so exquisitely “yes” he continued with a contemptuous smile “the blowing up of the first meridian is bound to raise a howl of execration”  “a difficult business” mr verloc mumbled feeling that this was the only safe thing to say  “what is the matter  haven’t you the whole gang under your hand  the very pick of the basket  that old terrorist yundt is here  i see him walking about piccadilly in his green havelock almost every day  and michaelis the ticketofleave apostle—you don’t mean to say you don’t know where he is  because if you don’t i can tell you” mr vladimir went on menacingly  “if you imagine that you are the only one on the secret fund list you are mistaken”  this perfectly gratuitous suggestion caused mr verloc to shuffle his feet slightly  “and the whole lausanne lot—eh  haven’t they been flocking over here at the first hint of the milan conference  this is an absurd country”  “it will cost money” mr verloc said by a sort of instinct  “that cock won’t fight” mr vladimir retorted with an amazingly genuine english accent  “you’ll get your screw every month and no more till something happens  and if nothing happens very soon you won’t get even that  what’s your ostensible occupation  what are you supposed to live by”  “i keep a shop” answered mr verloc  “a shop  what sort of shop”  “stationery newspapers  my wife—”  “your what” interrupted mr vladimir in his guttural central asian tones  “my wife”  mr verloc raised his husky voice slightly  “i am married”  “that be damned for a yarn” exclaimed the other in unfeigned astonishment  “married  and you a professed anarchist too  what is this confounded nonsense  but i suppose it’s merely a manner of speaking  anarchists don’t marry  it’s well known  they can’t  it would be apostasy”  “my wife isn’t one” mr verloc mumbled sulkily  “moreover it’s no concern of yours”  “oh yes it is” snapped mr vladimir  “i am beginning to be convinced that you are not at all the man for the work you’ve been employed on why you must have discredited yourself completely in your own world by your marriage  couldn’t you have managed without  this is your virtuous attachment—eh  what with one sort of attachment and another you are doing away with your usefulness”  mr verloc puffing out his cheeks let the air escape violently and that was all  he had armed himself with patience  it was not to be tried much longer  the first secretary became suddenly very curt detached final  “you may go now” he said  “a dynamite outrage must be provoked  i give you a month  the sittings of the conference are suspended  before it reassembles again something must have happened here or your connection with us ceases”  he changed the note once more with an unprincipled versatility  “think over my philosophy mr—mr—verloc” he said with a sort of chaffing condescension waving his hand towards the door  “go for the first meridian  you don’t know the middle classes as well as i do their sensibilities are jaded  the first meridian  nothing better and nothing easier i should think”  he had got up and with his thin sensitive lips twitching humorously watched in the glass over the mantelpiece mr verloc backing out of the room heavily hat and stick in hand  the door closed  the footman in trousers appearing suddenly in the corridor let mr verloc another way out and through a small door in the corner of the courtyard  the porter standing at the gate ignored his exit completely and mr verloc retraced the path of his morning’s pilgrimage as if in a dream—an angry dream  this detachment from the material world was so complete that though the mortal envelope of mr verloc had not hastened unduly along the streets that part of him to which it would be unwarrantably rude to refuse immortality found itself at the shop door all at once as if borne from west to east on the wings of a great wind he walked straight behind the counter and sat down on a wooden chair that stood there  no one appeared to disturb his solitude  stevie put into a green baize apron was now sweeping and dusting upstairs intent and conscientious as though he were playing at it and mrs verloc warned in the kitchen by the clatter of the cracked bell had merely come to the glazed door of the parlour and putting the curtain aside a little had peered into the dim shop  seeing her husband sitting there shadowy and bulky with his hat tilted far back on his head she had at once returned to her stove  an hour or more later she took the green baize apron off her brother stevie and instructed him to wash his hands and face in the peremptory tone she had used in that connection for fifteen years or so—ever since she had in fact ceased to attend to the boy’s hands and face herself  she spared presently a glance away from her dishingup for the inspection of that face and those hands which stevie approaching the kitchen table offered for her approval with an air of selfassurance hiding a perpetual residue of anxiety  formerly the anger of the father was the supremely effective sanction of these rites but mr verloc’s placidity in domestic life would have made all mention of anger incredible even to poor stevie’s nervousness  the theory was that mr verloc would have been inexpressibly pained and shocked by any deficiency of cleanliness at meal times  winnie after the death of her father found considerable consolation in the feeling that she need no longer tremble for poor stevie  she could not bear to see the boy hurt  it maddened her  as a little girl she had often faced with blazing eyes the irascible licensed victualler in defence of her brother  nothing now in mrs verloc’s appearance could lead one to suppose that she was capable of a passionate demonstration  she finished her dishingup  the table was laid in the parlour  going to the foot of the stairs she screamed out “mother”  then opening the glazed door leading to the shop she said quietly “adolf”  mr verloc had not changed his position he had not apparently stirred a limb for an hour and a half  he got up heavily and came to his dinner in his overcoat and with his hat on without uttering a word  his silence in itself had nothing startlingly unusual in this household hidden in the shades of the sordid street seldom touched by the sun behind the dim shop with its wares of disreputable rubbish  only that day mr verloc’s taciturnity was so obviously thoughtful that the two women were impressed by it  they sat silent themselves keeping a watchful eye on poor stevie lest he should break out into one of his fits of loquacity  he faced mr verloc across the table and remained very good and quiet staring vacantly  the endeavour to keep him from making himself objectionable in any way to the master of the house put no inconsiderable anxiety into these two women’s lives  “that boy” as they alluded to him softly between themselves had been a source of that sort of anxiety almost from the very day of his birth  the late licensed victualler’s humiliation at having such a very peculiar boy for a son manifested itself by a propensity to brutal treatment for he was a person of fine sensibilities and his sufferings as a man and a father were perfectly genuine  afterwards stevie had to be kept from making himself a nuisance to the single gentlemen lodgers who are themselves a queer lot and are easily aggrieved  and there was always the anxiety of his mere existence to face  visions of a workhouse infirmary for her child had haunted the old woman in the basement breakfastroom of the decayed belgravian house “if you had not found such a good husband my dear” she used to say to her daughter “i don’t know what would have become of that poor boy”  mr verloc extended as much recognition to stevie as a man not particularly fond of animals may give to his wife’s beloved cat and this recognition benevolent and perfunctory was essentially of the same quality  both women admitted to themselves that not much more could be reasonably expected  it was enough to earn for mr verloc the old woman’s reverential gratitude  in the early days made sceptical by the trials of friendless life she used sometimes to ask anxiously “you don’t think my dear that mr verloc is getting tired of seeing stevie about” to this winnie replied habitually by a slight toss of her head  once however she retorted with a rather grim pertness “he’ll have to get tired of me first”  a long silence ensued  the mother with her feet propped up on a stool seemed to be trying to get to the bottom of that answer whose feminine profundity had struck her all of a heap  she had never really understood why winnie had married mr verloc  it was very sensible of her and evidently had turned out for the best but her girl might have naturally hoped to find somebody of a more suitable age there had been a steady young fellow only son of a butcher in the next street helping his father in business with whom winnie had been walking out with obvious gusto  he was dependent on his father it is true but the business was good and his prospects excellent  he took her girl to the theatre on several evenings  then just as she began to dread to hear of their engagement for what could she have done with that big house alone with stevie on her hands that romance came to an abrupt end and winnie went about looking very dull  but mr verloc turning up providentially to occupy the firstfloor front bedroom there had been no more question of the young butcher  it was clearly providential     chapter iii   “    all idealisation makes life poorer  to beautify it is to take away its character of complexity—it is to destroy it  leave that to the moralists my boy  history is made by men but they do not make it in their heads  the ideas that are born in their consciousness play an insignificant part in the march of events  history is dominated and determined by the tool and the production—by the force of economic conditions  capitalism has made socialism and the laws made by the capitalism for the protection of property are responsible for anarchism no one can tell what form the social organisation may take in the future then why indulge in prophetic phantasies  at best they can only interpret the mind of the prophet and can have no objective value leave that pastime to the moralists my boy”  michaelis the ticketofleave apostle was speaking in an even voice a voice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by the layer of fat on his chest  he had come out of a highly hygienic prison round like a tub with an enormous stomach and distended cheeks of a pale semitransparent complexion as though for fifteen years the servants of an outraged society had made a point of stuffing him with fattening foods in a damp and lightless cellar  and ever since he had never managed to get his weight down as much as an ounce  it was said that for three seasons running a very wealthy old lady had sent him for a cure to marienbad—where he was about to share the public curiosity once with a crowned head—but the police on that occasion ordered him to leave within twelve hours  his martyrdom was continued by forbidding him all access to the healing waters  but he was resigned now  with his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint but more like a bend in a dummy’s limb thrown over the back of a chair he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate  “yes  i had the time to think things out a little” he added without emphasis  “society has given me plenty of time for meditation”  on the other side of the fireplace in the horsehair armchair where mrs verloc’s mother was generally privileged to sit karl yundt giggled grimly with a faint black grimace of a toothless mouth  the terrorist as he called himself was old and bald with a narrow snowwhite wisp of a goatee hanging limply from his chin  an extraordinary expression of underhand malevolence survived in his extinguished eyes  when he rose painfully the thrusting forward of a skinny groping hand deformed by gouty swellings suggested the effort of a moribund murderer summoning all his remaining strength for a last stab  he leaned on a thick stick which trembled under his other hand  “i have always dreamed” he mouthed fiercely “of a band of men absolute in their resolve to discard all scruples in the choice of means strong enough to give themselves frankly the name of destroyers and free from the taint of that resigned pessimism which rots the world  no pity for anything on earth including themselves and death enlisted for good and all in the service of humanity—that’s what i would have liked to see”  his little bald head quivered imparting a comical vibration to the wisp of white goatee  his enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger  his wornout passion resembling in its impotent fierceness the excitement of a senile sensualist was badly served by a dried throat and toothless gums which seemed to catch the tip of his tongue  mr verloc established in the corner of the sofa at the other end of the room emitted two hearty grunts of assent  the old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck from side to side  “and i could never get as many as three such men together  so much for your rotten pessimism” he snarled at michaelis who uncrossed his thick legs similar to bolsters and slid his feet abruptly under his chair in sign of exasperation  he a pessimist  preposterous  he cried out that the charge was outrageous  he was so far from pessimism that he saw already the end of all private property coming along logically unavoidably by the mere development of its inherent viciousness  the possessors of property had not only to face the awakened proletariat but they had also to fight amongst themselves  yes  struggle warfare was the condition of private ownership  it was fatal  ah he did not depend upon emotional excitement to keep up his belief no declamations no anger no visions of bloodred flags waving or metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising above the horizon of a doomed society  not he  cold reason he boasted was the basis of his optimism  yes optimism—  his laborious wheezing stopped then after a gasp or two he added  “don’t you think that if i had not been the optimist i am i could not have found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat  and in the last instance there were always the walls of my cell to dash my head against”  the shortness of breath took all fire all animation out of his voice his great pale cheeks hung like filled pouches motionless without a quiver but in his blue eyes narrowed as if peering there was the same look of confident shrewdness a little crazy in its fixity they must have had while the indomitable optimist sat thinking at night in his cell  before him karl yundt remained standing one wing of his faded greenish havelock thrown back cavalierly over his shoulder  seated in front of the fireplace comrade ossipon exmedical student the principal writer of the f p leaflets stretched out his robust legs keeping the soles of his boots turned up to the glow in the grate  a bush of crinkly yellow hair topped his red freckled face with a flattened nose and prominent mouth cast in the rough mould of the negro type  his almondshaped eyes leered languidly over the high cheekbones he wore a grey flannel shirt the loose ends of a black silk tie hung down the buttoned breast of his serge coat and his head resting on the back of his chair his throat largely exposed he raised to his lips a cigarette in a long wooden tube puffing jets of smoke straight up at the ceiling  michaelis pursued his idea—the idea of his solitary reclusion—the thought vouchsafed to his captivity and growing like a faith revealed in visions  he talked to himself indifferent to the sympathy or hostility of his hearers indifferent indeed to their presence from the habit he had acquired of thinking aloud hopefully in the solitude of the four whitewashed walls of his cell in the sepulchral silence of the great blind pile of bricks near a river sinister and ugly like a colossal mortuary for the socially drowned  he was no good in discussion not because any amount of argument could shake his faith but because the mere fact of hearing another voice disconcerted him painfully confusing his thoughts at once—these thoughts that for so many years in a mental solitude more barren than a waterless desert no living voice had ever combatted commented or approved  no one interrupted him now and he made again the confession of his faith mastering him irresistible and complete like an act of grace the secret of fate discovered in the material side of life the economic condition of the world responsible for the past and shaping the future the source of all history of all ideas guiding the mental development of mankind and the very impulses of their passion—  a harsh laugh from comrade ossipon cut the tirade dead short in a sudden faltering of the tongue and a bewildered unsteadiness of the apostle’s mildly exalted eyes  he closed them slowly for a moment as if to collect his routed thoughts  a silence fell but what with the two gasjets over the table and the glowing grate the little parlour behind mr verloc’s shop had become frightfully hot  mr verloc getting off the sofa with ponderous reluctance opened the door leading into the kitchen to get more air and thus disclosed the innocent stevie seated very good and quiet at a deal table drawing circles circles circles innumerable circles concentric eccentric a coruscating whirl of circles that by their tangled multitude of repeated curves uniformity of form and confusion of intersecting lines suggested a rendering of cosmic chaos the symbolism of a mad art attempting the inconceivable  the artist never turned his head and in all his soul’s application to the task his back quivered his thin neck sunk into a deep hollow at the base of the skull seemed ready to snap  mr verloc after a grunt of disapproving surprise returned to the sofa alexander ossipon got up tall in his threadbare blue serge suit under the low ceiling shook off the stiffness of long immobility and strolled away into the kitchen down two steps to look over stevie’s shoulder he came back pronouncing oracularly “very good  very characteristic perfectly typical”  “what’s very good” grunted inquiringly mr verloc settled again in the corner of the sofa  the other explained his meaning negligently with a shade of condescension and a toss of his head towards the kitchen  “typical of this form of degeneracy—these drawings i mean”  “you would call that lad a degenerate would you” mumbled mr verloc  comrade alexander ossipon—nicknamed the doctor exmedical student without a degree afterwards wandering lecturer to workingmen’s associations upon the socialistic aspects of hygiene author of a popular quasimedical study in the form of a cheap pamphlet seized promptly by the police entitled “the corroding vices of the middle classes” special delegate of the more or less mysterious red committee together with karl yundt and michaelis for the work of literary propaganda—turned upon the obscure familiar of at least two embassies that glance of insufferable hopelessly dense sufficiency which nothing but the frequentation of science can give to the dulness of common mortals  “that’s what he may be called scientifically  very good type too altogether of that sort of degenerate  it’s enough to glance at the lobes of his ears  if you read lombroso—”  mr verloc moody and spread largely on the sofa continued to look down the row of his waistcoat buttons but his cheeks became tinged by a faint blush  of late even the merest derivative of the word science a term in itself inoffensive and of indefinite meaning had the curious power of evoking a definitely offensive mental vision of mr vladimir in his body as he lived with an almost supernatural clearness  and this phenomenon deserving justly to be classed amongst the marvels of science induced in mr verloc an emotional state of dread and exasperation tending to express itself in violent swearing  but he said nothing  it was karl yundt who was heard implacable to his last breath  “lombroso is an ass”  comrade ossipon met the shock of this blasphemy by an awful vacant stare  and the other his extinguished eyes without gleams blackening the deep shadows under the great bony forehead mumbled catching the tip of his tongue between his lips at every second word as though he were chewing it angrily  “did you ever see such an idiot  for him the criminal is the prisoner simple is it not  what about those who shut him up there—forced him in there  exactly  forced him in there  and what is crime  does he know that this imbecile who has made his way in this world of gorged fools by looking at the ears and teeth of a lot of poor luckless devils  teeth and ears mark the criminal  do they  and what about the law that marks him still better—the pretty branding instrument invented by the overfed to protect themselves against the hungry  redhot applications on their vile skins—hey  can’t you smell and hear from here the thick hide of the people burn and sizzle  that’s how criminals are made for your lombrosos to write their silly stuff about”  the knob of his stick and his legs shook together with passion whilst the trunk draped in the wings of the havelock preserved his historic attitude of defiance  he seemed to sniff the tainted air of social cruelty to strain his ear for its atrocious sounds  there was an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing  the all but moribund veteran of dynamite wars had been a great actor in his time—actor on platforms in secret assemblies in private interviews the famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice  he was no man of action he was not even an orator of torrential eloquence sweeping the masses along in the rushing noise and foam of a great enthusiasm  with a more subtle intention he took the part of an insolent and venomous evoker of sinister impulses which lurk in the blind envy and exasperated vanity of ignorance in the suffering and misery of poverty in all the hopeful and noble illusions of righteous anger pity and revolt  the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison emptied now useless ready to be thrown away upon the rubbishheap of things that had served their time  michaelis the ticketofleave apostle smiled vaguely with his glued lips his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of melancholy assent he had been a prisoner himself  his own skin had sizzled under the redhot brand he murmured softly  but comrade ossipon nicknamed the doctor had got over the shock by that time  “you don’t understand” he began disdainfully but stopped short intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards him with a blind stare as if guided only by the sound  he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders  stevie accustomed to move about disregarded had got up from the kitchen table carrying off his drawing to bed with him  he had reached the parlour door in time to receive in full the shock of karl yundt’s eloquent imagery  the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers and he remained staring at the old terrorist as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain stevie knew very well that hot iron applied to one’s skin hurt very much his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly  his mouth dropped open  michaelis by staring unwinkingly at the fire had regained that sentiment of isolation necessary for the continuity of his thought  his optimism had begun to flow from his lips  he saw capitalism doomed in its cradle born with the poison of the principle of competition in its system  the great capitalists devouring the little capitalists concentrating the power and the tools of production in great masses perfecting industrial processes and in the madness of selfaggrandisement only preparing organising enriching making ready the lawful inheritance of the suffering proletariat  michaelis pronounced the great word “patience”—and his clear blue glance raised to the low ceiling of mr verloc’s parlour had a character of seraphic trustfulness  in the doorway stevie calmed seemed sunk in hebetude  comrade ossipon’s face twitched with exasperation  “then it’s no use doing anything—no use whatever”  “i don’t say that” protested michaelis gently  his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time  he continued to look down at the red coals  preparation for the future was necessary and he was willing to admit that the great change would perhaps come in the upheaval of a revolution  but he argued that revolutionary propaganda was a delicate work of high conscience  it was the education of the masters of the world  it should be as careful as the education given to kings  he would have it advance its tenets cautiously even timidly in our ignorance of the effect that may be produced by any given economic change upon the happiness the morals the intellect the history of mankind  for history is made with tools not with ideas and everything is changed by economic conditions—art philosophy love virtue—truth itself  the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash and michaelis the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary got up impetuously  round like a distended balloon he opened his short thick arms as if in a pathetically hopeless attempt to embrace and hug to his breast a selfregenerated universe  he gasped with ardour  “the future is as certain as the past—slavery feudalism individualism collectivism  this is the statement of a law not an empty prophecy”  the disdainful pout of comrade ossipon’s thick lips accentuated the negro type of his face  “nonsense” he said calmly enough  “there is no law and no certainty the teaching propaganda be hanged  what the people knows does not matter were its knowledge ever so accurate  the only thing that matters to us is the emotional state of the masses  without emotion there is no action”  he paused then added with modest firmness  “i am speaking now to you scientifically—scientifically—eh  what did you say verloc”  “nothing” growled from the sofa mr verloc who provoked by the abhorrent sound had merely muttered a “damn”  the venomous spluttering of the old terrorist without teeth was heard  “do you know how i would call the nature of the present economic conditions  i would call it cannibalistic  that’s what it is  they are nourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the people—nothing else”  stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp and at once as though it had been swift poison sank limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door  michaelis gave no sign of having heard anything  his lips seemed glued together for good not a quiver passed over his heavy cheeks  with troubled eyes he looked for his round hard hat and put it on his round head  his round and obese body seemed to float low between the chairs under the sharp elbow of karl yundt  the old terrorist raising an uncertain and clawlike hand gave a swaggering tilt to a black felt sombrero shading the hollows and ridges of his wasted face  he got in motion slowly striking the floor with his stick at every step  it was rather an affair to get him out of the house because now and then he would stop as if to think and did not offer to move again till impelled forward by michaelis  the gentle apostle grasped his arm with brotherly care and behind them his hands in his pockets the robust ossipon yawned vaguely  a blue cap with a patent leather peak set well at the back of his yellow bush of hair gave him the aspect of a norwegian sailor bored with the world after a thundering spree  mr verloc saw his guests off the premises attending them bareheaded his heavy overcoat hanging open his eyes on the ground  he closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence turned the key shot the bolt  he was not satisfied with his friends  in the light of mr vladimir’s philosophy of bomb throwing they appeared hopelessly futile  the part of mr verloc in revolutionary politics having been to observe he could not all at once either in his own home or in larger assemblies take the initiative of action  he had to be cautious  moved by the just indignation of a man well over forty menaced in what is dearest to him—his repose and his security—he asked himself scornfully what else could have been expected from such a lot this karl yundt this michaelis—this ossipon  pausing in his intention to turn off the gas burning in the middle of the shop mr verloc descended into the abyss of moral reflections  with the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict  a lazy lot—this karl yundt nursed by a bleareyed old woman a woman he had years ago enticed away from a friend and afterwards had tried more than once to shake off into the gutter  jolly lucky for yundt that she had persisted in coming up time after time or else there would have been no one now to help him out of the ’bus by the green park railings where that spectre took its constitutional crawl every fine morning  when that indomitable snarling old witch died the swaggering spectre would have to vanish too—there would be an end to fiery karl yundt  and mr verloc’s morality was offended also by the optimism of michaelis annexed by his wealthy old lady who had taken lately to sending him to a cottage she had in the country  the exprisoner could moon about the shady lanes for days together in a delicious and humanitarian idleness  as to ossipon that beggar was sure to want for nothing as long as there were silly girls with savingsbank books in the world  and mr verloc temperamentally identical with his associates drew fine distinctions in his mind on the strength of insignificant differences  he drew them with a certain complacency because the instinct of conventional respectability was strong within him being only overcome by his dislike of all kinds of recognised labour—a temperamental defect which he shared with a large proportion of revolutionary reformers of a given social state  for obviously one does not revolt against the advantages and opportunities of that state but against the price which must be paid for the same in the coin of accepted morality selfrestraint and toil  the majority of revolutionists are the enemies of discipline and fatigue mostly  there are natures too to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous odious oppressive worrying humiliating extortionate intolerable  those are the fanatics  the remaining portion of social rebels is accounted for by vanity the mother of all noble and vile illusions the companion of poets reformers charlatans prophets and incendiaries  lost for a whole minute in the abyss of meditation mr verloc did not reach the depth of these abstract considerations  perhaps he was not able  in any case he had not the time  he was pulled up painfully by the sudden recollection of mr vladimir another of his associates whom in virtue of subtle moral affinities he was capable of judging correctly he considered him as dangerous  a shade of envy crept into his thoughts loafing was all very well for these fellows who knew not mr vladimir and had women to fall back upon whereas he had a woman to provide for—  at this point by a simple association of ideas mr verloc was brought face to face with the necessity of going to bed some time or other that evening  then why not go now—at once  he sighed  the necessity was not so normally pleasurable as it ought to have been for a man of his age and temperament  he dreaded the demon of sleeplessness which he felt had marked him for its own  he raised his arm and turned off the flaring gasjet above his head  a bright band of light fell through the parlour door into the part of the shop behind the counter  it enabled mr verloc to ascertain at a glance the number of silver coins in the till  these were but few and for the first time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value  this survey was unfavourable  he had gone into trade for no commercial reasons  he had been guided in the selection of this peculiar line of business by an instinctive leaning towards shady transactions where money is picked up easily  moreover it did not take him out of his own sphere—the sphere which is watched by the police  on the contrary it gave him a publicly confessed standing in that sphere and as mr verloc had unconfessed relations which made him familiar with yet careless of the police there was a distinct advantage in such a situation  but as a means of livelihood it was by itself insufficient  he took the cashbox out of the drawer and turning to leave the shop became aware that stevie was still downstairs  what on earth is he doing there  mr verloc asked himself  what’s the meaning of these antics  he looked dubiously at his brotherinlaw but he did not ask him for information  mr verloc’s intercourse with stevie was limited to the casual mutter of a morning after breakfast “my boots” and even that was more a communication at large of a need than a direct order or request  mr verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie  he stood still in the middle of the parlour and looked into the kitchen in silence  nor yet did he know what would happen if he did say anything  and this appeared very queer to mr verloc in view of the fact borne upon him suddenly that he had to provide for this fellow too  he had never given a moment’s thought till then to that aspect of stevie’s existence  positively he did not know how to speak to the lad  he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen  stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a cage  a tentative “hadn’t you better go to bed now” produced no effect whatever and mr verloc abandoning the stony contemplation of his brotherinlaw’s behaviour crossed the parlour wearily cashbox in hand  the cause of the general lassitude he felt while climbing the stairs being purely mental he became alarmed by its inexplicable character  he hoped he was not sickening for anything he stopped on the dark landing to examine his sensations  but a slight and continuous sound of snoring pervading the obscurity interfered with their clearness  the sound came from his motherinlaw’s room  another one to provide for he thought—and on this thought walked into the bedroom  mrs verloc had fallen asleep with the lamp no gas was laid upstairs turned up full on the table by the side of the bed  the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plaits for the night  she woke up with the sound of her name in her ears and saw her husband standing over her  “winnie  winnie”  at first she did not stir lying very quiet and looking at the cashbox in mr verloc’s hand  but when she understood that her brother was “capering all over the place downstairs” she swung out in one sudden movement on to the edge of the bed  her bare feet as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck and wrists felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husband’s face  “i don’t know how to manage him” mr verloc explained peevishly  “won’t do to leave him downstairs alone with the lights”  she said nothing glided across the room swiftly and the door closed upon her white form  mr verloc deposited the cashbox on the night table and began the operation of undressing by flinging his overcoat on to a distant chair his coat and waistcoat followed  he walked about the room in his stockinged feet and his burly figure with the hands worrying nervously at his throat passed and repassed across the long strip of lookingglass in the door of his wife’s wardrobe  then after slipping his braces off his shoulders he pulled up violently the venetian blind and leaned his forehead against the cold windowpane—a fragile film of glass stretched between him and the enormity of cold black wet muddy inhospitable accumulation of bricks slates and stones things in themselves unlovely and unfriendly to man  mr verloc felt the latent unfriendliness of all out of doors with a force approaching to positive bodily anguish  there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police  it’s like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain  the comparison occurred to mr verloc because he had sat astride various army horses in his time and had now the sensation of an incipient fall  the prospect was as black as the windowpane against which he was leaning his forehead  and suddenly the face of mr vladimir cleanshaved and witty appeared enhaloed in the glow of its rosy complexion like a sort of pink seal impressed on the fatal darkness  this luminous and mutilated vision was so ghastly physically that mr verloc started away from the window letting down the venetian blind with a great rattle  discomposed and speechless with the apprehension of more such visions he beheld his wife reenter the room and get into bed in a calm businesslike manner which made him feel hopelessly lonely in the world  mrs verloc expressed her surprise at seeing him up yet  “i don’t feel very well” he muttered passing his hands over his moist brow  “giddiness”  “yes  not at all well”  mrs verloc with all the placidity of an experienced wife expressed a confident opinion as to the cause and suggested the usual remedies but her husband rooted in the middle of the room shook his lowered head sadly  “you’ll catch cold standing there” she observed  mr verloc made an effort finished undressing and got into bed  down below in the quiet narrow street measured footsteps approached the house then died away unhurried and firm as if the passerby had started to pace out all eternity from gaslamp to gaslamp in a night without end and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom  mrs verloc on her back and staring at the ceiling made a remark  “takings very small today”  mr verloc in the same position cleared his throat as if for an important statement but merely inquired  “did you turn off the gas downstairs”  “yes i did” answered mrs verloc conscientiously  “that poor boy is in a very excited state tonight” she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock  mr verloc cared nothing for stevie’s excitement but he felt horribly wakeful and dreaded facing the darkness and silence that would follow the extinguishing of the lamp  this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed  mrs verloc falling into the trap started to demonstrate at length to her husband that this was not “impudence” of any sort but simply “excitement” there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head  mrs verloc turning towards her recumbent husband raised herself on her elbow and hung over him in her anxiety that he should believe stevie to be a useful member of the family  that ardour of protecting compassion exalted morbidly in her childhood by the misery of another child tinged her sallow cheeks with a faint dusky blush made her big eyes gleam under the dark lids  mrs verloc then looked younger she looked as young as winnie used to look and much more animated than the winnie of the belgravian mansion days had ever allowed herself to appear to gentlemen lodgers  mr verloc’s anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying  it was as if her voice were talking on the other side of a very thick wall  it was her aspect that recalled him to himself  he appreciated this woman and the sentiment of this appreciation stirred by a display of something resembling emotion only added another pang to his mental anguish  when her voice ceased he moved uneasily and said  “i haven’t been feeling well for the last few days”  he might have meant this as an opening to a complete confidence but mrs verloc laid her head on the pillow again and staring upward went on  “that boy hears too much of what is talked about here  if i had known they were coming tonight i would have seen to it that he went to bed at the same time i did  he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating people’s flesh and drinking blood  what’s the good of talking like that”  there was a note of indignant scorn in her voice  mr verloc was fully responsive now  “ask karl yundt” he growled savagely  mrs verloc with great decision pronounced karl yundt “a disgusting old man”  she declared openly her affection for michaelis  of the robust ossipon in whose presence she always felt uneasy behind an attitude of stony reserve she said nothing whatever  and continuing to talk of that brother who had been for so many years an object of care and fears  “he isn’t fit to hear what’s said here  he believes it’s all true  he knows no better  he gets into his passions over it”  mr verloc made no comment  “he glared at me as if he didn’t know who i was when i went downstairs his heart was going like a hammer  he can’t help being excitable  i woke mother up and asked her to sit with him till he went to sleep  it isn’t his fault  he’s no trouble when he’s left alone”  mr verloc made no comment  “i wish he had never been to school” mrs verloc began again brusquely “he’s always taking away those newspapers from the window to read  he gets a red face poring over them  we don’t get rid of a dozen numbers in a month  they only take up room in the front window  and mr ossipon brings every week a pile of these f p tracts to sell at a halfpenny each  i wouldn’t give a halfpenny for the whole lot  it’s silly reading—that’s what it is  there’s no sale for it  the other day stevie got hold of one and there was a story in it of a german soldier officer tearing halfoff the ear of a recruit and nothing was done to him for it  the brute  i couldn’t do anything with stevie that afternoon  the story was enough too to make one’s blood boil  but what’s the use of printing things like that  we aren’t german slaves here thank god it’s not our business—is it”  mr verloc made no reply  “i had to take the carving knife from the boy” mrs verloc continued a little sleepily now  “he was shouting and stamping and sobbing  he can’t stand the notion of any cruelty  he would have stuck that officer like a pig if he had seen him then  it’s true too  some people don’t deserve much mercy”  mrs verloc’s voice ceased and the expression of her motionless eyes became more and more contemplative and veiled during the long pause  “comfortable dear” she asked in a faint faraway voice  “shall i put out the light now”  the dreary conviction that there was no sleep for him held mr verloc mute and hopelessly inert in his fear of darkness  he made a great effort  “yes  put it out” he said at last in a hollow tone     chapter iv   most of the thirty or so little tables covered by red cloths with a white design stood ranged at right angles to the deep brown wainscoting of the underground hall  bronze chandeliers with many globes depended from the low slightly vaulted ceiling and the fresco paintings ran flat and dull all round the walls without windows representing scenes of the chase and of outdoor revelry in mediæval costumes  varlets in green jerkins brandished hunting knives and raised on high tankards of foaming beer  “unless i am very much mistaken you are the man who would know the inside of this confounded affair” said the robust ossipon leaning over his elbows far out on the table and his feet tucked back completely under his chair  his eyes stared with wild eagerness  an upright semigrand piano near the door flanked by two palms in pots executed suddenly all by itself a valse tune with aggressive virtuosity the din it raised was deafening  when it ceased as abruptly as it had started the bespectacled dingy little man who faced ossipon behind a heavy glass mug full of beer emitted calmly what had the sound of a general proposition  “in principle what one of us may or may not know as to any given fact can’t be a matter for inquiry to the others”  “certainly not” comrade ossipon agreed in a quiet undertone  “in principle”  with his big florid face held between his hands he continued to stare hard while the dingy little man in spectacles coolly took a drink of beer and stood the glass mug back on the table  his flat large ears departed widely from the sides of his skull which looked frail enough for ossipon to crush between thumb and forefinger the dome of the forehead seemed to rest on the rim of the spectacles the flat cheeks of a greasy unhealthy complexion were merely smudged by the miserable poverty of a thin dark whisker  the lamentable inferiority of the whole physique was made ludicrous by the supremely selfconfident bearing of the individual  his speech was curt and he had a particularly impressive manner of keeping silent  ossipon spoke again from between his hands in a mutter  “have you been out much today”  “no  i stayed in bed all the morning” answered the other  “why”  “oh  nothing” said ossipon gazing earnestly and quivering inwardly with the desire to find out something but obviously intimidated by the little man’s overwhelming air of unconcern  when talking with this comrade—which happened but rarely—the big ossipon suffered from a sense of moral and even physical insignificance  however he ventured another question  “did you walk down here”  “no omnibus” the little man answered readily enough  he lived far away in islington in a small house down a shabby street littered with straw and dirty paper where out of school hours a troop of assorted children ran and squabbled with a shrill joyless rowdy clamour  his single back room remarkable for having an extremely large cupboard he rented furnished from two elderly spinsters dressmakers in a humble way with a clientele of servant girls mostly  he had a heavy padlock put on the cupboard but otherwise he was a model lodger giving no trouble and requiring practically no attendance  his oddities were that he insisted on being present when his room was being swept and that when he went out he locked his door and took the key away with him  ossipon had a vision of these round blackrimmed spectacles progressing along the streets on the top of an omnibus their selfconfident glitter falling here and there on the walls of houses or lowered upon the heads of the unconscious stream of people on the pavements  the ghost of a sickly smile altered the set of ossipon’s thick lips at the thought of the walls nodding of people running for life at the sight of those spectacles  if they had only known  what a panic  he murmured interrogatively “been sitting long here”  “an hour or more” answered the other negligently and took a pull at the dark beer  all his movements—the way he grasped the mug the act of drinking the way he set the heavy glass down and folded his arms—had a firmness an assured precision which made the big and muscular ossipon leaning forward with staring eyes and protruding lips look the picture of eager indecision  “an hour” he said  “then it may be you haven’t heard yet the news i’ve heard just now—in the street  have you”  the little man shook his head negatively the least bit  but as he gave no indication of curiosity ossipon ventured to add that he had heard it just outside the place  a newspaper boy had yelled the thing under his very nose and not being prepared for anything of that sort he was very much startled and upset  he had to come in there with a dry mouth  “i never thought of finding you here” he added murmuring steadily with his elbows planted on the table  “i come here sometimes” said the other preserving his provoking coolness of demeanour  “it’s wonderful that you of all people should have heard nothing of it” the big ossipon continued  his eyelids snapped nervously upon the shining eyes  “you of all people” he repeated tentatively  this obvious restraint argued an incredible and inexplicable timidity of the big fellow before the calm little man who again lifted the glass mug drank and put it down with brusque and assured movements  and that was all  ossipon after waiting for something word or sign that did not come made an effort to assume a sort of indifference  “do you” he said deadening his voice still more “give your stuff to anybody who’s up to asking you for it”  “my absolute rule is never to refuse anybody—as long as i have a pinch by me” answered the little man with decision  “that’s a principle” commented ossipon  “it’s a principle”  “and you think it’s sound”  the large round spectacles which gave a look of staring selfconfidence to the sallow face confronted ossipon like sleepless unwinking orbs flashing a cold fire  “perfectly  always  under every circumstance  what could stop me  why should i not  why should i think twice about it”  ossipon gasped as it were discreetly  “do you mean to say you would hand it over to a ‘teck’ if one came to ask you for your wares”  the other smiled faintly  “let them come and try it on and you will see” he said  “they know me but i know also every one of them  they won’t come near me—not they”  his thin livid lips snapped together firmly  ossipon began to argue  “but they could send someone—rig a plant on you  don’t you see  get the stuff from you in that way and then arrest you with the proof in their hands”  “proof of what  dealing in explosives without a licence perhaps”  this was meant for a contemptuous jeer though the expression of the thin sickly face remained unchanged and the utterance was negligent  “i don’t think there’s one of them anxious to make that arrest  i don’t think they could get one of them to apply for a warrant  i mean one of the best  not one”  “why” ossipon asked  “because they know very well i take care never to part with the last handful of my wares  i’ve it always by me”  he touched the breast of his coat lightly  “in a thick glass flask” he added  “so i have been told” said ossipon with a shade of wonder in his voice “but i didn’t know if—”  “they know” interrupted the little man crisply leaning against the straight chair back which rose higher than his fragile head  “i shall never be arrested  the game isn’t good enough for any policeman of them all  to deal with a man like me you require sheer naked inglorious heroism”  again his lips closed with a selfconfident snap  ossipon repressed a movement of impatience  “or recklessness—or simply ignorance” he retorted  “they’ve only to get somebody for the job who does not know you carry enough stuff in your pocket to blow yourself and everything within sixty yards of you to pieces”  “i never affirmed i could not be eliminated” rejoined the other  “but that wouldn’t be an arrest  moreover it’s not so easy as it looks”  “bah” ossipon contradicted  “don’t be too sure of that  what’s to prevent halfadozen of them jumping upon you from behind in the street with your arms pinned to your sides you could do nothing—could you”  “yes i could  i am seldom out in the streets after dark” said the little man impassively “and never very late  i walk always with my right hand closed round the indiarubber ball which i have in my trouser pocket  the pressing of this ball actuates a detonator inside the flask i carry in my pocket  it’s the principle of the pneumatic instantaneous shutter for a camera lens  the tube leads up—”  with a swift disclosing gesture he gave ossipon a glimpse of an indiarubber tube resembling a slender brown worm issuing from the armhole of his waistcoat and plunging into the inner breast pocket of his jacket  his clothes of a nondescript brown mixture were threadbare and marked with stains dusty in the folds with ragged buttonholes  “the detonator is partly mechanical partly chemical” he explained with casual condescension  “it is instantaneous of course” murmured ossipon with a slight shudder  “far from it” confessed the other with a reluctance which seemed to twist his mouth dolorously  “a full twenty seconds must elapse from the moment i press the ball till the explosion takes place”  “phew” whistled ossipon completely appalled  “twenty seconds horrors  you mean to say that you could face that  i should go crazy—”  “wouldn’t matter if you did  of course it’s the weak point of this special system which is only for my own use  the worst is that the manner of exploding is always the weak point with us  i am trying to invent a detonator that would adjust itself to all conditions of action and even to unexpected changes of conditions  a variable and yet perfectly precise mechanism  a really intelligent detonator”  “twenty seconds” muttered ossipon again  “ough  and then—”  with a slight turn of the head the glitter of the spectacles seemed to gauge the size of the beer saloon in the basement of the renowned silenus restaurant  “nobody in this room could hope to escape” was the verdict of that survey  “nor yet this couple going up the stairs now”  the piano at the foot of the staircase clanged through a mazurka with brazen impetuosity as though a vulgar and impudent ghost were showing off  the keys sank and rose mysteriously  then all became still  for a moment ossipon imagined the overlighted place changed into a dreadful black hole belching horrible fumes choked with ghastly rubbish of smashed brickwork and mutilated corpses  he had such a distinct perception of ruin and death that he shuddered again  the other observed with an air of calm sufficiency  “in the last instance it is character alone that makes for one’s safety there are very few people in the world whose character is as well established as mine”  “i wonder how you managed it” growled ossipon  “force of personality” said the other without raising his voice and coming from the mouth of that obviously miserable organism the assertion caused the robust ossipon to bite his lower lip  “force of personality” he repeated with ostentatious calm  “i have the means to make myself deadly but that by itself you understand is absolutely nothing in the way of protection  what is effective is the belief those people have in my will to use the means  that’s their impression  it is absolute therefore i am deadly”  “there are individuals of character amongst that lot too” muttered ossipon ominously  “possibly  but it is a matter of degree obviously since for instance i am not impressed by them  therefore they are inferior  they cannot be otherwise  their character is built upon conventional morality  it leans on the social order  mine stands free from everything artificial they are bound in all sorts of conventions  they depend on life which in this connection is a historical fact surrounded by all sorts of restraints and considerations a complex organised fact open to attack at every point whereas i depend on death which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked  my superiority is evident”  “this is a transcendental way of putting it” said ossipon watching the cold glitter of the round spectacles  “i’ve heard karl yundt say much the same thing not very long ago”  “karl yundt” mumbled the other contemptuously “the delegate of the international red committee has been a posturing shadow all his life there are three of you delegates aren’t there  i won’t define the other two as you are one of them  but what you say means nothing  you are the worthy delegates for revolutionary propaganda but the trouble is not only that you are as unable to think independently as any respectable grocer or journalist of them all but that you have no character whatever”  ossipon could not restrain a start of indignation  “but what do you want from us” he exclaimed in a deadened voice  “what is it you are after yourself”  “a perfect detonator” was the peremptory answer  “what are you making that face for  you see you can’t even bear the mention of something conclusive”  “i am not making a face” growled the annoyed ossipon bearishly  “you revolutionists” the other continued with leisurely selfconfidence “are the slaves of the social convention which is afraid of you slaves of it as much as the very police that stands up in the defence of that convention  clearly you are since you want to revolutionise it  it governs your thought of course and your action too and thus neither your thought nor your action can ever be conclusive”  he paused tranquil with that air of close endless silence then almost immediately went on  “you are not a bit better than the forces arrayed against you—than the police for instance  the other day i came suddenly upon chief inspector heat at the corner of tottenham court road  he looked at me very steadily  but i did not look at him why should i give him more than a glance  he was thinking of many things—of his superiors of his reputation of the law courts of his salary of newspapers—of a hundred things  but i was thinking of my perfect detonator only  he meant nothing to me  he was as insignificant as—i can’t call to mind anything insignificant enough to compare him with—except karl yundt perhaps  like to like  the terrorist and the policeman both come from the same basket  revolution legality—counter moves in the same game forms of idleness at bottom identical  he plays his little game—so do you propagandists  but i don’t play i work fourteen hours a day and go hungry sometimes  my experiments cost money now and again and then i must do without food for a day or two  you’re looking at my beer  yes  i have had two glasses already and shall have another presently  this is a little holiday and i celebrate it alone why not  i’ve the grit to work alone quite alone absolutely alone i’ve worked alone for years”  ossipon’s face had turned dusky red  “at the perfect detonator—eh” he sneered very low  “yes” retorted the other  “it is a good definition  you couldn’t find anything half so precise to define the nature of your activity with all your committees and delegations  it is i who am the true propagandist”  “we won’t discuss that point” said ossipon with an air of rising above personal considerations  “i am afraid i’ll have to spoil your holiday for you though  there’s a man blown up in greenwich park this morning”  “how do you know”  “they have been yelling the news in the streets since two o’clock  i bought the paper and just ran in here  then i saw you sitting at this table  i’ve got it in my pocket now”  he pulled the newspaper out  it was a goodsized rosy sheet as if flushed by the warmth of its own convictions which were optimistic  he scanned the pages rapidly  “ah  here it is  bomb in greenwich park  there isn’t much so far halfpast eleven  foggy morning  effects of explosion felt as far as romney road and park place  enormous hole in the ground under a tree filled with smashed roots and broken branches  all round fragments of a man’s body blown to pieces  that’s all  the rest’s mere newspaper gup no doubt a wicked attempt to blow up the observatory they say  h’m that’s hardly credible”  he looked at the paper for a while longer in silence then passed it to the other who after gazing abstractedly at the print laid it down without comment  it was ossipon who spoke first—still resentful  “the fragments of only one man you note  ergo blew himself up that spoils your day off for you—don’t it  were you expecting that sort of move  i hadn’t the slightest idea—not the ghost of a notion of anything of the sort being planned to come off here—in this country under the present circumstances it’s nothing short of criminal”  the little man lifted his thin black eyebrows with dispassionate scorn  “criminal  what is that  what is crime  what can be the meaning of such an assertion”  “how am i to express myself  one must use the current words” said ossipon impatiently  “the meaning of this assertion is that this business may affect our position very adversely in this country  isn’t that crime enough for you  i am convinced you have been giving away some of your stuff lately”  ossipon stared hard  the other without flinching lowered and raised his head slowly  “you have” burst out the editor of the f p leaflets in an intense whisper  “no  and are you really handing it over at large like this for the asking to the first fool that comes along”  “just so  the condemned social order has not been built up on paper and ink and i don’t fancy that a combination of paper and ink will ever put an end to it whatever you may think  yes i would give the stuff with both hands to every man woman or fool that likes to come along  i know what you are thinking about  but i am not taking my cue from the red committee  i would see you all hounded out of here or arrested—or beheaded for that matter—without turning a hair  what happens to us as individuals is not of the least consequence”  he spoke carelessly without heat almost without feeling and ossipon secretly much affected tried to copy this detachment  “if the police here knew their business they would shoot you full of holes with revolvers or else try to sandbag you from behind in broad daylight”  the little man seemed already to have considered that point of view in his dispassionate selfconfident manner  “yes” he assented with the utmost readiness  “but for that they would have to face their own institutions  do you see  that requires uncommon grit  grit of a special kind”  ossipon blinked  “i fancy that’s exactly what would happen to you if you were to set up your laboratory in the states  they don’t stand on ceremony with their institutions there”  “i am not likely to go and see  otherwise your remark is just” admitted the other  “they have more character over there and their character is essentially anarchistic  fertile ground for us the states—very good ground  the great republic has the root of the destructive matter in her  the collective temperament is lawless  excellent  they may shoot us down but—”  “you are too transcendental for me” growled ossipon with moody concern  “logical” protested the other  “there are several kinds of logic  this is the enlightened kind  america is all right  it is this country that is dangerous with her idealistic conception of legality  the social spirit of this people is wrapped up in scrupulous prejudices and that is fatal to our work  you talk of england being our only refuge  so much the worse  capua  what do we want with refuges  here you talk print plot and do nothing  i daresay it’s very convenient for such karl yundts”  he shrugged his shoulders slightly then added with the same leisurely assurance “to break up the superstition and worship of legality should be our aim  nothing would please me more than to see inspector heat and his likes take to shooting us down in broad daylight with the approval of the public  half our battle would be won then the disintegration of the old morality would have set in in its very temple  that is what you ought to aim at  but you revolutionists will never understand that  you plan the future you lose yourselves in reveries of economical systems derived from what is whereas what’s wanted is a clean sweep and a clear start for a new conception of life  that sort of future will take care of itself if you will only make room for it  therefore i would shovel my stuff in heaps at the corners of the streets if i had enough for that and as i haven’t i do my best by perfecting a really dependable detonator”  ossipon who had been mentally swimming in deep waters seized upon the last word as if it were a saving plank  “yes  your detonators  i shouldn’t wonder if it weren’t one of your detonators that made a clean sweep of the man in the park”  a shade of vexation darkened the determined sallow face confronting ossipon  “my difficulty consists precisely in experimenting practically with the various kinds  they must be tried after all  besides—”  ossipon interrupted  “who could that fellow be  i assure you that we in london had no knowledge—couldn’t you describe the person you gave the stuff to”  the other turned his spectacles upon ossipon like a pair of searchlights  “describe him” he repeated slowly  “i don’t think there can be the slightest objection now  i will describe him to you in one word—verloc”  ossipon whom curiosity had lifted a few inches off his seat dropped back as if hit in the face  “verloc  impossible”  the selfpossessed little man nodded slightly once  “yes  he’s the person  you can’t say that in this case i was giving my stuff to the first fool that came along  he was a prominent member of the group as far as i understand”  “yes” said ossipon  “prominent  no not exactly  he was the centre for general intelligence and usually received comrades coming over here more useful than important  man of no ideas  years ago he used to speak at meetings—in france i believe  not very well though  he was trusted by such men as latorre moser and all that old lot  the only talent he showed really was his ability to elude the attentions of the police somehow  here for instance he did not seem to be looked after very closely  he was regularly married you know  i suppose it’s with her money that he started that shop  seemed to make it pay too”  ossipon paused abruptly muttered to himself “i wonder what that woman will do now” and fell into thought  the other waited with ostentatious indifference  his parentage was obscure and he was generally known only by his nickname of professor his title to that designation consisted in his having been once assistant demonstrator in chemistry at some technical institute  he quarrelled with the authorities upon a question of unfair treatment  afterwards he obtained a post in the laboratory of a manufactory of dyes  there too he had been treated with revolting injustice  his struggles his privations his hard work to raise himself in the social scale had filled him with such an exalted conviction of his merits that it was extremely difficult for the world to treat him with justice—the standard of that notion depending so much upon the patience of the individual the professor had genius but lacked the great social virtue of resignation  “intellectually a nonentity” ossipon pronounced aloud abandoning suddenly the inward contemplation of mrs verloc’s bereaved person and business  “quite an ordinary personality  you are wrong in not keeping more in touch with the comrades professor” he added in a reproving tone  “did he say anything to you—give you some idea of his intentions i hadn’t seen him for a month  it seems impossible that he should be gone”  “he told me it was going to be a demonstration against a building” said the professor  “i had to know that much to prepare the missile  i pointed out to him that i had hardly a sufficient quantity for a completely destructive result but he pressed me very earnestly to do my best  as he wanted something that could be carried openly in the hand i proposed to make use of an old onegallon copal varnish can i happened to have by me  he was pleased at the idea  it gave me some trouble because i had to cut out the bottom first and solder it on again afterwards  when prepared for use the can enclosed a widemouthed wellcorked jar of thick glass packed around with some wet clay and containing sixteen ounces of x2 green powder  the detonator was connected with the screw top of the can  it was ingenious—a combination of time and shock  i explained the system to him  it was a thin tube of tin enclosing a—”  ossipon’s attention had wandered  “what do you think has happened” he interrupted  “can’t tell  screwed the top on tight which would make the connection and then forgot the time  it was set for twenty minutes  on the other hand the time contact being made a sharp shock would bring about the explosion at once  he either ran the time too close or simply let the thing fall  the contact was made all right—that’s clear to me at any rate  the system’s worked perfectly  and yet you would think that a common fool in a hurry would be much more likely to forget to make the contact altogether  i was worrying myself about that sort of failure mostly  but there are more kinds of fools than one can guard against you can’t expect a detonator to be absolutely foolproof”  he beckoned to a waiter  ossipon sat rigid with the abstracted gaze of mental travail  after the man had gone away with the money he roused himself with an air of profound dissatisfaction  “it’s extremely unpleasant for me” he mused  “karl has been in bed with bronchitis for a week  there’s an even chance that he will never get up again  michaelis’s luxuriating in the country somewhere  a fashionable publisher has offered him five hundred pounds for a book  it will be a ghastly failure  he has lost the habit of consecutive thinking in prison you know”  the professor on his feet now buttoning his coat looked about him with perfect indifference  “what are you going to do” asked ossipon wearily  he dreaded the blame of the central red committee a body which had no permanent place of abode and of whose membership he was not exactly informed  if this affair eventuated in the stoppage of the modest subsidy allotted to the publication of the f p pamphlets then indeed he would have to regret verloc’s inexplicable folly  “solidarity with the extremest form of action is one thing and silly recklessness is another” he said with a sort of moody brutality  “i don’t know what came to verloc  there’s some mystery there  however he’s gone  you may take it as you like but under the circumstances the only policy for the militant revolutionary group is to disclaim all connection with this damned freak of yours  how to make the disclaimer convincing enough is what bothers me”  the little man on his feet buttoned up and ready to go was no taller than the seated ossipon  he levelled his spectacles at the latter’s face pointblank  “you might ask the police for a testimonial of good conduct  they know where every one of you slept last night  perhaps if you asked them they would consent to publish some sort of official statement”  “no doubt they are aware well enough that we had nothing to do with this” mumbled ossipon bitterly  “what they will say is another thing” he remained thoughtful disregarding the short owlish shabby figure standing by his side  “i must lay hands on michaelis at once and get him to speak from his heart at one of our gatherings  the public has a sort of sentimental regard for that fellow  his name is known  and i am in touch with a few reporters on the big dailies  what he would say would be utter bosh but he has a turn of talk that makes it go down all the same”  “like treacle” interjected the professor rather low keeping an impassive expression  the perplexed ossipon went on communing with himself half audibly after the manner of a man reflecting in perfect solitude  “confounded ass  to leave such an imbecile business on my hands  and i don’t even know if—”  he sat with compressed lips  the idea of going for news straight to the shop lacked charm  his notion was that verloc’s shop might have been turned already into a police trap  they will be bound to make some arrests he thought with something resembling virtuous indignation for the even tenor of his revolutionary life was menaced by no fault of his and yet unless he went there he ran the risk of remaining in ignorance of what perhaps it would be very material for him to know  then he reflected that if the man in the park had been so very much blown to pieces as the evening papers said he could not have been identified and if so the police could have no special reason for watching verloc’s shop more closely than any other place known to be frequented by marked anarchists—no more reason in fact than for watching the doors of the silenus  there would be a lot of watching all round no matter where he went  still—  “i wonder what i had better do now” he muttered taking counsel with himself  a rasping voice at his elbow said with sedate scorn  “fasten yourself upon the woman for all she’s worth”  after uttering these words the professor walked away from the table ossipon whom that piece of insight had taken unawares gave one ineffectual start and remained still with a helpless gaze as though nailed fast to the seat of his chair  the lonely piano without as much as a music stool to help it struck a few chords courageously and beginning a selection of national airs played him out at last to the tune of “blue bells of scotland”  the painfully detached notes grew faint behind his back while he went slowly upstairs across the hall and into the street  in front of the great doorway a dismal row of newspaper sellers standing clear of the pavement dealt out their wares from the gutter  it was a raw gloomy day of the early spring and the grimy sky the mud of the streets the rags of the dirty men harmonised excellently with the eruption of the damp rubbishy sheets of paper soiled with printers’ ink the posters maculated with filth garnished like tapestry the sweep of the curbstone  the trade in afternoon papers was brisk yet in comparison with the swift constant march of foot traffic the effect was of indifference of a disregarded distribution  ossipon looked hurriedly both ways before stepping out into the crosscurrents but the professor was already out of sight     chapter v   the professor had turned into a street to the left and walked along with his head carried rigidly erect in a crowd whose every individual almost overtopped his stunted stature  it was vain to pretend to himself that he was not disappointed  but that was mere feeling the stoicism of his thought could not be disturbed by this or any other failure  next time or the time after next a telling stroke would be delivered—something really startling—a blow fit to open the first crack in the imposing front of the great edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice of society  of humble origin and with an appearance really so mean as to stand in the way of his considerable natural abilities his imagination had been fired early by the tales of men rising from the depths of poverty to positions of authority and affluence  the extreme almost ascetic purity of his thought combined with an astounding ignorance of worldly conditions had set before him a goal of power and prestige to be attained without the medium of arts graces tact wealth—by sheer weight of merit alone  on that view he considered himself entitled to undisputed success  his father a delicate dark enthusiast with a sloping forehead had been an itinerant and rousing preacher of some obscure but rigid christian sect—a man supremely confident in the privileges of his righteousness  in the son individualist by temperament once the science of colleges had replaced thoroughly the faith of conventicles this moral attitude translated itself into a frenzied puritanism of ambition  he nursed it as something secularly holy  to see it thwarted opened his eyes to the true nature of the world whose morality was artificial corrupt and blasphemous  the way of even the most justifiable revolutions is prepared by personal impulses disguised into creeds  the professor’s indignation found in itself a final cause that absolved him from the sin of turning to destruction as the agent of his ambition  to destroy public faith in legality was the imperfect formula of his pedantic fanaticism but the subconscious conviction that the framework of an established social order cannot be effectually shattered except by some form of collective or individual violence was precise and correct  he was a moral agent—that was settled in his mind  by exercising his agency with ruthless defiance he procured for himself the appearances of power and personal prestige  that was undeniable to his vengeful bitterness it pacified its unrest and in their own way the most ardent of revolutionaries are perhaps doing no more but seeking for peace in common with the rest of mankind—the peace of soothed vanity of satisfied appetites or perhaps of appeased conscience  lost in the crowd miserable and undersized he meditated confidently on his power keeping his hand in the left pocket of his trousers grasping lightly the indiarubber ball the supreme guarantee of his sinister freedom but after a while he became disagreeably affected by the sight of the roadway thronged with vehicles and of the pavement crowded with men and women  he was in a long straight street peopled by a mere fraction of an immense multitude but all round him on and on even to the limits of the horizon hidden by the enormous piles of bricks he felt the mass of mankind mighty in its numbers  they swarmed numerous like locusts industrious like ants thoughtless like a natural force pushing on blind and orderly and absorbed impervious to sentiment to logic to terror too perhaps  that was the form of doubt he feared most  impervious to fear  often while walking abroad when he happened also to come out of himself he had such moments of dreadful and sane mistrust of mankind  what if nothing could move them  such moments come to all men whose ambition aims at a direct grasp upon humanity—to artists politicians thinkers reformers or saints  a despicable emotional state this against which solitude fortifies a superior character and with severe exultation the professor thought of the refuge of his room with its padlocked cupboard lost in a wilderness of poor houses the hermitage of the perfect anarchist  in order to reach sooner the point where he could take his omnibus he turned brusquely out of the populous street into a narrow and dusky alley paved with flagstones  on one side the low brick houses had in their dusty windows the sightless moribund look of incurable decay—empty shells awaiting demolition  from the other side life had not departed wholly as yet  facing the only gaslamp yawned the cavern of a secondhand furniture dealer where deep in the gloom of a sort of narrow avenue winding through a bizarre forest of wardrobes with an undergrowth tangle of table legs a tall pierglass glimmered like a pool of water in a wood  an unhappy homeless couch accompanied by two unrelated chairs stood in the open  the only human being making use of the alley besides the professor coming stalwart and erect from the opposite direction checked his swinging pace suddenly  “hallo” he said and stood a little on one side watchfully  the professor had already stopped with a ready half turn which brought his shoulders very near the other wall  his right hand fell lightly on the back of the outcast couch the left remained purposefully plunged deep in the trousers pocket and the roundness of the heavy rimmed spectacles imparted an owlish character to his moody unperturbed face  it was like a meeting in a side corridor of a mansion full of life  the stalwart man was buttoned up in a dark overcoat and carried an umbrella his hat tilted back uncovered a good deal of forehead which appeared very white in the dusk  in the dark patches of the orbits the eyeballs glimmered piercingly  long drooping moustaches the colour of ripe corn framed with their points the square block of his shaved chin  “i am not looking for you” he said curtly  the professor did not stir an inch  the blended noises of the enormous town sank down to an inarticulate low murmur  chief inspector heat of the special crimes department changed his tone  “not in a hurry to get home” he asked with mocking simplicity  the unwholesomelooking little moral agent of destruction exulted silently in the possession of personal prestige keeping in check this man armed with the defensive mandate of a menaced society  more fortunate than caligula who wished that the roman senate had only one head for the better satisfaction of his cruel lust he beheld in that one man all the forces he had set at defiance the force of law property oppression and injustice  he beheld all his enemies and fearlessly confronted them all in a supreme satisfaction of his vanity  they stood perplexed before him as if before a dreadful portent  he gloated inwardly over the chance of this meeting affirming his superiority over all the multitude of mankind  it was in reality a chance meeting  chief inspector heat had had a disagreeably busy day since his department received the first telegram from greenwich a little before eleven in the morning  first of all the fact of the outrage being attempted less than a week after he had assured a high official that no outbreak of anarchist activity was to be apprehended was sufficiently annoying  if he ever thought himself safe in making a statement it was then  he had made that statement with infinite satisfaction to himself because it was clear that the high official desired greatly to hear that very thing  he had affirmed that nothing of the sort could even be thought of without the department being aware of it within twentyfour hours and he had spoken thus in his consciousness of being the great expert of his department  he had gone even so far as to utter words which true wisdom would have kept back but chief inspector heat was not very wise—at least not truly so  true wisdom which is not certain of anything in this world of contradictions would have prevented him from attaining his present position  it would have alarmed his superiors and done away with his chances of promotion his promotion had been very rapid  “there isn’t one of them sir that we couldn’t lay our hands on at any time of night and day  we know what each of them is doing hour by hour” he had declared  and the high official had deigned to smile  this was so obviously the right thing to say for an officer of chief inspector heat’s reputation that it was perfectly delightful  the high official believed the declaration which chimed in with his idea of the fitness of things  his wisdom was of an official kind or else he might have reflected upon a matter not of theory but of experience that in the closewoven stuff of relations between conspirator and police there occur unexpected solutions of continuity sudden holes in space and time  a given anarchist may be watched inch by inch and minute by minute but a moment always comes when somehow all sight and touch of him are lost for a few hours during which something generally an explosion more or less deplorable does happen  but the high official carried away by his sense of the fitness of things had smiled and now the recollection of that smile was very annoying to chief inspector heat principal expert in anarchist procedure  this was not the only circumstance whose recollection depressed the usual serenity of the eminent specialist  there was another dating back only to that very morning  the thought that when called urgently to his assistant commissioner’s private room he had been unable to conceal his astonishment was distinctly vexing  his instinct of a successful man had taught him long ago that as a general rule a reputation is built on manner as much as on achievement  and he felt that his manner when confronted with the telegram had not been impressive  he had opened his eyes widely and had exclaimed “impossible” exposing himself thereby to the unanswerable retort of a fingertip laid forcibly on the telegram which the assistant commissioner after reading it aloud had flung on the desk  to be crushed as it were under the tip of a forefinger was an unpleasant experience  very damaging too  furthermore chief inspector heat was conscious of not having mended matters by allowing himself to express a conviction  “one thing i can tell you at once none of our lot had anything to do with this”  he was strong in his integrity of a good detective but he saw now that an impenetrably attentive reserve towards this incident would have served his reputation better  on the other hand he admitted to himself that it was difficult to preserve one’s reputation if rank outsiders were going to take a hand in the business  outsiders are the bane of the police as of other professions  the tone of the assistant commissioner’s remarks had been sour enough to set one’s teeth on edge  and since breakfast chief inspector heat had not managed to get anything to eat  starting immediately to begin his investigation on the spot he had swallowed a good deal of raw unwholesome fog in the park  then he had walked over to the hospital and when the investigation in greenwich was concluded at last he had lost his inclination for food  not accustomed as the doctors are to examine closely the mangled remains of human beings he had been shocked by the sight disclosed to his view when a waterproof sheet had been lifted off a table in a certain apartment of the hospital  another waterproof sheet was spread over that table in the manner of a tablecloth with the corners turned up over a sort of mound—a heap of rags scorched and bloodstained half concealing what might have been an accumulation of raw material for a cannibal feast  it required considerable firmness of mind not to recoil before that sight  chief inspector heat an efficient officer of his department stood his ground but for a whole minute he did not advance  a local constable in uniform cast a sidelong glance and said with stolid simplicity  “he’s all there  every bit of him  it was a job”  he had been the first man on the spot after the explosion  he mentioned the fact again  he had seen something like a heavy flash of lightning in the fog  at that time he was standing at the door of the king william street lodge talking to the keeper  the concussion made him tingle all over  he ran between the trees towards the observatory  “as fast as my legs would carry me” he repeated twice  chief inspector heat bending forward over the table in a gingerly and horrified manner let him run on  the hospital porter and another man turned down the corners of the cloth and stepped aside  the chief inspector’s eyes searched the gruesome detail of that heap of mixed things which seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops  “you used a shovel” he remarked observing a sprinkling of small gravel tiny brown bits of bark and particles of splintered wood as fine as needles  “had to in one place” said the stolid constable  “i sent a keeper to fetch a spade  when he heard me scraping the ground with it he leaned his forehead against a tree and was as sick as a dog”  the chief inspector stooping guardedly over the table fought down the unpleasant sensation in his throat  the shattering violence of destruction which had made of that body a heap of nameless fragments affected his feelings with a sense of ruthless cruelty though his reason told him the effect must have been as swift as a flash of lightning  the man whoever he was had died instantaneously and yet it seemed impossible to believe that a human body could have reached that state of disintegration without passing through the pangs of inconceivable agony no physiologist and still less of a metaphysician chief inspector heat rose by the force of sympathy which is a form of fear above the vulgar conception of time  instantaneous  he remembered all he had ever read in popular publications of long and terrifying dreams dreamed in the instant of waking of the whole past life lived with frightful intensity by a drowning man as his doomed head bobs up streaming for the last time  the inexplicable mysteries of conscious existence beset chief inspector heat till he evolved a horrible notion that ages of atrocious pain and mental torture could be contained between two successive winks of an eye  and meantime the chief inspector went on peering at the table with a calm face and the slightly anxious attention of an indigent customer bending over what may be called the byproducts of a butcher’s shop with a view to an inexpensive sunday dinner  all the time his trained faculties of an excellent investigator who scorns no chance of information followed the selfsatisfied disjointed loquacity of the constable  “a fairhaired fellow” the last observed in a placid tone and paused “the old woman who spoke to the sergeant noticed a fairhaired fellow coming out of maze hill station”  he paused  “and he was a fairhaired fellow  she noticed two men coming out of the station after the uptrain had gone on” he continued slowly  “she couldn’t tell if they were together  she took no particular notice of the big one but the other was a fair slight chap carrying a tin varnish can in one hand”  the constable ceased  “know the woman” muttered the chief inspector with his eyes fixed on the table and a vague notion in his mind of an inquest to be held presently upon a person likely to remain for ever unknown  “yes  she’s housekeeper to a retired publican and attends the chapel in park place sometimes” the constable uttered weightily and paused with another oblique glance at the table  then suddenly “well here he is—all of him i could see  fair slight—slight enough  look at that foot there  i picked up the legs first one after another  he was that scattered you didn’t know where to begin”  the constable paused the least flicker of an innocent selflaudatory smile invested his round face with an infantile expression  “stumbled” he announced positively  “i stumbled once myself and pitched on my head too while running up  them roots do stick out all about the place  stumbled against the root of a tree and fell and that thing he was carrying must have gone off right under his chest i expect”  the echo of the words “person unknown” repeating itself in his inner consciousness bothered the chief inspector considerably  he would have liked to trace this affair back to its mysterious origin for his own information  he was professionally curious  before the public he would have liked to vindicate the efficiency of his department by establishing the identity of that man  he was a loyal servant  that however appeared impossible  the first term of the problem was unreadable—lacked all suggestion but that of atrocious cruelty  overcoming his physical repugnance chief inspector heat stretched out his hand without conviction for the salving of his conscience and took up the least soiled of the rags  it was a narrow strip of velvet with a larger triangular piece of dark blue cloth hanging from it  he held it up to his eyes and the police constable spoke  “velvet collar  funny the old woman should have noticed the velvet collar  dark blue overcoat with a velvet collar she has told us  he was the chap she saw and no mistake  and here he is all complete velvet collar and all  i don’t think i missed a single piece as big as a postage stamp”  at this point the trained faculties of the chief inspector ceased to hear the voice of the constable  he moved to one of the windows for better light  his face averted from the room expressed a startled intense interest while he examined closely the triangular piece of broadcloth by a sudden jerk he detached it and only after stuffing it into his pocket turned round to the room and flung the velvet collar back on the table—  “cover up” he directed the attendants curtly without another look and saluted by the constable carried off his spoil hastily  a convenient train whirled him up to town alone and pondering deeply in a thirdclass compartment  that singed piece of cloth was incredibly valuable and he could not defend himself from astonishment at the casual manner it had come into his possession  it was as if fate had thrust that clue into his hands  and after the manner of the average man whose ambition is to command events he began to mistrust such a gratuitous and accidental success—just because it seemed forced upon him  the practical value of success depends not a little on the way you look at it  but fate looks at nothing  it has no discretion  he no longer considered it eminently desirable all round to establish publicly the identity of the man who had blown himself up that morning with such horrible completeness  but he was not certain of the view his department would take  a department is to those it employs a complex personality with ideas and even fads of its own  it depends on the loyal devotion of its servants and the devoted loyalty of trusted servants is associated with a certain amount of affectionate contempt which keeps it sweet as it were  by a benevolent provision of nature no man is a hero to his valet or else the heroes would have to brush their own clothes  likewise no department appears perfectly wise to the intimacy of its workers  a department does not know so much as some of its servants  being a dispassionate organism it can never be perfectly informed  it would not be good for its efficiency to know too much  chief inspector heat got out of the train in a state of thoughtfulness entirely untainted with disloyalty but not quite free of that jealous mistrust which so often springs on the ground of perfect devotion whether to women or to institutions  it was in this mental disposition physically very empty but still nauseated by what he had seen that he had come upon the professor under these conditions which make for irascibility in a sound normal man this meeting was specially unwelcome to chief inspector heat  he had not been thinking of the professor he had not been thinking of any individual anarchist at all  the complexion of that case had somehow forced upon him the general idea of the absurdity of things human which in the abstract is sufficiently annoying to an unphilosophical temperament and in concrete instances becomes exasperating beyond endurance  at the beginning of his career chief inspector heat had been concerned with the more energetic forms of thieving  he had gained his spurs in that sphere and naturally enough had kept for it after his promotion to another department a feeling not very far removed from affection  thieving was not a sheer absurdity  it was a form of human industry perverse indeed but still an industry exercised in an industrious world it was work undertaken for the same reason as the work in potteries in coal mines in fields in toolgrinding shops  it was labour whose practical difference from the other forms of labour consisted in the nature of its risk which did not lie in ankylosis or lead poisoning or firedamp or gritty dust but in what may be briefly defined in its own special phraseology as “seven years hard”  chief inspector heat was of course not insensible to the gravity of moral differences  but neither were the thieves he had been looking after they submitted to the severe sanctions of a morality familiar to chief inspector heat with a certain resignation  they were his fellowcitizens gone wrong because of imperfect education chief inspector heat believed but allowing for that difference he could understand the mind of a burglar because as a matter of fact the mind and the instincts of a burglar are of the same kind as the mind and the instincts of a police officer  both recognise the same conventions and have a working knowledge of each other’s methods and of the routine of their respective trades  they understand each other which is advantageous to both and establishes a sort of amenity in their relations  products of the same machine one classed as useful and the other as noxious they take the machine for granted in different ways but with a seriousness essentially the same  the mind of chief inspector heat was inaccessible to ideas of revolt  but his thieves were not rebels  his bodily vigour his cool inflexible manner his courage and his fairness had secured for him much respect and some adulation in the sphere of his early successes  he had felt himself revered and admired and chief inspector heat arrested within six paces of the anarchist nicknamed the professor gave a thought of regret to the world of thieves—sane without morbid ideals working by routine respectful of constituted authorities free from all taint of hate and despair  after paying this tribute to what is normal in the constitution of society for the idea of thieving appeared to his instinct as normal as the idea of property chief inspector heat felt very angry with himself for having stopped for having spoken for having taken that way at all on the ground of it being a short cut from the station to the headquarters  and he spoke again in his big authoritative voice which being moderated had a threatening character  “you are not wanted i tell you” he repeated  the anarchist did not stir  an inward laugh of derision uncovered not only his teeth but his gums as well shook him all over without the slightest sound  chief inspector heat was led to add against his better judgment  “not yet  when i want you i will know where to find you”  those were perfectly proper words within the tradition and suitable to his character of a police officer addressing one of his special flock but the reception they got departed from tradition and propriety  it was outrageous  the stunted weakly figure before him spoke at last  “i’ve no doubt the papers would give you an obituary notice then  you know best what that would be worth to you  i should think you can imagine easily the sort of stuff that would be printed  but you may be exposed to the unpleasantness of being buried together with me though i suppose your friends would make an effort to sort us out as much as possible”  with all his healthy contempt for the spirit dictating such speeches the atrocious allusiveness of the words had its effect on chief inspector heat  he had too much insight and too much exact information as well to dismiss them as rot  the dusk of this narrow lane took on a sinister tint from the dark frail little figure its back to the wall and speaking with a weak selfconfident voice  to the vigorous tenacious vitality of the chief inspector the physical wretchedness of that being so obviously not fit to live was ominous for it seemed to him that if he had the misfortune to be such a miserable object he would not have cared how soon he died  life had such a strong hold upon him that a fresh wave of nausea broke out in slight perspiration upon his brow  the murmur of town life the subdued rumble of wheels in the two invisible streets to the right and left came through the curve of the sordid lane to his ears with a precious familiarity and an appealing sweetness  he was human  but chief inspector heat was also a man and he could not let such words pass  “all this is good to frighten children with” he said  “i’ll have you yet”  it was very well said without scorn with an almost austere quietness  “doubtless” was the answer “but there’s no time like the present believe me  for a man of real convictions this is a fine opportunity of selfsacrifice  you may not find another so favourable so humane there isn’t even a cat near us and these condemned old houses would make a good heap of bricks where you stand  you’ll never get me at so little cost to life and property which you are paid to protect”  “you don’t know who you’re speaking to” said chief inspector heat firmly  “if i were to lay my hands on you now i would be no better than yourself”  “ah  the game’  “you may be sure our side will win in the end  it may yet be necessary to make people believe that some of you ought to be shot at sight like mad dogs  then that will be the game  but i’ll be damned if i know what yours is  i don’t believe you know yourselves  you’ll never get anything by it”  “meantime it’s you who get something from it—so far  and you get it easily too  i won’t speak of your salary but haven’t you made your name simply by not understanding what we are after”  “what are you after then” asked chief inspector heat with scornful haste like a man in a hurry who perceives he is wasting his time  the perfect anarchist answered by a smile which did not part his thin colourless lips and the celebrated chief inspector felt a sense of superiority which induced him to raise a warning finger  “give it up—whatever it is” he said in an admonishing tone but not so kindly as if he were condescending to give good advice to a cracksman of repute  “give it up  you’ll find we are too many for you”  the fixed smile on the professor’s lips wavered as if the mocking spirit within had lost its assurance  chief inspector heat went on  “don’t you believe me eh  well you’ve only got to look about you  we are  and anyway you’re not doing it well  you’re always making a mess of it  why if the thieves didn’t know their work better they would starve”  the hint of an invincible multitude behind that man’s back roused a sombre indignation in the breast of the professor  he smiled no longer his enigmatic and mocking smile  the resisting power of numbers the unattackable stolidity of a great multitude was the haunting fear of his sinister loneliness  his lips trembled for some time before he managed to say in a strangled voice  “i am doing my work better than you’re doing yours”  “that’ll do now” interrupted chief inspector heat hurriedly and the professor laughed right out this time  while still laughing he moved on but he did not laugh long  it was a sadfaced miserable little man who emerged from the narrow passage into the bustle of the broad thoroughfare  he walked with the nerveless gait of a tramp going on still going on indifferent to rain or sun in a sinister detachment from the aspects of sky and earth  chief inspector heat on the other hand after watching him for a while stepped out with the purposeful briskness of a man disregarding indeed the inclemencies of the weather but conscious of having an authorised mission on this earth and the moral support of his kind  all the inhabitants of the immense town the population of the whole country and even the teeming millions struggling upon the planet were with him—down to the very thieves and mendicants yes the thieves themselves were sure to be with him in his present work the consciousness of universal support in his general activity heartened him to grapple with the particular problem  the problem immediately before the chief inspector was that of managing the assistant commissioner of his department his immediate superior this is the perennial problem of trusty and loyal servants anarchism gave it its particular complexion but nothing more  truth to say chief inspector heat thought but little of anarchism  he did not attach undue importance to it and could never bring himself to consider it seriously it had more the character of disorderly conduct disorderly without the human excuse of drunkenness which at any rate implies good feeling and an amiable leaning towards festivity  as criminals anarchists were distinctly no class—no class at all  and recalling the professor chief inspector heat without checking his swinging pace muttered through his teeth  “lunatic”  catching thieves was another matter altogether  it had that quality of seriousness belonging to every form of open sport where the best man wins under perfectly comprehensible rules  there were no rules for dealing with anarchists  and that was distasteful to the chief inspector  it was all foolishness but that foolishness excited the public mind affected persons in high places and touched upon international relations  a hard merciless contempt settled rigidly on the chief inspector’s face as he walked on  his mind ran over all the anarchists of his flock  not one of them had half the spunk of this or that burglar he had known  not half—not onetenth  at headquarters the chief inspector was admitted at once to the assistant commissioner’s private room  he found him pen in hand bent over a great table bestrewn with papers as if worshipping an enormous double inkstand of bronze and crystal  speaking tubes resembling snakes were tied by the heads to the back of the assistant commissioner’s wooden armchair and their gaping mouths seemed ready to bite his elbows  and in this attitude he raised only his eyes whose lids were darker than his face and very much creased  the reports had come in every anarchist had been exactly accounted for  after saying this he lowered his eyes signed rapidly two single sheets of paper and only then laid down his pen and sat well back directing an inquiring gaze at his renowned subordinate  the chief inspector stood it well deferential but inscrutable  “i daresay you were right” said the assistant commissioner “in telling me at first that the london anarchists had nothing to do with this  i quite appreciate the excellent watch kept on them by your men  on the other hand this for the public does not amount to more than a confession of ignorance”  the assistant commissioner’s delivery was leisurely as it were cautious his thought seemed to rest poised on a word before passing to another as though words had been the steppingstones for his intellect picking its way across the waters of error  “unless you have brought something useful from greenwich” he added  the chief inspector began at once the account of his investigation in a clear matteroffact manner  his superior turning his chair a little and crossing his thin legs leaned sideways on his elbow with one hand shading his eyes  his listening attitude had a sort of angular and sorrowful grace  gleams as of highly burnished silver played on the sides of his ebony black head when he inclined it slowly at the end  chief inspector heat waited with the appearance of turning over in his mind all he had just said but as a matter of fact considering the advisability of saying something more  the assistant commissioner cut his hesitation short  “you believe there were two men” he asked without uncovering his eyes  the chief inspector thought it more than probable  in his opinion the two men had parted from each other within a hundred yards from the observatory walls  he explained also how the other man could have got out of the park speedily without being observed  the fog though not very dense was in his favour  he seemed to have escorted the other to the spot and then to have left him there to do the job singlehanded taking the time those two were seen coming out of maze hill station by the old woman and the time when the explosion was heard the chief inspector thought that the other man might have been actually at the greenwich park station ready to catch the next train up at the moment his comrade was destroying himself so thoroughly  “very thoroughly—eh” murmured the assistant commissioner from under the shadow of his hand  the chief inspector in a few vigorous words described the aspect of the remains  “the coroner’s jury will have a treat” he added grimly  the assistant commissioner uncovered his eyes  “we shall have nothing to tell them” he remarked languidly  he looked up and for a time watched the markedly noncommittal attitude of his chief inspector  his nature was one that is not easily accessible to illusions  he knew that a department is at the mercy of its subordinate officers who have their own conceptions of loyalty  his career had begun in a tropical colony  he had liked his work there  it was police work  he had been very successful in tracking and breaking up certain nefarious secret societies amongst the natives  then he took his long leave and got married rather impulsively  it was a good match from a worldly point of view but his wife formed an unfavourable opinion of the colonial climate on hearsay evidence  on the other hand she had influential connections  it was an excellent match  but he did not like the work he had to do now  he felt himself dependent on too many subordinates and too many masters  the near presence of that strange emotional phenomenon called public opinion weighed upon his spirits and alarmed him by its irrational nature  no doubt that from ignorance he exaggerated to himself its power for good and evil—especially for evil and the rough east winds of the english spring which agreed with his wife augmented his general mistrust of men’s motives and of the efficiency of their organisation  the futility of office work especially appalled him on those days so trying to his sensitive liver  he got up unfolding himself to his full height and with a heaviness of step remarkable in so slender a man moved across the room to the window the panes streamed with rain and the short street he looked down into lay wet and empty as if swept clear suddenly by a great flood  it was a very trying day choked in raw fog to begin with and now drowned in cold rain  the flickering blurred flames of gaslamps seemed to be dissolving in a watery atmosphere  and the lofty pretensions of a mankind oppressed by the miserable indignities of the weather appeared as a colossal and hopeless vanity deserving of scorn wonder and compassion  “horrible horrible” thought the assistant commissioner to himself with his face near the windowpane  “we have been having this sort of thing now for ten days no a fortnight—a fortnight”  he ceased to think completely for a time  that utter stillness of his brain lasted about three seconds  then he said perfunctorily “you have set inquiries on foot for tracing that other man up and down the line”  he had no doubt that everything needful had been done  chief inspector heat knew of course thoroughly the business of manhunting  and these were the routine steps too that would be taken as a matter of course by the merest beginner  a few inquiries amongst the ticket collectors and the porters of the two small railway stations would give additional details as to the appearance of the two men the inspection of the collected tickets would show at once where they came from that morning it was elementary and could not have been neglected  accordingly the chief inspector answered that all this had been done directly the old woman had come forward with her deposition  and he mentioned the name of a station  “that’s where they came from sir” he went on  “the porter who took the tickets at maze hill remembers two chaps answering to the description passing the barrier  they seemed to him two respectable working men of a superior sort—sign painters or house decorators  the big man got out of a thirdclass compartment backward with a bright tin can in his hand  on the platform he gave it to carry to the fair young fellow who followed him  all this agrees exactly with what the old woman told the police sergeant in greenwich”  the assistant commissioner still with his face turned to the window expressed his doubt as to these two men having had anything to do with the outrage  all this theory rested upon the utterances of an old charwoman who had been nearly knocked down by a man in a hurry  not a very substantial authority indeed unless on the ground of sudden inspiration which was hardly tenable  “frankly now could she have been really inspired” he queried with grave irony keeping his back to the room as if entranced by the contemplation of the town’s colossal forms half lost in the night  he did not even look round when he heard the mutter of the word “providential” from the principal subordinate of his department whose name printed sometimes in the papers was familiar to the great public as that of one of its zealous and hardworking protectors  chief inspector heat raised his voice a little  “strips and bits of bright tin were quite visible to me” he said “that’s a pretty good corroboration”  “and these men came from that little country station” the assistant commissioner mused aloud wondering  he was told that such was the name on two tickets out of three given up out of that train at maze hill  the third person who got out was a hawker from gravesend well known to the porters  the chief inspector imparted that information in a tone of finality with some ill humour as loyal servants will do in the consciousness of their fidelity and with the sense of the value of their loyal exertions  and still the assistant commissioner did not turn away from the darkness outside as vast as a sea  “two foreign anarchists coming from that place” he said apparently to the windowpane  “it’s rather unaccountable”’  “yes sir  but it would be still more unaccountable if that michaelis weren’t staying in a cottage in the neighbourhood”  at the sound of that name falling unexpectedly into this annoying affair the assistant commissioner dismissed brusquely the vague remembrance of his daily whist party at his club  it was the most comforting habit of his life in a mainly successful display of his skill without the assistance of any subordinate  he entered his club to play from five to seven before going home to dinner forgetting for those two hours whatever was distasteful in his life as though the game were a beneficent drug for allaying the pangs of moral discontent  his partners were the gloomily humorous editor of a celebrated magazine a silent elderly barrister with malicious little eyes and a highly martial simpleminded old colonel with nervous brown hands  they were his club acquaintances merely  he never met them elsewhere except at the cardtable  but they all seemed to approach the game in the spirit of cosufferers as if it were indeed a drug against the secret ills of existence and every day as the sun declined over the countless roofs of the town a mellow pleasurable impatience resembling the impulse of a sure and profound friendship lightened his professional labours  and now this pleasurable sensation went out of him with something resembling a physical shock and was replaced by a special kind of interest in his work of social protection—an improper sort of interest which may be defined best as a sudden and alert mistrust of the weapon in his hand     chapter vi   the lady patroness of michaelis the ticketofleave apostle of humanitarian hopes was one of the most influential and distinguished connections of the assistant commissioner’s wife whom she called annie and treated still rather as a not very wise and utterly inexperienced young girl  but she had consented to accept him on a friendly footing which was by no means the case with all of his wife’s influential connections  married young and splendidly at some remote epoch of the past she had had for a time a close view of great affairs and even of some great men  she herself was a great lady  old now in the number of her years she had that sort of exceptional temperament which defies time with scornful disregard as if it were a rather vulgar convention submitted to by the mass of inferior mankind  many other conventions easier to set aside alas failed to obtain her recognition also on temperamental grounds—either because they bored her or else because they stood in the way of her scorns and sympathies  admiration was a sentiment unknown to her it was one of the secret griefs of her most noble husband against her—first as always more or less tainted with mediocrity and next as being in a way an admission of inferiority  and both were frankly inconceivable to her nature  to be fearlessly outspoken in her opinions came easily to her since she judged solely from the standpoint of her social position  she was equally untrammelled in her actions and as her tactfulness proceeded from genuine humanity her bodily vigour remained remarkable and her superiority was serene and cordial three generations had admired her infinitely and the last she was likely to see had pronounced her a wonderful woman  meantime intelligent with a sort of lofty simplicity and curious at heart but not like many women merely of social gossip she amused her age by attracting within her ken through the power of her great almost historical social prestige everything that rose above the dead level of mankind lawfully or unlawfully by position wit audacity fortune or misfortune  royal highnesses artists men of science young statesmen and charlatans of all ages and conditions who unsubstantial and light bobbing up like corks show best the direction of the surface currents had been welcomed in that house listened to penetrated understood appraised for her own edification  in her own words she liked to watch what the world was coming to  and as she had a practical mind her judgment of men and things though based on special prejudices was seldom totally wrong and almost never wrongheaded  her drawingroom was probably the only place in the wide world where an assistant commissioner of police could meet a convict liberated on a ticketofleave on other than professional and official ground  who had brought michaelis there one afternoon the assistant commissioner did not remember very well  he had a notion it must have been a certain member of parliament of illustrious parentage and unconventional sympathies which were the standing joke of the comic papers  the notabilities and even the simple notorieties of the day brought each other freely to that temple of an old woman’s not ignoble curiosity  you never could guess whom you were likely to come upon being received in semiprivacy within the faded blue silk and gilt frame screen making a cosy nook for a couch and a few armchairs in the great drawingroom with its hum of voices and the groups of people seated or standing in the light of six tall windows  michaelis had been the object of a revulsion of popular sentiment the same sentiment which years ago had applauded the ferocity of the life sentence passed upon him for complicity in a rather mad attempt to rescue some prisoners from a police van  the plan of the conspirators had been to shoot down the horses and overpower the escort  unfortunately one of the police constables got shot too  he left a wife and three small children and the death of that man aroused through the length and breadth of a realm for whose defence welfare and glory men die every day as matter of duty an outburst of furious indignation of a raging implacable pity for the victim  three ringleaders got hanged michaelis young and slim locksmith by trade and great frequenter of evening schools did not even know that anybody had been killed his part with a few others being to force open the door at the back of the special conveyance  when arrested he had a bunch of skeleton keys in one pocket a heavy chisel in another and a short crowbar in his hand neither more nor less than a burglar  but no burglar would have received such a heavy sentence  the death of the constable had made him miserable at heart but the failure of the plot also  he did not conceal either of these sentiments from his empanelled countrymen and that sort of compunction appeared shockingly imperfect to the crammed court  the judge on passing sentence commented feelingly upon the depravity and callousness of the young prisoner  that made the groundless fame of his condemnation the fame of his release was made for him on no better grounds by people who wished to exploit the sentimental aspect of his imprisonment either for purposes of their own or for no intelligible purpose  he let them do so in the innocence of his heart and the simplicity of his mind  nothing that happened to him individually had any importance  he was like those saintly men whose personality is lost in the contemplation of their faith  his ideas were not in the nature of convictions  they were inaccessible to reasoning  they formed in all their contradictions and obscurities an invincible and humanitarian creed which he confessed rather than preached with an obstinate gentleness a smile of pacific assurance on his lips and his candid blue eyes cast down because the sight of faces troubled his inspiration developed in solitude  in that characteristic attitude pathetic in his grotesque and incurable obesity which he had to drag like a galley slave’s bullet to the end of his days the assistant commissioner of police beheld the ticketofleave apostle filling a privileged armchair within the screen  he sat there by the head of the old lady’s couch mildvoiced and quiet with no more selfconsciousness than a very small child and with something of a child’s charm—the appealing charm of trustfulness  confident of the future whose secret ways had been revealed to him within the four walls of a wellknown penitentiary he had no reason to look with suspicion upon anybody  if he could not give the great and curious lady a very definite idea as to what the world was coming to he had managed without effort to impress her by his unembittered faith by the sterling quality of his optimism  a certain simplicity of thought is common to serene souls at both ends of the social scale  the great lady was simple in her own way  his views and beliefs had nothing in them to shock or startle her since she judged them from the standpoint of her lofty position  indeed her sympathies were easily accessible to a man of that sort  she was not an exploiting capitalist herself she was as it were above the play of economic conditions  and she had a great capacity of pity for the more obvious forms of common human miseries precisely because she was such a complete stranger to them that she had to translate her conception into terms of mental suffering before she could grasp the notion of their cruelty  the assistant commissioner remembered very well the conversation between these two  he had listened in silence  it was something as exciting in a way and even touching in its foredoomed futility as the efforts at moral intercourse between the inhabitants of remote planets  but this grotesque incarnation of humanitarian passion appealed somehow to one’s imagination  at last michaelis rose and taking the great lady’s extended hand shook it retained it for a moment in his great cushioned palm with unembarrassed friendliness and turned upon the semiprivate nook of the drawingroom his back vast and square and as if distended under the short tweed jacket  glancing about in serene benevolence he waddled along to the distant door between the knots of other visitors the murmur of conversations paused on his passage  he smiled innocently at a tall brilliant girl whose eyes met his accidentally and went out unconscious of the glances following him across the room  michaelis’ first appearance in the world was a success—a success of esteem unmarred by a single murmur of derision  the interrupted conversations were resumed in their proper tone grave or light  only a wellsetup longlimbed activelooking man of forty talking with two ladies near a window remarked aloud with an unexpected depth of feeling “eighteen stone i should say and not five foot six  poor fellow  it’s terrible—terrible”  the lady of the house gazing absently at the assistant commissioner left alone with her on the private side of the screen seemed to be rearranging her mental impressions behind her thoughtful immobility of a handsome old face  men with grey moustaches and full healthy vaguely smiling countenances approached circling round the screen two mature women with a matronly air of gracious resolution a cleanshaved individual with sunken cheeks and dangling a goldmounted eyeglass on a broad black ribbon with an oldworld dandified effect  a silence deferential but full of reserves reigned for a moment and then the great lady exclaimed not with resentment but with a sort of protesting indignation  “and that officially is supposed to be a revolutionist  what nonsense” she looked hard at the assistant commissioner who murmured apologetically  “not a dangerous one perhaps”  “not dangerous—i should think not indeed  he is a mere believer  it’s the temperament of a saint” declared the great lady in a firm tone “and they kept him shut up for twenty years  one shudders at the stupidity of it  and now they have let him out everybody belonging to him is gone away somewhere or dead  his parents are dead the girl he was to marry has died while he was in prison he has lost the skill necessary for his manual occupation  he told me all this himself with the sweetest patience but then he said he had had plenty of time to think out things for himself  a pretty compensation  if that’s the stuff revolutionists are made of some of us may well go on their knees to them” she continued in a slightly bantering voice while the banal society smiles hardened on the worldly faces turned towards her with conventional deference  “the poor creature is obviously no longer in a position to take care of himself  somebody will have to look after him a little”  “he should be recommended to follow a treatment of some sort” the soldierly voice of the activelooking man was heard advising earnestly from a distance  he was in the pink of condition for his age and even the texture of his long frock coat had a character of elastic soundness as if it were a living tissue  “the man is virtually a cripple” he added with unmistakable feeling  other voices as if glad of the opening murmured hasty compassion “quite startling” “monstrous” “most painful to see”  the lank man with the eyeglass on a broad ribbon pronounced mincingly the word “grotesque” whose justness was appreciated by those standing near him they smiled at each other  the assistant commissioner had expressed no opinion either then or later his position making it impossible for him to ventilate any independent view of a ticketofleave convict  but in truth he shared the view of his wife’s friend and patron that michaelis was a humanitarian sentimentalist a little mad but upon the whole incapable of hurting a fly intentionally  so when that name cropped up suddenly in this vexing bomb affair he realised all the danger of it for the ticketofleave apostle and his mind reverted at once to the old lady’s wellestablished infatuation  her arbitrary kindness would not brook patiently any interference with michaelis’ freedom  it was a deep calm convinced infatuation  she had not only felt him to be inoffensive but she had said so which last by a confusion of her absolutist mind became a sort of incontrovertible demonstration  it was as if the monstrosity of the man with his candid infant’s eyes and a fat angelic smile had fascinated her  she had come to believe almost his theory of the future since it was not repugnant to her prejudices  she disliked the new element of plutocracy in the social compound and industrialism as a method of human development appeared to her singularly repulsive in its mechanical and unfeeling character  the humanitarian hopes of the mild michaelis tended not towards utter destruction but merely towards the complete economic ruin of the system  and she did not really see where was the moral harm of it  it would do away with all the multitude of the “parvenus” whom she disliked and mistrusted not because they had arrived anywhere she denied that but because of their profound unintelligence of the world which was the primary cause of the crudity of their perceptions and the aridity of their hearts  with the annihilation of all capital they would vanish too but universal ruin providing it was universal as it was revealed to michaelis would leave the social values untouched  the disappearance of the last piece of money could not affect people of position  she could not conceive how it could affect her position for instance  she had developed these discoveries to the assistant commissioner with all the serene fearlessness of an old woman who had escaped the blight of indifference he had made for himself the rule to receive everything of that sort in a silence which he took care from policy and inclination not to make offensive  he had an affection for the aged disciple of michaelis a complex sentiment depending a little on her prestige on her personality but most of all on the instinct of flattered gratitude  he felt himself really liked in her house  she was kindness personified  and she was practically wise too after the manner of experienced women  she made his married life much easier than it would have been without her generously full recognition of his rights as annie’s husband  her influence upon his wife a woman devoured by all sorts of small selfishnesses small envies small jealousies was excellent unfortunately both her kindness and her wisdom were of unreasonable complexion distinctly feminine and difficult to deal with  she remained a perfect woman all along her full tale of years and not as some of them do become—a sort of slippery pestilential old man in petticoats  and it was as of a woman that he thought of her—the specially choice incarnation of the feminine wherein is recruited the tender ingenuous and fierce bodyguard for all sorts of men who talk under the influence of an emotion true or fraudulent for preachers seers prophets or reformers  appreciating the distinguished and good friend of his wife and himself in that way the assistant commissioner became alarmed at the convict michaelis’ possible fate  once arrested on suspicion of being in some way however remote a party to this outrage the man could hardly escape being sent back to finish his sentence at least  and that would kill him he would never come out alive  the assistant commissioner made a reflection extremely unbecoming his official position without being really creditable to his humanity  “if the fellow is laid hold of again” he thought “she will never forgive me”  the frankness of such a secretly outspoken thought could not go without some derisive selfcriticism  no man engaged in a work he does not like can preserve many saving illusions about himself  the distaste the absence of glamour extend from the occupation to the personality  it is only when our appointed activities seem by a lucky accident to obey the particular earnestness of our temperament that we can taste the comfort of complete selfdeception  the assistant commissioner did not like his work at home  the police work he had been engaged on in a distant part of the globe had the saving character of an irregular sort of warfare or at least the risk and excitement of openair sport  his real abilities which were mainly of an administrative order were combined with an adventurous disposition  chained to a desk in the thick of four millions of men he considered himself the victim of an ironic fate—the same no doubt which had brought about his marriage with a woman exceptionally sensitive in the matter of colonial climate besides other limitations testifying to the delicacy of her nature—and her tastes  though he judged his alarm sardonically he did not dismiss the improper thought from his mind  the instinct of selfpreservation was strong within him on the contrary he repeated it mentally with profane emphasis and a fuller precision “damn it  if that infernal heat has his way the fellow’ll die in prison smothered in his fat and she’ll never forgive me”  his black narrow figure with the white band of the collar under the silvery gleams on the closecropped hair at the back of the head remained motionless  the silence had lasted such a long time that chief inspector heat ventured to clear his throat  this noise produced its effect  the zealous and intelligent officer was asked by his superior whose back remained turned to him immovably  “you connect michaelis with this affair”  chief inspector heat was very positive but cautious  “well sir” he said “we have enough to go upon  a man like that has no business to be at large anyhow”  “you will want some conclusive evidence” came the observation in a murmur  chief inspector heat raised his eyebrows at the black narrow back which remained obstinately presented to his intelligence and his zeal  “there will be no difficulty in getting up sufficient evidence against him” he said with virtuous complacency  “you may trust me for that sir” he added quite unnecessarily out of the fulness of his heart for it seemed to him an excellent thing to have that man in hand to be thrown down to the public should it think fit to roar with any special indignation in this case  it was impossible to say yet whether it would roar or not  that in the last instance depended of course on the newspaper press  but in any case chief inspector heat purveyor of prisons by trade and a man of legal instincts did logically believe that incarceration was the proper fate for every declared enemy of the law  in the strength of that conviction he committed a fault of tact he allowed himself a little conceited laugh and repeated  “trust me for that sir”  this was too much for the forced calmness under which the assistant commissioner had for upwards of eighteen months concealed his irritation with the system and the subordinates of his office  a square peg forced into a round hole he had felt like a daily outrage that long established smooth roundness into which a man of less sharply angular shape would have fitted himself with voluptuous acquiescence after a shrug or two what he resented most was just the necessity of taking so much on trust at the little laugh of chief inspector heat’s he spun swiftly on his heels as if whirled away from the windowpane by an electric shock  he caught on the latter’s face not only the complacency proper to the occasion lurking under the moustache but the vestiges of experimental watchfulness in the round eyes which had been no doubt fastened on his back and now met his glance for a second before the intent character of their stare had the time to change to a merely startled appearance  the assistant commissioner of police had really some qualifications for his post  suddenly his suspicion was awakened  it is but fair to say that his suspicions of the police methods unless the police happened to be a semimilitary body organised by himself was not difficult to arouse  if it ever slumbered from sheer weariness it was but lightly and his appreciation of chief inspector heat’s zeal and ability moderate in itself excluded all notion of moral confidence  “he’s up to something” he exclaimed mentally and at once became angry  crossing over to his desk with headlong strides he sat down violently  “here i am stuck in a litter of paper” he reflected with unreasonable resentment “supposed to hold all the threads in my hands and yet i can but hold what is put in my hand and nothing else  and they can fasten the other ends of the threads where they please”  he raised his head and turned towards his subordinate a long meagre face with the accentuated features of an energetic don quixote  “now what is it you’ve got up your sleeve”  the other stared  he stared without winking in a perfect immobility of his round eyes as he was used to stare at the various members of the criminal class when after being duly cautioned they made their statements in the tones of injured innocence or false simplicity or sullen resignation  but behind that professional and stony fixity there was some surprise too for in such a tone combining nicely the note of contempt and impatience chief inspector heat the righthand man of the department was not used to be addressed  he began in a procrastinating manner like a man taken unawares by a new and unexpected experience  “what i’ve got against that man michaelis you mean sir”  the assistant commissioner watched the bullet head the points of that norse rover’s moustache falling below the line of the heavy jaw the whole full and pale physiognomy whose determined character was marred by too much flesh at the cunning wrinkles radiating from the outer corners of the eyes—and in that purposeful contemplation of the valuable and trusted officer he drew a conviction so sudden that it moved him like an inspiration  “i have reason to think that when you came into this room” he said in measured tones “it was not michaelis who was in your mind not principally—perhaps not at all”  “you have reason to think sir” muttered chief inspector heat with every appearance of astonishment which up to a certain point was genuine enough  he had discovered in this affair a delicate and perplexing side forcing upon the discoverer a certain amount of insincerity—that sort of insincerity which under the names of skill prudence discretion turns up at one point or another in most human affairs  he felt at the moment like a tightrope artist might feel if suddenly in the middle of the performance the manager of the music hall were to rush out of the proper managerial seclusion and begin to shake the rope  indignation the sense of moral insecurity engendered by such a treacherous proceeding joined to the immediate apprehension of a broken neck would in the colloquial phrase put him in a state  and there would be also some scandalised concern for his art too since a man must identify himself with something more tangible than his own personality and establish his pride somewhere either in his social position or in the quality of the work he is obliged to do or simply in the superiority of the idleness he may be fortunate enough to enjoy  “yes” said the assistant commissioner “i have  i do not mean to say that you have not thought of michaelis at all  but you are giving the fact you’ve mentioned a prominence which strikes me as not quite candid inspector heat  if that is really the track of discovery why haven’t you followed it up at once either personally or by sending one of your men to that village”  “do you think sir i have failed in my duty there” the chief inspector asked in a tone which he sought to make simply reflective  forced unexpectedly to concentrate his faculties upon the task of preserving his balance he had seized upon that point and exposed himself to a rebuke for the assistant commissioner frowning slightly observed that this was a very improper remark to make  “but since you’ve made it” he continued coldly “i’ll tell you that this is not my meaning”  he paused with a straight glance of his sunken eyes which was a full equivalent of the unspoken termination “and you know it”  the head of the socalled special crimes department debarred by his position from going out of doors personally in quest of secrets locked up in guilty breasts had a propensity to exercise his considerable gifts for the detection of incriminating truth upon his own subordinates  that peculiar instinct could hardly be called a weakness  it was natural  he was a born detective  it had unconsciously governed his choice of a career and if it ever failed him in life it was perhaps in the one exceptional circumstance of his marriage—which was also natural  it fed since it could not roam abroad upon the human material which was brought to it in its official seclusion  we can never cease to be ourselves  his elbow on the desk his thin legs crossed and nursing his cheek in the palm of his meagre hand the assistant commissioner in charge of the special crimes branch was getting hold of the case with growing interest his chief inspector if not an absolutely worthy foeman of his penetration was at any rate the most worthy of all within his reach  a mistrust of established reputations was strictly in character with the assistant commissioner’s ability as detector  his memory evoked a certain old fat and wealthy native chief in the distant colony whom it was a tradition for the successive colonial governors to trust and make much of as a firm friend and supporter of the order and legality established by white men whereas when examined sceptically he was found out to be principally his own good friend and nobody else’s  not precisely a traitor but still a man of many dangerous reservations in his fidelity caused by a due regard for his own advantage comfort and safety  a fellow of some innocence in his naive duplicity but none the less dangerous  he took some finding out  he was physically a big man too and allowing for the difference of colour of course chief inspector heat’s appearance recalled him to the memory of his superior it was not the eyes nor yet the lips exactly  it was bizarre  but does not alfred wallace relate in his famous book on the malay archipelago how amongst the aru islanders he discovered in an old and naked savage with a sooty skin a peculiar resemblance to a dear friend at home  for the first time since he took up his appointment the assistant commissioner felt as if he were going to do some real work for his salary  and that was a pleasurable sensation  “i’ll turn him inside out like an old glove” thought the assistant commissioner with his eyes resting pensively upon chief inspector heat  “no that was not my thought” he began again  “there is no doubt about you knowing your business—no doubt at all and that’s precisely why i—” he stopped short and changing his tone “what could you bring up against michaelis of a definite nature  i mean apart from the fact that the two men under suspicion—you’re certain there were two of them—came last from a railway station within three miles of the village where michaelis is living now”  “this by itself is enough for us to go upon sir with that sort of man” said the chief inspector with returning composure  the slight approving movement of the assistant commissioner’s head went far to pacify the resentful astonishment of the renowned officer  for chief inspector heat was a kind man an excellent husband a devoted father and the public and departmental confidence he enjoyed acting favourably upon an amiable nature disposed him to feel friendly towards the successive assistant commissioners he had seen pass through that very room  there had been three in his time  the first one a soldierly abrupt redfaced person with white eyebrows and an explosive temper could be managed with a silken thread  he left on reaching the age limit  the second a perfect gentleman knowing his own and everybody else’s place to a nicety on resigning to take up a higher appointment out of england got decorated for really inspector heat’s services  to work with him had been a pride and a pleasure  the third a bit of a dark horse from the first was at the end of eighteen months something of a dark horse still to the department  upon the whole chief inspector heat believed him to be in the main harmless—oddlooking but harmless  he was speaking now and the chief inspector listened with outward deference which means nothing being a matter of duty and inwardly with benevolent toleration  “michaelis reported himself before leaving london for the country”  “yes sir  he did”  “and what may he be doing there” continued the assistant commissioner who was perfectly informed on that point  fitted with painful tightness into an old wooden armchair before a wormeaten oak table in an upstairs room of a fourroomed cottage with a roof of mossgrown tiles michaelis was writing night and day in a shaky slanting hand that “autobiography of a prisoner” which was to be like a book of revelation in the history of mankind  the conditions of confined space seclusion and solitude in a small fourroomed cottage were favourable to his inspiration  it was like being in prison except that one was never disturbed for the odious purpose of taking exercise according to the tyrannical regulations of his old home in the penitentiary  he could not tell whether the sun still shone on the earth or not  the perspiration of the literary labour dropped from his brow  a delightful enthusiasm urged him on  it was the liberation of his inner life the letting out of his soul into the wide world  and the zeal of his guileless vanity first awakened by the offer of five hundred pounds from a publisher seemed something predestined and holy  “it would be of course most desirable to be informed exactly” insisted the assistant commissioner uncandidly  chief inspector heat conscious of renewed irritation at this display of scrupulousness said that the county police had been notified from the first of michaelis’ arrival and that a full report could be obtained in a few hours  a wire to the superintendent—  thus he spoke rather slowly while his mind seemed already to be weighing the consequences  a slight knitting of the brow was the outward sign of this  but he was interrupted by a question  “you’ve sent that wire already”  “no sir” he answered as if surprised  the assistant commissioner uncrossed his legs suddenly  the briskness of that movement contrasted with the casual way in which he threw out a suggestion  “would you think that michaelis had anything to do with the preparation of that bomb for instance”  the chief inspector assumed a reflective manner  “i wouldn’t say so  there’s no necessity to say anything at present  he associates with men who are classed as dangerous  he was made a delegate of the red committee less than a year after his release on licence  a sort of compliment i suppose”  and the chief inspector laughed a little angrily a little scornfully with a man of that sort scrupulousness was a misplaced and even an illegal sentiment  the celebrity bestowed upon michaelis on his release two years ago by some emotional journalists in want of special copy had rankled ever since in his breast  it was perfectly legal to arrest that man on the barest suspicion  it was legal and expedient on the face of it  his two former chiefs would have seen the point at once whereas this one without saying either yes or no sat there as if lost in a dream  moreover besides being legal and expedient the arrest of michaelis solved a little personal difficulty which worried chief inspector heat somewhat  this difficulty had its bearing upon his reputation upon his comfort and even upon the efficient performance of his duties  for if michaelis no doubt knew something about this outrage the chief inspector was fairly certain that he did not know too much  this was just as well  he knew much less—the chief inspector was positive—than certain other individuals he had in his mind but whose arrest seemed to him inexpedient besides being a more complicated matter on account of the rules of the game  the rules of the game did not protect so much michaelis who was an exconvict  it would be stupid not to take advantage of legal facilities and the journalists who had written him up with emotional gush would be ready to write him down with emotional indignation  this prospect viewed with confidence had the attraction of a personal triumph for chief inspector heat  and deep down in his blameless bosom of an average married citizen almost unconscious but potent nevertheless the dislike of being compelled by events to meddle with the desperate ferocity of the professor had its say  this dislike had been strengthened by the chance meeting in the lane  the encounter did not leave behind with chief inspector heat that satisfactory sense of superiority the members of the police force get from the unofficial but intimate side of their intercourse with the criminal classes by which the vanity of power is soothed and the vulgar love of domination over our fellowcreatures is flattered as worthily as it deserves  the perfect anarchist was not recognised as a fellowcreature by chief inspector heat  he was impossible—a mad dog to be left alone  not that the chief inspector was afraid of him on the contrary he meant to have him some day  but not yet he meant to get hold of him in his own time properly and effectively according to the rules of the game  the present was not the right time for attempting that feat not the right time for many reasons personal and of public service  this being the strong feeling of inspector heat it appeared to him just and proper that this affair should be shunted off its obscure and inconvenient track leading goodness knows where into a quiet and lawful siding called michaelis and he repeated as if reconsidering the suggestion conscientiously  “the bomb  no i would not say that exactly  we may never find that out  but it’s clear that he is connected with this in some way which we can find out without much trouble”  his countenance had that look of grave overbearing indifference once well known and much dreaded by the better sort of thieves  chief inspector heat though what is called a man was not a smiling animal but his inward state was that of satisfaction at the passively receptive attitude of the assistant commissioner who murmured gently  “and you really think that the investigation should be made in that direction”  “i do sir”  “quite convinced  “i am sir  that’s the true line for us to take”  the assistant commissioner withdrew the support of his hand from his reclining head with a suddenness that considering his languid attitude seemed to menace his whole person with collapse  but on the contrary he sat up extremely alert behind the great writingtable on which his hand had fallen with the sound of a sharp blow  “what i want to know is what put it out of your head till now”  “put it out of my head” repeated the chief inspector very slowly  “yes  till you were called into this room—you know”  the chief inspector felt as if the air between his clothing and his skin had become unpleasantly hot  it was the sensation of an unprecedented and incredible experience  “of course” he said exaggerating the deliberation of his utterance to the utmost limits of possibility “if there is a reason of which i know nothing for not interfering with the convict michaelis perhaps it’s just as well i didn’t start the county police after him”  this took such a long time to say that the unflagging attention of the assistant commissioner seemed a wonderful feat of endurance  his retort came without delay  “no reason whatever that i know of  come chief inspector this finessing with me is highly improper on your part—highly improper  and it’s also unfair you know  you shouldn’t leave me to puzzle things out for myself like this  really i am surprised”  he paused then added smoothly “i need scarcely tell you that this conversation is altogether unofficial”  these words were far from pacifying the chief inspector  the indignation of a betrayed tightrope performer was strong within him  in his pride of a trusted servant he was affected by the assurance that the rope was not shaken for the purpose of breaking his neck as by an exhibition of impudence  as if anybody were afraid  assistant commissioners come and go but a valuable chief inspector is not an ephemeral office phenomenon he was not afraid of getting a broken neck  to have his performance spoiled was more than enough to account for the glow of honest indignation  and as thought is no respecter of persons the thought of chief inspector heat took a threatening and prophetic shape  “you my boy” he said to himself keeping his round and habitually roving eyes fastened upon the assistant commissioner’s face—“you my boy you don’t know your place and your place won’t know you very long either i bet”  as if in provoking answer to that thought something like the ghost of an amiable smile passed on the lips of the assistant commissioner  his manner was easy and businesslike while he persisted in administering another shake to the tight rope  “let us come now to what you have discovered on the spot chief inspector” he said  “a fool and his job are soon parted” went on the train of prophetic thought in chief inspector heat’s head  but it was immediately followed by the reflection that a higher official even when “fired out” this was the precise image has still the time as he flies through the door to launch a nasty kick at the shinbones of a subordinate  without softening very much the basilisk nature of his stare he said impassively  “we are coming to that part of my investigation sir”  “that’s right  well what have you brought away from it”  the chief inspector who had made up his mind to jump off the rope came to the ground with gloomy frankness  “i’ve brought away an address” he said pulling out of his pocket without haste a singed rag of dark blue cloth  “this belongs to the overcoat the fellow who got himself blown to pieces was wearing  of course the overcoat may not have been his and may even have been stolen  but that’s not at all probable if you look at this”  the chief inspector stepping up to the table smoothed out carefully the rag of blue cloth  he had picked it up from the repulsive heap in the mortuary because a tailor’s name is found sometimes under the collar it is not often of much use but still—he only half expected to find anything useful but certainly he did not expect to find—not under the collar at all but stitched carefully on the under side of the lapel—a square piece of calico with an address written on it in marking ink  the chief inspector removed his smoothing hand  “i carried it off with me without anybody taking notice” he said  “i thought it best  it can always be produced if required”  the assistant commissioner rising a little in his chair pulled the cloth over to his side of the table  he sat looking at it in silence only the number 32 and the name of brett street were written in marking ink on a piece of calico slightly larger than an ordinary cigarette paper  he was genuinely surprised  “can’t understand why he should have gone about labelled like this” he said looking up at chief inspector heat  “it’s a most extraordinary thing”  “i met once in the smokingroom of a hotel an old gentleman who went about with his name and address sewn on in all his coats in case of an accident or sudden illness” said the chief inspector  “he professed to be eightyfour years old but he didn’t look his age  he told me he was also afraid of losing his memory suddenly like those people he has been reading of in the papers”  a question from the assistant commissioner who wanted to know what was no 32 brett street interrupted that reminiscence abruptly  the chief inspector driven down to the ground by unfair artifices had elected to walk the path of unreserved openness  if he believed firmly that to know too much was not good for the department the judicious holding back of knowledge was as far as his loyalty dared to go for the good of the service  if the assistant commissioner wanted to mismanage this affair nothing of course could prevent him  but on his own part he now saw no reason for a display of alacrity  so he answered concisely  “it’s a shop sir”  the assistant commissioner with his eyes lowered on the rag of blue cloth waited for more information  as that did not come he proceeded to obtain it by a series of questions propounded with gentle patience  thus he acquired an idea of the nature of mr verloc’s commerce of his personal appearance and heard at last his name  in a pause the assistant commissioner raised his eyes and discovered some animation on the chief inspector’s face  they looked at each other in silence  “of course” said the latter “the department has no record of that man”  “did any of my predecessors have any knowledge of what you have told me now” asked the assistant commissioner putting his elbows on the table and raising his joined hands before his face as if about to offer prayer only that his eyes had not a pious expression  “no sir certainly not  what would have been the object  that sort of man could never be produced publicly to any good purpose  it was sufficient for me to know who he was and to make use of him in a way that could be used publicly”  “and do you think that sort of private knowledge consistent with the official position you occupy”  “perfectly sir  i think it’s quite proper  i will take the liberty to tell you sir that it makes me what i am—and i am looked upon as a man who knows his work  it’s a private affair of my own  a personal friend of mine in the french police gave me the hint that the fellow was an embassy spy  private friendship private information private use of it—that’s how i look upon it”  the assistant commissioner after remarking to himself that the mental state of the renowned chief inspector seemed to affect the outline of his lower jaw as if the lively sense of his high professional distinction had been located in that part of his anatomy dismissed the point for the moment with a calm “i see”  then leaning his cheek on his joined hands  “well then—speaking privately if you like—how long have you been in private touch with this embassy spy”  to this inquiry the private answer of the chief inspector so private that it was never shaped into audible words was  “long before you were even thought of for your place here”  the sotospeak public utterance was much more precise  “i saw him for the first time in my life a little more than seven years ago when two imperial highnesses and the imperial chancellor were on a visit here  i was put in charge of all the arrangements for looking after them  baron stottwartenheim was ambassador then  he was a very nervous old gentleman  one evening three days before the guildhall banquet he sent word that he wanted to see me for a moment  i was downstairs and the carriages were at the door to take the imperial highnesses and the chancellor to the opera  i went up at once  i found the baron walking up and down his bedroom in a pitiable state of distress squeezing his hands together  he assured me he had the fullest confidence in our police and in my abilities but he had there a man just come over from paris whose information could be trusted implicity  he wanted me to hear what that man had to say  he took me at once into a dressingroom next door where i saw a big fellow in a heavy overcoat sitting all alone on a chair and holding his hat and stick in one hand the baron said to him in french ‘speak my friend’  the light in that room was not very good  i talked with him for some five minutes perhaps he certainly gave me a piece of very startling news  then the baron took me aside nervously to praise him up to me and when i turned round again i discovered that the fellow had vanished like a ghost  got up and sneaked out down some back stairs i suppose  there was no time to run after him as i had to hurry off after the ambassador down the great staircase and see the party started safe for the opera  however i acted upon the information that very night  whether it was perfectly correct or not it did look serious enough  very likely it saved us from an ugly trouble on the day of the imperial visit to the city  “some time later a month or so after my promotion to chief inspector my attention was attracted to a big burly man i thought i had seen somewhere before coming out in a hurry from a jeweller’s shop in the strand  i went after him as it was on my way towards charing cross and there seeing one of our detectives across the road i beckoned him over and pointed out the fellow to him with instructions to watch his movements for a couple of days and then report to me  no later than next afternoon my man turned up to tell me that the fellow had married his landlady’s daughter at a registrar’s office that very day at 1130 am and had gone off with her to margate for a week  our man had seen the luggage being put on the cab  there were some old paris labels on one of the bags  somehow i couldn’t get the fellow out of my head and the very next time i had to go to paris on service i spoke about him to that friend of mine in the paris police  my friend said ‘from what you tell me i think you must mean a rather wellknown hangeron and emissary of the revolutionary red committee  he says he is an englishman by birth  we have an idea that he has been for a good few years now a secret agent of one of the foreign embassies in london’  this woke up my memory completely  he was the vanishing fellow i saw sitting on a chair in baron stottwartenheim’s bathroom  i told my friend that he was quite right  the fellow was a secret agent to my certain knowledge afterwards my friend took the trouble to ferret out the complete record of that man for me  i thought i had better know all there was to know but i don’t suppose you want to hear his history now sir”  the assistant commissioner shook his supported head  “the history of your relations with that useful personage is the only thing that matters just now” he said closing slowly his weary deepset eyes and then opening them swiftly with a greatly refreshed glance  “there’s nothing official about them” said the chief inspector bitterly “i went into his shop one evening told him who i was and reminded him of our first meeting  he didn’t as much as twitch an eyebrow  he said that he was married and settled now and that all he wanted was not to be interfered in his little business  i took it upon myself to promise him that as long as he didn’t go in for anything obviously outrageous he would be left alone by the police  that was worth something to him because a word from us to the customhouse people would have been enough to get some of these packages he gets from paris and brussels opened in dover with confiscation to follow for certain and perhaps a prosecution as well at the end of it”  “that’s a very precarious trade” murmured the assistant commissioner “why did he go in for that”  the chief inspector raised scornful eyebrows dispassionately  “most likely got a connection—friends on the continent—amongst people who deal in such wares  they would be just the sort he would consort with he’s a lazy dog too—like the rest of them”  “what do you get from him in exchange for your protection”  the chief inspector was not inclined to enlarge on the value of mr verloc’s services  “he would not be much good to anybody but myself  one has got to know a good deal beforehand to make use of a man like that  i can understand the sort of hint he can give  and when i want a hint he can generally furnish it to me”  the chief inspector lost himself suddenly in a discreet reflective mood and the assistant commissioner repressed a smile at the fleeting thought that the reputation of chief inspector heat might possibly have been made in a great part by the secret agent verloc  “in a more general way of being of use all our men of the special crimes section on duty at charing cross and victoria have orders to take careful notice of anybody they may see with him  he meets the new arrivals frequently and afterwards keeps track of them  he seems to have been told off for that sort of duty  when i want an address in a hurry i can always get it from him  of course i know how to manage our relations i haven’t seen him to speak to three times in the last two years  i drop him a line unsigned and he answers me in the same way at my private address”  from time to time the assistant commissioner gave an almost imperceptible nod  the chief inspector added that he did not suppose mr verloc to be deep in the confidence of the prominent members of the revolutionary international council but that he was generally trusted of that there could be no doubt  “whenever i’ve had reason to think there was something in the wind” he concluded “i’ve always found he could tell me something worth knowing”  the assistant commissioner made a significant remark  “he failed you this time”  “neither had i wind of anything in any other way” retorted chief inspector heat  “i asked him nothing so he could tell me nothing  he isn’t one of our men  it isn’t as if he were in our pay”  “no” muttered the assistant commissioner  “he’s a spy in the pay of a foreign government  we could never confess to him”  “i must do my work in my own way” declared the chief inspector  “when it comes to that i would deal with the devil himself and take the consequences  there are things not fit for everybody to know”  “your idea of secrecy seems to consist in keeping the chief of your department in the dark  that’s stretching it perhaps a little too far isn’t it  he lives over his shop”  “who—verloc  oh yes  he lives over his shop  the wife’s mother i fancy lives with them”  “is the house watched”  “oh dear no  it wouldn’t do  certain people who come there are watched  my opinion is that he knows nothing of this affair”  “how do you account for this”  the assistant commissioner nodded at the cloth rag lying before him on the table  “i don’t account for it at all sir  it’s simply unaccountable  it can’t be explained by what i know”  the chief inspector made those admissions with the frankness of a man whose reputation is established as if on a rock  “at any rate not at this present moment  i think that the man who had most to do with it will turn out to be michaelis”  “you do”  “yes sir because i can answer for all the others”  “what about that other man supposed to have escaped from the park”  “i should think he’s far away by this time” opined the chief inspector  the assistant commissioner looked hard at him and rose suddenly as though having made up his mind to some course of action  as a matter of fact he had that very moment succumbed to a fascinating temptation  the chief inspector heard himself dismissed with instructions to meet his superior early next morning for further consultation upon the case  he listened with an impenetrable face and walked out of the room with measured steps  whatever might have been the plans of the assistant commissioner they had nothing to do with that desk work which was the bane of his existence because of its confined nature and apparent lack of reality  it could not have had or else the general air of alacrity that came upon the assistant commissioner would have been inexplicable  as soon as he was left alone he looked for his hat impulsively and put it on his head having done that he sat down again to reconsider the whole matter  but as his mind was already made up this did not take long  and before chief inspector heat had gone very far on the way home he also left the building     chapter vii   the assistant commissioner walked along a short and narrow street like a wet muddy trench then crossing a very broad thoroughfare entered a public edifice and sought speech with a young private secretary unpaid of a great personage  this fair smoothfaced young man whose symmetrically arranged hair gave him the air of a large and neat schoolboy met the assistant commissioner’s request with a doubtful look and spoke with bated breath  “would he see you  i don’t know about that  he has walked over from the house an hour ago to talk with the permanent undersecretary and now he’s ready to walk back again  he might have sent for him but he does it for the sake of a little exercise i suppose  it’s all the exercise he can find time for while this session lasts  i don’t complain i rather enjoy these little strolls  he leans on my arm and doesn’t open his lips  but i say he’s very tired and—well—not in the sweetest of tempers just now”  “it’s in connection with that greenwich affair”  “oh  i say  he’s very bitter against you people  but i will go and see if you insist”  “do  that’s a good fellow” said the assistant commissioner  the unpaid secretary admired this pluck  composing for himself an innocent face he opened a door and went in with the assurance of a nice and privileged child  and presently he reappeared with a nod to the assistant commissioner who passing through the same door left open for him found himself with the great personage in a large room  vast in bulk and stature with a long white face which broadened at the base by a big double chin appeared eggshaped in the fringe of thin greyish whisker the great personage seemed an expanding man unfortunate from a tailoring point of view the crossfolds in the middle of a buttoned black coat added to the impression as if the fastenings of the garment were tried to the utmost  from the head set upward on a thick neck the eyes with puffy lower lids stared with a haughty droop on each side of a hooked aggressive nose nobly salient in the vast pale circumference of the face  a shiny silk hat and a pair of worn gloves lying ready on the end of a long table looked expanded too enormous  he stood on the hearthrug in big roomy boots and uttered no word of greeting  “i would like to know if this is the beginning of another dynamite campaign” he asked at once in a deep very smooth voice  “don’t go into details  i have no time for that”  the assistant commissioner’s figure before this big and rustic presence had the frail slenderness of a reed addressing an oak  and indeed the unbroken record of that man’s descent surpassed in the number of centuries the age of the oldest oak in the country  “no  as far as one can be positive about anything i can assure you that it is not”  “yes  but your idea of assurances over there” said the great man with a contemptuous wave of his hand towards a window giving on the broad thoroughfare “seems to consist mainly in making the secretary of state look a fool  i have been told positively in this very room less than a month ago that nothing of the sort was even possible”  the assistant commissioner glanced in the direction of the window calmly  “you will allow me to remark sir ethelred that so far i have had no opportunity to give you assurances of any kind”  the haughty droop of the eyes was focussed now upon the assistant commissioner  “true” confessed the deep smooth voice  “i sent for heat  you are still rather a novice in your new berth  and how are you getting on over there”  “i believe i am learning something every day”  “of course of course  i hope you will get on”  “thank you sir ethelred  i’ve learned something today and even within the last hour or so  there is much in this affair of a kind that does not meet the eye in a usual anarchist outrage even if one looked into it as deep as can be  that’s why i am here”  the great man put his arms akimbo the backs of his big hands resting on his hips  “very well  go on  only no details pray  spare me the details”  “you shall not be troubled with them sir ethelred” the assistant commissioner began with a calm and untroubled assurance  while he was speaking the hands on the face of the clock behind the great man’s back—a heavy glistening affair of massive scrolls in the same dark marble as the mantelpiece and with a ghostly evanescent tick—had moved through the space of seven minutes  he spoke with a studious fidelity to a parenthetical manner into which every little fact—that is every detail—fitted with delightful ease  not a murmur nor even a movement hinted at interruption  the great personage might have been the statue of one of his own princely ancestors stripped of a crusader’s war harness and put into an illfitting frock coat  the assistant commissioner felt as though he were at liberty to talk for an hour  but he kept his head and at the end of the time mentioned above he broke off with a sudden conclusion which reproducing the opening statement pleasantly surprised sir ethelred by its apparent swiftness and force  “the kind of thing which meets us under the surface of this affair otherwise without gravity is unusual—in this precise form at least—and requires special treatment”  the tone of sir ethelred was deepened full of conviction  “i should think so—involving the ambassador of a foreign power”  “oh  the ambassador” protested the other erect and slender allowing himself a mere half smile  “it would be stupid of me to advance anything of the kind  and it is absolutely unnecessary because if i am right in my surmises whether ambassador or hall porter it’s a mere detail”  sir ethelred opened a wide mouth like a cavern into which the hooked nose seemed anxious to peer there came from it a subdued rolling sound as from a distant organ with the scornful indignation stop  “no  these people are too impossible  what do they mean by importing their methods of crimtartary here  a turk would have more decency”  “you forget sir ethelred that strictly speaking we know nothing positively—as yet”  “no  but how would you define it  shortly”  “barefaced audacity amounting to childishness of a peculiar sort”  “we can’t put up with the innocence of nasty little children” said the great and expanded personage expanding a little more as it were  the haughty drooping glance struck crushingly the carpet at the assistant commissioner’s feet  “they’ll have to get a hard rap on the knuckles over this affair  we must be in a position to—what is your general idea stated shortly  no need to go into details”  “no sir ethelred  in principle i should lay it down that the existence of secret agents should not be tolerated as tending to augment the positive dangers of the evil against which they are used  that the spy will fabricate his information is a mere commonplace  but in the sphere of political and revolutionary action relying partly on violence the professional spy has every facility to fabricate the very facts themselves and will spread the double evil of emulation in one direction and of panic hasty legislation unreflecting hate on the other  however this is an imperfect world—”  the deepvoiced presence on the hearthrug motionless with big elbows stuck out said hastily  “be lucid please”  “yes sir ethelred—an imperfect world  therefore directly the character of this affair suggested itself to me i thought it should be dealt with with special secrecy and ventured to come over here”  “that’s right” approved the great personage glancing down complacently over his double chin  “i am glad there’s somebody over at your shop who thinks that the secretary of state may be trusted now and then”  the assistant commissioner had an amused smile  “i was really thinking that it might be better at this stage for heat to be replaced by—”  “what  heat  an ass—eh” exclaimed the great man with distinct animosity  “not at all  pray sir ethelred don’t put that unjust interpretation on my remarks”  “then what  too clever by half”  “neither—at least not as a rule  all the grounds of my surmises i have from him  the only thing i’ve discovered by myself is that he has been making use of that man privately  who could blame him  he’s an old police hand  he told me virtually that he must have tools to work with it occurred to me that this tool should be surrendered to the special crimes division as a whole instead of remaining the private property of chief inspector heat  i extend my conception of our departmental duties to the suppression of the secret agent  but chief inspector heat is an old departmental hand  he would accuse me of perverting its morality and attacking its efficiency  he would define it bitterly as protection extended to the criminal class of revolutionists  it would mean just that to him”  “yes  but what do you mean”  “i mean to say first that there’s but poor comfort in being able to declare that any given act of violence—damaging property or destroying life—is not the work of anarchism at all but of something else altogether—some species of authorised scoundrelism  this i fancy is much more frequent than we suppose  next it’s obvious that the existence of these people in the pay of foreign governments destroys in a measure the efficiency of our supervision  a spy of that sort can afford to be more reckless than the most reckless of conspirators  his occupation is free from all restraint  he’s without as much faith as is necessary for complete negation and without that much law as is implied in lawlessness  thirdly the existence of these spies amongst the revolutionary groups which we are reproached for harbouring here does away with all certitude  you have received a reassuring statement from chief inspector heat some time ago  it was by no means groundless—and yet this episode happens  i call it an episode because this affair i make bold to say is episodic it is no part of any general scheme however wild  the very peculiarities which surprise and perplex chief inspector heat establish its character in my eyes  i am keeping clear of details sir ethelred”  the personage on the hearthrug had been listening with profound attention  “just so  be as concise as you can”  the assistant commissioner intimated by an earnest deferential gesture that he was anxious to be concise  “there is a peculiar stupidity and feebleness in the conduct of this affair which gives me excellent hopes of getting behind it and finding there something else than an individual freak of fanaticism  for it is a planned thing undoubtedly  the actual perpetrator seems to have been led by the hand to the spot and then abandoned hurriedly to his own devices  the inference is that he was imported from abroad for the purpose of committing this outrage  at the same time one is forced to the conclusion that he did not know enough english to ask his way unless one were to accept the fantastic theory that he was a deaf mute  i wonder now—but this is idle  he has destroyed himself by an accident obviously  not an extraordinary accident  but an extraordinary little fact remains the address on his clothing discovered by the merest accident too  it is an incredible little fact so incredible that the explanation which will account for it is bound to touch the bottom of this affair  instead of instructing heat to go on with this case my intention is to seek this explanation personally—by myself i mean—where it may be picked up  that is in a certain shop in brett street and on the lips of a certain secret agent once upon a time the confidential and trusted spy of the late baron stottwartenheim ambassador of a great power to the court of st james”  the assistant commissioner paused then added “those fellows are a perfect pest”  in order to raise his drooping glance to the speaker’s face the personage on the hearthrug had gradually tilted his head farther back which gave him an aspect of extraordinary haughtiness  “why not leave it to heat”  “because he is an old departmental hand  they have their own morality my line of inquiry would appear to him an awful perversion of duty  for him the plain duty is to fasten the guilt upon as many prominent anarchists as he can on some slight indications he had picked up in the course of his investigation on the spot whereas i he would say am bent upon vindicating their innocence  i am trying to be as lucid as i can in presenting this obscure matter to you without details”  “he would would he” muttered the proud head of sir ethelred from its lofty elevation  “i am afraid so—with an indignation and disgust of which you or i can have no idea  he’s an excellent servant  we must not put an undue strain on his loyalty  that’s always a mistake  besides i want a free hand—a freer hand than it would be perhaps advisable to give chief inspector heat  i haven’t the slightest wish to spare this man verloc he will i imagine be extremely startled to find his connection with this affair whatever it may be brought home to him so quickly frightening him will not be very difficult  but our true objective lies behind him somewhere  i want your authority to give him such assurances of personal safety as i may think proper”  “certainly” said the personage on the hearthrug  “find out as much as you can find it out in your own way”  “i must set about it without loss of time this very evening” said the assistant commissioner  sir ethelred shifted one hand under his coat tails and tilting back his head looked at him steadily  “we’ll have a late sitting tonight” he said  “come to the house with your discoveries if we are not gone home  i’ll warn toodles to look out for you  he’ll take you into my room”  the numerous family and the wide connections of the youthfullooking private secretary cherished for him the hope of an austere and exalted destiny  meantime the social sphere he adorned in his hours of idleness chose to pet him under the above nickname  and sir ethelred hearing it on the lips of his wife and girls every day mostly at breakfasttime had conferred upon it the dignity of unsmiling adoption  the assistant commissioner was surprised and gratified extremely  “i shall certainly bring my discoveries to the house on the chance of you having the time to—”  “i won’t have the time” interrupted the great personage  “but i will see you  i haven’t the time now—and you are going yourself”  “yes sir ethelred  i think it the best way”  the personage had tilted his head so far back that in order to keep the assistant commissioner under his observation he had to nearly close his eyes  “h’m  ha  and how do you propose—will you assume a disguise”  “hardly a disguise  i’ll change my clothes of course”  “of course” repeated the great man with a sort of absentminded loftiness  he turned his big head slowly and over his shoulder gave a haughty oblique stare to the ponderous marble timepiece with the sly feeble tick  the gilt hands had taken the opportunity to steal through no less than five and twenty minutes behind his back  the assistant commissioner who could not see them grew a little nervous in the interval  but the great man presented to him a calm and undismayed face  “very well” he said and paused as if in deliberate contempt of the official clock  “but what first put you in motion in this direction”  “i have been always of opinion” began the assistant commissioner  “ah  yes  opinion  that’s of course  but the immediate motive”  “what shall i say sir ethelred  a new man’s antagonism to old methods a desire to know something at first hand  some impatience  it’s my old work but the harness is different  it has been chafing me a little in one or two tender places”  “i hope you’ll get on over there” said the great man kindly extending his hand soft to the touch but broad and powerful like the hand of a glorified farmer  the assistant commissioner shook it and withdrew  in the outer room toodles who had been waiting perched on the edge of a table advanced to meet him subduing his natural buoyancy  “well  satisfactory” he asked with airy importance  “perfectly  you’ve earned my undying gratitude” answered the assistant commissioner whose long face looked wooden in contrast with the peculiar character of the other’s gravity which seemed perpetually ready to break into ripples and chuckles  “that’s all right  but seriously you can’t imagine how irritated he is by the attacks on his bill for the nationalisation of fisheries  they call it the beginning of social revolution  of course it is a revolutionary measure  but these fellows have no decency  the personal attacks—”  “i read the papers” remarked the assistant commissioner  “odious  eh  and you have no notion what a mass of work he has got to get through every day  he does it all himself  seems unable to trust anyone with these fisheries”  “and yet he’s given a whole half hour to the consideration of my very small sprat” interjected the assistant commissioner  “small  is it  i’m glad to hear that  but it’s a pity you didn’t keep away then  this fight takes it out of him frightfully  the man’s getting exhausted  i feel it by the way he leans on my arm as we walk over  and i say is he safe in the streets  mullins has been marching his men up here this afternoon  there’s a constable stuck by every lamppost and every second person we meet between this and palace yard is an obvious ‘tec’  it will get on his nerves presently  i say these foreign scoundrels aren’t likely to throw something at him—are they  it would be a national calamity  the country can’t spare him”  “not to mention yourself  he leans on your arm” suggested the assistant commissioner soberly  “you would both go”  “it would be an easy way for a young man to go down into history  not so many british ministers have been assassinated as to make it a minor incident  but seriously now—”  “i am afraid that if you want to go down into history you’ll have to do something for it  seriously there’s no danger whatever for both of you but from overwork”  the sympathetic toodles welcomed this opening for a chuckle  “the fisheries won’t kill me  i am used to late hours” he declared with ingenuous levity  but feeling an instant compunction he began to assume an air of statesmanlike moodiness as one draws on a glove  “his massive intellect will stand any amount of work  it’s his nerves that i am afraid of  the reactionary gang with that abusive brute cheeseman at their head insult him every night”  “if he will insist on beginning a revolution” murmured the assistant commissioner  “the time has come and he is the only man great enough for the work” protested the revolutionary toodles flaring up under the calm speculative gaze of the assistant commissioner  somewhere in a corridor a distant bell tinkled urgently and with devoted vigilance the young man pricked up his ears at the sound  “he’s ready to go now” he exclaimed in a whisper snatched up his hat and vanished from the room  the assistant commissioner went out by another door in a less elastic manner  again he crossed the wide thoroughfare walked along a narrow street and reentered hastily his own departmental buildings  he kept up this accelerated pace to the door of his private room  before he had closed it fairly his eyes sought his desk  he stood still for a moment then walked up looked all round on the floor sat down in his chair rang a bell and waited  “chief inspector heat gone yet”  “yes sir  went away halfanhour ago”  he nodded  “that will do”  and sitting still with his hat pushed off his forehead he thought that it was just like heat’s confounded cheek to carry off quietly the only piece of material evidence  but he thought this without animosity  old and valued servants will take liberties the piece of overcoat with the address sewn on was certainly not a thing to leave about  dismissing from his mind this manifestation of chief inspector heat’s mistrust he wrote and despatched a note to his wife charging her to make his apologies to michaelis’ great lady with whom they were engaged to dine that evening  the short jacket and the low round hat he assumed in a sort of curtained alcove containing a washstand a row of wooden pegs and a shelf brought out wonderfully the length of his grave brown face  he stepped back into the full light of the room looking like the vision of a cool reflective don quixote with the sunken eyes of a dark enthusiast and a very deliberate manner  he left the scene of his daily labours quickly like an unobtrusive shadow  his descent into the street was like the descent into a slimy aquarium from which the water had been run off  a murky gloomy dampness enveloped him  the walls of the houses were wet the mud of the roadway glistened with an effect of phosphorescence and when he emerged into the strand out of a narrow street by the side of charing cross station the genius of the locality assimilated him  he might have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can be seen of an evening about there flitting round the dark corners  he came to a stand on the very edge of the pavement and waited  his exercised eyes had made out in the confused movements of lights and shadows thronging the roadway the crawling approach of a hansom  he gave no sign but when the low step gliding along the curbstone came to his feet he dodged in skilfully in front of the big turning wheel and spoke up through the little trap door almost before the man gazing supinely ahead from his perch was aware of having been boarded by a fare  it was not a long drive  it ended by signal abruptly nowhere in particular between two lampposts before a large drapery establishment—a long range of shops already lapped up in sheets of corrugated iron for the night  tendering a coin through the trap door the fare slipped out and away leaving an effect of uncanny eccentric ghastliness upon the driver’s mind  but the size of the coin was satisfactory to his touch and his education not being literary he remained untroubled by the fear of finding it presently turned to a dead leaf in his pocket  raised above the world of fares by the nature of his calling he contemplated their actions with a limited interest  the sharp pulling of his horse right round expressed his philosophy  meantime the assistant commissioner was already giving his order to a waiter in a little italian restaurant round the corner—one of those traps for the hungry long and narrow baited with a perspective of mirrors and white napery without air but with an atmosphere of their own—an atmosphere of fraudulent cookery mocking an abject mankind in the most pressing of its miserable necessities  in this immoral atmosphere the assistant commissioner reflecting upon his enterprise seemed to lose some more of his identity  he had a sense of loneliness of evil freedom  it was rather pleasant  when after paying for his short meal he stood up and waited for his change he saw himself in the sheet of glass and was struck by his foreign appearance  he contemplated his own image with a melancholy and inquisitive gaze then by sudden inspiration raised the collar of his jacket  this arrangement appeared to him commendable and he completed it by giving an upward twist to the ends of his black moustache  he was satisfied by the subtle modification of his personal aspect caused by these small changes  “that’ll do very well” he thought  “i’ll get a little wet a little splashed—”  he became aware of the waiter at his elbow and of a small pile of silver coins on the edge of the table before him  the waiter kept one eye on it while his other eye followed the long back of a tall not very young girl who passed up to a distant table looking perfectly sightless and altogether unapproachable  she seemed to be a habitual customer  on going out the assistant commissioner made to himself the observation that the patrons of the place had lost in the frequentation of fraudulent cookery all their national and private characteristics  and this was strange since the italian restaurant is such a peculiarly british institution  but these people were as denationalised as the dishes set before them with every circumstance of unstamped respectability  neither was their personality stamped in any way professionally socially or racially  they seemed created for the italian restaurant unless the italian restaurant had been perchance created for them  but that last hypothesis was unthinkable since one could not place them anywhere outside those special establishments  one never met these enigmatical persons elsewhere  it was impossible to form a precise idea what occupations they followed by day and where they went to bed at night and he himself had become unplaced  it would have been impossible for anybody to guess his occupation  as to going to bed there was a doubt even in his own mind  not indeed in regard to his domicile itself but very much so in respect of the time when he would be able to return there  a pleasurable feeling of independence possessed him when he heard the glass doors swing to behind his back with a sort of imperfect baffled thud  he advanced at once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp plaster interspersed with lamps and enveloped oppressed penetrated choked and suffocated by the blackness of a wet london night which is composed of soot and drops of water  brett street was not very far away  it branched off narrow from the side of an open triangular space surrounded by dark and mysterious houses temples of petty commerce emptied of traders for the night  only a fruiterer’s stall at the corner made a violent blaze of light and colour  beyond all was black and the few people passing in that direction vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and lemons  no footsteps echoed  they would never be heard of again  the adventurous head of the special crimes department watched these disappearances from a distance with an interested eye  he felt lighthearted as though he had been ambushed all alone in a jungle many thousands of miles away from departmental desks and official inkstands this joyousness and dispersion of thought before a task of some importance seems to prove that this world of ours is not such a very serious affair after all  for the assistant commissioner was not constitutionally inclined to levity  the policeman on the beat projected his sombre and moving form against the luminous glory of oranges and lemons and entered brett street without haste  the assistant commissioner as though he were a member of the criminal classes lingered out of sight awaiting his return  but this constable seemed to be lost for ever to the force  he never returned must have gone out at the other end of brett street  the assistant commissioner reaching this conclusion entered the street in his turn and came upon a large van arrested in front of the dimly lit windowpanes of a carter’s eatinghouse  the man was refreshing himself inside and the horses their big heads lowered to the ground fed out of nosebags steadily  farther on on the opposite side of the street another suspect patch of dim light issued from mr verloc’s shop front hung with papers heaving with vague piles of cardboard boxes and the shapes of books  the assistant commissioner stood observing it across the roadway  there could be no mistake  by the side of the front window encumbered by the shadows of nondescript things the door standing ajar let escape on the pavement a narrow clear streak of gaslight within  behind the assistant commissioner the van and horses merged into one mass seemed something alive—a squarebacked black monster blocking half the street with sudden ironshod stampings fierce jingles and heavy blowing sighs  the harshly festive illomened glare of a large and prosperous publichouse faced the other end of brett street across a wide road  this barrier of blazing lights opposing the shadows gathered about the humble abode of mr verloc’s domestic happiness seemed to drive the obscurity of the street back upon itself make it more sullen brooding and sinister     chapter viii   having infused by persistent importunities some sort of heat into the chilly interest of several licensed victuallers the acquaintances once upon a time of her late unlucky husband mrs verloc’s mother had at last secured her admission to certain almshouses founded by a wealthy innkeeper for the destitute widows of the trade  this end conceived in the astuteness of her uneasy heart the old woman had pursued with secrecy and determination  that was the time when her daughter winnie could not help passing a remark to mr verloc that “mother has been spending halfcrowns and five shillings almost every day this last week in cab fares”  but the remark was not made grudgingly  winnie respected her mother’s infirmities  she was only a little surprised at this sudden mania for locomotion  mr verloc who was sufficiently magnificent in his way had grunted the remark impatiently aside as interfering with his meditations  these were frequent deep and prolonged they bore upon a matter more important than five shillings distinctly more important and beyond all comparison more difficult to consider in all its aspects with philosophical serenity  her object attained in astute secrecy the heroic old woman had made a clean breast of it to mrs verloc  her soul was triumphant and her heart tremulous  inwardly she quaked because she dreaded and admired the calm selfcontained character of her daughter winnie whose displeasure was made redoubtable by a diversity of dreadful silences  but she did not allow her inward apprehensions to rob her of the advantage of venerable placidity conferred upon her outward person by her triple chin the floating ampleness of her ancient form and the impotent condition of her legs  the shock of the information was so unexpected that mrs verloc against her usual practice when addressed interrupted the domestic occupation she was engaged upon  it was the dusting of the furniture in the parlour behind the shop  she turned her head towards her mother  “whatever did you want to do that for” she exclaimed in scandalised astonishment  the shock must have been severe to make her depart from that distant and uninquiring acceptance of facts which was her force and her safeguard in life  “weren’t you made comfortable enough here”  she had lapsed into these inquiries but next moment she saved the consistency of her conduct by resuming her dusting while the old woman sat scared and dumb under her dingy white cap and lustreless dark wig  winnie finished the chair and ran the duster along the mahogany at the back of the horsehair sofa on which mr verloc loved to take his ease in hat and overcoat  she was intent on her work but presently she permitted herself another question  “how in the world did you manage it mother”  as not affecting the inwardness of things which it was mrs verloc’s principle to ignore this curiosity was excusable  it bore merely on the methods  the old woman welcomed it eagerly as bringing forward something that could be talked about with much sincerity  she favoured her daughter by an exhaustive answer full of names and enriched by side comments upon the ravages of time as observed in the alteration of human countenances  the names were principally the names of licensed victuallers—“poor daddy’s friends my dear”  she enlarged with special appreciation on the kindness and condescension of a large brewer a baronet and an m p the chairman of the governors of the charity  she expressed herself thus warmly because she had been allowed to interview by appointment his private secretary—“a very polite gentleman all in black with a gentle sad voice but so very very thin and quiet  he was like a shadow my dear”  winnie prolonging her dusting operations till the tale was told to the end walked out of the parlour into the kitchen down two steps in her usual manner without the slightest comment  shedding a few tears in sign of rejoicing at her daughter’s mansuetude in this terrible affair mrs verloc’s mother gave play to her astuteness in the direction of her furniture because it was her own and sometimes she wished it hadn’t been  heroism is all very well but there are circumstances when the disposal of a few tables and chairs brass bedsteads and so on may be big with remote and disastrous consequences she required a few pieces herself the foundation which after many importunities had gathered her to its charitable breast giving nothing but bare planks and cheaply papered bricks to the objects of its solicitude  the delicacy guiding her choice to the least valuable and most dilapidated articles passed unacknowledged because winnie’s philosophy consisted in not taking notice of the inside of facts she assumed that mother took what suited her best  as to mr verloc his intense meditation like a sort of chinese wall isolated him completely from the phenomena of this world of vain effort and illusory appearances  her selection made the disposal of the rest became a perplexing question in a particular way  she was leaving it in brett street of course  but she had two children  winnie was provided for by her sensible union with that excellent husband mr verloc  stevie was destitute—and a little peculiar  his position had to be considered before the claims of legal justice and even the promptings of partiality  the possession of the furniture would not be in any sense a provision  he ought to have it—the poor boy  but to give it to him would be like tampering with his position of complete dependence  it was a sort of claim which she feared to weaken  moreover the susceptibilities of mr verloc would perhaps not brook being beholden to his brotherinlaw for the chairs he sat on  in a long experience of gentlemen lodgers mrs verloc’s mother had acquired a dismal but resigned notion of the fantastic side of human nature  what if mr verloc suddenly took it into his head to tell stevie to take his blessed sticks somewhere out of that  a division on the other hand however carefully made might give some cause of offence to winnie  no stevie must remain destitute and dependent  and at the moment of leaving brett street she had said to her daughter “no use waiting till i am dead is there  everything i leave here is altogether your own now my dear”  winnie with her hat on silent behind her mother’s back went on arranging the collar of the old woman’s cloak  she got her handbag an umbrella with an impassive face  the time had come for the expenditure of the sum of threeandsixpence on what might well be supposed the last cab drive of mrs verloc’s mother’s life  they went out at the shop door  the conveyance awaiting them would have illustrated the proverb that “truth can be more cruel than caricature” if such a proverb existed crawling behind an infirm horse a metropolitan hackney carriage drew up on wobbly wheels and with a maimed driver on the box  this last peculiarity caused some embarrassment  catching sight of a hooked iron contrivance protruding from the left sleeve of the man’s coat mrs verloc’s mother lost suddenly the heroic courage of these days  she really couldn’t trust herself  “what do you think winnie”  she hung back  the passionate expostulations of the bigfaced cabman seemed to be squeezed out of a blocked throat  leaning over from his box he whispered with mysterious indignation  what was the matter now  was it possible to treat a man so  his enormous and unwashed countenance flamed red in the muddy stretch of the street  was it likely they would have given him a licence he inquired desperately if—  the police constable of the locality quieted him by a friendly glance then addressing himself to the two women without marked consideration said  “he’s been driving a cab for twenty years  i never knew him to have an accident”  “accident” shouted the driver in a scornful whisper  the policeman’s testimony settled it  the modest assemblage of seven people mostly under age dispersed  winnie followed her mother into the cab  stevie climbed on the box  his vacant mouth and distressed eyes depicted the state of his mind in regard to the transactions which were taking place  in the narrow streets the progress of the journey was made sensible to those within by the near fronts of the houses gliding past slowly and shakily with a great rattle and jingling of glass as if about to collapse behind the cab and the infirm horse with the harness hung over his sharp backbone flapping very loose about his thighs appeared to be dancing mincingly on his toes with infinite patience later on in the wider space of whitehall all visual evidences of motion became imperceptible  the rattle and jingle of glass went on indefinitely in front of the long treasury building—and time itself seemed to stand still  at last winnie observed “this isn’t a very good horse”  her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead immovable  on the box stevie shut his vacant mouth first in order to ejaculate earnestly “don’t”  the driver holding high the reins twisted around the hook took no notice  perhaps he had not heard  stevie’s breast heaved  “don’t whip”  the man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours bristling with white hairs  his little red eyes glistened with moisture his big lips had a violet tint  they remained closed  with the dirty back of his whiphand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous chin  “you mustn’t” stammered out stevie violently  “it hurts”  “mustn’t whip” queried the other in a thoughtful whisper and immediately whipped  he did this not because his soul was cruel and his heart evil but because he had to earn his fare  and for a time the walls of st stephen’s with its towers and pinnacles contemplated in immobility and silence a cab that jingled  it rolled too however  but on the bridge there was a commotion  stevie suddenly proceeded to get down from the box  there were shouts on the pavement people ran forward the driver pulled up whispering curses of indignation and astonishment  winnie lowered the window and put her head out white as a ghost  in the depths of the cab her mother was exclaiming in tones of anguish “is that boy hurt  is that boy hurt”  stevie was not hurt he had not even fallen but excitement as usual had robbed him of the power of connected speech  he could do no more than stammer at the window  “too heavy  too heavy”  winnie put out her hand on to his shoulder  “stevie  get up on the box directly and don’t try to get down again”  “no  no  walk  must walk”  in trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered himself into utter incoherence  no physical impossibility stood in the way of his whim  stevie could have managed easily to keep pace with the infirm dancing horse without getting out of breath  but his sister withheld her consent decisively  “the idea  whoever heard of such a thing  run after a cab”  her mother frightened and helpless in the depths of the conveyance entreated “oh don’t let him winnie  he’ll get lost don’t let him”  “certainly not  what next  mr verloc will be sorry to hear of this nonsense stevie—i can tell you  he won’t be happy at all”  the idea of mr verloc’s grief and unhappiness acting as usual powerfully upon stevie’s fundamentally docile disposition he abandoned all resistance and climbed up again on the box with a face of despair  the cabby turned at him his enormous and inflamed countenance truculently  “don’t you go for trying this silly game again young fellow”  after delivering himself thus in a stern whisper strained almost to extinction he drove on ruminating solemnly  to his mind the incident remained somewhat obscure  but his intellect though it had lost its pristine vivacity in the benumbing years of sedentary exposure to the weather lacked not independence or sanity  gravely he dismissed the hypothesis of stevie being a drunken young nipper  inside the cab the spell of silence in which the two women had endured shoulder to shoulder the jolting rattling and jingling of the journey had been broken by stevie’s outbreak  winnie raised her voice  “you’ve done what you wanted mother  you’ll have only yourself to thank for it if you aren’t happy afterwards  and i don’t think you’ll be that i don’t  weren’t you comfortable enough in the house  whatever people’ll think of us—you throwing yourself like this on a charity”  “my dear” screamed the old woman earnestly above the noise “you’ve been the best of daughters to me  as to mr verloc—there—”  words failing her on the subject of mr verloc’s excellence she turned her old tearful eyes to the roof of the cab  then she averted her head on the pretence of looking out of the window as if to judge of their progress  it was insignificant and went on close to the curbstone night the early dirty night the sinister noisy hopeless and rowdy night of south london had overtaken her on her last cab drive  in the gaslight of the lowfronted shops her big cheeks glowed with an orange hue under a black and mauve bonnet  mrs verloc’s mother’s complexion had become yellow by the effect of age and from a natural predisposition to biliousness favoured by the trials of a difficult and worried existence first as wife then as widow  it was a complexion that under the influence of a blush would take on an orange tint  and this woman modest indeed but hardened in the fires of adversity of an age moreover when blushes are not expected had positively blushed before her daughter  in the privacy of a fourwheeler on her way to a charity cottage one of a row which by the exiguity of its dimensions and the simplicity of its accommodation might well have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still more straitened circumstances of the grave she was forced to hid from her own child a blush of remorse and shame  whatever people will think  she knew very well what they did think the people winnie had in her mind—the old friends of her husband and others too whose interest she had solicited with such flattering success  she had not known before what a good beggar she could be  but she guessed very well what inference was drawn from her application  on account of that shrinking delicacy which exists side by side with aggressive brutality in masculine nature the inquiries into her circumstances had not been pushed very far  she had checked them by a visible compression of the lips and some display of an emotion determined to be eloquently silent  and the men would become suddenly incurious after the manner of their kind  she congratulated herself more than once on having nothing to do with women who being naturally more callous and avid of details would have been anxious to be exactly informed by what sort of unkind conduct her daughter and soninlaw had driven her to that sad extremity it was only before the secretary of the great brewer m p and chairman of the charity who acting for his principal felt bound to be conscientiously inquisitive as to the real circumstances of the applicant that she had burst into tears outright and aloud as a cornered woman will weep  the thin and polite gentleman after contemplating her with an air of being “struck all of a heap” abandoned his position under the cover of soothing remarks  she must not distress herself  the deed of the charity did not absolutely specify “childless widows”  in fact it did not by any means disqualify her  but the discretion of the committee must be an informed discretion  one could understand very well her unwillingness to be a burden etc etc thereupon to his profound disappointment mrs verloc’s mother wept some more with an augmented vehemence  the tears of that large female in a dark dusty wig and ancient silk dress festooned with dingy white cotton lace were the tears of genuine distress  she had wept because she was heroic and unscrupulous and full of love for both her children  girls frequently get sacrificed to the welfare of the boys  in this case she was sacrificing winnie  by the suppression of truth she was slandering her  of course winnie was independent and need not care for the opinion of people that she would never see and who would never see her whereas poor stevie had nothing in the world he could call his own except his mother’s heroism and unscrupulousness  the first sense of security following on winnie’s marriage wore off in time for nothing lasts and mrs verloc’s mother in the seclusion of the back bedroom had recalled the teaching of that experience which the world impresses upon a widowed woman  but she had recalled it without vain bitterness her store of resignation amounted almost to dignity she reflected stoically that everything decays wears out in this world that the way of kindness should be made easy to the well disposed that her daughter winnie was a most devoted sister and a very selfconfident wife indeed  as regards winnie’s sisterly devotion her stoicism flinched  she excepted that sentiment from the rule of decay affecting all things human and some things divine  she could not help it not to do so would have frightened her too much  but in considering the conditions of her daughter’s married state she rejected firmly all flattering illusions  she took the cold and reasonable view that the less strain put on mr verloc’s kindness the longer its effects were likely to last  that excellent man loved his wife of course but he would no doubt prefer to keep as few of her relations as was consistent with the proper display of that sentiment  it would be better if its whole effect were concentrated on poor stevie  and the heroic old woman resolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion and as a move of deep policy  the “virtue” of this policy consisted in this mrs verloc’s mother was subtle in her way that stevie’s moral claim would be strengthened  the poor boy—a good useful boy if a little peculiar—had not a sufficient standing  he had been taken over with his mother somewhat in the same way as the furniture of the belgravian mansion had been taken over as if on the ground of belonging to her exclusively  what will happen she asked herself for mrs verloc’s mother was in a measure imaginative when i die  and when she asked herself that question it was with dread it was also terrible to think that she would not then have the means of knowing what happened to the poor boy  but by making him over to his sister by going thus away she gave him the advantage of a directly dependent position  this was the more subtle sanction of mrs verloc’s mother’s heroism and unscrupulousness  her act of abandonment was really an arrangement for settling her son permanently in life  other people made material sacrifices for such an object she in that way  it was the only way  moreover she would be able to see how it worked  ill or well she would avoid the horrible incertitude on the deathbed  but it was hard hard cruelly hard  the cab rattled jingled jolted in fact the last was quite extraordinary  by its disproportionate violence and magnitude it obliterated every sensation of onward movement and the effect was of being shaken in a stationary apparatus like a mediæval device for the punishment of crime or some very newfangled invention for the cure of a sluggish liver  it was extremely distressing and the raising of mrs verloc’s mother’s voice sounded like a wail of pain  “i know my dear you’ll come to see me as often as you can spare the time  won’t you”  “of course” answered winnie shortly staring straight before her  and the cab jolted in front of a steamy greasy shop in a blaze of gas and in the smell of fried fish  the old woman raised a wail again  “and my dear i must see that poor boy every sunday  he won’t mind spending the day with his old mother—”  winnie screamed out stolidly  “mind  i should think not  that poor boy will miss you something cruel i wish you had thought a little of that mother”  not think of it  the heroic woman swallowed a playful and inconvenient object like a billiard ball which had tried to jump out of her throat winnie sat mute for a while pouting at the front of the cab then snapped out which was an unusual tone with her  “i expect i’ll have a job with him at first he’ll be that restless—”  “whatever you do don’t let him worry your husband my dear”  thus they discussed on familiar lines the bearings of a new situation and the cab jolted  mrs verloc’s mother expressed some misgivings could stevie be trusted to come all that way alone  winnie maintained that he was much less “absentminded” now  they agreed as to that  it could not be denied  much less—hardly at all  they shouted at each other in the jingle with comparative cheerfulness  but suddenly the maternal anxiety broke out afresh  there were two omnibuses to take and a short walk between  it was too difficult  the old woman gave way to grief and consternation  winnie stared forward  “don’t you upset yourself like this mother  you must see him of course”  “no my dear  i’ll try not to”  she mopped her streaming eyes  “but you can’t spare the time to come with him and if he should forget himself and lose his way and somebody spoke to him sharply his name and address may slip his memory and he’ll remain lost for days and days—”  the vision of a workhouse infirmary for poor stevie—if only during inquiries—wrung her heart  for she was a proud woman  winnie’s stare had grown hard intent inventive  “i can’t bring him to you myself every week” she cried  “but don’t you worry mother  i’ll see to it that he don’t get lost for long”  they felt a peculiar bump a vision of brick pillars lingered before the rattling windows of the cab a sudden cessation of atrocious jolting and uproarious jingling dazed the two women  what had happened  they sat motionless and scared in the profound stillness till the door came open and a rough strained whispering was heard  “here you are”  a range of gabled little houses each with one dim yellow window on the ground floor surrounded the dark open space of a grass plot planted with shrubs and railed off from the patchwork of lights and shadows in the wide road resounding with the dull rumble of traffic  before the door of one of these tiny houses—one without a light in the little downstairs window—the cab had come to a standstill  mrs verloc’s mother got out first backwards with a key in her hand  winnie lingered on the flagstone path to pay the cabman  stevie after helping to carry inside a lot of small parcels came out and stood under the light of a gaslamp belonging to the charity  the cabman looked at the pieces of silver which appearing very minute in his big grimy palm symbolised the insignificant results which reward the ambitious courage and toil of a mankind whose day is short on this earth of evil  he had been paid decently—four oneshilling pieces—and he contemplated them in perfect stillness as if they had been the surprising terms of a melancholy problem  the slow transfer of that treasure to an inner pocket demanded much laborious groping in the depths of decayed clothing his form was squat and without flexibility  stevie slender his shoulders a little up and his hands thrust deep in the side pockets of his warm overcoat stood at the edge of the path pouting  the cabman pausing in his deliberate movements seemed struck by some misty recollection  “oh  ’ere you are young fellow” he whispered  “you’ll know him again—won’t you”  stevie was staring at the horse whose hind quarters appeared unduly elevated by the effect of emaciation  the little stiff tail seemed to have been fitted in for a heartless joke and at the other end the thin flat neck like a plank covered with old horsehide drooped to the ground under the weight of an enormous bony head  the ears hung at different angles negligently and the macabre figure of that mute dweller on the earth steamed straight up from ribs and backbone in the muggy stillness of the air  the cabman struck lightly stevie’s breast with the iron hook protruding from a ragged greasy sleeve  “look ’ere young feller  ’ow’d you like to sit behind this ’oss up to two o’clock in the morning p’raps”  stevie looked vacantly into the fierce little eyes with rededged lids  “he ain’t lame” pursued the other whispering with energy  “he ain’t got no sore places on ’im  ’ere he is  ’ow would you like—”  his strained extinct voice invested his utterance with a character of vehement secrecy  stevie’s vacant gaze was changing slowly into dread  “you may well look  till three and four o’clock in the morning  cold and ’ungry  looking for fares  drunks”  his jovial purple cheeks bristled with white hairs and like virgil’s silenus who his face smeared with the juice of berries discoursed of olympian gods to the innocent shepherds of sicily he talked to stevie of domestic matters and the affairs of men whose sufferings are great and immortality by no means assured  “i am a night cabby i am” he whispered with a sort of boastful exasperation  “i’ve got to take out what they will blooming well give me at the yard  i’ve got my missus and four kids at ’ome”  the monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed to strike the world dumb  a silence reigned during which the flanks of the old horse the steed of apocalyptic misery smoked upwards in the light of the charitable gaslamp  the cabman grunted then added in his mysterious whisper  “this ain’t an easy world”  stevie’s face had been twitching for some time and at last his feelings burst out in their usual concise form  “bad  bad”  his gaze remained fixed on the ribs of the horse selfconscious and sombre as though he were afraid to look about him at the badness of the world  and his slenderness his rosy lips and pale clear complexion gave him the aspect of a delicate boy notwithstanding the fluffy growth of golden hair on his cheeks  he pouted in a scared way like a child the cabman short and broad eyed him with his fierce little eyes that seemed to smart in a clear and corroding liquid  “’ard on ’osses but dam’ sight ’arder on poor chaps like me” he wheezed just audibly  “poor  poor” stammered out stevie pushing his hands deeper into his pockets with convulsive sympathy  he could say nothing for the tenderness to all pain and all misery the desire to make the horse happy and the cabman happy had reached the point of a bizarre longing to take them to bed with him  and that he knew was impossible  for stevie was not mad  it was as it were a symbolic longing and at the same time it was very distinct because springing from experience the mother of wisdom  thus when as a child he cowered in a dark corner scared wretched sore and miserable with the black black misery of the soul his sister winnie used to come along and carry him off to bed with her as into a heaven of consoling peace  stevie though apt to forget mere facts such as his name and address for instance had a faithful memory of sensations  to be taken into a bed of compassion was the supreme remedy with the only one disadvantage of being difficult of application on a large scale  and looking at the cabman stevie perceived this clearly because he was reasonable  the cabman went on with his leisurely preparations as if stevie had not existed  he made as if to hoist himself on the box but at the last moment from some obscure motive perhaps merely from disgust with carriage exercise desisted  he approached instead the motionless partner of his labours and stooping to seize the bridle lifted up the big weary head to the height of his shoulder with one effort of his right arm like a feat of strength  “come on” he whispered secretly  limping he led the cab away  there was an air of austerity in this departure the scrunched gravel of the drive crying out under the slowly turning wheels the horse’s lean thighs moving with ascetic deliberation away from the light into the obscurity of the open space bordered dimly by the pointed roofs and the feebly shining windows of the little almshouses  the plaint of the gravel travelled slowly all round the drive  between the lamps of the charitable gateway the slow cortege reappeared lighted up for a moment the short thick man limping busily with the horse’s head held aloft in his fist the lank animal walking in stiff and forlorn dignity the dark low box on wheels rolling behind comically with an air of waddling  they turned to the left  there was a pub down the street within fifty yards of the gate  stevie left alone beside the private lamppost of the charity his hands thrust deep into his pockets glared with vacant sulkiness  at the bottom of his pockets his incapable weak hands were clinched hard into a pair of angry fists  in the face of anything which affected directly or indirectly his morbid dread of pain stevie ended by turning vicious  a magnanimous indignation swelled his frail chest to bursting and caused his candid eyes to squint  supremely wise in knowing his own powerlessness stevie was not wise enough to restrain his passions  the tenderness of his universal charity had two phases as indissolubly joined and connected as the reverse and obverse sides of a medal  the anguish of immoderate compassion was succeeded by the pain of an innocent but pitiless rage  those two states expressing themselves outwardly by the same signs of futile bodily agitation his sister winnie soothed his excitement without ever fathoming its twofold character  mrs verloc wasted no portion of this transient life in seeking for fundamental information  this is a sort of economy having all the appearances and some of the advantages of prudence  obviously it may be good for one not to know too much  and such a view accords very well with constitutional indolence  on that evening on which it may be said that mrs verloc’s mother having parted for good from her children had also departed this life winnie verloc did not investigate her brother’s psychology  the poor boy was excited of course  after once more assuring the old woman on the threshold that she would know how to guard against the risk of stevie losing himself for very long on his pilgrimages of filial piety she took her brother’s arm to walk away  stevie did not even mutter to himself but with the special sense of sisterly devotion developed in her earliest infancy she felt that the boy was very much excited indeed  holding tight to his arm under the appearance of leaning on it she thought of some words suitable to the occasion  “now stevie you must look well after me at the crossings and get first into the ’bus like a good brother”  this appeal to manly protection was received by stevie with his usual docility  it flattered him  he raised his head and threw out his chest  “don’t be nervous winnie  mustn’t be nervous  ’bus all right” he answered in a brusque slurring stammer partaking of the timorousness of a child and the resolution of a man  he advanced fearlessly with the woman on his arm but his lower lip dropped  nevertheless on the pavement of the squalid and wide thoroughfare whose poverty in all the amenities of life stood foolishly exposed by a mad profusion of gaslights their resemblance to each other was so pronounced as to strike the casual passersby  before the doors of the publichouse at the corner where the profusion of gaslight reached the height of positive wickedness a fourwheeled cab standing by the curbstone with no one on the box seemed cast out into the gutter on account of irremediable decay  mrs verloc recognised the conveyance  its aspect was so profoundly lamentable with such a perfection of grotesque misery and weirdness of macabre detail as if it were the cab of death itself that mrs verloc with that ready compassion of a woman for a horse when she is not sitting behind him exclaimed vaguely  “poor brute”  hanging back suddenly stevie inflicted an arresting jerk upon his sister  “poor  poor” he ejaculated appreciatively  “cabman poor too  he told me himself”  the contemplation of the infirm and lonely steed overcame him  jostled but obstinate he would remain there trying to express the view newly opened to his sympathies of the human and equine misery in close association  but it was very difficult  “poor brute poor people” was all he could repeat  it did not seem forcible enough and he came to a stop with an angry splutter “shame”  stevie was no master of phrases and perhaps for that very reason his thoughts lacked clearness and precision  but he felt with greater completeness and some profundity that little word contained all his sense of indignation and horror at one sort of wretchedness having to feed upon the anguish of the other—at the poor cabman beating the poor horse in the name as it were of his poor kids at home  and stevie knew what it was to be beaten  he knew it from experience  it was a bad world  bad  bad  mrs verloc his only sister guardian and protector could not pretend to such depths of insight  moreover she had not experienced the magic of the cabman’s eloquence  she was in the dark as to the inwardness of the word “shame”  and she said placidly  “come along stevie  you can’t help that”  the docile stevie went along but now he went along without pride shamblingly and muttering half words and even words that would have been whole if they had not been made up of halves that did not belong to each other  it was as though he had been trying to fit all the words he could remember to his sentiments in order to get some sort of corresponding idea  and as a matter of fact he got it at last  he hung back to utter it at once  “bad world for poor people”  directly he had expressed that thought he became aware that it was familiar to him already in all its consequences  this circumstance strengthened his conviction immensely but also augmented his indignation  somebody he felt ought to be punished for it—punished with great severity  being no sceptic but a moral creature he was in a manner at the mercy of his righteous passions  “beastly” he added concisely  it was clear to mrs verloc that he was greatly excited  “nobody can help that” she said  “do come along  is that the way you’re taking care of me”  stevie mended his pace obediently  he prided himself on being a good brother  his morality which was very complete demanded that from him yet he was pained at the information imparted by his sister winnie who was good  nobody could help that  he came along gloomily but presently he brightened up  like the rest of mankind perplexed by the mystery of the universe he had his moments of consoling trust in the organised powers of the earth  “police” he suggested confidently  “the police aren’t for that” observed mrs verloc cursorily hurrying on her way  stevie’s face lengthened considerably  he was thinking  the more intense his thinking the slacker was the droop of his lower jaw  and it was with an aspect of hopeless vacancy that he gave up his intellectual enterprise  “not for that” he mumbled resigned but surprised  “not for that”  he had formed for himself an ideal conception of the metropolitan police as a sort of benevolent institution for the suppression of evil  the notion of benevolence especially was very closely associated with his sense of the power of the men in blue  he had liked all police constables tenderly with a guileless trustfulness  and he was pained  he was irritated too by a suspicion of duplicity in the members of the force for stevie was frank and as open as the day himself  what did they mean by pretending then  unlike his sister who put her trust in face values he wished to go to the bottom of the matter  he carried on his inquiry by means of an angry challenge  “what for are they then winn  what are they for  tell me”  winnie disliked controversy  but fearing most a fit of black depression consequent on stevie missing his mother very much at first she did not altogether decline the discussion  guiltless of all irony she answered yet in a form which was not perhaps unnatural in the wife of mr verloc delegate of the central red committee personal friend of certain anarchists and a votary of social revolution  “don’t you know what the police are for stevie  they are there so that them as have nothing shouldn’t take anything away from them who have”  she avoided using the verb “to steal” because it always made her brother uncomfortable  for stevie was delicately honest  certain simple principles had been instilled into him so anxiously on account of his “queerness” that the mere names of certain transgressions filled him with horror  he had been always easily impressed by speeches  he was impressed and startled now and his intelligence was very alert  “what” he asked at once anxiously  “not even if they were hungry mustn’t they”  the two had paused in their walk  “not if they were ever so” said mrs verloc with the equanimity of a person untroubled by the problem of the distribution of wealth and exploring the perspective of the roadway for an omnibus of the right colour  “certainly not  but what’s the use of talking about all that you aren’t ever hungry”  she cast a swift glance at the boy like a young man by her side  she saw him amiable attractive affectionate and only a little a very little peculiar  and she could not see him otherwise for he was connected with what there was of the salt of passion in her tasteless life—the passion of indignation of courage of pity and even of selfsacrifice  she did not add “and you aren’t likely ever to be as long as i live”  but she might very well have done so since she had taken effectual steps to that end  mr verloc was a very good husband it was her honest impression that nobody could help liking the boy  she cried out suddenly  “quick stevie  stop that green ’bus”  and stevie tremulous and important with his sister winnie on his arm flung up the other high above his head at the approaching ’bus with complete success  an hour afterwards mr verloc raised his eyes from a newspaper he was reading or at any rate looking at behind the counter and in the expiring clatter of the doorbell beheld winnie his wife enter and cross the shop on her way upstairs followed by stevie his brotherinlaw  the sight of his wife was agreeable to mr verloc  it was his idiosyncrasy  the figure of his brotherinlaw remained imperceptible to him because of the morose thoughtfulness that lately had fallen like a veil between mr verloc and the appearances of the world of senses  he looked after his wife fixedly without a word as though she had been a phantom  his voice for home use was husky and placid but now it was heard not at all  it was not heard at supper to which he was called by his wife in the usual brief manner “adolf”  he sat down to consume it without conviction wearing his hat pushed far back on his head  it was not devotion to an outdoor life but the frequentation of foreign cafés which was responsible for that habit investing with a character of unceremonious impermanency mr verloc’s steady fidelity to his own fireside  twice at the clatter of the cracked bell he arose without a word disappeared into the shop and came back silently during these absences mrs verloc becoming acutely aware of the vacant place at her right hand missed her mother very much and stared stonily while stevie from the same reason kept on shuffling his feet as though the floor under the table were uncomfortably hot  when mr verloc returned to sit in his place like the very embodiment of silence the character of mrs verloc’s stare underwent a subtle change and stevie ceased to fidget with his feet because of his great and awed regard for his sister’s husband  he directed at him glances of respectful compassion  mr verloc was sorry  his sister winnie had impressed upon him in the omnibus that mr verloc would be found at home in a state of sorrow and must not be worried  his father’s anger the irritability of gentlemen lodgers and mr verloc’s predisposition to immoderate grief had been the main sanctions of stevie’s selfrestraint  of these sentiments all easily provoked but not always easy to understand the last had the greatest moral efficiency—because mr verloc was good  his mother and his sister had established that ethical fact on an unshakable foundation  they had established erected consecrated it behind mr verloc’s back for reasons that had nothing to do with abstract morality and mr verloc was not aware of it  it is but bare justice to him to say that he had no notion of appearing good to stevie  yet so it was  he was even the only man so qualified in stevie’s knowledge because the gentlemen lodgers had been too transient and too remote to have anything very distinct about them but perhaps their boots and as regards the disciplinary measures of his father the desolation of his mother and sister shrank from setting up a theory of goodness before the victim  it would have been too cruel  and it was even possible that stevie would not have believed them  as far as mr verloc was concerned nothing could stand in the way of stevie’s belief  mr verloc was obviously yet mysteriously good  and the grief of a good man is august  stevie gave glances of reverential compassion to his brotherinlaw  mr verloc was sorry  the brother of winnie had never before felt himself in such close communion with the mystery of that man’s goodness  it was an understandable sorrow  and stevie himself was sorry  he was very sorry the same sort of sorrow  and his attention being drawn to this unpleasant state stevie shuffled his feet  his feelings were habitually manifested by the agitation of his limbs  “keep your feet quiet dear” said mrs verloc with authority and tenderness then turning towards her husband in an indifferent voice the masterly achievement of instinctive tact “are you going out tonight” she asked  the mere suggestion seemed repugnant to mr verloc  he shook his head moodily and then sat still with downcast eyes looking at the piece of cheese on his plate for a whole minute  at the end of that time he got up and went out—went right out in the clatter of the shopdoor bell  he acted thus inconsistently not from any desire to make himself unpleasant but because of an unconquerable restlessness  it was no earthly good going out  he could not find anywhere in london what he wanted  but he went out  he led a cortege of dismal thoughts along dark streets through lighted streets in and out of two flash bars as if in a halfhearted attempt to make a night of it and finally back again to his menaced home where he sat down fatigued behind the counter and they crowded urgently round him like a pack of hungry black hounds  after locking up the house and putting out the gas he took them upstairs with him—a dreadful escort for a man going to bed  his wife had preceded him some time before and with her ample form defined vaguely under the counterpane her head on the pillow and a hand under the cheek offered to his distraction the view of early drowsiness arguing the possession of an equable soul  her big eyes stared wide open inert and dark against the snowy whiteness of the linen  she did not move  she had an equable soul  she felt profoundly that things do not stand much looking into  she made her force and her wisdom of that instinct but the taciturnity of mr verloc had been lying heavily upon her for a good many days  it was as a matter of fact affecting her nerves recumbent and motionless she said placidly  “you’ll catch cold walking about in your socks like this”  this speech becoming the solicitude of the wife and the prudence of the woman took mr verloc unawares  he had left his boots downstairs but he had forgotten to put on his slippers and he had been turning about the bedroom on noiseless pads like a bear in a cage  at the sound of his wife’s voice he stopped and stared at her with a somnambulistic expressionless gaze so long that mrs verloc moved her limbs slightly under the bedclothes  but she did not move her black head sunk in the white pillow one hand under her cheek and the big dark unwinking eyes  under her husband’s expressionless stare and remembering her mother’s empty room across the landing she felt an acute pang of loneliness  she had never been parted from her mother before  they had stood by each other  she felt that they had and she said to herself that now mother was gone—gone for good  mrs verloc had no illusions  stevie remained however  and she said  “mother’s done what she wanted to do  there’s no sense in it that i can see  i’m sure she couldn’t have thought you had enough of her  it’s perfectly wicked leaving us like that”  mr verloc was not a wellread person his range of allusive phrases was limited but there was a peculiar aptness in circumstances which made him think of rats leaving a doomed ship  he very nearly said so  he had grown suspicious and embittered  could it be that the old woman had such an excellent nose  but the unreasonableness of such a suspicion was patent and mr verloc held his tongue  not altogether however  he muttered heavily  “perhaps it’s just as well”  he began to undress  mrs verloc kept very still perfectly still with her eyes fixed in a dreamy quiet stare  and her heart for the fraction of a second seemed to stand still too  that night she was “not quite herself” as the saying is and it was borne upon her with some force that a simple sentence may hold several diverse meanings—mostly disagreeable  how was it just as well  and why  but she did not allow herself to fall into the idleness of barren speculation  she was rather confirmed in her belief that things did not stand being looked into practical and subtle in her way she brought stevie to the front without loss of time because in her the singleness of purpose had the unerring nature and the force of an instinct  “what i am going to do to cheer up that boy for the first few days i’m sure i don’t know  he’ll be worrying himself from morning till night before he gets used to mother being away  and he’s such a good boy  i couldn’t do without him”  mr verloc went on divesting himself of his clothing with the unnoticing inward concentration of a man undressing in the solitude of a vast and hopeless desert  for thus inhospitably did this fair earth our common inheritance present itself to the mental vision of mr verloc  all was so still without and within that the lonely ticking of the clock on the landing stole into the room as if for the sake of company  mr verloc getting into bed on his own side remained prone and mute behind mrs verloc’s back  his thick arms rested abandoned on the outside of the counterpane like dropped weapons like discarded tools  at that moment he was within a hair’s breadth of making a clean breast of it all to his wife  the moment seemed propitious  looking out of the corners of his eyes he saw her ample shoulders draped in white the back of her head with the hair done for the night in three plaits tied up with black tapes at the ends  and he forbore  mr verloc loved his wife as a wife should be loved—that is maritally with the regard one has for one’s chief possession  this head arranged for the night those ample shoulders had an aspect of familiar sacredness—the sacredness of domestic peace  she moved not massive and shapeless like a recumbent statue in the rough he remembered her wideopen eyes looking into the empty room  she was mysterious with the mysteriousness of living beings  the farfamed secret agent delta of the late baron stottwartenheim’s alarmist despatches was not the man to break into such mysteries  he was easily intimidated  and he was also indolent with the indolence which is so often the secret of good nature  he forbore touching that mystery out of love timidity and indolence  there would be always time enough  for several minutes he bore his sufferings silently in the drowsy silence of the room  and then he disturbed it by a resolute declaration  “i am going on the continent tomorrow”  his wife might have fallen asleep already  he could not tell  as a matter of fact mrs verloc had heard him  her eyes remained very wide open and she lay very still confirmed in her instinctive conviction that things don’t bear looking into very much  and yet it was nothing very unusual for mr verloc to take such a trip  he renewed his stock from paris and brussels  often he went over to make his purchases personally  a little select connection of amateurs was forming around the shop in brett street a secret connection eminently proper for any business undertaken by mr verloc who by a mystic accord of temperament and necessity had been set apart to be a secret agent all his life  he waited for a while then added “i’ll be away a week or perhaps a fortnight  get mrs neale to come for the day”  mrs neale was the charwoman of brett street  victim of her marriage with a debauched joiner she was oppressed by the needs of many infant children  redarmed and aproned in coarse sacking up to the armpits she exhaled the anguish of the poor in a breath of soapsuds and rum in the uproar of scrubbing in the clatter of tin pails  mrs verloc full of deep purpose spoke in the tone of the shallowest indifference  “there is no need to have the woman here all day  i shall do very well with stevie”  she let the lonely clock on the landing count off fifteen ticks into the abyss of eternity and asked  “shall i put the light out”  mr verloc snapped at his wife huskily  “put it out”     chapter ix   mr verloc returning from the continent at the end of ten days brought back a mind evidently unrefreshed by the wonders of foreign travel and a countenance unlighted by the joys of homecoming  he entered in the clatter of the shop bell with an air of sombre and vexed exhaustion  his bag in hand his head lowered he strode straight behind the counter and let himself fall into the chair as though he had tramped all the way from dover  it was early morning  stevie dusting various objects displayed in the front windows turned to gape at him with reverence and awe  “here” said mr verloc giving a slight kick to the gladstone bag on the floor and stevie flung himself upon it seized it bore it off with triumphant devotion  he was so prompt that mr verloc was distinctly surprised  already at the clatter of the shop bell mrs neale blackleading the parlour grate had looked through the door and rising from her knees had gone aproned and grimy with everlasting toil to tell mrs verloc in the kitchen that “there was the master come back”  winnie came no farther than the inner shop door  “you’ll want some breakfast” she said from a distance  mr verloc moved his hands slightly as if overcome by an impossible suggestion  but once enticed into the parlour he did not reject the food set before him  he ate as if in a public place his hat pushed off his forehead the skirts of his heavy overcoat hanging in a triangle on each side of the chair  and across the length of the table covered with brown oilcloth winnie his wife talked evenly at him the wifely talk as artfully adapted no doubt to the circumstances of this return as the talk of penelope to the return of the wandering odysseus  mrs verloc however had done no weaving during her husband’s absence  but she had had all the upstairs room cleaned thoroughly had sold some wares had seen mr michaelis several times  he had told her the last time that he was going away to live in a cottage in the country somewhere on the london chatham and dover line  karl yundt had come too once led under the arm by that “wicked old housekeeper of his”  he was “a disgusting old man”  of comrade ossipon whom she had received curtly entrenched behind the counter with a stony face and a faraway gaze she said nothing her mental reference to the robust anarchist being marked by a short pause with the faintest possible blush  and bringing in her brother stevie as soon as she could into the current of domestic events she mentioned that the boy had moped a good deal  “it’s all along of mother leaving us like this”  mr verloc neither said “damn” nor yet “stevie be hanged”  and mrs verloc not let into the secret of his thoughts failed to appreciate the generosity of this restraint  “it isn’t that he doesn’t work as well as ever” she continued  “he’s been making himself very useful  you’d think he couldn’t do enough for us”  mr verloc directed a casual and somnolent glance at stevie who sat on his right delicate palefaced his rosy mouth open vacantly  it was not a critical glance  it had no intention  and if mr verloc thought for a moment that his wife’s brother looked uncommonly useless it was only a dull and fleeting thought devoid of that force and durability which enables sometimes a thought to move the world  leaning back mr verloc uncovered his head  before his extended arm could put down the hat stevie pounced upon it and bore it off reverently into the kitchen and again mr verloc was surprised  “you could do anything with that boy adolf” mrs verloc said with her best air of inflexible calmness  “he would go through fire for you he—”  she paused attentive her ear turned towards the door of the kitchen  there mrs neale was scrubbing the floor  at stevie’s appearance she groaned lamentably having observed that he could be induced easily to bestow for the benefit of her infant children the shilling his sister winnie presented him with from time to time  on all fours amongst the puddles wet and begrimed like a sort of amphibious and domestic animal living in ashbins and dirty water she uttered the usual exordium “it’s all very well for you kept doing nothing like a gentleman”  and she followed it with the everlasting plaint of the poor pathetically mendacious miserably authenticated by the horrible breath of cheap rum and soapsuds  she scrubbed hard snuffling all the time and talking volubly  and she was sincere  and on each side of her thin red nose her bleared misty eyes swam in tears because she felt really the want of some sort of stimulant in the morning  in the parlour mrs verloc observed with knowledge  “there’s mrs neale at it again with her harrowing tales about her little children  they can’t be all so little as she makes them out  some of them must be big enough by now to try to do something for themselves  it only makes stevie angry”  these words were confirmed by a thud as of a fist striking the kitchen table  in the normal evolution of his sympathy stevie had become angry on discovering that he had no shilling in his pocket  in his inability to relieve at once mrs neale’s “little ’uns’” privations he felt that somebody should be made to suffer for it  mrs verloc rose and went into the kitchen to “stop that nonsense”  and she did it firmly but gently she was well aware that directly mrs neale received her money she went round the corner to drink ardent spirits in a mean and musty publichouse—the unavoidable station on the via dolorosa of her life mrs verloc’s comment upon this practice had an unexpected profundity as coming from a person disinclined to look under the surface of things “of course what is she to do to keep up  if i were like mrs neale i expect i wouldn’t act any different”  in the afternoon of the same day as mr verloc coming with a start out of the last of a long series of dozes before the parlour fire declared his intention of going out for a walk winnie said from the shop  “i wish you would take that boy out with you adolf”  for the third time that day mr verloc was surprised  he stared stupidly at his wife  she continued in her steady manner  the boy whenever he was not doing anything moped in the house  it made her uneasy it made her nervous she confessed  and that from the calm winnie sounded like exaggeration  but in truth stevie moped in the striking fashion of an unhappy domestic animal  he would go up on the dark landing to sit on the floor at the foot of the tall clock with his knees drawn up and his head in his hands  to come upon his pallid face with its big eyes gleaming in the dusk was discomposing to think of him up there was uncomfortable  mr verloc got used to the startling novelty of the idea  he was fond of his wife as a man should be—that is generously  but a weighty objection presented itself to his mind and he formulated it  “he’ll lose sight of me perhaps and get lost in the street” he said  mrs verloc shook her head competently  “he won’t  you don’t know him  that boy just worships you  but if you should miss him—”  mrs verloc paused for a moment but only for a moment  “you just go on and have your walk out  don’t worry  he’ll be all right  he’s sure to turn up safe here before very long”  this optimism procured for mr verloc his fourth surprise of the day  “is he” he grunted doubtfully  but perhaps his brotherinlaw was not such an idiot as he looked  his wife would know best  he turned away his heavy eyes saying huskily “well let him come along then” and relapsed into the clutches of black care that perhaps prefers to sit behind a horseman but knows also how to tread close on the heels of people not sufficiently well off to keep horses—like mr verloc for instance  winnie at the shop door did not see this fatal attendant upon mr verloc’s walks  she watched the two figures down the squalid street one tall and burly the other slight and short with a thin neck and the peaked shoulders raised slightly under the large semitransparent ears the material of their overcoats was the same their hats were black and round in shape  inspired by the similarity of wearing apparel mrs verloc gave rein to her fancy  “might be father and son” she said to herself  she thought also that mr verloc was as much of a father as poor stevie ever had in his life  she was aware also that it was her work  and with peaceful pride she congratulated herself on a certain resolution she had taken a few years before  it had cost her some effort and even a few tears  she congratulated herself still more on observing in the course of days that mr verloc seemed to be taking kindly to stevie’s companionship now when ready to go out for his walk mr verloc called aloud to the boy in the spirit no doubt in which a man invites the attendance of the household dog though of course in a different manner  in the house mr verloc could be detected staring curiously at stevie a good deal  his own demeanour had changed  taciturn still he was not so listless  mrs verloc thought that he was rather jumpy at times  it might have been regarded as an improvement  as to stevie he moped no longer at the foot of the clock but muttered to himself in corners instead in a threatening tone  when asked “what is it you’re saying stevie” he merely opened his mouth and squinted at his sister  at odd times he clenched his fists without apparent cause and when discovered in solitude would be scowling at the wall with the sheet of paper and the pencil given him for drawing circles lying blank and idle on the kitchen table  this was a change but it was no improvement  mrs verloc including all these vagaries under the general definition of excitement began to fear that stevie was hearing more than was good for him of her husband’s conversations with his friends  during his “walks” mr verloc of course met and conversed with various persons  it could hardly be otherwise  his walks were an integral part of his outdoor activities which his wife had never looked deeply into  mrs verloc felt that the position was delicate but she faced it with the same impenetrable calmness which impressed and even astonished the customers of the shop and made the other visitors keep their distance a little wonderingly no  she feared that there were things not good for stevie to hear of she told her husband  it only excited the poor boy because he could not help them being so  nobody could  it was in the shop  mr verloc made no comment  he made no retort and yet the retort was obvious  but he refrained from pointing out to his wife that the idea of making stevie the companion of his walks was her own and nobody else’s  at that moment to an impartial observer mr verloc would have appeared more than human in his magnanimity  he took down a small cardboard box from a shelf peeped in to see that the contents were all right and put it down gently on the counter  not till that was done did he break the silence to the effect that most likely stevie would profit greatly by being sent out of town for a while only he supposed his wife could not get on without him  “could not get on without him” repeated mrs verloc slowly  “i couldn’t get on without him if it were for his good  the idea  of course i can get on without him  but there’s nowhere for him to go”  mr verloc got out some brown paper and a ball of string and meanwhile he muttered that michaelis was living in a little cottage in the country michaelis wouldn’t mind giving stevie a room to sleep in  there were no visitors and no talk there  michaelis was writing a book  mrs verloc declared her affection for michaelis mentioned her abhorrence of karl yundt “nasty old man” and of ossipon she said nothing  as to stevie he could be no other than very pleased  mr michaelis was always so nice and kind to him  he seemed to like the boy  well the boy was a good boy  “you too seem to have grown quite fond of him of late” she added after a pause with her inflexible assurance  mr verloc tying up the cardboard box into a parcel for the post broke the string by an injudicious jerk and muttered several swear words confidentially to himself  then raising his tone to the usual husky mutter he announced his willingness to take stevie into the country himself and leave him all safe with michaelis  he carried out this scheme on the very next day  stevie offered no objection  he seemed rather eager in a bewildered sort of way  he turned his candid gaze inquisitively to mr verloc’s heavy countenance at frequent intervals especially when his sister was not looking at him his expression was proud apprehensive and concentrated like that of a small child entrusted for the first time with a box of matches and the permission to strike a light  but mrs verloc gratified by her brother’s docility recommended him not to dirty his clothes unduly in the country at this stevie gave his sister guardian and protector a look which for the first time in his life seemed to lack the quality of perfect childlike trustfulness  it was haughtily gloomy  mrs verloc smiled  “goodness me  you needn’t be offended  you know you do get yourself very untidy when you get a chance stevie”  mr verloc was already gone some way down the street  thus in consequence of her mother’s heroic proceedings and of her brother’s absence on this villegiature mrs verloc found herself oftener than usual all alone not only in the shop but in the house  for mr verloc had to take his walks  she was alone longer than usual on the day of the attempted bomb outrage in greenwich park because mr verloc went out very early that morning and did not come back till nearly dusk  she did not mind being alone  she had no desire to go out  the weather was too bad and the shop was cosier than the streets  sitting behind the counter with some sewing she did not raise her eyes from her work when mr verloc entered in the aggressive clatter of the bell  she had recognised his step on the pavement outside  she did not raise her eyes but as mr verloc silent and with his hat rammed down upon his forehead made straight for the parlour door she said serenely  “what a wretched day  you’ve been perhaps to see stevie”  “no  i haven’t” said mr verloc softly and slammed the glazed parlour door behind him with unexpected energy  for some time mrs verloc remained quiescent with her work dropped in her lap before she put it away under the counter and got up to light the gas  this done she went into the parlour on her way to the kitchen  mr verloc would want his tea presently  confident of the power of her charms winnie did not expect from her husband in the daily intercourse of their married life a ceremonious amenity of address and courtliness of manner vain and antiquated forms at best probably never very exactly observed discarded nowadays even in the highest spheres and always foreign to the standards of her class  she did not look for courtesies from him  but he was a good husband and she had a loyal respect for his rights  mrs verloc would have gone through the parlour and on to her domestic duties in the kitchen with the perfect serenity of a woman sure of the power of her charms  but a slight very slight and rapid rattling sound grew upon her hearing  bizarre and incomprehensible it arrested mrs verloc’s attention  then as its character became plain to the ear she stopped short amazed and concerned  striking a match on the box she held in her hand she turned on and lighted above the parlour table one of the two gasburners which being defective first whistled as if astonished and then went on purring comfortably like a cat  mr verloc against his usual practice had thrown off his overcoat  it was lying on the sofa  his hat which he must also have thrown off rested overturned under the edge of the sofa  he had dragged a chair in front of the fireplace and his feet planted inside the fender his head held between his hands he was hanging low over the glowing grate  his teeth rattled with an ungovernable violence causing his whole enormous back to tremble at the same rate  mrs verloc was startled  “you’ve been getting wet” she said  “not very” mr verloc managed to falter out in a profound shudder  by a great effort he suppressed the rattling of his teeth  “i’ll have you laid up on my hands” she said with genuine uneasiness  “i don’t think so” remarked mr verloc snuffling huskily  he had certainly contrived somehow to catch an abominable cold between seven in the morning and five in the afternoon  mrs verloc looked at his bowed back  “where have you been today” she asked  “nowhere” answered mr verloc in a low choked nasal tone  his attitude suggested aggrieved sulks or a severe headache  the unsufficiency and uncandidness of his answer became painfully apparent in the dead silence of the room  he snuffled apologetically and added “i’ve been to the bank”  mrs verloc became attentive  “you have” she said dispassionately  “what for”  mr verloc mumbled with his nose over the grate and with marked unwillingness  “draw the money out”  “what do you mean  all of it”  “yes  all of it”  mrs verloc spread out with care the scanty tablecloth got two knives and two forks out of the table drawer and suddenly stopped in her methodical proceedings  “what did you do that for”  “may want it soon” snuffled vaguely mr verloc who was coming to the end of his calculated indiscretions  “i don’t know what you mean” remarked his wife in a tone perfectly casual but standing stock still between the table and the cupboard  “you know you can trust me” mr verloc remarked to the grate with hoarse feeling  mrs verloc turned slowly towards the cupboard saying with deliberation  “oh yes  i can trust you”  and she went on with her methodical proceedings  she laid two plates got the bread the butter going to and fro quietly between the table and the cupboard in the peace and silence of her home  on the point of taking out the jam she reflected practically “he will be feeling hungry having been away all day” and she returned to the cupboard once more to get the cold beef  she set it under the purring gasjet and with a passing glance at her motionless husband hugging the fire she went down two steps into the kitchen  it was only when coming back carving knife and fork in hand that she spoke again  “if i hadn’t trusted you i wouldn’t have married you”  bowed under the overmantel mr verloc holding his head in both hands seemed to have gone to sleep  winnie made the tea and called out in an undertone  “adolf”  mr verloc got up at once and staggered a little before he sat down at the table  his wife examining the sharp edge of the carving knife placed it on the dish and called his attention to the cold beef  he remained insensible to the suggestion with his chin on his breast  “you should feed your cold” mrs verloc said dogmatically  he looked up and shook his head  his eyes were bloodshot and his face red  his fingers had ruffled his hair into a dissipated untidiness altogether he had a disreputable aspect expressive of the discomfort the irritation and the gloom following a heavy debauch  but mr verloc was not a debauched man  in his conduct he was respectable  his appearance might have been the effect of a feverish cold  he drank three cups of tea but abstained from food entirely  he recoiled from it with sombre aversion when urged by mrs verloc who said at last  “aren’t your feet wet  you had better put on your slippers  you aren’t going out any more this evening”  mr verloc intimated by morose grunts and signs that his feet were not wet and that anyhow he did not care  the proposal as to slippers was disregarded as beneath his notice  but the question of going out in the evening received an unexpected development  it was not of going out in the evening that mr verloc was thinking  his thoughts embraced a vaster scheme  from moody and incomplete phrases it became apparent that mr verloc had been considering the expediency of emigrating  it was not very clear whether he had in his mind france or california  the utter unexpectedness improbability and inconceivableness of such an event robbed this vague declaration of all its effect  mrs verloc as placidly as if her husband had been threatening her with the end of the world said  “the idea”  mr verloc declared himself sick and tired of everything and besides—she interrupted him  “you’ve a bad cold”  it was indeed obvious that mr verloc was not in his usual state physically and even mentally  a sombre irresolution held him silent for a while  then he murmured a few ominous generalities on the theme of necessity  “will have to” repeated winnie sitting calmly back with folded arms opposite her husband  “i should like to know who’s to make you  you ain’t a slave  no one need be a slave in this country—and don’t you make yourself one”  she paused and with invincible and steady candour  “the business isn’t so bad” she went on  “you’ve a comfortable home”  she glanced all round the parlour from the corner cupboard to the good fire in the grate  ensconced cosily behind the shop of doubtful wares with the mysteriously dim window and its door suspiciously ajar in the obscure and narrow street it was in all essentials of domestic propriety and domestic comfort a respectable home  her devoted affection missed out of it her brother stevie now enjoying a damp villegiature in the kentish lanes under the care of mr michaelis  she missed him poignantly with all the force of her protecting passion  this was the boy’s home too—the roof the cupboard the stoked grate  on this thought mrs verloc rose and walking to the other end of the table said in the fulness of her heart  “and you are not tired of me”  mr verloc made no sound  winnie leaned on his shoulder from behind and pressed her lips to his forehead  thus she lingered  not a whisper reached them from the outside world  the sound of footsteps on the pavement died out in the discreet dimness of the shop  only the gasjet above the table went on purring equably in the brooding silence of the parlour  during the contact of that unexpected and lingering kiss mr verloc gripping with both hands the edges of his chair preserved a hieratic immobility  when the pressure was removed he let go the chair rose and went to stand before the fireplace  he turned no longer his back to the room  with his features swollen and an air of being drugged he followed his wife’s movements with his eyes  mrs verloc went about serenely clearing up the table  her tranquil voice commented the idea thrown out in a reasonable and domestic tone it wouldn’t stand examination  she condemned it from every point of view  but her only real concern was stevie’s welfare  he appeared to her thought in that connection as sufficiently “peculiar” not to be taken rashly abroad  and that was all  but talking round that vital point she approached absolute vehemence in her delivery  meanwhile with brusque movements she arrayed herself in an apron for the washing up of cups  and as if excited by the sound of her uncontradicted voice she went so far as to say in a tone almost tart  “if you go abroad you’ll have to go without me”  “you know i wouldn’t” said mr verloc huskily and the unresonant voice of his private life trembled with an enigmatical emotion  already mrs verloc was regretting her words  they had sounded more unkind than she meant them to be  they had also the unwisdom of unnecessary things  in fact she had not meant them at all  it was a sort of phrase that is suggested by the demon of perverse inspiration but she knew a way to make it as if it had not been  she turned her head over her shoulder and gave that man planted heavily in front of the fireplace a glance half arch half cruel out of her large eyes—a glance of which the winnie of the belgravian mansion days would have been incapable because of her respectability and her ignorance  but the man was her husband now and she was no longer ignorant  she kept it on him for a whole second with her grave face motionless like a mask while she said playfully  “you couldn’t  you would miss me too much”  mr verloc started forward  “exactly” he said in a louder tone throwing his arms out and making a step towards her  something wild and doubtful in his expression made it appear uncertain whether he meant to strangle or to embrace his wife but mrs verloc’s attention was called away from that manifestation by the clatter of the shop bell  “shop adolf  you go”  he stopped his arms came down slowly  “you go” repeated mrs verloc  “i’ve got my apron on”  mr verloc obeyed woodenly stonyeyed and like an automaton whose face had been painted red  and this resemblance to a mechanical figure went so far that he had an automaton’s absurd air of being aware of the machinery inside of him  he closed the parlour door and mrs verloc moving briskly carried the tray into the kitchen  she washed the cups and some other things before she stopped in her work to listen  no sound reached her  the customer was a long time in the shop  it was a customer because if he had not been mr verloc would have taken him inside  undoing the strings of her apron with a jerk she threw it on a chair and walked back to the parlour slowly  at that precise moment mr verloc entered from the shop  he had gone in red  he came out a strange papery white  his face losing its drugged feverish stupor had in that short time acquired a bewildered and harassed expression  he walked straight to the sofa and stood looking down at his overcoat lying there as though he were afraid to touch it  “what’s the matter” asked mrs verloc in a subdued voice  through the door left ajar she could see that the customer was not gone yet  “i find i’ll have to go out this evening” said mr verloc  he did not attempt to pick up his outer garment  without a word winnie made for the shop and shutting the door after her walked in behind the counter  she did not look overtly at the customer till she had established herself comfortably on the chair  but by that time she had noted that he was tall and thin and wore his moustaches twisted up  in fact he gave the sharp points a twist just then  his long bony face rose out of a turnedup collar  he was a little splashed a little wet  a dark man with the ridge of the cheekbone well defined under the slightly hollow temple  a complete stranger  not a customer either  mrs verloc looked at him placidly  “you came over from the continent” she said after a time  the long thin stranger without exactly looking at mrs verloc answered only by a faint and peculiar smile  mrs verloc’s steady incurious gaze rested on him  “you understand english don’t you”  “oh yes  i understand english”  there was nothing foreign in his accent except that he seemed in his slow enunciation to be taking pains with it  and mrs verloc in her varied experience had come to the conclusion that some foreigners could speak better english than the natives  she said looking at the door of the parlour fixedly  “you don’t think perhaps of staying in england for good”  the stranger gave her again a silent smile  he had a kindly mouth and probing eyes  and he shook his head a little sadly it seemed  “my husband will see you through all right  meantime for a few days you couldn’t do better than take lodgings with mr giugliani  continental hotel it’s called  private  it’s quiet  my husband will take you there”  “a good idea” said the thin dark man whose glance had hardened suddenly  “you knew mr verloc before—didn’t you  perhaps in france”  “i have heard of him” admitted the visitor in his slow painstaking tone which yet had a certain curtness of intention  there was a pause  then he spoke again in a far less elaborate manner  “your husband has not gone out to wait for me in the street by chance”  “in the street” repeated mrs verloc surprised  “he couldn’t  there’s no other door to the house”  for a moment she sat impassive then left her seat to go and peep through the glazed door  suddenly she opened it and disappeared into the parlour  mr verloc had done no more than put on his overcoat  but why he should remain afterwards leaning over the table propped up on his two arms as though he were feeling giddy or sick she could not understand  “adolf” she called out half aloud and when he had raised himself  “do you know that man” she asked rapidly  “i’ve heard of him” whispered uneasily mr verloc darting a wild glance at the door  mrs verloc’s fine incurious eyes lighted up with a flash of abhorrence  “one of karl yundt’s friends—beastly old man”  “no  no” protested mr verloc busy fishing for his hat  but when he got it from under the sofa he held it as if he did not know the use of a hat  “well—he’s waiting for you” said mrs verloc at last  “i say adolf he ain’t one of them embassy people you have been bothered with of late”  “bothered with embassy people” repeated mr verloc with a heavy start of surprise and fear  “who’s been talking to you of the embassy people”  “yourself”  “i  i  talked of the embassy to you”  mr verloc seemed scared and bewildered beyond measure  his wife explained  “you’ve been talking a little in your sleep of late adolf”  “what—what did i say  what do you know”  “nothing much  it seemed mostly nonsense  enough to let me guess that something worried you”  mr verloc rammed his hat on his head  a crimson flood of anger ran over his face  “nonsense—eh  the embassy people  i would cut their hearts out one after another  but let them look out  i’ve got a tongue in my head”  he fumed pacing up and down between the table and the sofa his open overcoat catching against the angles  the red flood of anger ebbed out and left his face all white with quivering nostrils  mrs verloc for the purposes of practical existence put down these appearances to the cold  “well” she said “get rid of the man whoever he is as soon as you can and come back home to me  you want looking after for a day or two”  mr verloc calmed down and with resolution imprinted on his pale face had already opened the door when his wife called him back in a whisper  “adolf  adolf”  he came back startled  “what about that money you drew out” she asked  “you’ve got it in your pocket  hadn’t you better—”  mr verloc gazed stupidly into the palm of his wife’s extended hand for some time before he slapped his brow  “money  yes  yes  i didn’t know what you meant”  he drew out of his breast pocket a new pigskin pocketbook  mrs verloc received it without another word and stood still till the bell clattering after mr verloc and mr verloc’s visitor had quieted down only then she peeped in at the amount drawing the notes out for the purpose  after this inspection she looked round thoughtfully with an air of mistrust in the silence and solitude of the house  this abode of her married life appeared to her as lonely and unsafe as though it had been situated in the midst of a forest  no receptacle she could think of amongst the solid heavy furniture seemed other but flimsy and particularly tempting to her conception of a housebreaker  it was an ideal conception endowed with sublime faculties and a miraculous insight  the till was not to be thought of  it was the first spot a thief would make for  mrs verloc unfastening hastily a couple of hooks slipped the pocketbook under the bodice of her dress  having thus disposed of her husband’s capital she was rather glad to hear the clatter of the door bell announcing an arrival  assuming the fixed unabashed stare and the stony expression reserved for the casual customer she walked in behind the counter  a man standing in the middle of the shop was inspecting it with a swift cool allround glance  his eyes ran over the walls took in the ceiling noted the floor—all in a moment  the points of a long fair moustache fell below the line of the jaw  he smiled the smile of an old if distant acquaintance and mrs verloc remembered having seen him before  not a customer  she softened her “customer stare” to mere indifference and faced him across the counter  he approached on his side confidentially but not too markedly so  “husband at home mrs verloc” he asked in an easy full tone  “no  he’s gone out”  “i am sorry for that  i’ve called to get from him a little private information”  this was the exact truth  chief inspector heat had been all the way home and had even gone so far as to think of getting into his slippers since practically he was he told himself chucked out of that case  he indulged in some scornful and in a few angry thoughts and found the occupation so unsatisfactory that he resolved to seek relief out of doors  nothing prevented him paying a friendly call to mr verloc casually as it were  it was in the character of a private citizen that walking out privately he made use of his customary conveyances  their general direction was towards mr verloc’s home  chief inspector heat respected his own private character so consistently that he took especial pains to avoid all the police constables on point and patrol duty in the vicinity of brett street  this precaution was much more necessary for a man of his standing than for an obscure assistant commissioner  private citizen heat entered the street manoeuvring in a way which in a member of the criminal classes would have been stigmatised as slinking  the piece of cloth picked up in greenwich was in his pocket  not that he had the slightest intention of producing it in his private capacity  on the contrary he wanted to know just what mr verloc would be disposed to say voluntarily  he hoped mr verloc’s talk would be of a nature to incriminate michaelis  it was a conscientiously professional hope in the main but not without its moral value  for chief inspector heat was a servant of justice  finding mr verloc from home he felt disappointed  “i would wait for him a little if i were sure he wouldn’t be long” he said  mrs verloc volunteered no assurance of any kind  “the information i need is quite private” he repeated  “you understand what i mean  i wonder if you could give me a notion where he’s gone to”  mrs verloc shook her head  “can’t say”  she turned away to range some boxes on the shelves behind the counter chief inspector heat looked at her thoughtfully for a time  “i suppose you know who i am” he said  mrs verloc glanced over her shoulder  chief inspector heat was amazed at her coolness  “come  you know i am in the police” he said sharply  “i don’t trouble my head much about it” mrs verloc remarked returning to the ranging of her boxes  “my name is heat  chief inspector heat of the special crimes section”  mrs verloc adjusted nicely in its place a small cardboard box and turning round faced him again heavyeyed with idle hands hanging down a silence reigned for a time  “so your husband went out a quarter of an hour ago  and he didn’t say when he would be back”  “he didn’t go out alone” mrs verloc let fall negligently  “a friend”  mrs verloc touched the back of her hair  it was in perfect order  “a stranger who called”  “i see  what sort of man was that stranger  would you mind telling me”  mrs verloc did not mind  and when chief inspector heat heard of a man dark thin with a long face and turned up moustaches he gave signs of perturbation and exclaimed  “dash me if i didn’t think so  he hasn’t lost any time”  he was intensely disgusted in the secrecy of his heart at the unofficial conduct of his immediate chief  but he was not quixotic  he lost all desire to await mr verloc’s return  what they had gone out for he did not know but he imagined it possible that they would return together the case is not followed properly it’s being tampered with he thought bitterly  “i am afraid i haven’t time to wait for your husband” he said  mrs verloc received this declaration listlessly  her detachment had impressed chief inspector heat all along  at this precise moment it whetted his curiosity  chief inspector heat hung in the wind swayed by his passions like the most private of citizens  “i think” he said looking at her steadily “that you could give me a pretty good notion of what’s going on if you liked”  forcing her fine inert eyes to return his gaze mrs verloc murmured  “going on  what is going on”  “why the affair i came to talk about a little with your husband”  that day mrs verloc had glanced at a morning paper as usual  but she had not stirred out of doors  the newsboys never invaded brett street  it was not a street for their business  and the echo of their cries drifting along the populous thoroughfares expired between the dirty brick walls without reaching the threshold of the shop  her husband had not brought an evening paper home  at any rate she had not seen it  mrs verloc knew nothing whatever of any affair  and she said so with a genuine note of wonder in her quiet voice  chief inspector heat did not believe for a moment in so much ignorance curtly without amiability he stated the bare fact  mrs verloc turned away her eyes  “i call it silly” she pronounced slowly  she paused  “we ain’t downtrodden slaves here”  the chief inspector waited watchfully  nothing more came  “and your husband didn’t mention anything to you when he came home”  mrs verloc simply turned her face from right to left in sign of negation a languid baffling silence reigned in the shop  chief inspector heat felt provoked beyond endurance  “there was another small matter” he began in a detached tone “which i wanted to speak to your husband about  there came into our hands a—a—what we believe is—a stolen overcoat”  mrs verloc with her mind specially aware of thieves that evening touched lightly the bosom of her dress  “we have lost no overcoat” she said calmly  “that’s funny” continued private citizen heat  “i see you keep a lot of marking ink here—”  he took up a small bottle and looked at it against the gasjet in the middle of the shop  “purple—isn’t it” he remarked setting it down again  “as i said it’s strange  because the overcoat has got a label sewn on the inside with your address written in marking ink”  mrs verloc leaned over the counter with a low exclamation  “that’s my brother’s then”  “where’s your brother  can i see him” asked the chief inspector briskly  mrs verloc leaned a little more over the counter  “no  he isn’t here  i wrote that label myself”  “where’s your brother now”  “he’s been away living with—a friend—in the country”  “the overcoat comes from the country  and what’s the name of the friend”  “michaelis” confessed mrs verloc in an awed whisper  the chief inspector let out a whistle  his eyes snapped  “just so  capital  and your brother now what’s he like—a sturdy darkish chap—eh”  “oh no” exclaimed mrs verloc fervently  “that must be the thief stevie’s slight and fair”  “good” said the chief inspector in an approving tone  and while mrs verloc wavering between alarm and wonder stared at him he sought for information  why have the address sewn like this inside the coat  and he heard that the mangled remains he had inspected that morning with extreme repugnance were those of a youth nervous absentminded peculiar and also that the woman who was speaking to him had had the charge of that boy since he was a baby  “easily excitable” he suggested  “oh yes  he is  but how did he come to lose his coat—”  chief inspector heat suddenly pulled out a pink newspaper he had bought less than halfanhour ago  he was interested in horses  forced by his calling into an attitude of doubt and suspicion towards his fellowcitizens chief inspector heat relieved the instinct of credulity implanted in the human breast by putting unbounded faith in the sporting prophets of that particular evening publication  dropping the extra special on to the counter he plunged his hand again into his pocket and pulling out the piece of cloth fate had presented him with out of a heap of things that seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops he offered it to mrs verloc for inspection  “i suppose you recognise this”  she took it mechanically in both her hands  her eyes seemed to grow bigger as she looked  “yes” she whispered then raised her head and staggered backward a little  “whatever for is it torn out like this”  the chief inspector snatched across the counter the cloth out of her hands and she sat heavily on the chair  he thought identification’s perfect  and in that moment he had a glimpse into the whole amazing truth  verloc was the “other man”  “mrs verloc” he said “it strikes me that you know more of this bomb affair than even you yourself are aware of”  mrs verloc sat still amazed lost in boundless astonishment  what was the connection  and she became so rigid all over that she was not able to turn her head at the clatter of the bell which caused the private investigator heat to spin round on his heel  mr verloc had shut the door and for a moment the two men looked at each other  mr verloc without looking at his wife walked up to the chief inspector who was relieved to see him return alone  “you here” muttered mr verloc heavily  “who are you after”  “no one” said chief inspector heat in a low tone  “look here i would like a word or two with you”  mr verloc still pale had brought an air of resolution with him  still he didn’t look at his wife  he said  “come in here then”  and he led the way into the parlour  the door was hardly shut when mrs verloc jumping up from the chair ran to it as if to fling it open but instead of doing so fell on her knees with her ear to the keyhole  the two men must have stopped directly they were through because she heard plainly the chief inspector’s voice though she could not see his finger pressed against her husband’s breast emphatically  “you are the other man verloc  two men were seen entering the park”  and the voice of mr verloc said  “well take me now  what’s to prevent you  you have the right”  “oh no  i know too well who you have been giving yourself away to he’ll have to manage this little affair all by himself  but don’t you make a mistake it’s i who found you out”  then she heard only muttering  inspector heat must have been showing to mr verloc the piece of stevie’s overcoat because stevie’s sister guardian and protector heard her husband a little louder  “i never noticed that she had hit upon that dodge”  again for a time mrs verloc heard nothing but murmurs whose mysteriousness was less nightmarish to her brain than the horrible suggestions of shaped words  then chief inspector heat on the other side of the door raised his voice  “you must have been mad”  and mr verloc’s voice answered with a sort of gloomy fury  “i have been mad for a month or more but i am not mad now  it’s all over  it shall all come out of my head and hang the consequences”  there was a silence and then private citizen heat murmured  “what’s coming out”  “everything” exclaimed the voice of mr verloc and then sank very low  after a while it rose again  “you have known me for several years now and you’ve found me useful too  you know i was a straight man  yes straight”  this appeal to old acquaintance must have been extremely distasteful to the chief inspector  his voice took on a warning note  “don’t you trust so much to what you have been promised  if i were you i would clear out  i don’t think we will run after you”  mr verloc was heard to laugh a little  “oh yes you hope the others will get rid of me for you—don’t you  no no you don’t shake me off now  i have been a straight man to those people too long and now everything must come out”  “let it come out then” the indifferent voice of chief inspector heat assented  “but tell me now how did you get away”  “i was making for chesterfield walk” mrs verloc heard her husband’s voice “when i heard the bang  i started running then  fog  i saw no one till i was past the end of george street  don’t think i met anyone till then”  “so easy as that” marvelled the voice of chief inspector heat  “the bang startled you eh”  “yes it came too soon” confessed the gloomy husky voice of mr verloc  mrs verloc pressed her ear to the keyhole her lips were blue her hands cold as ice and her pale face in which the two eyes seemed like two black holes felt to her as if it were enveloped in flames  on the other side of the door the voices sank very low  she caught words now and then sometimes in her husband’s voice sometimes in the smooth tones of the chief inspector  she heard this last say  “we believe he stumbled against the root of a tree”  there was a husky voluble murmur which lasted for some time and then the chief inspector as if answering some inquiry spoke emphatically  “of course  blown to small bits limbs gravel clothing bones splinters—all mixed up together  i tell you they had to fetch a shovel to gather him up with”  mrs verloc sprang up suddenly from her crouching position and stopping her ears reeled to and fro between the counter and the shelves on the wall towards the chair  her crazed eyes noted the sporting sheet left by the chief inspector and as she knocked herself against the counter she snatched it up fell into the chair tore the optimistic rosy sheet right across in trying to open it then flung it on the floor  on the other side of the door chief inspector heat was saying to mr verloc the secret agent  “so your defence will be practically a full confession”  “it will  i am going to tell the whole story”  “you won’t be believed as much as you fancy you will”  and the chief inspector remained thoughtful  the turn this affair was taking meant the disclosure of many things—the laying waste of fields of knowledge which cultivated by a capable man had a distinct value for the individual and for the society  it was sorry sorry meddling  it would leave michaelis unscathed it would drag to light the professor’s home industry disorganise the whole system of supervision make no end of a row in the papers which from that point of view appeared to him by a sudden illumination as invariably written by fools for the reading of imbeciles  mentally he agreed with the words mr verloc let fall at last in answer to his last remark  “perhaps not  but it will upset many things  i have been a straight man and i shall keep straight in this—”  “if they let you” said the chief inspector cynically  “you will be preached to no doubt before they put you into the dock  and in the end you may yet get let in for a sentence that will surprise you  i wouldn’t trust too much the gentleman who’s been talking to you”  mr verloc listened frowning  “my advice to you is to clear out while you may  i have no instructions there are some of them” continued chief inspector heat laying a peculiar stress on the word “them” “who think you are already out of the world”  “indeed” mr verloc was moved to say  though since his return from greenwich he had spent most of his time sitting in the taproom of an obscure little publichouse he could hardly have hoped for such favourable news  “that’s the impression about you”  the chief inspector nodded at him “vanish  clear out”  “where to” snarled mr verloc  he raised his head and gazing at the closed door of the parlour muttered feelingly “i only wish you would take me away tonight  i would go quietly”  “i daresay” assented sardonically the chief inspector following the direction of his glance  the brow of mr verloc broke into slight moisture  he lowered his husky voice confidentially before the unmoved chief inspector  “the lad was halfwitted irresponsible  any court would have seen that at once  only fit for the asylum  and that was the worst that would’ve happened to him if—”  the chief inspector his hand on the door handle whispered into mr verloc’s face  “he may’ve been halfwitted but you must have been crazy  what drove you off your head like this”  mr verloc thinking of mr vladimir did not hesitate in the choice of words  “a hyperborean swine” he hissed forcibly  “a what you might call a—a gentleman”  the chief inspector steadyeyed nodded briefly his comprehension and opened the door  mrs verloc behind the counter might have heard but did not see his departure pursued by the aggressive clatter of the bell she sat at her post of duty behind the counter  she sat rigidly erect in the chair with two dirty pink pieces of paper lying spread out at her feet  the palms of her hands were pressed convulsively to her face with the tips of the fingers contracted against the forehead as though the skin had been a mask which she was ready to tear off violently  the perfect immobility of her pose expressed the agitation of rage and despair all the potential violence of tragic passions better than any shallow display of shrieks with the beating of a distracted head against the walls could have done  chief inspector heat crossing the shop at his busy swinging pace gave her only a cursory glance  and when the cracked bell ceased to tremble on its curved ribbon of steel nothing stirred near mrs verloc as if her attitude had the locking power of a spell  even the butterflyshaped gas flames posed on the ends of the suspended tbracket burned without a quiver  in that shop of shady wares fitted with deal shelves painted a dull brown which seemed to devour the sheen of the light the gold circlet of the wedding ring on mrs verloc’s left hand glittered exceedingly with the untarnished glory of a piece from some splendid treasure of jewels dropped in a dustbin     chapter x   the assistant commissioner driven rapidly in a hansom from the neighbourhood of soho in the direction of westminster got out at the very centre of the empire on which the sun never sets  some stalwart constables who did not seem particularly impressed by the duty of watching the august spot saluted him  penetrating through a portal by no means lofty into the precincts of the house which is the house par excellence in the minds of many millions of men he was met at last by the volatile and revolutionary toodles  that neat and nice young man concealed his astonishment at the early appearance of the assistant commissioner whom he had been told to look out for some time about midnight  his turning up so early he concluded to be the sign that things whatever they were had gone wrong  with an extremely ready sympathy which in nice youngsters goes often with a joyous temperament he felt sorry for the great presence he called “the chief” and also for the assistant commissioner whose face appeared to him more ominously wooden than ever before and quite wonderfully long “what a queer foreignlooking chap he is” he thought to himself smiling from a distance with friendly buoyancy  and directly they came together he began to talk with the kind intention of burying the awkwardness of failure under a heap of words  it looked as if the great assault threatened for that night were going to fizzle out  an inferior henchman of “that brute cheeseman” was up boring mercilessly a very thin house with some shamelessly cooked statistics  he toodles hoped he would bore them into a count out every minute  but then he might be only marking time to let that guzzling cheeseman dine at his leisure  anyway the chief could not be persuaded to go home  “he will see you at once i think  he’s sitting all alone in his room thinking of all the fishes of the sea” concluded toodles airily  “come along”  notwithstanding the kindness of his disposition the young private secretary unpaid was accessible to the common failings of humanity  he did not wish to harrow the feelings of the assistant commissioner who looked to him uncommonly like a man who has made a mess of his job  but his curiosity was too strong to be restrained by mere compassion  he could not help as they went along to throw over his shoulder lightly  “and your sprat”  “got him” answered the assistant commissioner with a concision which did not mean to be repellent in the least  “good  you’ve no idea how these great men dislike to be disappointed in small things”  after this profound observation the experienced toodles seemed to reflect  at any rate he said nothing for quite two seconds  then  “i’m glad  but—i say—is it really such a very small thing as you make it out”  “do you know what may be done with a sprat” the assistant commissioner asked in his turn  “he’s sometimes put into a sardine box” chuckled toodles whose erudition on the subject of the fishing industry was fresh and in comparison with his ignorance of all other industrial matters immense “there are sardine canneries on the spanish coast which—”  the assistant commissioner interrupted the apprentice statesman  “yes  yes  but a sprat is also thrown away sometimes in order to catch a whale”  “a whale  phew” exclaimed toodles with bated breath  “you’re after a whale then”  “not exactly  what i am after is more like a dogfish  you don’t know perhaps what a dogfish is like”  “yes i do  we’re buried in special books up to our necks—whole shelves full of them—with plates    it’s a noxious rascallylooking altogether detestable beast with a sort of smooth face and moustaches”  “described to a t” commended the assistant commissioner  “only mine is cleanshaven altogether  you’ve seen him  it’s a witty fish”  “i have seen him” said toodles incredulously  “i can’t conceive where i could have seen him”  “at the explorers i should say” dropped the assistant commissioner calmly  at the name of that extremely exclusive club toodles looked scared and stopped short  “nonsense” he protested but in an awestruck tone  “what do you mean a member”  “honorary” muttered the assistant commissioner through his teeth  “heavens”  toodles looked so thunderstruck that the assistant commissioner smiled faintly  “that’s between ourselves strictly” he said  “that’s the beastliest thing i’ve ever heard in my life” declared toodles feebly as if astonishment had robbed him of all his buoyant strength in a second  the assistant commissioner gave him an unsmiling glance  till they came to the door of the great man’s room toodles preserved a scandalised and solemn silence as though he were offended with the assistant commissioner for exposing such an unsavoury and disturbing fact  it revolutionised his idea of the explorers’ club’s extreme selectness of its social purity  toodles was revolutionary only in politics his social beliefs and personal feelings he wished to preserve unchanged through all the years allotted to him on this earth which upon the whole he believed to be a nice place to live on  he stood aside  “go in without knocking” he said  shades of green silk fitted low over all the lights imparted to the room something of a forest’s deep gloom  the haughty eyes were physically the great man’s weak point  this point was wrapped up in secrecy  when an opportunity offered he rested them conscientiously  the assistant commissioner entering saw at first only a big pale hand supporting a big head and concealing the upper part of a big pale face an open despatchbox stood on the writingtable near a few oblong sheets of paper and a scattered handful of quill pens  there was absolutely nothing else on the large flat surface except a little bronze statuette draped in a toga mysteriously watchful in its shadowy immobility  the assistant commissioner invited to take a chair sat down  in the dim light the salient points of his personality the long face the black hair his lankness made him look more foreign than ever  the great man manifested no surprise no eagerness no sentiment whatever  the attitude in which he rested his menaced eyes was profoundly meditative  he did not alter it the least bit  but his tone was not dreamy  “well  what is it that you’ve found out already  you came upon something unexpected on the first step”  “not exactly unexpected sir ethelred  what i mainly came upon was a psychological state”  the great presence made a slight movement  “you must be lucid please”  “yes sir ethelred  you know no doubt that most criminals at some time or other feel an irresistible need of confessing—of making a clean breast of it to somebody—to anybody  and they do it often to the police  in that verloc whom heat wished so much to screen i’ve found a man in that particular psychological state  the man figuratively speaking flung himself on my breast  it was enough on my part to whisper to him who i was and to add ‘i know that you are at the bottom of this affair’  it must have seemed miraculous to him that we should know already but he took it all in the stride  the wonderfulness of it never checked him for a moment  there remained for me only to put to him the two questions who put you up to it and who was the man who did it  he answered the first with remarkable emphasis  as to the second question i gather that the fellow with the bomb was his brotherinlaw—quite a lad—a weakminded creature    it is rather a curious affair—too long perhaps to state fully just now”  “what then have you learned” asked the great man  “first i’ve learned that the exconvict michaelis had nothing to do with it though indeed the lad had been living with him temporarily in the country up to eight o’clock this morning  it is more than likely that michaelis knows nothing of it to this moment”  “you are positive as to that” asked the great man  “quite certain sir ethelred  this fellow verloc went there this morning and took away the lad on the pretence of going out for a walk in the lanes  as it was not the first time that he did this michaelis could not have the slightest suspicion of anything unusual  for the rest sir ethelred the indignation of this man verloc had left nothing in doubt—nothing whatever  he had been driven out of his mind almost by an extraordinary performance which for you or me it would be difficult to take as seriously meant but which produced a great impression obviously on him”  the assistant commissioner then imparted briefly to the great man who sat still resting his eyes under the screen of his hand mr verloc’s appreciation of mr vladimir’s proceedings and character  the assistant commissioner did not seem to refuse it a certain amount of competency but the great personage remarked  “all this seems very fantastic”  “doesn’t it  one would think a ferocious joke  but our man took it seriously it appears  he felt himself threatened  in the time you know he was in direct communication with old stottwartenheim himself and had come to regard his services as indispensable  it was an extremely rude awakening  i imagine that he lost his head  he became angry and frightened  upon my word my impression is that he thought these embassy people quite capable not only to throw him out but to give him away too in some manner or other—”  “how long were you with him” interrupted the presence from behind his big hand  “some forty minutes sir ethelred in a house of bad repute called continental hotel closeted in a room which bytheby i took for the night  i found him under the influence of that reaction which follows the effort of crime  the man cannot be defined as a hardened criminal it is obvious that he did not plan the death of that wretched lad—his brotherinlaw  that was a shock to him—i could see that  perhaps he is a man of strong sensibilities  perhaps he was even fond of the lad—who knows  he might have hoped that the fellow would get clear away in which case it would have been almost impossible to bring this thing home to anyone  at any rate he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for him”  the assistant commissioner paused in his speculations to reflect for a moment  “though how in that last case he could hope to have his own share in the business concealed is more than i can tell” he continued in his ignorance of poor stevie’s devotion to mr verloc who was good and of his truly peculiar dumbness which in the old affair of fireworks on the stairs had for many years resisted entreaties coaxing anger and other means of investigation used by his beloved sister  for stevie was loyal     “no i can’t imagine  it’s possible that he never thought of that at all  it sounds an extravagant way of putting it sir ethelred but his state of dismay suggested to me an impulsive man who after committing suicide with the notion that it would end all his troubles had discovered that it did nothing of the kind”  the assistant commissioner gave this definition in an apologetic voice but in truth there is a sort of lucidity proper to extravagant language and the great man was not offended  a slight jerky movement of the big body half lost in the gloom of the green silk shades of the big head leaning on the big hand accompanied an intermittent stifled but powerful sound  the great man had laughed  “what have you done with him”  the assistant commissioner answered very readily  “as he seemed very anxious to get back to his wife in the shop i let him go sir ethelred”  “you did  but the fellow will disappear”  “pardon me  i don’t think so  where could he go to  moreover you must remember that he has got to think of the danger from his comrades too he’s there at his post  how could he explain leaving it  but even if there were no obstacles to his freedom of action he would do nothing  at present he hasn’t enough moral energy to take a resolution of any sort permit me also to point out that if i had detained him we would have been committed to a course of action on which i wished to know your precise intentions first”  the great personage rose heavily an imposing shadowy form in the greenish gloom of the room  “i’ll see the attorneygeneral tonight and will send for you tomorrow morning  is there anything more you’d wish to tell me now”  the assistant commissioner had stood up also slender and flexible  “i think not sir ethelred unless i were to enter into details which—”  “no  no details please”  the great shadowy form seemed to shrink away as if in physical dread of details then came forward expanded enormous and weighty offering a large hand  “and you say that this man has got a wife”  “yes sir ethelred” said the assistant commissioner pressing deferentially the extended hand  “a genuine wife and a genuinely respectably marital relation  he told me that after his interview at the embassy he would have thrown everything up would have tried to sell his shop and leave the country only he felt certain that his wife would not even hear of going abroad  nothing could be more characteristic of the respectable bond than that” went on with a touch of grimness the assistant commissioner whose own wife too had refused to hear of going abroad  “yes a genuine wife  and the victim was a genuine brotherinlaw  from a certain point of view we are here in the presence of a domestic drama”  the assistant commissioner laughed a little but the great man’s thoughts seemed to have wandered far away perhaps to the questions of his country’s domestic policy the battleground of his crusading valour against the paynim cheeseman  the assistant commissioner withdrew quietly unnoticed as if already forgotten  he had his own crusading instincts  this affair which in one way or another disgusted chief inspector heat seemed to him a providentially given startingpoint for a crusade  he had it much at heart to begin he walked slowly home meditating that enterprise on the way and thinking over mr verloc’s psychology in a composite mood of repugnance and satisfaction  he walked all the way home  finding the drawingroom dark he went upstairs and spent some time between the bedroom and the dressingroom changing his clothes going to and fro with the air of a thoughtful somnambulist  but he shook it off before going out again to join his wife at the house of the great lady patroness of michaelis  he knew he would be welcomed there  on entering the smaller of the two drawingrooms he saw his wife in a small group near the piano  a youngish composer in pass of becoming famous was discoursing from a music stool to two thick men whose backs looked old and three slender women whose backs looked young  behind the screen the great lady had only two persons with her a man and a woman who sat side by side on armchairs at the foot of her couch  she extended her hand to the assistant commissioner  “i never hoped to see you here tonight  annie told me—”  “yes  i had no idea myself that my work would be over so soon”  the assistant commissioner added in a low tone “i am glad to tell you that michaelis is altogether clear of this—”  the patroness of the exconvict received this assurance indignantly  “why  were your people stupid enough to connect him with—”  “not stupid” interrupted the assistant commissioner contradicting deferentially  “clever enough—quite clever enough for that”  a silence fell  the man at the foot of the couch had stopped speaking to the lady and looked on with a faint smile  “i don’t know whether you ever met before” said the great lady  mr vladimir and the assistant commissioner introduced acknowledged each other’s existence with punctilious and guarded courtesy  “he’s been frightening me” declared suddenly the lady who sat by the side of mr vladimir with an inclination of the head towards that gentleman  the assistant commissioner knew the lady  “you do not look frightened” he pronounced after surveying her conscientiously with his tired and equable gaze  he was thinking meantime to himself that in this house one met everybody sooner or later mr vladimir’s rosy countenance was wreathed in smiles because he was witty but his eyes remained serious like the eyes of convinced man  “well he tried to at least” amended the lady  “force of habit perhaps” said the assistant commissioner moved by an irresistible inspiration  “he has been threatening society with all sorts of horrors” continued the lady whose enunciation was caressing and slow “apropos of this explosion in greenwich park  it appears we all ought to quake in our shoes at what’s coming if those people are not suppressed all over the world  i had no idea this was such a grave affair”  mr vladimir affecting not to listen leaned towards the couch talking amiably in subdued tones but he heard the assistant commissioner say  “i’ve no doubt that mr vladimir has a very precise notion of the true importance of this affair”  mr vladimir asked himself what that confounded and intrusive policeman was driving at  descended from generations victimised by the instruments of an arbitrary power he was racially nationally and individually afraid of the police  it was an inherited weakness altogether independent of his judgment of his reason of his experience  he was born to it  but that sentiment which resembled the irrational horror some people have of cats did not stand in the way of his immense contempt for the english police  he finished the sentence addressed to the great lady and turned slightly in his chair  “you mean that we have a great experience of these people  yes indeed we suffer greatly from their activity while you”—mr vladimir hesitated for a moment in smiling perplexity—“while you suffer their presence gladly in your midst” he finished displaying a dimple on each cleanshaven cheek  then he added more gravely “i may even say—because you do”  when mr vladimir ceased speaking the assistant commissioner lowered his glance and the conversation dropped  almost immediately afterwards mr vladimir took leave  directly his back was turned on the couch the assistant commissioner rose too  “i thought you were going to stay and take annie home” said the lady patroness of michaelis  “i find that i’ve yet a little work to do tonight”  “in connection—”  “well yes—in a way”  “tell me what is it really—this horror”  “it’s difficult to say what it is but it may yet be a cause célèbre” said the assistant commissioner  he left the drawingroom hurriedly and found mr vladimir still in the hall wrapping up his throat carefully in a large silk handkerchief behind him a footman waited holding his overcoat  another stood ready to open the door  the assistant commissioner was duly helped into his coat and let out at once  after descending the front steps he stopped as if to consider the way he should take  on seeing this through the door held open mr vladimir lingered in the hall to get out a cigar and asked for a light  it was furnished to him by an elderly man out of livery with an air of calm solicitude  but the match went out the footman then closed the door and mr vladimir lighted his large havana with leisurely care  when at last he got out of the house he saw with disgust the “confounded policeman” still standing on the pavement  “can he be waiting for me” thought mr vladimir looking up and down for some signs of a hansom  he saw none  a couple of carriages waited by the curbstone their lamps blazing steadily the horses standing perfectly still as if carved in stone the coachmen sitting motionless under the big fur capes without as much as a quiver stirring the white thongs of their big whips  mr vladimir walked on and the “confounded policeman” fell into step at his elbow  he said nothing  at the end of the fourth stride mr vladimir felt infuriated and uneasy  this could not last  “rotten weather” he growled savagely  “mild” said the assistant commissioner without passion  he remained silent for a little while  “we’ve got hold of a man called verloc” he announced casually  mr vladimir did not stumble did not stagger back did not change his stride  but he could not prevent himself from exclaiming “what”  the assistant commissioner did not repeat his statement  “you know him” he went on in the same tone  mr vladimir stopped and became guttural  “what makes you say that”  “i don’t  it’s verloc who says that”  “a lying dog of some sort” said mr vladimir in somewhat oriental phraseology  but in his heart he was almost awed by the miraculous cleverness of the english police  the change of his opinion on the subject was so violent that it made him for a moment feel slightly sick he threw away his cigar and moved on  “what pleased me most in this affair” the assistant went on talking slowly “is that it makes such an excellent startingpoint for a piece of work which i’ve felt must be taken in hand—that is the clearing out of this country of all the foreign political spies police and that sort of—of—dogs  in my opinion they are a ghastly nuisance also an element of danger  but we can’t very well seek them out individually  the only way is to make their employment unpleasant to their employers  the thing’s becoming indecent  and dangerous too for us here”  mr vladimir stopped again for a moment  “what do you mean”  “the prosecution of this verloc will demonstrate to the public both the danger and the indecency”  “nobody will believe what a man of that sort says” said mr vladimir contemptuously  “the wealth and precision of detail will carry conviction to the great mass of the public” advanced the assistant commissioner gently  “so that is seriously what you mean to do”  “we’ve got the man we have no choice”  “you will be only feeding up the lying spirit of these revolutionary scoundrels” mr vladimir protested  “what do you want to make a scandal for—from morality—or what”  mr vladimir’s anxiety was obvious  the assistant commissioner having ascertained in this way that there must be some truth in the summary statements of mr verloc said indifferently  “there’s a practical side too  we have really enough to do to look after the genuine article  you can’t say we are not effective  but we don’t intend to let ourselves be bothered by shams under any pretext whatever”  mr vladimir’s tone became lofty  “for my part i can’t share your view  it is selfish  my sentiments for my own country cannot be doubted but i’ve always felt that we ought to be good europeans besides—i mean governments and men”  “yes” said the assistant commissioner simply  “only you look at europe from its other end  but” he went on in a goodnatured tone “the foreign governments cannot complain of the inefficiency of our police look at this outrage a case specially difficult to trace inasmuch as it was a sham  in less than twelve hours we have established the identity of a man literally blown to shreds have found the organiser of the attempt and have had a glimpse of the inciter behind him  and we could have gone further only we stopped at the limits of our territory”  “so this instructive crime was planned abroad” mr vladimir said quickly “you admit it was planned abroad”  “theoretically  theoretically only on foreign territory abroad only by a fiction” said the assistant commissioner alluding to the character of embassies which are supposed to be part and parcel of the country to which they belong  “but that’s a detail  i talked to you of this business because it’s your government that grumbles most at our police you see that we are not so bad  i wanted particularly to tell you of our success”  “i’m sure i’m very grateful” muttered mr vladimir through his teeth  “we can put our finger on every anarchist here” went on the assistant commissioner as though he were quoting chief inspector heat  “all that’s wanted now is to do away with the agent provocateur to make everything safe”  mr vladimir held up his hand to a passing hansom  “you’re not going in here” remarked the assistant commissioner looking at a building of noble proportions and hospitable aspect with the light of a great hall falling through its glass doors on a broad flight of steps  but mr vladimir sitting stonyeyed inside the hansom drove off without a word  the assistant commissioner himself did not turn into the noble building it was the explorers’ club  the thought passed through his mind that mr vladimir honorary member would not be seen very often there in the future  he looked at his watch  it was only halfpast ten  he had had a very full evening     chapter xi   after chief inspector heat had left him mr verloc moved about the parlour  from time to time he eyed his wife through the open door  “she knows all about it now” he thought to himself with commiseration for her sorrow and with some satisfaction as regarded himself  mr verloc’s soul if lacking greatness perhaps was capable of tender sentiments  the prospect of having to break the news to her had put him into a fever chief inspector heat had relieved him of the task  that was good as far as it went  it remained for him now to face her grief  mr verloc had never expected to have to face it on account of death whose catastrophic character cannot be argued away by sophisticated reasoning or persuasive eloquence  mr verloc never meant stevie to perish with such abrupt violence  he did not mean him to perish at all stevie dead was a much greater nuisance than ever he had been when alive mr verloc had augured a favourable issue to his enterprise basing himself not on stevie’s intelligence which sometimes plays queer tricks with a man but on the blind docility and on the blind devotion of the boy  though not much of a psychologist mr verloc had gauged the depth of stevie’s fanaticism  he dared cherish the hope of stevie walking away from the walls of the observatory as he had been instructed to do taking the way shown to him several times previously and rejoining his brotherinlaw the wise and good mr verloc outside the precincts of the park  fifteen minutes ought to have been enough for the veriest fool to deposit the engine and walk away  and the professor had guaranteed more than fifteen minutes  but stevie had stumbled within five minutes of being left to himself  and mr verloc was shaken morally to pieces  he had foreseen everything but that  he had foreseen stevie distracted and lost—sought for—found in some police station or provincial workhouse in the end  he had foreseen stevie arrested and was not afraid because mr verloc had a great opinion of stevie’s loyalty which had been carefully indoctrinated with the necessity of silence in the course of many walks like a peripatetic philosopher mr verloc strolling along the streets of london had modified stevie’s view of the police by conversations full of subtle reasonings  never had a sage a more attentive and admiring disciple  the submission and worship were so apparent that mr verloc had come to feel something like a liking for the boy  in any case he had not foreseen the swift bringing home of his connection  that his wife should hit upon the precaution of sewing the boy’s address inside his overcoat was the last thing mr verloc would have thought of  one can’t think of everything  that was what she meant when she said that he need not worry if he lost stevie during their walks  she had assured him that the boy would turn up all right  well he had turned up with a vengeance  “well well” muttered mr verloc in his wonder  what did she mean by it spare him the trouble of keeping an anxious eye on stevie  most likely she had meant well  only she ought to have told him of the precaution she had taken  mr verloc walked behind the counter of the shop  his intention was not to overwhelm his wife with bitter reproaches  mr verloc felt no bitterness  the unexpected march of events had converted him to the doctrine of fatalism  nothing could be helped now  he said  “i didn’t mean any harm to come to the boy”  mrs verloc shuddered at the sound of her husband’s voice  she did not uncover her face  the trusted secret agent of the late baron stottwartenheim looked at her for a time with a heavy persistent undiscerning glance  the torn evening paper was lying at her feet  it could not have told her much  mr verloc felt the need of talking to his wife  “it’s that damned heat—eh” he said  “he upset you  he’s a brute blurting it out like this to a woman  i made myself ill thinking how to break it to you  i sat for hours in the little parlour of cheshire cheese thinking over the best way  you understand i never meant any harm to come to that boy”  mr verloc the secret agent was speaking the truth  it was his marital affection that had received the greatest shock from the premature explosion  he added  “i didn’t feel particularly gay sitting there and thinking of you”  he observed another slight shudder of his wife which affected his sensibility  as she persisted in hiding her face in her hands he thought he had better leave her alone for a while  on this delicate impulse mr verloc withdrew into the parlour again where the gas jet purred like a contented cat  mrs verloc’s wifely forethought had left the cold beef on the table with carving knife and fork and half a loaf of bread for mr verloc’s supper  he noticed all these things now for the first time and cutting himself a piece of bread and meat began to eat  his appetite did not proceed from callousness  mr verloc had not eaten any breakfast that day  he had left his home fasting  not being an energetic man he found his resolution in nervous excitement which seemed to hold him mainly by the throat  he could not have swallowed anything solid  michaelis’ cottage was as destitute of provisions as the cell of a prisoner  the ticketofleave apostle lived on a little milk and crusts of stale bread  moreover when mr verloc arrived he had already gone upstairs after his frugal meal  absorbed in the toil and delight of literary composition he had not even answered mr verloc’s shout up the little staircase  “i am taking this young fellow home for a day or two”  and in truth mr verloc did not wait for an answer but had marched out of the cottage at once followed by the obedient stevie  now that all action was over and his fate taken out of his hands with unexpected swiftness mr verloc felt terribly empty physically  he carved the meat cut the bread and devoured his supper standing by the table and now and then casting a glance towards his wife  her prolonged immobility disturbed the comfort of his refection  he walked again into the shop and came up very close to her  this sorrow with a veiled face made mr verloc uneasy  he expected of course his wife to be very much upset but he wanted her to pull herself together  he needed all her assistance and all her loyalty in these new conjunctures his fatalism had already accepted  “can’t be helped” he said in a tone of gloomy sympathy  “come winnie we’ve got to think of tomorrow  you’ll want all your wits about you after i am taken away”  he paused  mrs verloc’s breast heaved convulsively  this was not reassuring to mr verloc in whose view the newly created situation required from the two people most concerned in it calmness decision and other qualities incompatible with the mental disorder of passionate sorrow  mr verloc was a humane man he had come home prepared to allow every latitude to his wife’s affection for her brother  only he did not understand either the nature or the whole extent of that sentiment  and in this he was excusable since it was impossible for him to understand it without ceasing to be himself  he was startled and disappointed and his speech conveyed it by a certain roughness of tone  “you might look at a fellow” he observed after waiting a while  as if forced through the hands covering mrs verloc’s face the answer came deadened almost pitiful  “i don’t want to look at you as long as i live”  “eh  what”  mr verloc was merely startled by the superficial and literal meaning of this declaration  it was obviously unreasonable the mere cry of exaggerated grief  he threw over it the mantle of his marital indulgence  the mind of mr verloc lacked profundity  under the mistaken impression that the value of individuals consists in what they are in themselves he could not possibly comprehend the value of stevie in the eyes of mrs verloc  she was taking it confoundedly hard he thought to himself  it was all the fault of that damned heat  what did he want to upset the woman for  but she mustn’t be allowed for her own good to carry on so till she got quite beside herself  “look here  you can’t sit like this in the shop” he said with affected severity in which there was some real annoyance for urgent practical matters must be talked over if they had to sit up all night  “somebody might come in at any minute” he added and waited again  no effect was produced and the idea of the finality of death occurred to mr verloc during the pause  he changed his tone  “come  this won’t bring him back” he said gently feeling ready to take her in his arms and press her to his breast where impatience and compassion dwelt side by side but except for a short shudder mrs verloc remained apparently unaffected by the force of that terrible truism  it was mr verloc himself who was moved  he was moved in his simplicity to urge moderation by asserting the claims of his own personality  “do be reasonable winnie  what would it have been if you had lost me”  he had vaguely expected to hear her cry out  but she did not budge  she leaned back a little quieted down to a complete unreadable stillness mr verloc’s heart began to beat faster with exasperation and something resembling alarm  he laid his hand on her shoulder saying  “don’t be a fool winnie”  she gave no sign  it was impossible to talk to any purpose with a woman whose face one cannot see  mr verloc caught hold of his wife’s wrists but her hands seemed glued fast  she swayed forward bodily to his tug and nearly went off the chair  startled to feel her so helplessly limp he was trying to put her back on the chair when she stiffened suddenly all over tore herself out of his hands ran out of the shop across the parlour and into the kitchen  this was very swift  he had just a glimpse of her face and that much of her eyes that he knew she had not looked at him  it all had the appearance of a struggle for the possession of a chair because mr verloc instantly took his wife’s place in it  mr verloc did not cover his face with his hands but a sombre thoughtfulness veiled his features  a term of imprisonment could not be avoided  he did not wish now to avoid it  a prison was a place as safe from certain unlawful vengeances as the grave with this advantage that in a prison there is room for hope  what he saw before him was a term of imprisonment an early release and then life abroad somewhere such as he had contemplated already in case of failure  well it was a failure if not exactly the sort of failure he had feared  it had been so near success that he could have positively terrified mr vladimir out of his ferocious scoffing with this proof of occult efficiency  so at least it seemed now to mr verloc his prestige with the embassy would have been immense if—if his wife had not had the unlucky notion of sewing on the address inside stevie’s overcoat  mr verloc who was no fool had soon perceived the extraordinary character of the influence he had over stevie though he did not understand exactly its origin—the doctrine of his supreme wisdom and goodness inculcated by two anxious women  in all the eventualities he had foreseen mr verloc had calculated with correct insight on stevie’s instinctive loyalty and blind discretion  the eventuality he had not foreseen had appalled him as a humane man and a fond husband  from every other point of view it was rather advantageous  nothing can equal the everlasting discretion of death  mr verloc sitting perplexed and frightened in the small parlour of the cheshire cheese could not help acknowledging that to himself because his sensibility did not stand in the way of his judgment  stevie’s violent disintegration however disturbing to think about only assured the success for of course the knocking down of a wall was not the aim of mr vladimir’s menaces but the production of a moral effect  with much trouble and distress on mr verloc’s part the effect might be said to have been produced  when however most unexpectedly it came home to roost in brett street mr verloc who had been struggling like a man in a nightmare for the preservation of his position accepted the blow in the spirit of a convinced fatalist  the position was gone through no one’s fault really a small tiny fact had done it  it was like slipping on a bit of orange peel in the dark and breaking your leg  mr verloc drew a weary breath  he nourished no resentment against his wife  he thought she will have to look after the shop while they keep me locked up  and thinking also how cruelly she would miss stevie at first he felt greatly concerned about her health and spirits  how would she stand her solitude—absolutely alone in that house  it would not do for her to break down while he was locked up  what would become of the shop then  the shop was an asset  though mr verloc’s fatalism accepted his undoing as a secret agent he had no mind to be utterly ruined mostly it must be owned from regard for his wife  silent and out of his line of sight in the kitchen she frightened him if only she had had her mother with her  but that silly old woman—an angry dismay possessed mr verloc  he must talk with his wife  he could tell her certainly that a man does get desperate under certain circumstances  but he did not go incontinently to impart to her that information  first of all it was clear to him that this evening was no time for business  he got up to close the street door and put the gas out in the shop  having thus assured a solitude around his hearthstone mr verloc walked into the parlour and glanced down into the kitchen  mrs verloc was sitting in the place where poor stevie usually established himself of an evening with paper and pencil for the pastime of drawing these coruscations of innumerable circles suggesting chaos and eternity  her arms were folded on the table and her head was lying on her arms  mr verloc contemplated her back and the arrangement of her hair for a time then walked away from the kitchen door  mrs verloc’s philosophical almost disdainful incuriosity the foundation of their accord in domestic life made it extremely difficult to get into contact with her now this tragic necessity had arisen  mr verloc felt this difficulty acutely  he turned around the table in the parlour with his usual air of a large animal in a cage  curiosity being one of the forms of selfrevelation a systematically incurious person remains always partly mysterious  every time he passed near the door mr verloc glanced at his wife uneasily  it was not that he was afraid of her  mr verloc imagined himself loved by that woman  but she had not accustomed him to make confidences  and the confidence he had to make was of a profound psychological order  how with his want of practice could he tell her what he himself felt but vaguely that there are conspiracies of fatal destiny that a notion grows in a mind sometimes till it acquires an outward existence an independent power of its own and even a suggestive voice  he could not inform her that a man may be haunted by a fat witty cleanshaved face till the wildest expedient to get rid of it appears a child of wisdom  on this mental reference to a first secretary of a great embassy mr verloc stopped in the doorway and looking down into the kitchen with an angry face and clenched fists addressed his wife  “you don’t know what a brute i had to deal with”  he started off to make another perambulation of the table then when he had come to the door again he stopped glaring in from the height of two steps  “a silly jeering dangerous brute with no more sense than—after all these years  a man like me  and i have been playing my head at that game  you didn’t know  quite right too  what was the good of telling you that i stood the risk of having a knife stuck into me any time these seven years we’ve been married  i am not a chap to worry a woman that’s fond of me  you had no business to know”  mr verloc took another turn round the parlour fuming  “a venomous beast” he began again from the doorway  “drive me out into a ditch to starve for a joke  i could see he thought it was a damned good joke  a man like me  look here  some of the highest in the world got to thank me for walking on their two legs to this day  that’s the man you’ve got married to my girl”  he perceived that his wife had sat up  mrs verloc’s arms remained lying stretched on the table  mr verloc watched at her back as if he could read there the effect of his words  “there isn’t a murdering plot for the last eleven years that i hadn’t my finger in at the risk of my life  there’s scores of these revolutionists i’ve sent off with their bombs in their blamed pockets to get themselves caught on the frontier  the old baron knew what i was worth to his country  and here suddenly a swine comes along—an ignorant overbearing swine”  mr verloc stepping slowly down two steps entered the kitchen took a tumbler off the dresser and holding it in his hand approached the sink without looking at his wife  “it wasn’t the old baron who would have had the wicked folly of getting me to call on him at eleven in the morning there are two or three in this town that if they had seen me going in would have made no bones about knocking me on the head sooner or later it was a silly murderous trick to expose for nothing a man—like me”  mr verloc turning on the tap above the sink poured three glasses of water one after another down his throat to quench the fires of his indignation  mr vladimir’s conduct was like a hot brand which set his internal economy in a blaze  he could not get over the disloyalty of it this man who would not work at the usual hard tasks which society sets to its humbler members had exercised his secret industry with an indefatigable devotion  there was in mr verloc a fund of loyalty  he had been loyal to his employers to the cause of social stability—and to his affections too—as became apparent when after standing the tumbler in the sink he turned about saying  “if i hadn’t thought of you i would have taken the bullying brute by the throat and rammed his head into the fireplace  i’d have been more than a match for that pinkfaced smoothshaved—”  mr verloc neglected to finish the sentence as if there could be no doubt of the terminal word  for the first time in his life he was taking that incurious woman into his confidence  the singularity of the event the force and importance of the personal feelings aroused in the course of this confession drove stevie’s fate clean out of mr verloc’s mind the boy’s stuttering existence of fears and indignations together with the violence of his end had passed out of mr verloc’s mental sight for a time  for that reason when he looked up he was startled by the inappropriate character of his wife’s stare  it was not a wild stare and it was not inattentive but its attention was peculiar and not satisfactory inasmuch that it seemed concentrated upon some point beyond mr verloc’s person  the impression was so strong that mr verloc glanced over his shoulder  there was nothing behind him there was just the whitewashed wall  the excellent husband of winnie verloc saw no writing on the wall  he turned to his wife again repeating with some emphasis  “i would have taken him by the throat  as true as i stand here if i hadn’t thought of you then i would have half choked the life out of the brute before i let him get up  and don’t you think he would have been anxious to call the police either  he wouldn’t have dared  you understand why—don’t you”  he blinked at his wife knowingly  “no” said mrs verloc in an unresonant voice and without looking at him at all  “what are you talking about”  a great discouragement the result of fatigue came upon mr verloc  he had had a very full day and his nerves had been tried to the utmost after a month of maddening worry ending in an unexpected catastrophe the stormtossed spirit of mr verloc longed for repose  his career as a secret agent had come to an end in a way no one could have foreseen only now perhaps he could manage to get a night’s sleep at last  but looking at his wife he doubted it  she was taking it very hard—not at all like herself he thought  he made an effort to speak  “you’ll have to pull yourself together my girl” he said sympathetically  “what’s done can’t be undone”  mrs verloc gave a slight start though not a muscle of her white face moved in the least  mr verloc who was not looking at her continued ponderously  “you go to bed now  what you want is a good cry”  this opinion had nothing to recommend it but the general consent of mankind  it is universally understood that as if it were nothing more substantial than vapour floating in the sky every emotion of a woman is bound to end in a shower  and it is very probable that had stevie died in his bed under her despairing gaze in her protecting arms mrs verloc’s grief would have found relief in a flood of bitter and pure tears  mrs verloc in common with other human beings was provided with a fund of unconscious resignation sufficient to meet the normal manifestation of human destiny  without “troubling her head about it” she was aware that it “did not stand looking into very much”  but the lamentable circumstances of stevie’s end which to mr verloc’s mind had only an episodic character as part of a greater disaster dried her tears at their very source  it was the effect of a whitehot iron drawn across her eyes at the same time her heart hardened and chilled into a lump of ice kept her body in an inward shudder set her features into a frozen contemplative immobility addressed to a whitewashed wall with no writing on it  the exigencies of mrs verloc’s temperament which when stripped of its philosophical reserve was maternal and violent forced her to roll a series of thoughts in her motionless head  these thoughts were rather imagined than expressed  mrs verloc was a woman of singularly few words either for public or private use  with the rage and dismay of a betrayed woman she reviewed the tenor of her life in visions concerned mostly with stevie’s difficult existence from its earliest days  it was a life of single purpose and of a noble unity of inspiration like those rare lives that have left their mark on the thoughts and feelings of mankind  but the visions of mrs verloc lacked nobility and magnificence  she saw herself putting the boy to bed by the light of a single candle on the deserted top floor of a “business house” dark under the roof and scintillating exceedingly with lights and cut glass at the level of the street like a fairy palace  that meretricious splendour was the only one to be met in mrs verloc’s visions  she remembered brushing the boy’s hair and tying his pinafores—herself in a pinafore still the consolations administered to a small and badly scared creature by another creature nearly as small but not quite so badly scared she had the vision of the blows intercepted often with her own head of a door held desperately shut against a man’s rage not for very long of a poker flung once not very far which stilled that particular storm into the dumb and awful silence which follows a thunderclap  and all these scenes of violence came and went accompanied by the unrefined noise of deep vociferations proceeding from a man wounded in his paternal pride declaring himself obviously accursed since one of his kids was a “slobbering idjut and the other a wicked shedevil”  it was of her that this had been said many years ago  mrs verloc heard the words again in a ghostly fashion and then the dreary shadow of the belgravian mansion descended upon her shoulders  it was a crushing memory an exhausting vision of countless breakfast trays carried up and down innumerable stairs of endless haggling over pence of the endless drudgery of sweeping dusting cleaning from basement to attics while the impotent mother staggering on swollen legs cooked in a grimy kitchen and poor stevie the unconscious presiding genius of all their toil blacked the gentlemen’s boots in the scullery  but this vision had a breath of a hot london summer in it and for a central figure a young man wearing his sunday best with a straw hat on his dark head and a wooden pipe in his mouth  affectionate and jolly he was a fascinating companion for a voyage down the sparkling stream of life only his boat was very small  there was room in it for a girlpartner at the oar but no accommodation for passengers  he was allowed to drift away from the threshold of the belgravian mansion while winnie averted her tearful eyes  he was not a lodger  the lodger was mr verloc indolent and keeping late hours sleepily jocular of a morning from under his bedclothes but with gleams of infatuation in his heavy lidded eyes and always with some money in his pockets  there was no sparkle of any kind on the lazy stream of his life  it flowed through secret places  but his barque seemed a roomy craft and his taciturn magnanimity accepted as a matter of course the presence of passengers  mrs verloc pursued the visions of seven years’ security for stevie loyally paid for on her part of security growing into confidence into a domestic feeling stagnant and deep like a placid pool whose guarded surface hardly shuddered on the occasional passage of comrade ossipon the robust anarchist with shamelessly inviting eyes whose glance had a corrupt clearness sufficient to enlighten any woman not absolutely imbecile  a few seconds only had elapsed since the last word had been uttered aloud in the kitchen and mrs verloc was staring already at the vision of an episode not more than a fortnight old  with eyes whose pupils were extremely dilated she stared at the vision of her husband and poor stevie walking up brett street side by side away from the shop  it was the last scene of an existence created by mrs verloc’s genius an existence foreign to all grace and charm without beauty and almost without decency but admirable in the continuity of feeling and tenacity of purpose  and this last vision had such plastic relief such nearness of form such a fidelity of suggestive detail that it wrung from mrs verloc an anguished and faint murmur reproducing the supreme illusion of her life an appalled murmur that died out on her blanched lips  “might have been father and son”  mr verloc stopped and raised a careworn face  “eh  what did you say” he asked  receiving no reply he resumed his sinister tramping  then with a menacing flourish of a thick fleshy fist he burst out  “yes  the embassy people  a pretty lot ain’t they  before a week’s out i’ll make some of them wish themselves twenty feet underground  eh what”  he glanced sideways with his head down  mrs verloc gazed at the whitewashed wall  a blank wall—perfectly blank  a blankness to run at and dash your head against  mrs verloc remained immovably seated  she kept still as the population of half the globe would keep still in astonishment and despair were the sun suddenly put out in the summer sky by the perfidy of a trusted providence  “the embassy” mr verloc began again after a preliminary grimace which bared his teeth wolfishly  “i wish i could get loose in there with a cudgel for halfanhour  i would keep on hitting till there wasn’t a single unbroken bone left amongst the whole lot  but never mind i’ll teach them yet what it means trying to throw out a man like me to rot in the streets  i’ve a tongue in my head  all the world shall know what i’ve done for them  i am not afraid  i don’t care  everything’ll come out  every damned thing  let them look out”  in these terms did mr verloc declare his thirst for revenge  it was a very appropriate revenge  it was in harmony with the promptings of mr verloc’s genius  it had also the advantage of being within the range of his powers and of adjusting itself easily to the practice of his life which had consisted precisely in betraying the secret and unlawful proceedings of his fellowmen  anarchists or diplomats were all one to him  mr verloc was temperamentally no respecter of persons  his scorn was equally distributed over the whole field of his operations  but as a member of a revolutionary proletariat—which he undoubtedly was—he nourished a rather inimical sentiment against social distinction  “nothing on earth can stop me now” he added and paused looking fixedly at his wife who was looking fixedly at a blank wall  the silence in the kitchen was prolonged and mr verloc felt disappointed  he had expected his wife to say something  but mrs verloc’s lips composed in their usual form preserved a statuesque immobility like the rest of her face  and mr verloc was disappointed yet the occasion did not he recognised demand speech from her  she was a woman of very few words  for reasons involved in the very foundation of his psychology mr verloc was inclined to put his trust in any woman who had given herself to him  therefore he trusted his wife  their accord was perfect but it was not precise  it was a tacit accord congenial to mrs verloc’s incuriosity and to mr verloc’s habits of mind which were indolent and secret  they refrained from going to the bottom of facts and motives  this reserve expressing in a way their profound confidence in each other introduced at the same time a certain element of vagueness into their intimacy  no system of conjugal relations is perfect  mr verloc presumed that his wife had understood him but he would have been glad to hear her say what she thought at the moment  it would have been a comfort  there were several reasons why this comfort was denied him  there was a physical obstacle mrs verloc had no sufficient command over her voice she did not see any alternative between screaming and silence and instinctively she chose the silence  winnie verloc was temperamentally a silent person  and there was the paralysing atrocity of the thought which occupied her  her cheeks were blanched her lips ashy her immobility amazing  and she thought without looking at mr verloc “this man took the boy away to murder him  he took the boy away from his home to murder him  he took the boy away from me to murder him”  mrs verloc’s whole being was racked by that inconclusive and maddening thought  it was in her veins in her bones in the roots of her hair mentally she assumed the biblical attitude of mourning—the covered face the rent garments the sound of wailing and lamentation filled her head but her teeth were violently clenched and her tearless eyes were hot with rage because she was not a submissive creature  the protection she had extended over her brother had been in its origin of a fierce and indignant complexion  she had to love him with a militant love  she had battled for him—even against herself  his loss had the bitterness of defeat with the anguish of a baffled passion  it was not an ordinary stroke of death  moreover it was not death that took stevie from her it was mr verloc who took him away  she had seen him  she had watched him without raising a hand take the boy away  and she had let him go like—like a fool—a blind fool  then after he had murdered the boy he came home to her  just came home like any other man would come home to his wife     through her set teeth mrs verloc muttered at the wall  “and i thought he had caught a cold”  mr verloc heard these words and appropriated them  “it was nothing” he said moodily  “i was upset  i was upset on your account”  mrs verloc turning her head slowly transferred her stare from the wall to her husband’s person  mr verloc with the tips of his fingers between his lips was looking on the ground  “can’t be helped” he mumbled letting his hand fall  “you must pull yourself together  you’ll want all your wits about you  it is you who brought the police about our ears  never mind i won’t say anything more about it” continued mr verloc magnanimously  “you couldn’t know”  “i couldn’t” breathed out mrs verloc  it was as if a corpse had spoken mr verloc took up the thread of his discourse  “i don’t blame you  i’ll make them sit up  once under lock and key it will be safe enough for me to talk—you understand  you must reckon on me being two years away from you” he continued in a tone of sincere concern  “it will be easier for you than for me  you’ll have something to do while i—look here winnie what you must do is to keep this business going for two years  you know enough for that  you’ve a good head on you  i’ll send you word when it’s time to go about trying to sell  you’ll have to be extra careful  the comrades will be keeping an eye on you all the time  you’ll have to be as artful as you know how and as close as the grave  no one must know what you are going to do  i have no mind to get a knock on the head or a stab in the back directly i am let out”  thus spoke mr verloc applying his mind with ingenuity and forethought to the problems of the future  his voice was sombre because he had a correct sentiment of the situation  everything which he did not wish to pass had come to pass  the future had become precarious  his judgment perhaps had been momentarily obscured by his dread of mr vladimir’s truculent folly  a man somewhat over forty may be excusably thrown into considerable disorder by the prospect of losing his employment especially if the man is a secret agent of political police dwelling secure in the consciousness of his high value and in the esteem of high personages  he was excusable  now the thing had ended in a crash  mr verloc was cool but he was not cheerful  a secret agent who throws his secrecy to the winds from desire of vengeance and flaunts his achievements before the public eye becomes the mark for desperate and bloodthirsty indignations  without unduly exaggerating the danger mr verloc tried to bring it clearly before his wife’s mind  he repeated that he had no intention to let the revolutionists do away with him  he looked straight into his wife’s eyes  the enlarged pupils of the woman received his stare into their unfathomable depths  “i am too fond of you for that” he said with a little nervous laugh  a faint flush coloured mrs verloc’s ghastly and motionless face  having done with the visions of the past she had not only heard but had also understood the words uttered by her husband  by their extreme disaccord with her mental condition these words produced on her a slightly suffocating effect  mrs verloc’s mental condition had the merit of simplicity but it was not sound  it was governed too much by a fixed idea  every nook and cranny of her brain was filled with the thought that this man with whom she had lived without distaste for seven years had taken the “poor boy” away from her in order to kill him—the man to whom she had grown accustomed in body and mind the man whom she had trusted took the boy away to kill him  in its form in its substance in its effect which was universal altering even the aspect of inanimate things it was a thought to sit still and marvel at for ever and ever mrs verloc sat still  and across that thought not across the kitchen the form of mr verloc went to and fro familiarly in hat and overcoat stamping with his boots upon her brain  he was probably talking too but mrs verloc’s thought for the most part covered the voice  now and then however the voice would make itself heard  several connected words emerged at times  their purport was generally hopeful on each of these occasions mrs verloc’s dilated pupils losing their faroff fixity followed her husband’s movements with the effect of black care and impenetrable attention  well informed upon all matters relating to his secret calling mr verloc augured well for the success of his plans and combinations  he really believed that it would be upon the whole easy for him to escape the knife of infuriated revolutionists  he had exaggerated the strength of their fury and the length of their arm for professional purposes too often to have many illusions one way or the other  for to exaggerate with judgment one must begin by measuring with nicety  he knew also how much virtue and how much infamy is forgotten in two years—two long years  his first really confidential discourse to his wife was optimistic from conviction  he also thought it good policy to display all the assurance he could muster  it would put heart into the poor woman  on his liberation which harmonising with the whole tenor of his life would be secret of course they would vanish together without loss of time  as to covering up the tracks he begged his wife to trust him for that  he knew how it was to be done so that the devil himself—  he waved his hand  he seemed to boast  he wished only to put heart into her  it was a benevolent intention but mr verloc had the misfortune not to be in accord with his audience  the selfconfident tone grew upon mrs verloc’s ear which let most of the words go by for what were words to her now  what could words do to her for good or evil in the face of her fixed idea  her black glance followed that man who was asserting his impunity—the man who had taken poor stevie from home to kill him somewhere  mrs verloc could not remember exactly where but her heart began to beat very perceptibly  mr verloc in a soft and conjugal tone was now expressing his firm belief that there were yet a good few years of quiet life before them both  he did not go into the question of means  a quiet life it must be and as it were nestling in the shade concealed among men whose flesh is grass modest like the life of violets  the words used by mr verloc were “lie low for a bit”  and far from england of course  it was not clear whether mr verloc had in his mind spain or south america but at any rate somewhere abroad  this last word falling into mrs verloc’s ear produced a definite impression  this man was talking of going abroad  the impression was completely disconnected and such is the force of mental habit that mrs verloc at once and automatically asked herself “and what of stevie”  it was a sort of forgetfulness but instantly she became aware that there was no longer any occasion for anxiety on that score  there would never be any occasion any more  the poor boy had been taken out and killed the poor boy was dead  this shaking piece of forgetfulness stimulated mrs verloc’s intelligence she began to perceive certain consequences which would have surprised mr verloc  there was no need for her now to stay there in that kitchen in that house with that man—since the boy was gone for ever  no need whatever  and on that mrs verloc rose as if raised by a spring  but neither could she see what there was to keep her in the world at all and this inability arrested her  mr verloc watched her with marital solicitude  “you’re looking more like yourself” he said uneasily  something peculiar in the blackness of his wife’s eyes disturbed his optimism  at that precise moment mrs verloc began to look upon herself as released from all earthly ties  she had her freedom  her contract with existence as represented by that man standing over there was at an end  she was a free woman  had this view become in some way perceptible to mr verloc he would have been extremely shocked  in his affairs of the heart mr verloc had been always carelessly generous yet always with no other idea than that of being loved for himself  upon this matter his ethical notions being in agreement with his vanity he was completely incorrigible  that this should be so in the case of his virtuous and legal connection he was perfectly certain  he had grown older fatter heavier in the belief that he lacked no fascination for being loved for his own sake  when he saw mrs verloc starting to walk out of the kitchen without a word he was disappointed  “where are you going to” he called out rather sharply  “upstairs”  mrs verloc in the doorway turned at the voice  an instinct of prudence born of fear the excessive fear of being approached and touched by that man induced her to nod at him slightly from the height of two steps with a stir of the lips which the conjugal optimism of mr verloc took for a wan and uncertain smile  “that’s right” he encouraged her gruffly  “rest and quiet’s what you want  go on  it won’t be long before i am with you”  mrs verloc the free woman who had had really no idea where she was going to obeyed the suggestion with rigid steadiness  mr verloc watched her  she disappeared up the stairs  he was disappointed  there was that within him which would have been more satisfied if she had been moved to throw herself upon his breast  but he was generous and indulgent  winnie was always undemonstrative and silent  neither was mr verloc himself prodigal of endearments and words as a rule  but this was not an ordinary evening  it was an occasion when a man wants to be fortified and strengthened by open proofs of sympathy and affection  mr verloc sighed and put out the gas in the kitchen  mr verloc’s sympathy with his wife was genuine and intense  it almost brought tears into his eyes as he stood in the parlour reflecting on the loneliness hanging over her head  in this mood mr verloc missed stevie very much out of a difficult world  he thought mournfully of his end  if only that lad had not stupidly destroyed himself  the sensation of unappeasable hunger not unknown after the strain of a hazardous enterprise to adventurers of tougher fibre than mr verloc overcame him again  the piece of roast beef laid out in the likeness of funereal baked meats for stevie’s obsequies offered itself largely to his notice  and mr verloc again partook  he partook ravenously without restraint and decency cutting thick slices with the sharp carving knife and swallowing them without bread  in the course of that refection it occurred to mr verloc that he was not hearing his wife move about the bedroom as he should have done  the thought of finding her perhaps sitting on the bed in the dark not only cut mr verloc’s appetite but also took from him the inclination to follow her upstairs just yet laying down the carving knife mr verloc listened with careworn attention  he was comforted by hearing her move at last  she walked suddenly across the room and threw the window up  after a period of stillness up there during which he figured her to himself with her head out he heard the sash being lowered slowly  then she made a few steps and sat down every resonance of his house was familiar to mr verloc who was thoroughly domesticated  when next he heard his wife’s footsteps overhead he knew as well as if he had seen her doing it that she had been putting on her walking shoes  mr verloc wriggled his shoulders slightly at this ominous symptom and moving away from the table stood with his back to the fireplace his head on one side and gnawing perplexedly at the tips of his fingers  he kept track of her movements by the sound  she walked here and there violently with abrupt stoppages now before the chest of drawers then in front of the wardrobe  an immense load of weariness the harvest of a day of shocks and surprises weighed mr verloc’s energies to the ground  he did not raise his eyes till he heard his wife descending the stairs it was as he had guessed  she was dressed for going out  mrs verloc was a free woman  she had thrown open the window of the bedroom either with the intention of screaming murder  help or of throwing herself out  for she did not exactly know what use to make of her freedom  her personality seemed to have been torn into two pieces whose mental operations did not adjust themselves very well to each other  the street silent and deserted from end to end repelled her by taking sides with that man who was so certain of his impunity  she was afraid to shout lest no one should come  obviously no one would come her instinct of selfpreservation recoiled from the depth of the fall into that sort of slimy deep trench  mrs verloc closed the window and dressed herself to go out into the street by another way  she was a free woman  she had dressed herself thoroughly down to the tying of a black veil over her face  as she appeared before him in the light of the parlour mr verloc observed that she had even her little handbag hanging from her left wrist    flying off to her mother of course  the thought that women were wearisome creatures after all presented itself to his fatigued brain  but he was too generous to harbour it for more than an instant  this man hurt cruelly in his vanity remained magnanimous in his conduct allowing himself no satisfaction of a bitter smile or of a contemptuous gesture  with true greatness of soul he only glanced at the wooden clock on the wall and said in a perfectly calm but forcible manner  “five and twenty minutes past eight winnie  there’s no sense in going over there so late  you will never manage to get back tonight”  before his extended hand mrs verloc had stopped short  he added heavily “your mother will be gone to bed before you get there  this is the sort of news that can wait”  nothing was further from mrs verloc’s thoughts than going to her mother she recoiled at the mere idea and feeling a chair behind her she obeyed the suggestion of the touch and sat down  her intention had been simply to get outside the door for ever  and if this feeling was correct its mental form took an unrefined shape corresponding to her origin and station  “i would rather walk the streets all the days of my life” she thought  but this creature whose moral nature had been subjected to a shock of which in the physical order the most violent earthquake of history could only be a faint and languid rendering was at the mercy of mere trifles of casual contacts  she sat down  with her hat and veil she had the air of a visitor of having looked in on mr verloc for a moment  her instant docility encouraged him whilst her aspect of only temporary and silent acquiescence provoked him a little  “let me tell you winnie” he said with authority “that your place is here this evening  hang it all you brought the damned police high and low about my ears  i don’t blame you—but it’s your doing all the same you’d better take this confounded hat off  i can’t let you go out old girl” he added in a softened voice  mrs verloc’s mind got hold of that declaration with morbid tenacity  the man who had taken stevie out from under her very eyes to murder him in a locality whose name was at the moment not present to her memory would not allow her go out  of course he wouldn’t  now he had murdered stevie he would never let her go  he would want to keep her for nothing  and on this characteristic reasoning having all the force of insane logic mrs verloc’s disconnected wits went to work practically  she could slip by him open the door run out  but he would dash out after her seize her round the body drag her back into the shop  she could scratch kick and bite—and stab too but for stabbing she wanted a knife  mrs verloc sat still under her black veil in her own house like a masked and mysterious visitor of impenetrable intentions  mr verloc’s magnanimity was not more than human  she had exasperated him at last  “can’t you say something  you have your own dodges for vexing a man  oh yes  i know your deafanddumb trick  i’ve seen you at it before today  but just now it won’t do  and to begin with take this damned thing off  one can’t tell whether one is talking to a dummy or to a live woman”  he advanced and stretching out his hand dragged the veil off unmasking a still unreadable face against which his nervous exasperation was shattered like a glass bubble flung against a rock  “that’s better” he said to cover his momentary uneasiness and retreated back to his old station by the mantelpiece  it never entered his head that his wife could give him up  he felt a little ashamed of himself for he was fond and generous  what could he do  everything had been said already  he protested vehemently  “by heavens  you know that i hunted high and low  i ran the risk of giving myself away to find somebody for that accursed job  and i tell you again i couldn’t find anyone crazy enough or hungry enough  what do you take me for—a murderer or what  the boy is gone  do you think i wanted him to blow himself up  he’s gone  his troubles are over  ours are just going to begin i tell you precisely because he did blow himself  i don’t blame you  but just try to understand that it was a pure accident as much an accident as if he had been run over by a ’bus while crossing the street”  his generosity was not infinite because he was a human being—and not a monster as mrs verloc believed him to be  he paused and a snarl lifting his moustaches above a gleam of white teeth gave him the expression of a reflective beast not very dangerous—a slow beast with a sleek head gloomier than a seal and with a husky voice  “and when it comes to that it’s as much your doing as mine  that’s so you may glare as much as you like  i know what you can do in that way strike me dead if i ever would have thought of the lad for that purpose it was you who kept on shoving him in my way when i was half distracted with the worry of keeping the lot of us out of trouble  what the devil made you  one would think you were doing it on purpose  and i am damned if i know that you didn’t  there’s no saying how much of what’s going on you have got hold of on the sly with your infernal don’tcareadamn way of looking nowhere in particular and saying nothing at all    ”  his husky domestic voice ceased for a while  mrs verloc made no reply before that silence he felt ashamed of what he had said  but as often happens to peaceful men in domestic tiffs being ashamed he pushed another point  “you have a devilish way of holding your tongue sometimes” he began again without raising his voice  “enough to make some men go mad  it’s lucky for you that i am not so easily put out as some of them would be by your deafanddumb sulks  i am fond of you  but don’t you go too far this isn’t the time for it  we ought to be thinking of what we’ve got to do  and i can’t let you go out tonight galloping off to your mother with some crazy tale or other about me  i won’t have it  don’t you make any mistake about it if you will have it that i killed the boy then you’ve killed him as much as i”  in sincerity of feeling and openness of statement these words went far beyond anything that had ever been said in this home kept up on the wages of a secret industry eked out by the sale of more or less secret wares the poor expedients devised by a mediocre mankind for preserving an imperfect society from the dangers of moral and physical corruption both secret too of their kind  they were spoken because mr verloc had felt himself really outraged but the reticent decencies of this home life nestling in a shady street behind a shop where the sun never shone remained apparently undisturbed  mrs verloc heard him out with perfect propriety and then rose from her chair in her hat and jacket like a visitor at the end of a call  she advanced towards her husband one arm extended as if for a silent leavetaking  her net veil dangling down by one end on the left side of her face gave an air of disorderly formality to her restrained movements  but when she arrived as far as the hearthrug mr verloc was no longer standing there  he had moved off in the direction of the sofa without raising his eyes to watch the effect of his tirade  he was tired resigned in a truly marital spirit  but he felt hurt in the tender spot of his secret weakness  if she would go on sulking in that dreadful overcharged silence—why then she must  she was a master in that domestic art  mr verloc flung himself heavily upon the sofa disregarding as usual the fate of his hat which as if accustomed to take care of itself made for a safe shelter under the table  he was tired  the last particle of his nervous force had been expended in the wonders and agonies of this day full of surprising failures coming at the end of a harassing month of scheming and insomnia  he was tired a man isn’t made of stone  hang everything  mr verloc reposed characteristically clad in his outdoor garments  one side of his open overcoat was lying partly on the ground  mr verloc wallowed on his back but he longed for a more perfect rest—for sleep—for a few hours of delicious forgetfulness  that would come later  provisionally he rested  and he thought “i wish she would give over this damned nonsense  it’s exasperating”  there must have been something imperfect in mrs verloc’s sentiment of regained freedom  instead of taking the way of the door she leaned back with her shoulders against the tablet of the mantelpiece as a wayfarer rests against a fence  a tinge of wildness in her aspect was derived from the black veil hanging like a rag against her cheek and from the fixity of her black gaze where the light of the room was absorbed and lost without the trace of a single gleam  this woman capable of a bargain the mere suspicion of which would have been infinitely shocking to mr verloc’s idea of love remained irresolute as if scrupulously aware of something wanting on her part for the formal closing of the transaction  on the sofa mr verloc wriggled his shoulders into perfect comfort and from the fulness of his heart emitted a wish which was certainly as pious as anything likely to come from such a source  “i wish to goodness” he growled huskily “i had never seen greenwich park or anything belonging to it”  the veiled sound filled the small room with its moderate volume well adapted to the modest nature of the wish  the waves of air of the proper length propagated in accordance with correct mathematical formulas flowed around all the inanimate things in the room lapped against mrs verloc’s head as if it had been a head of stone  and incredible as it may appear the eyes of mrs verloc seemed to grow still larger  the audible wish of mr verloc’s overflowing heart flowed into an empty place in his wife’s memory  greenwich park  a park  that’s where the boy was killed  a park—smashed branches torn leaves gravel bits of brotherly flesh and bone all spouting up together in the manner of a firework she remembered now what she had heard and she remembered it pictorially they had to gather him up with the shovel  trembling all over with irrepressible shudders she saw before her the very implement with its ghastly load scraped up from the ground  mrs verloc closed her eyes desperately throwing upon that vision the night of her eyelids where after a rainlike fall of mangled limbs the decapitated head of stevie lingered suspended alone and fading out slowly like the last star of a pyrotechnic display  mrs verloc opened her eyes  her face was no longer stony  anybody could have noted the subtle change on her features in the stare of her eyes giving her a new and startling expression an expression seldom observed by competent persons under the conditions of leisure and security demanded for thorough analysis but whose meaning could not be mistaken at a glance  mrs verloc’s doubts as to the end of the bargain no longer existed her wits no longer disconnected were working under the control of her will  but mr verloc observed nothing  he was reposing in that pathetic condition of optimism induced by excess of fatigue  he did not want any more trouble—with his wife too—of all people in the world  he had been unanswerable in his vindication  he was loved for himself  the present phase of her silence he interpreted favourably  this was the time to make it up with her the silence had lasted long enough  he broke it by calling to her in an undertone  “winnie”  “yes” answered obediently mrs verloc the free woman  she commanded her wits now her vocal organs she felt herself to be in an almost preternaturally perfect control of every fibre of her body  it was all her own because the bargain was at an end  she was clear sighted  she had become cunning  she chose to answer him so readily for a purpose she did not wish that man to change his position on the sofa which was very suitable to the circumstances  she succeeded  the man did not stir  but after answering him she remained leaning negligently against the mantelpiece in the attitude of a resting wayfarer  she was unhurried  her brow was smooth  the head and shoulders of mr verloc were hidden from her by the high side of the sofa  she kept her eyes fixed on his feet  she remained thus mysteriously still and suddenly collected till mr verloc was heard with an accent of marital authority and moving slightly to make room for her to sit on the edge of the sofa  “come here” he said in a peculiar tone which might have been the tone of brutality but was intimately known to mrs verloc as the note of wooing  she started forward at once as if she were still a loyal woman bound to that man by an unbroken contract  her right hand skimmed slightly the end of the table and when she had passed on towards the sofa the carving knife had vanished without the slightest sound from the side of the dish mr verloc heard the creaky plank in the floor and was content  he waited  mrs verloc was coming  as if the homeless soul of stevie had flown for shelter straight to the breast of his sister guardian and protector the resemblance of her face with that of her brother grew at every step even to the droop of the lower lip even to the slight divergence of the eyes  but mr verloc did not see that  he was lying on his back and staring upwards  he saw partly on the ceiling and partly on the wall the moving shadow of an arm with a clenched hand holding a carving knife  it flickered up and down  its movements were leisurely they were leisurely enough for mr verloc to recognise the limb and the weapon  they were leisurely enough for him to take in the full meaning of the portent and to taste the flavour of death rising in his gorge  his wife had gone raving mad—murdering mad  they were leisurely enough for the first paralysing effect of this discovery to pass away before a resolute determination to come out victorious from the ghastly struggle with that armed lunatic  they were leisurely enough for mr verloc to elaborate a plan of defence involving a dash behind the table and the felling of the woman to the ground with a heavy wooden chair  but they were not leisurely enough to allow mr verloc the time to move either hand or foot the knife was already planted in his breast  it met no resistance on its way  hazard has such accuracies  into that plunging blow delivered over the side of the couch mrs verloc had put all the inheritance of her immemorial and obscure descent the simple ferocity of the age of caverns and the unbalanced nervous fury of the age of barrooms  mr verloc the secret agent turning slightly on his side with the force of the blow expired without stirring a limb in the muttered sound of the word “don’t” by way of protest  mrs verloc had let go the knife and her extraordinary resemblance to her late brother had faded had become very ordinary now  she drew a deep breath the first easy breath since chief inspector heat had exhibited to her the labelled piece of stevie’s overcoat  she leaned forward on her folded arms over the side of the sofa  she adopted that easy attitude not in order to watch or gloat over the body of mr verloc but because of the undulatory and swinging movements of the parlour which for some time behaved as though it were at sea in a tempest  she was giddy but calm she had become a free woman with a perfection of freedom which left her nothing to desire and absolutely nothing to do since stevie’s urgent claim on her devotion no longer existed  mrs verloc who thought in images was not troubled now by visions because she did not think at all  and she did not move  she was a woman enjoying her complete irresponsibility and endless leisure almost in the manner of a corpse she did not move she did not think  neither did the mortal envelope of the late mr verloc reposing on the sofa  except for the fact that mrs verloc breathed these two would have been perfect in accord that accord of prudent reserve without superfluous words and sparing of signs which had been the foundation of their respectable home life  for it had been respectable covering by a decent reticence the problems that may arise in the practice of a secret profession and the commerce of shady wares to the last its decorum had remained undisturbed by unseemly shrieks and other misplaced sincerities of conduct  and after the striking of the blow this respectability was continued in immobility and silence  nothing moved in the parlour till mrs verloc raised her head slowly and looked at the clock with inquiring mistrust  she had become aware of a ticking sound in the room  it grew upon her ear while she remembered clearly that the clock on the wall was silent had no audible tick  what did it mean by beginning to tick so loudly all of a sudden  its face indicated ten minutes to nine  mrs verloc cared nothing for time and the ticking went on  she concluded it could not be the clock and her sullen gaze moved along the walls wavered and became vague while she strained her hearing to locate the sound  tic tic tic  after listening for some time mrs verloc lowered her gaze deliberately on her husband’s body  its attitude of repose was so homelike and familiar that she could do so without feeling embarrassed by any pronounced novelty in the phenomena of her home life  mr verloc was taking his habitual ease  he looked comfortable  by the position of the body the face of mr verloc was not visible to mrs verloc his widow  her fine sleepy eyes travelling downward on the track of the sound became contemplative on meeting a flat object of bone which protruded a little beyond the edge of the sofa  it was the handle of the domestic carving knife with nothing strange about it but its position at right angles to mr verloc’s waistcoat and the fact that something dripped from it  dark drops fell on the floorcloth one after another with a sound of ticking growing fast and furious like the pulse of an insane clock  at its highest speed this ticking changed into a continuous sound of trickling  mrs verloc watched that transformation with shadows of anxiety coming and going on her face  it was a trickle dark swift thin    blood  at this unforeseen circumstance mrs verloc abandoned her pose of idleness and irresponsibility  with a sudden snatch at her skirts and a faint shriek she ran to the door as if the trickle had been the first sign of a destroying flood finding the table in her way she gave it a push with both hands as though it had been alive with such force that it went for some distance on its four legs making a loud scraping racket whilst the big dish with the joint crashed heavily on the floor  then all became still  mrs verloc on reaching the door had stopped  a round hat disclosed in the middle of the floor by the moving of the table rocked slightly on its crown in the wind of her flight     chapter xii   winnie verloc the widow of mr verloc the sister of the late faithful stevie blown to fragments in a state of innocence and in the conviction of being engaged in a humanitarian enterprise did not run beyond the door of the parlour  she had indeed run away so far from a mere trickle of blood but that was a movement of instinctive repulsion  and there she had paused with staring eyes and lowered head  as though she had run through long years in her flight across the small parlour mrs verloc by the door was quite a different person from the woman who had been leaning over the sofa a little swimmy in her head but otherwise free to enjoy the profound calm of idleness and irresponsibility  mrs verloc was no longer giddy  her head was steady  on the other hand she was no longer calm  she was afraid  if she avoided looking in the direction of her reposing husband it was not because she was afraid of him  mr verloc was not frightful to behold  he looked comfortable  moreover he was dead  mrs verloc entertained no vain delusions on the subject of the dead  nothing brings them back neither love nor hate  they can do nothing to you  they are as nothing  her mental state was tinged by a sort of austere contempt for that man who had let himself be killed so easily  he had been the master of a house the husband of a woman and the murderer of her stevie  and now he was of no account in every respect  he was of less practical account than the clothing on his body than his overcoat than his boots—than that hat lying on the floor  he was nothing  he was not worth looking at  he was even no longer the murderer of poor stevie the only murderer that would be found in the room when people came to look for mr verloc would be—herself  her hands shook so that she failed twice in the task of refastening her veil  mrs verloc was no longer a person of leisure and responsibility she was afraid  the stabbing of mr verloc had been only a blow  it had relieved the pentup agony of shrieks strangled in her throat of tears dried up in her hot eyes of the maddening and indignant rage at the atrocious part played by that man who was less than nothing now in robbing her of the boy  it had been an obscurely prompted blow  the blood trickling on the floor off the handle of the knife had turned it into an extremely plain case of murder  mrs verloc who always refrained from looking deep into things was compelled to look into the very bottom of this thing  she saw there no haunting face no reproachful shade no vision of remorse no sort of ideal conception  she saw there an object  that object was the gallows mrs verloc was afraid of the gallows  she was terrified of them ideally  having never set eyes on that last argument of men’s justice except in illustrative woodcuts to a certain type of tales she first saw them erect against a black and stormy background festooned with chains and human bones circled about by birds that peck at dead men’s eyes  this was frightful enough but mrs verloc though not a wellinformed woman had a sufficient knowledge of the institutions of her country to know that gallows are no longer erected romantically on the banks of dismal rivers or on windswept headlands but in the yards of jails  there within four high walls as if into a pit at dawn of day the murderer was brought out to be executed with a horrible quietness and as the reports in the newspapers always said “in the presence of the authorities”  with her eyes staring on the floor her nostrils quivering with anguish and shame she imagined herself all alone amongst a lot of strange gentlemen in silk hats who were calmly proceeding about the business of hanging her by the neck  that—never never  and how was it done  the impossibility of imagining the details of such quiet execution added something maddening to her abstract terror the newspapers never gave any details except one but that one with some affectation was always there at the end of a meagre report  mrs verloc remembered its nature  it came with a cruel burning pain into her head as if the words “the drop given was fourteen feet” had been scratched on her brain with a hot needle  “the drop given was fourteen feet”  these words affected her physically too  her throat became convulsed in waves to resist strangulation and the apprehension of the jerk was so vivid that she seized her head in both hands as if to save it from being torn off her shoulders  “the drop given was fourteen feet”  no that must never be  she could not stand that  the thought of it even was not bearable  she could not stand thinking of it  therefore mrs verloc formed the resolution to go at once and throw herself into the river off one of the bridges  this time she managed to refasten her veil  with her face as if masked all black from head to foot except for some flowers in her hat she looked up mechanically at the clock  she thought it must have stopped she could not believe that only two minutes had passed since she had looked at it last  of course not  it had been stopped all the time  as a matter of fact only three minutes had elapsed from the moment she had drawn the first deep easy breath after the blow to this moment when mrs verloc formed the resolution to drown herself in the thames  but mrs verloc could not believe that  she seemed to have heard or read that clocks and watches always stopped at the moment of murder for the undoing of the murderer  she did not care  “to the bridge—and over i go”    but her movements were slow  she dragged herself painfully across the shop and had to hold on to the handle of the door before she found the necessary fortitude to open it the street frightened her since it led either to the gallows or to the river  she floundered over the doorstep head forward arms thrown out like a person falling over the parapet of a bridge  this entrance into the open air had a foretaste of drowning a slimy dampness enveloped her entered her nostrils clung to her hair  it was not actually raining but each gas lamp had a rusty little halo of mist  the van and horses were gone and in the black street the curtained window of the carters’ eatinghouse made a square patch of soiled bloodred light glowing faintly very near the level of the pavement  mrs verloc dragging herself slowly towards it thought that she was a very friendless woman it was true  it was so true that in a sudden longing to see some friendly face she could think of no one else but of mrs neale the charwoman  she had no acquaintances of her own  nobody would miss her in a social way  it must not be imagined that the widow verloc had forgotten her mother  this was not so  winnie had been a good daughter because she had been a devoted sister  her mother had always leaned on her for support  no consolation or advice could be expected there  now that stevie was dead the bond seemed to be broken  she could not face the old woman with the horrible tale  moreover it was too far  the river was her present destination  mrs verloc tried to forget her mother  each step cost her an effort of will which seemed the last possible  mrs verloc had dragged herself past the red glow of the eatinghouse window “to the bridge—and over i go” she repeated to herself with fierce obstinacy  she put out her hand just in time to steady herself against a lamppost  “i’ll never get there before morning” she thought  the fear of death paralysed her efforts to escape the gallows  it seemed to her she had been staggering in that street for hours  “i’ll never get there” she thought  “they’ll find me knocking about the streets  it’s too far”  she held on panting under her black veil  “the drop given was fourteen feet”  she pushed the lamppost away from her violently and found herself walking  but another wave of faintness overtook her like a great sea washing away her heart clean out of her breast  “i will never get there” she muttered suddenly arrested swaying lightly where she stood “never”  and perceiving the utter impossibility of walking as far as the nearest bridge mrs verloc thought of a flight abroad  it came to her suddenly  murderers escaped  they escaped abroad  spain or california  mere names  the vast world created for the glory of man was only a vast blank to mrs verloc  she did not know which way to turn murderers had friends relations helpers—they had knowledge  she had nothing  she was the most lonely of murderers that ever struck a mortal blow  she was alone in london and the whole town of marvels and mud with its maze of streets and its mass of lights was sunk in a hopeless night rested at the bottom of a black abyss from which no unaided woman could hope to scramble out  she swayed forward and made a fresh start blindly with an awful dread of falling down but at the end of a few steps unexpectedly she found a sensation of support of security  raising her head she saw a man’s face peering closely at her veil  comrade ossipon was not afraid of strange women and no feeling of false delicacy could prevent him from striking an acquaintance with a woman apparently very much intoxicated comrade ossipon was interested in women  he held up this one between his two large palms peering at her in a businesslike way till he heard her say faintly “mr ossipon” and then he very nearly let her drop to the ground  “mrs verloc” he exclaimed  “you here”  it seemed impossible to him that she should have been drinking  but one never knows  he did not go into that question but attentive not to discourage kind fate surrendering to him the widow of comrade verloc he tried to draw her to his breast  to his astonishment she came quite easily and even rested on his arm for a moment before she attempted to disengage herself  comrade ossipon would not be brusque with kind fate he withdrew his arm in a natural way  “you recognised me” she faltered out standing before him fairly steady on her legs  “of course i did” said ossipon with perfect readiness  “i was afraid you were going to fall  i’ve thought of you too often lately not to recognise you anywhere at any time  i’ve always thought of you—ever since i first set eyes on you”  mrs verloc seemed not to hear  “you were coming to the shop” she said nervously  “yes at once” answered ossipon  “directly i read the paper”  in fact comrade ossipon had been skulking for a good two hours in the neighbourhood of brett street unable to make up his mind for a bold move  the robust anarchist was not exactly a bold conqueror  he remembered that mrs verloc had never responded to his glances by the slightest sign of encouragement  besides he thought the shop might be watched by the police and comrade ossipon did not wish the police to form an exaggerated notion of his revolutionary sympathies  even now he did not know precisely what to do  in comparison with his usual amatory speculations this was a big and serious undertaking  he ignored how much there was in it and how far he would have to go in order to get hold of what there was to get—supposing there was a chance at all  these perplexities checking his elation imparted to his tone a soberness well in keeping with the circumstances  “may i ask you where you were going” he inquired in a subdued voice  “don’t ask me” cried mrs verloc with a shuddering repressed violence all her strong vitality recoiled from the idea of death  “never mind where i was going   ”  ossipon concluded that she was very much excited but perfectly sober she remained silent by his side for moment then all at once she did something which he did not expect  she slipped her hand under his arm he was startled by the act itself certainly and quite as much too by the palpably resolute character of this movement  but this being a delicate affair comrade ossipon behaved with delicacy  he contented himself by pressing the hand slightly against his robust ribs  at the same time he felt himself being impelled forward and yielded to the impulse  at the end of brett street he became aware of being directed to the left  he submitted  the fruiterer at the corner had put out the blazing glory of his oranges and lemons and brett place was all darkness interspersed with the misty halos of the few lamps defining its triangular shape with a cluster of three lights on one stand in the middle  the dark forms of the man and woman glided slowly arm in arm along the walls with a loverlike and homeless aspect in the miserable night  “what would you say if i were to tell you that i was going to find you” mrs verloc asked gripping his arm with force  “i would say that you couldn’t find anyone more ready to help you in your trouble” answered ossipon with a notion of making tremendous headway in fact the progress of this delicate affair was almost taking his breath away  “in my trouble” mrs verloc repeated slowly  “yes”  “and do you know what my trouble is” she whispered with strange intensity  “ten minutes after seeing the evening paper” explained ossipon with ardour “i met a fellow whom you may have seen once or twice at the shop perhaps and i had a talk with him which left no doubt whatever in my mind  then i started for here wondering whether you—i’ve been fond of you beyond words ever since i set eyes on your face” he cried as if unable to command his feelings  comrade ossipon assumed correctly that no woman was capable of wholly disbelieving such a statement  but he did not know that mrs verloc accepted it with all the fierceness the instinct of selfpreservation puts into the grip of a drowning person  to the widow of mr verloc the robust anarchist was like a radiant messenger of life  they walked slowly in step  “i thought so” mrs verloc murmured faintly  “you’ve read it in my eyes” suggested ossipon with great assurance  “yes” she breathed out into his inclined ear  “a love like mine could not be concealed from a woman like you” he went on trying to detach his mind from material considerations such as the business value of the shop and the amount of money mr verloc might have left in the bank  he applied himself to the sentimental side of the affair  in his heart of hearts he was a little shocked at his success verloc had been a good fellow and certainly a very decent husband as far as one could see  however comrade ossipon was not going to quarrel with his luck for the sake of a dead man  resolutely he suppressed his sympathy for the ghost of comrade verloc and went on  “i could not conceal it  i was too full of you  i daresay you could not help seeing it in my eyes  but i could not guess it  you were always so distant   ”  “what else did you expect” burst out mrs verloc  “i was a respectable woman—”  she paused then added as if speaking to herself in sinister resentment “till he made me what i am”  ossipon let that pass and took up his running  “he never did seem to me to be quite worthy of you” he began throwing loyalty to the winds “you were worthy of a better fate”  mrs verloc interrupted bitterly  “better fate  he cheated me out of seven years of life”  “you seemed to live so happily with him”  ossipon tried to exculpate the lukewarmness of his past conduct  “it’s that what’s made me timid  you seemed to love him  i was surprised—and jealous” he added  “love him” mrs verloc cried out in a whisper full of scorn and rage “love him  i was a good wife to him  i am a respectable woman  you thought i loved him  you did  look here tom—”  the sound of this name thrilled comrade ossipon with pride  for his name was alexander and he was called tom by arrangement with the most familiar of his intimates  it was a name of friendship—of moments of expansion  he had no idea that she had ever heard it used by anybody it was apparent that she had not only caught it but had treasured it in her memory—perhaps in her heart  “look here tom  i was a young girl  i was done up  i was tired  i had two people depending on what i could do and it did seem as if i couldn’t do any more  two people—mother and the boy  he was much more mine than mother’s  i sat up nights and nights with him on my lap all alone upstairs when i wasn’t more than eight years old myself  and then—he was mine i tell you    you can’t understand that  no man can understand it  what was i to do  there was a young fellow—”  the memory of the early romance with the young butcher survived tenacious like the image of a glimpsed ideal in that heart quailing before the fear of the gallows and full of revolt against death  “that was the man i loved then” went on the widow of mr verloc  “i suppose he could see it in my eyes too  five and twenty shillings a week and his father threatened to kick him out of the business if he made such a fool of himself as to marry a girl with a crippled mother and a crazy idiot of a boy on her hands  but he would hang about me till one evening i found the courage to slam the door in his face  i had to do it  i loved him dearly  five and twenty shillings a week  there was that other man—a good lodger  what is a girl to do  could i’ve gone on the streets  he seemed kind  he wanted me anyhow  what was i to do with mother and that poor boy  eh  i said yes  he seemed goodnatured he was freehanded he had money he never said anything  seven years—seven years a good wife to him the kind the good the generous the—and he loved me  oh yes  he loved me till i sometimes wished myself—seven years  seven years a wife to him  and do you know what he was that dear friend of yours  do you know what he was  he was a devil”  the superhuman vehemence of that whispered statement completely stunned comrade ossipon  winnie verloc turning about held him by both arms facing him under the falling mist in the darkness and solitude of brett place in which all sounds of life seemed lost as if in a triangular well of asphalt and bricks of blind houses and unfeeling stones  “no i didn’t know” he declared with a sort of flabby stupidity whose comical aspect was lost upon a woman haunted by the fear of the gallows “but i do now  i—i understand” he floundered on his mind speculating as to what sort of atrocities verloc could have practised under the sleepy placid appearances of his married estate  it was positively awful  “i understand” he repeated and then by a sudden inspiration uttered an—“unhappy woman” of lofty commiseration instead of the more familiar “poor darling” of his usual practice  this was no usual case he felt conscious of something abnormal going on while he never lost sight of the greatness of the stake  “unhappy brave woman”  he was glad to have discovered that variation but he could discover nothing else  “ah but he is dead now” was the best he could do  and he put a remarkable amount of animosity into his guarded exclamation  mrs verloc caught at his arm with a sort of frenzy  “you guessed then he was dead” she murmured as if beside herself “you  you guessed what i had to do  had to”  there were suggestions of triumph relief gratitude in the indefinable tone of these words  it engrossed the whole attention of ossipon to the detriment of mere literal sense  he wondered what was up with her why she had worked herself into this state of wild excitement  he even began to wonder whether the hidden causes of that greenwich park affair did not lie deep in the unhappy circumstances of the verlocs’ married life  he went so far as to suspect mr verloc of having selected that extraordinary manner of committing suicide  by jove that would account for the utter inanity and wrongheadedness of the thing  no anarchist manifestation was required by the circumstances  quite the contrary and verloc was as well aware of that as any other revolutionist of his standing  what an immense joke if verloc had simply made fools of the whole of europe of the revolutionary world of the police of the press and of the cocksure professor as well  indeed thought ossipon in astonishment it seemed almost certain that he did  poor beggar  it struck him as very possible that of that household of two it wasn’t precisely the man who was the devil  alexander ossipon nicknamed the doctor was naturally inclined to think indulgently of his men friends  he eyed mrs verloc hanging on his arm of his women friends he thought in a specially practical way  why mrs verloc should exclaim at his knowledge of mr verloc’s death which was no guess at all did not disturb him beyond measure  they often talked like lunatics  but he was curious to know how she had been informed  the papers could tell her nothing beyond the mere fact the man blown to pieces in greenwich park not having been identified  it was inconceivable on any theory that verloc should have given her an inkling of his intention—whatever it was  this problem interested comrade ossipon immensely  he stopped short  they had gone then along the three sides of brett place and were near the end of brett street again  “how did you first come to hear of it” he asked in a tone he tried to render appropriate to the character of the revelations which had been made to him by the woman at his side  she shook violently for a while before she answered in a listless voice  “from the police  a chief inspector came chief inspector heat he said he was  he showed me—”  mrs verloc choked  “oh tom they had to gather him up with a shovel”  her breast heaved with dry sobs  in a moment ossipon found his tongue  “the police  do you mean to say the police came already  that chief inspector heat himself actually came to tell you”  “yes” she confirmed in the same listless tone  “he came just like this he came  i didn’t know  he showed me a piece of overcoat and—just like that  do you know this he says”  “heat  heat  and what did he do”  mrs verloc’s head dropped  “nothing  he did nothing  he went away the police were on that man’s side” she murmured tragically  “another one came too”  “another—another inspector do you mean” asked ossipon in great excitement and very much in the tone of a scared child  “i don’t know  he came  he looked like a foreigner  he may have been one of them embassy people”  comrade ossipon nearly collapsed under this new shock  “embassy  are you aware what you are saying  what embassy  what on earth do you mean by embassy”  “it’s that place in chesham square  the people he cursed so  i don’t know  what does it matter”  “and that fellow what did he do or say to you”  “i don’t remember    nothing     i don’t care  don’t ask me” she pleaded in a weary voice  “all right  i won’t” assented ossipon tenderly  and he meant it too not because he was touched by the pathos of the pleading voice but because he felt himself losing his footing in the depths of this tenebrous affair  police  embassy  phew  for fear of adventuring his intelligence into ways where its natural lights might fail to guide it safely he dismissed resolutely all suppositions surmises and theories out of his mind  he had the woman there absolutely flinging herself at him and that was the principal consideration  but after what he had heard nothing could astonish him any more  and when mrs verloc as if startled suddenly out of a dream of safety began to urge upon him wildly the necessity of an immediate flight on the continent he did not exclaim in the least  he simply said with unaffected regret that there was no train till the morning and stood looking thoughtfully at her face veiled in black net in the light of a gas lamp veiled in a gauze of mist  near him her black form merged in the night like a figure half chiselled out of a block of black stone  it was impossible to say what she knew how deep she was involved with policemen and embassies  but if she wanted to get away it was not for him to object  he was anxious to be off himself  he felt that the business the shop so strangely familiar to chief inspectors and members of foreign embassies was not the place for him  that must be dropped  but there was the rest  these savings  the money  “you must hide me till the morning somewhere” she said in a dismayed voice  “fact is my dear i can’t take you where i live  i share the room with a friend”  he was somewhat dismayed himself  in the morning the blessed ’tecs will be out in all the stations no doubt  and if they once got hold of her for one reason or another she would be lost to him indeed  “but you must  don’t you care for me at all—at all  what are you thinking of”  she said this violently but she let her clasped hands fall in discouragement  there was a silence while the mist fell and darkness reigned undisturbed over brett place  not a soul not even the vagabond lawless and amorous soul of a cat came near the man and the woman facing each other  “it would be possible perhaps to find a safe lodging somewhere” ossipon spoke at last  “but the truth is my dear i have not enough money to go and try with—only a few pence  we revolutionists are not rich”  he had fifteen shillings in his pocket  he added  “and there’s the journey before us too—first thing in the morning at that”  she did not move made no sound and comrade ossipon’s heart sank a little  apparently she had no suggestion to offer  suddenly she clutched at her breast as if she had felt a sharp pain there  “but i have” she gasped  “i have the money  i have enough money  tom let us go from here”  “how much have you got” he inquired without stirring to her tug for he was a cautious man  “i have the money i tell you  all the money”  “what do you mean by it  all the money there was in the bank or what” he asked incredulously but ready not to be surprised at anything in the way of luck  “yes yes” she said nervously  “all there was  i’ve it all”  “how on earth did you manage to get hold of it already” he marvelled  “he gave it to me” she murmured suddenly subdued and trembling comrade ossipon put down his rising surprise with a firm hand  “why then—we are saved” he uttered slowly  she leaned forward and sank against his breast  he welcomed her there she had all the money  her hat was in the way of very marked effusion her veil too  he was adequate in his manifestations but no more  she received them without resistance and without abandonment passively as if only halfsensible  she freed herself from his lax embraces without difficulty  “you will save me tom” she broke out recoiling but still keeping her hold on him by the two lapels of his damp coat  “save me  hide me don’t let them have me  you must kill me first  i couldn’t do it myself—i couldn’t i couldn’t—not even for what i am afraid of”  she was confoundedly bizarre he thought  she was beginning to inspire him with an indefinite uneasiness  he said surlily for he was busy with important thoughts  “what the devil are you afraid of”  “haven’t you guessed what i was driven to do” cried the woman distracted by the vividness of her dreadful apprehensions her head ringing with forceful words that kept the horror of her position before her mind she had imagined her incoherence to be clearness itself  she had no conscience of how little she had audibly said in the disjointed phrases completed only in her thought  she had felt the relief of a full confession and she gave a special meaning to every sentence spoken by comrade ossipon whose knowledge did not in the least resemble her own “haven’t you guessed what i was driven to do”  her voice fell  “you needn’t be long in guessing then what i am afraid of” she continued in a bitter and sombre murmur  “i won’t have it  i won’t  i won’t  i won’t  you must promise to kill me first”  she shook the lapels of his coat  “it must never be”  he assured her curtly that no promises on his part were necessary but he took good care not to contradict her in set terms because he had had much to do with excited women and he was inclined in general to let his experience guide his conduct in preference to applying his sagacity to each special case  his sagacity in this case was busy in other directions  women’s words fell into water but the shortcomings of timetables remained  the insular nature of great britain obtruded itself upon his notice in an odious form  “might just as well be put under lock and key every night” he thought irritably as nonplussed as though he had a wall to scale with the woman on his back  suddenly he slapped his forehead  he had by dint of cudgelling his brains just thought of the southampton—st malo service  the boat left about midnight  there was a train at 1030  he became cheery and ready to act  “from waterloo  plenty of time  we are all right after all    what’s the matter now  this isn’t the way” he protested  mrs verloc having hooked her arm into his was trying to drag him into brett street again  “i’ve forgotten to shut the shop door as i went out” she whispered terribly agitated  the shop and all that was in it had ceased to interest comrade ossipon he knew how to limit his desires  he was on the point of saying “what of that  let it be” but he refrained  he disliked argument about trifles he even mended his pace considerably on the thought that she might have left the money in the drawer  but his willingness lagged behind her feverish impatience  the shop seemed to be quite dark at first  the door stood ajar  mrs verloc leaning against the front gasped out  “nobody has been in  look  the light—the light in the parlour”  ossipon stretching his head forward saw a faint gleam in the darkness of the shop  “there is” he said  “i forgot it” mrs verloc’s voice came from behind her veil faintly  and as he stood waiting for her to enter first she said louder “go in and put it out—or i’ll go mad”  he made no immediate objection to this proposal so strangely motived “where’s all that money” he asked  “on me  go tom  quick  put it out    go in” she cried seizing him by both shoulders from behind  not prepared for a display of physical force comrade ossipon stumbled far into the shop before her push  he was astonished at the strength of the woman and scandalised by her proceedings  but he did not retrace his steps in order to remonstrate with her severely in the street  he was beginning to be disagreeably impressed by her fantastic behaviour moreover this or never was the time to humour the woman  comrade ossipon avoided easily the end of the counter and approached calmly the glazed door of the parlour  the curtain over the panes being drawn back a little he by a very natural impulse looked in just as he made ready to turn the handle  he looked in without a thought without intention without curiosity of any sort  he looked in because he could not help looking in  he looked in and discovered mr verloc reposing quietly on the sofa  a yell coming from the innermost depths of his chest died out unheard and transformed into a sort of greasy sickly taste on his lips  at the same time the mental personality of comrade ossipon executed a frantic leap backward  but his body left thus without intellectual guidance held on to the door handle with the unthinking force of an instinct  the robust anarchist did not even totter  and he stared his face close to the glass his eyes protruding out of his head  he would have given anything to get away but his returning reason informed him that it would not do to let go the door handle  what was it—madness a nightmare or a trap into which he had been decoyed with fiendish artfulness  why—what for he did not know  without any sense of guilt in his breast in the full peace of his conscience as far as these people were concerned the idea that he would be murdered for mysterious reasons by the couple verloc passed not so much across his mind as across the pit of his stomach and went out leaving behind a trail of sickly faintness—an indisposition comrade ossipon did not feel very well in a very special way for a moment—a long moment  and he stared  mr verloc lay very still meanwhile simulating sleep for reasons of his own while that savage woman of his was guarding the door—invisible and silent in the dark and deserted street  was all this a some sort of terrifying arrangement invented by the police for his especial benefit  his modesty shrank from that explanation  but the true sense of the scene he was beholding came to ossipon through the contemplation of the hat  it seemed an extraordinary thing an ominous object a sign  black and rim upward it lay on the floor before the couch as if prepared to receive the contributions of pence from people who would come presently to behold mr verloc in the fullness of his domestic ease reposing on a sofa  from the hat the eyes of the robust anarchist wandered to the displaced table gazed at the broken dish for a time received a kind of optical shock from observing a white gleam under the imperfectly closed eyelids of the man on the couch  mr verloc did not seem so much asleep now as lying down with a bent head and looking insistently at his left breast  and when comrade ossipon had made out the handle of the knife he turned away from the glazed door and retched violently  the crash of the street door flung to made his very soul leap in a panic this house with its harmless tenant could still be made a trap of—a trap of a terrible kind  comrade ossipon had no settled conception now of what was happening to him  catching his thigh against the end of the counter he spun round staggered with a cry of pain felt in the distracting clatter of the bell his arms pinned to his side by a convulsive hug while the cold lips of a woman moved creepily on his very ear to form the words  “policeman  he has seen me”  he ceased to struggle she never let him go  her hands had locked themselves with an inseparable twist of fingers on his robust back while the footsteps approached they breathed quickly breast to breast with hard laboured breaths as if theirs had been the attitude of a deadly struggle while in fact it was the attitude of deadly fear  and the time was long  the constable on the beat had in truth seen something of mrs verloc only coming from the lighted thoroughfare at the other end of brett street she had been no more to him than a flutter in the darkness  and he was not even quite sure that there had been a flutter  he had no reason to hurry up  on coming abreast of the shop he observed that it had been closed early  there was nothing very unusual in that  the men on duty had special instructions about that shop what went on about there was not to be meddled with unless absolutely disorderly but any observations made were to be reported  there were no observations to make but from a sense of duty and for the peace of his conscience owing also to that doubtful flutter of the darkness the constable crossed the road and tried the door  the spring latch whose key was reposing for ever off duty in the late mr verloc’s waistcoat pocket held as well as usual while the conscientious officer was shaking the handle ossipon felt the cold lips of the woman stirring again creepily against his very ear  “if he comes in kill me—kill me tom”  the constable moved away flashing as he passed the light of his dark lantern merely for form’s sake at the shop window  for a moment longer the man and the woman inside stood motionless panting breast to breast then her fingers came unlocked her arms fell by her side slowly ossipon leaned against the counter  the robust anarchist wanted support badly  this was awful  he was almost too disgusted for speech  yet he managed to utter a plaintive thought showing at least that he realised his position  “only a couple of minutes later and you’d have made me blunder against the fellow poking about here with his damned dark lantern”  the widow of mr verloc motionless in the middle of the shop said insistently  “go in and put that light out tom  it will drive me crazy”  she saw vaguely his vehement gesture of refusal  nothing in the world would have induced ossipon to go into the parlour  he was not superstitious but there was too much blood on the floor a beastly pool of it all round the hat  he judged he had been already far too near that corpse for his peace of mind—for the safety of his neck perhaps  “at the meter then  there  look  in that corner”  the robust form of comrade ossipon striding brusque and shadowy across the shop squatted in a corner obediently but this obedience was without grace  he fumbled nervously—and suddenly in the sound of a muttered curse the light behind the glazed door flicked out to a gasping hysterical sigh of a woman  night the inevitable reward of men’s faithful labours on this earth night had fallen on mr verloc the tried revolutionist—“one of the old lot”—the humble guardian of society the invaluable secret agent delta of baron stottwartenheim’s despatches a servant of law and order faithful trusted accurate admirable with perhaps one single amiable weakness the idealistic belief in being loved for himself  ossipon groped his way back through the stuffy atmosphere as black as ink now to the counter  the voice of mrs verloc standing in the middle of the shop vibrated after him in that blackness with a desperate protest  “i will not be hanged tom  i will not—”  she broke off  ossipon from the counter issued a warning “don’t shout like this” then seemed to reflect profoundly  “you did this thing quite by yourself” he inquired in a hollow voice but with an appearance of masterful calmness which filled mrs verloc’s heart with grateful confidence in his protecting strength  “yes” she whispered invisible  “i wouldn’t have believed it possible” he muttered  “nobody would” she heard him move about and the snapping of a lock in the parlour door comrade ossipon had turned the key on mr verloc’s repose and this he did not from reverence for its eternal nature or any other obscurely sentimental consideration but for the precise reason that he was not at all sure that there was not someone else hiding somewhere in the house he did not believe the woman or rather he was incapable by now of judging what could be true possible or even probable in this astounding universe  he was terrified out of all capacity for belief or disbelief in regard of this extraordinary affair which began with police inspectors and embassies and would end goodness knows where—on the scaffold for someone  he was terrified at the thought that he could not prove the use he made of his time ever since seven o’clock for he had been skulking about brett street  he was terrified at this savage woman who had brought him in there and would probably saddle him with complicity at least if he were not careful  he was terrified at the rapidity with which he had been involved in such dangers—decoyed into it it was some twenty minutes since he had met her—not more  the voice of mrs verloc rose subdued pleading piteously “don’t let them hang me tom  take me out of the country  i’ll work for you  i’ll slave for you  i’ll love you  i’ve no one in the world     who would look at me if you don’t”  she ceased for a moment then in the depths of the loneliness made round her by an insignificant thread of blood trickling off the handle of a knife she found a dreadful inspiration to her—who had been the respectable girl of the belgravian mansion the loyal respectable wife of mr verloc  “i won’t ask you to marry me” she breathed out in shamefaced accents  she moved a step forward in the darkness  he was terrified at her  he would not have been surprised if she had suddenly produced another knife destined for his breast  he certainly would have made no resistance  he had really not enough fortitude in him just then to tell her to keep back  but he inquired in a cavernous strange tone “was he asleep”  “no” she cried and went on rapidly  “he wasn’t  not he  he had been telling me that nothing could touch him  after taking the boy away from under my very eyes to kill him—the loving innocent harmless lad  my own i tell you  he was lying on the couch quite easy—after killing the boy—my boy  i would have gone on the streets to get out of his sight and he says to me like this ‘come here’ after telling me i had helped to kill the boy  you hear tom  he says like this ‘come here’ after taking my very heart out of me along with the boy to smash in the dirt”  she ceased then dreamily repeated twice “blood and dirt  blood and dirt”  a great light broke upon comrade ossipon  it was that halfwitted lad then who had perished in the park  and the fooling of everybody all round appeared more complete than ever—colossal  he exclaimed scientifically in the extremity of his astonishment “the degenerate—by heavens”  “come here”  the voice of mrs verloc rose again  “what did he think i was made of  tell me tom  come here  me  like this  i had been looking at the knife and i thought i would come then if he wanted me so much  oh yes  i came—for the last time    with the knife”  he was excessively terrified at her—the sister of the degenerate—a degenerate herself of a murdering type    or else of the lying type comrade ossipon might have been said to be terrified scientifically in addition to all other kinds of fear  it was an immeasurable and composite funk which from its very excess gave him in the dark a false appearance of calm and thoughtful deliberation  for he moved and spoke with difficulty being as if half frozen in his will and mind—and no one could see his ghastly face  he felt half dead  he leaped a foot high  unexpectedly mrs verloc had desecrated the unbroken reserved decency of her home by a shrill and terrible shriek  “help tom  save me  i won’t be hanged”  he rushed forward groping for her mouth with a silencing hand and the shriek died out  but in his rush he had knocked her over  he felt her now clinging round his legs and his terror reached its culminating point became a sort of intoxication entertained delusions acquired the characteristics of delirium tremens  he positively saw snakes now  he saw the woman twined round him like a snake not to be shaken off  she was not deadly  she was death itself—the companion of life  mrs verloc as if relieved by the outburst was very far from behaving noisily now  she was pitiful  “tom you can’t throw me off now” she murmured from the floor  “not unless you crush my head under your heel  i won’t leave you”  “get up” said ossipon  his face was so pale as to be quite visible in the profound black darkness of the shop while mrs verloc veiled had no face almost no discernible form  the trembling of something small and white a flower in her hat marked her place her movements  it rose in the blackness  she had got up from the floor and ossipon regretted not having run out at once into the street  but he perceived easily that it would not do  it would not do  she would run after him she would pursue him shrieking till she sent every policeman within hearing in chase  and then goodness only knew what she would say of him he was so frightened that for a moment the insane notion of strangling her in the dark passed through his mind  and he became more frightened than ever  she had him  he saw himself living in abject terror in some obscure hamlet in spain or italy till some fine morning they found him dead too with a knife in his breast—like mr verloc  he sighed deeply he dared not move  and mrs verloc waited in silence the good pleasure of her saviour deriving comfort from his reflective silence  suddenly he spoke up in an almost natural voice  his reflections had come to an end  “let’s get out or we will lose the train”  “where are we going to tom” she asked timidly  mrs verloc was no longer a free woman  “let’s get to paris first the best way we can    go out first and see if the way’s clear”  she obeyed  her voice came subdued through the cautiously opened door  “it’s all right”  ossipon came out  notwithstanding his endeavours to be gentle the cracked bell clattered behind the closed door in the empty shop as if trying in vain to warn the reposing mr verloc of the final departure of his wife—accompanied by his friend  in the hansom they presently picked up the robust anarchist became explanatory  he was still awfully pale with eyes that seemed to have sunk a whole halfinch into his tense face  but he seemed to have thought of everything with extraordinary method  “when we arrive” he discoursed in a queer monotonous tone “you must go into the station ahead of me as if we did not know each other  i will take the tickets and slip in yours into your hand as i pass you  then you will go into the firstclass ladies’ waitingroom and sit there till ten minutes before the train starts  then you come out  i will be outside  you go in first on the platform as if you did not know me there may be eyes watching there that know what’s what  alone you are only a woman going off by train  i am known  with me you may be guessed at as mrs verloc running away  do you understand my dear” he added with an effort  “yes” said mrs verloc sitting there against him in the hansom all rigid with the dread of the gallows and the fear of death  “yes tom”  and she added to herself like an awful refrain “the drop given was fourteen feet”  ossipon not looking at her and with a face like a fresh plaster cast of himself after a wasting illness said “bytheby i ought to have the money for the tickets now”  mrs verloc undoing some hooks of her bodice while she went on staring ahead beyond the splashboard handed over to him the new pigskin pocketbook  he received it without a word and seemed to plunge it deep somewhere into his very breast  then he slapped his coat on the outside  all this was done without the exchange of a single glance they were like two people looking out for the first sight of a desired goal  it was not till the hansom swung round a corner and towards the bridge that ossipon opened his lips again  “do you know how much money there is in that thing” he asked as if addressing slowly some hobgoblin sitting between the ears of the horse  “no” said mrs verloc  “he gave it to me  i didn’t count  i thought nothing of it at the time  afterwards—”  she moved her right hand a little  it was so expressive that little movement of that right hand which had struck the deadly blow into a man’s heart less than an hour before that ossipon could not repress a shudder he exaggerated it then purposely and muttered  “i am cold  i got chilled through”  mrs verloc looked straight ahead at the perspective of her escape  now and then like a sable streamer blown across a road the words “the drop given was fourteen feet” got in the way of her tense stare  through her black veil the whites of her big eyes gleamed lustrously like the eyes of a masked woman  ossipon’s rigidity had something businesslike a queer official expression  he was heard again all of a sudden as though he had released a catch in order to speak  “look here  do you know whether your—whether he kept his account at the bank in his own name or in some other name”  mrs verloc turned upon him her masked face and the big white gleam of her eyes  “other name” she said thoughtfully  “be exact in what you say” ossipon lectured in the swift motion of the hansom  “it’s extremely important  i will explain to you  the bank has the numbers of these notes  if they were paid to him in his own name then when his—his death becomes known the notes may serve to track us since we have no other money  you have no other money on you”  she shook her head negatively  “none whatever” he insisted  “a few coppers”  “it would be dangerous in that case  the money would have then to be dealt specially with  very specially  we’d have perhaps to lose more than half the amount in order to get these notes changed in a certain safe place i know of in paris  in the other case i mean if he had his account and got paid out under some other name—say smith for instance—the money is perfectly safe to use  you understand  the bank has no means of knowing that mr verloc and say smith are one and the same person  do you see how important it is that you should make no mistake in answering me  can you answer that query at all  perhaps not eh”  she said composedly  “i remember now  he didn’t bank in his own name  he told me once that it was on deposit in the name of prozor”  “you are sure”  “certain”  “you don’t think the bank had any knowledge of his real name  or anybody in the bank or—”  she shrugged her shoulders  “how can i know  is it likely tom  “no  i suppose it’s not likely  it would have been more comfortable to know    here we are  get out first and walk straight in  move smartly”  he remained behind and paid the cabman out of his own loose silver  the programme traced by his minute foresight was carried out  when mrs verloc with her ticket for st malo in her hand entered the ladies’ waitingroom comrade ossipon walked into the bar and in seven minutes absorbed three goes of hot brandy and water  “trying to drive out a cold” he explained to the barmaid with a friendly nod and a grimacing smile  then he came out bringing out from that festive interlude the face of a man who had drunk at the very fountain of sorrow  he raised his eyes to the clock  it was time  he waited  punctual mrs verloc came out with her veil down and all black—black as commonplace death itself crowned with a few cheap and pale flowers  she passed close to a little group of men who were laughing but whose laughter could have been struck dead by a single word  her walk was indolent but her back was straight and comrade ossipon looked after it in terror before making a start himself  the train was drawn up with hardly anybody about its row of open doors owing to the time of the year and to the abominable weather there were hardly any passengers  mrs verloc walked slowly along the line of empty compartments till ossipon touched her elbow from behind  “in here”  she got in and he remained on the platform looking about  she bent forward and in a whisper  “what is it tom  is there any danger  wait a moment  there’s the guard”  she saw him accost the man in uniform  they talked for a while  she heard the guard say “very well sir” and saw him touch his cap  then ossipon came back saying “i told him not to let anybody get into our compartment”  she was leaning forward on her seat  “you think of everything    you’ll get me off tom” she asked in a gust of anguish lifting her veil brusquely to look at her saviour  she had uncovered a face like adamant  and out of this face the eyes looked on big dry enlarged lightless burnt out like two black holes in the white shining globes  “there is no danger” he said gazing into them with an earnestness almost rapt which to mrs verloc flying from the gallows seemed to be full of force and tenderness  this devotion deeply moved her—and the adamantine face lost the stern rigidity of its terror  comrade ossipon gazed at it as no lover ever gazed at his mistress’s face  alexander ossipon anarchist nicknamed the doctor author of a medical and improper pamphlet late lecturer on the social aspects of hygiene to working men’s clubs was free from the trammels of conventional morality—but he submitted to the rule of science  he was scientific and he gazed scientifically at that woman the sister of a degenerate a degenerate herself—of a murdering type  he gazed at her and invoked lombroso as an italian peasant recommends himself to his favourite saint  he gazed scientifically  he gazed at her cheeks at her nose at her eyes at her ears    bad    fatal  mrs verloc’s pale lips parting slightly relaxed under his passionately attentive gaze he gazed also at her teeth    not a doubt remained    a murdering type    if comrade ossipon did not recommend his terrified soul to lombroso it was only because on scientific grounds he could not believe that he carried about him such a thing as a soul  but he had in him the scientific spirit which moved him to testify on the platform of a railway station in nervous jerky phrases  “he was an extraordinary lad that brother of yours  most interesting to study  a perfect type in a way  perfect”  he spoke scientifically in his secret fear  and mrs verloc hearing these words of commendation vouchsafed to her beloved dead swayed forward with a flicker of light in her sombre eyes like a ray of sunshine heralding a tempest of rain  “he was that indeed” she whispered softly with quivering lips  “you took a lot of notice of him tom  i loved you for it”  “it’s almost incredible the resemblance there was between you two” pursued ossipon giving a voice to his abiding dread and trying to conceal his nervous sickening impatience for the train to start  “yes he resembled you”  these words were not especially touching or sympathetic  but the fact of that resemblance insisted upon was enough in itself to act upon her emotions powerfully  with a little faint cry and throwing her arms out mrs verloc burst into tears at last  ossipon entered the carriage hastily closed the door and looked out to see the time by the station clock  eight minutes more  for the first three of these mrs verloc wept violently and helplessly without pause or interruption  then she recovered somewhat and sobbed gently in an abundant fall of tears  she tried to talk to her saviour to the man who was the messenger of life  “oh tom  how could i fear to die after he was taken away from me so cruelly  how could i  how could i be such a coward”  she lamented aloud her love of life that life without grace or charm and almost without decency but of an exalted faithfulness of purpose even unto murder  and as often happens in the lament of poor humanity rich in suffering but indigent in words the truth—the very cry of truth—was found in a worn and artificial shape picked up somewhere among the phrases of sham sentiment  “how could i be so afraid of death  tom i tried  but i am afraid  i tried to do away with myself  and i couldn’t  am i hard  i suppose the cup of horrors was not full enough for such as me  then when you came    ”  she paused  then in a gust of confidence and gratitude “i will live all my days for you tom” she sobbed out  “go over into the other corner of the carriage away from the platform” said ossipon solicitously  she let her saviour settle her comfortably and he watched the coming on of another crisis of weeping still more violent than the first  he watched the symptoms with a sort of medical air as if counting seconds  he heard the guard’s whistle at last  an involuntary contraction of the upper lip bared his teeth with all the aspect of savage resolution as he felt the train beginning to move  mrs verloc heard and felt nothing and ossipon her saviour stood still  he felt the train roll quicker rumbling heavily to the sound of the woman’s loud sobs and then crossing the carriage in two long strides he opened the door deliberately and leaped out  he had leaped out at the very end of the platform and such was his determination in sticking to his desperate plan that he managed by a sort of miracle performed almost in the air to slam to the door of the carriage  only then did he find himself rolling head over heels like a shot rabbit  he was bruised shaken pale as death and out of breath when he got up  but he was calm and perfectly able to meet the excited crowd of railway men who had gathered round him in a moment  he explained in gentle and convincing tones that his wife had started at a moment’s notice for brittany to her dying mother that of course she was greatly upset and he considerably concerned at her state that he was trying to cheer her up and had absolutely failed to notice at first that the train was moving out  to the general exclamation “why didn’t you go on to southampton then sir” he objected the inexperience of a young sisterinlaw left alone in the house with three small children and her alarm at his absence the telegraph offices being closed  he had acted on impulse  “but i don’t think i’ll ever try that again” he concluded smiled all round distributed some small change and marched without a limp out of the station  outside comrade ossipon flush of safe banknotes as never before in his life refused the offer of a cab  “i can walk” he said with a little friendly laugh to the civil driver  he could walk  he walked  he crossed the bridge  later on the towers of the abbey saw in their massive immobility the yellow bush of his hair passing under the lamps  the lights of victoria saw him too and sloane square and the railings of the park  and comrade ossipon once more found himself on a bridge  the river a sinister marvel of still shadows and flowing gleams mingling below in a black silence arrested his attention  he stood looking over the parapet for a long time  the clock tower boomed a brazen blast above his drooping head  he looked up at the dial    halfpast twelve of a wild night in the channel  and again comrade ossipon walked  his robust form was seen that night in distant parts of the enormous town slumbering monstrously on a carpet of mud under a veil of raw mist  it was seen crossing the streets without life and sound or diminishing in the interminable straight perspectives of shadowy houses bordering empty roadways lined by strings of gas lamps he walked through squares places ovals commons through monotonous streets with unknown names where the dust of humanity settles inert and hopeless out of the stream of life  he walked  and suddenly turning into a strip of a front garden with a mangy grass plot he let himself into a small grimy house with a latchkey he took out of his pocket  he threw himself down on his bed all dressed and lay still for a whole quarter of an hour  then he sat up suddenly drawing up his knees and clasping his legs  the first dawn found him openeyed in that same posture  this man who could walk so long so far so aimlessly without showing a sign of fatigue could also remain sitting still for hours without stirring a limb or an eyelid  but when the late sun sent its rays into the room he unclasped his hands and fell back on the pillow his eyes stared at the ceiling  and suddenly they closed  comrade ossipon slept in the sunlight     chapter xiii   the enormous iron padlock on the doors of the wall cupboard was the only object in the room on which the eye could rest without becoming afflicted by the miserable unloveliness of forms and the poverty of material unsaleable in the ordinary course of business on account of its noble proportions it had been ceded to the professor for a few pence by a marine dealer in the east of london  the room was large clean respectable and poor with that poverty suggesting the starvation of every human need except mere bread  there was nothing on the walls but the paper an expanse of arsenical green soiled with indelible smudges here and there and with stains resembling faded maps of uninhabited continents  at a deal table near a window sat comrade ossipon holding his head between his fists  the professor dressed in his only suit of shoddy tweeds but flapping to and fro on the bare boards a pair of incredibly dilapidated slippers had thrust his hands deep into the overstrained pockets of his jacket  he was relating to his robust guest a visit he had lately been paying to the apostle michaelis  the perfect anarchist had even been unbending a little  “the fellow didn’t know anything of verloc’s death  of course  he never looks at the newspapers  they make him too sad he says  but never mind  i walked into his cottage  not a soul anywhere  i had to shout halfadozen times before he answered me  i thought he was fast asleep yet in bed  but not at all  he had been writing his book for four hours already  he sat in that tiny cage in a litter of manuscript there was a halfeaten raw carrot on the table near him  his breakfast he lives on a diet of raw carrots and a little milk now”  “how does he look on it” asked comrade ossipon listlessly  “angelic    i picked up a handful of his pages from the floor  the poverty of reasoning is astonishing  he has no logic  he can’t think consecutively  but that’s nothing  he has divided his biography into three parts entitled—‘faith hope charity’  he is elaborating now the idea of a world planned out like an immense and nice hospital with gardens and flowers in which the strong are to devote themselves to the nursing of the weak”  the professor paused  “conceive you this folly ossipon  the weak  the source of all evil on this earth” he continued with his grim assurance  “i told him that i dreamt of a world like shambles where the weak would be taken in hand for utter extermination”  “do you understand ossipon  the source of all evil  they are our sinister masters—the weak the flabby the silly the cowardly the faint of heart and the slavish of mind  they have power  they are the multitude  theirs is the kingdom of the earth  exterminate exterminate  that is the only way of progress  it is  follow me ossipon  first the great multitude of the weak must go then the only relatively strong  you see  first the blind then the deaf and the dumb then the halt and the lame—and so on  every taint every vice every prejudice every convention must meet its doom”  “and what remains” asked ossipon in a stifled voice  “i remain—if i am strong enough” asserted the sallow little professor whose large ears thin like membranes and standing far out from the sides of his frail skull took on suddenly a deep red tint  “haven’t i suffered enough from this oppression of the weak” he continued forcibly  then tapping the breastpocket of his jacket “and yet i am the force” he went on  “but the time  the time  give me time  ah that multitude too stupid to feel either pity or fear sometimes i think they have everything on their side  everything—even death—my own weapon”  “come and drink some beer with me at the silenus” said the robust ossipon after an interval of silence pervaded by the rapid flap flap of the slippers on the feet of the perfect anarchist  this last accepted he was jovial that day in his own peculiar way  he slapped ossipon’s shoulder  “beer  so be it  let us drink and he merry for we are strong and tomorrow we die”  he busied himself with putting on his boots and talked meanwhile in his curt resolute tones  “what’s the matter with you ossipon  you look glum and seek even my company  i hear that you are seen constantly in places where men utter foolish things over glasses of liquor  why  have you abandoned your collection of women  they are the weak who feed the strong—eh”  he stamped one foot and picked up his other laced boot heavy thicksoled unblacked mended many times  he smiled to himself grimly  “tell me ossipon terrible man has ever one of your victims killed herself for you—or are your triumphs so far incomplete—for blood alone puts a seal on greatness  blood  death  look at history”  “you be damned” said ossipon without turning his head  “why  let that be the hope of the weak whose theology has invented hell for the strong  ossipon my feeling for you is amicable contempt  you couldn’t kill a fly”  but rolling to the feast on the top of the omnibus the professor lost his high spirits  the contemplation of the multitudes thronging the pavements extinguished his assurance under a load of doubt and uneasiness which he could only shake off after a period of seclusion in the room with the large cupboard closed by an enormous padlock  “and so” said over his shoulder comrade ossipon who sat on the seat behind  “and so michaelis dreams of a world like a beautiful and cheery hospital”  “just so  an immense charity for the healing of the weak” assented the professor sardonically  “that’s silly” admitted ossipon  “you can’t heal weakness  but after all michaelis may not be so far wrong  in two hundred years doctors will rule the world  science reigns already  it reigns in the shade maybe—but it reigns  and all science must culminate at last in the science of healing—not the weak but the strong  mankind wants to live—to live”  “mankind” asserted the professor with a selfconfident glitter of his ironrimmed spectacles “does not know what it wants”  “but you do” growled ossipon  “just now you’ve been crying for time—time  well  the doctors will serve you out your time—if you are good  you profess yourself to be one of the strong—because you carry in your pocket enough stuff to send yourself and say twenty other people into eternity  but eternity is a damned hole  it’s time that you need you—if you met a man who could give you for certain ten years of time you would call him your master”  “my device is no god  no master” said the professor sententiously as he rose to get off the ’bus  ossipon followed  “wait till you are lying flat on your back at the end of your time” he retorted jumping off the footboard after the other “your scurvy shabby mangy little bit of time” he continued across the street and hopping on to the curbstone  “ossipon i think that you are a humbug” the professor said opening masterfully the doors of the renowned silenus  and when they had established themselves at a little table he developed further this gracious thought  “you are not even a doctor  but you are funny  your notion of a humanity universally putting out the tongue and taking the pill from pole to pole at the bidding of a few solemn jokers is worthy of the prophet  prophecy  what’s the good of thinking of what will be” he raised his glass  “to the destruction of what is” he said calmly  he drank and relapsed into his peculiarly close manner of silence  the thought of a mankind as numerous as the sands of the seashore as indestructible as difficult to handle oppressed him  the sound of exploding bombs was lost in their immensity of passive grains without an echo  for instance this verloc affair  who thought of it now  ossipon as if suddenly compelled by some mysterious force pulled a muchfolded newspaper out of his pocket  the professor raised his head at the rustle  “what’s that paper  anything in it” he asked  ossipon started like a scared somnambulist  “nothing  nothing whatever  the thing’s ten days old  i forgot it in my pocket i suppose”  but he did not throw the old thing away  before returning it to his pocket he stole a glance at the last lines of a paragraph  they ran thus “an impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever over this act of madness or despair”  such were the end words of an item of news headed “suicide of lady passenger from a crosschannel boat”  comrade ossipon was familiar with the beauties of its journalistic style  “an impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever    ”  he knew every word by heart  “an impenetrable mystery    ”  and the robust anarchist hanging his head on his breast fell into a long reverie  he was menaced by this thing in the very sources of his existence  he could not issue forth to meet his various conquests those that he courted on benches in kensington gardens and those he met near area railings without the dread of beginning to talk to them of an impenetrable mystery destined    he was becoming scientifically afraid of insanity lying in wait for him amongst these lines  “to hang for ever over”  it was an obsession a torture  he had lately failed to keep several of these appointments whose note used to be an unbounded trustfulness in the language of sentiment and manly tenderness  the confiding disposition of various classes of women satisfied the needs of his selflove and put some material means into his hand  he needed it to live  it was there  but if he could no longer make use of it he ran the risk of starving his ideals and his body    “this act of madness or despair”  “an impenetrable mystery” was sure “to hang for ever” as far as all mankind was concerned  but what of that if he alone of all men could never get rid of the cursed knowledge  and comrade ossipon’s knowledge was as precise as the newspaper man could make it—up to the very threshold of the “mystery destined to hang for ever   ”  comrade ossipon was well informed  he knew what the gangway man of the steamer had seen “a lady in a black dress and a black veil wandering at midnight alongside on the quay  ‘are you going by the boat ma’am’ he had asked her encouragingly  ‘this way’  she seemed not to know what to do  he helped her on board  she seemed weak”  and he knew also what the stewardess had seen a lady in black with a white face standing in the middle of the empty ladies’ cabin  the stewardess induced her to lie down there  the lady seemed quite unwilling to speak and as if she were in some awful trouble  the next the stewardess knew she was gone from the ladies’ cabin  the stewardess then went on deck to look for her and comrade ossipon was informed that the good woman found the unhappy lady lying down in one of the hooded seats  her eyes were open but she would not answer anything that was said to her  she seemed very ill  the stewardess fetched the chief steward and those two people stood by the side of the hooded seat consulting over their extraordinary and tragic passenger  they talked in audible whispers for she seemed past hearing of st malo and the consul there of communicating with her people in england  then they went away to arrange for her removal down below for indeed by what they could see of her face she seemed to them to be dying  but comrade ossipon knew that behind that white mask of despair there was struggling against terror and despair a vigour of vitality a love of life that could resist the furious anguish which drives to murder and the fear the blind mad fear of the gallows  he knew  but the stewardess and the chief steward knew nothing except that when they came back for her in less than five minutes the lady in black was no longer in the hooded seat  she was nowhere  she was gone  it was then five o’clock in the morning and it was no accident either  an hour afterwards one of the steamer’s hands found a wedding ring left lying on the seat  it had stuck to the wood in a bit of wet and its glitter caught the man’s eye  there was a date 24th june 1879 engraved inside  “an impenetrable mystery is destined to hang for ever    ”  and comrade ossipon raised his bowed head beloved of various humble women of these isles apollolike in the sunniness of its bush of hair  the professor had grown restless meantime  he rose  “stay” said ossipon hurriedly  “here what do you know of madness and despair”  the professor passed the tip of his tongue on his dry thin lips and said doctorally  “there are no such things  all passion is lost now  the world is mediocre limp without force  and madness and despair are a force  and force is a crime in the eyes of the fools the weak and the silly who rule the roost  you are mediocre  verloc whose affair the police has managed to smother so nicely was mediocre  and the police murdered him he was mediocre  everybody is mediocre  madness and despair  give me that for a lever and i’ll move the world  ossipon you have my cordial scorn  you are incapable of conceiving even what the fatfed citizen would call a crime  you have no force”  he paused smiling sardonically under the fierce glitter of his thick glasses  “and let me tell you that this little legacy they say you’ve come into has not improved your intelligence  you sit at your beer like a dummy goodbye”  “will you have it” said ossipon looking up with an idiotic grin  “have what”  “the legacy  all of it”  the incorruptible professor only smiled  his clothes were all but falling off him his boots shapeless with repairs heavy like lead let water in at every step  he said  “i will send you byandby a small bill for certain chemicals which i shall order tomorrow  i need them badly  understood—eh”  ossipon lowered his head slowly  he was alone  “an impenetrable mystery    ”  it seemed to him that suspended in the air before him he saw his own brain pulsating to the rhythm of an impenetrable mystery it was diseased clearly     “this act of madness or despair”  the mechanical piano near the door played through a valse cheekily then fell silent all at once as if gone grumpy  comrade ossipon nicknamed the doctor went out of the silenus beerhall at the door he hesitated blinking at a not too splendid sunlight—and the paper with the report of the suicide of a lady was in his pocket  his heart was beating against it  the suicide of a lady—this act of madness or despair  he walked along the street without looking where he put his feet and he walked in a direction which would not bring him to the place of appointment with another lady an elderly nursery governess putting her trust in an apollolike ambrosial head  he was walking away from it he could face no woman  it was ruin  he could neither think work sleep nor eat  but he was beginning to drink with pleasure with anticipation with hope  it was ruin  his revolutionary career sustained by the sentiment and trustfulness of many women was menaced by an impenetrable mystery—the mystery of a human brain pulsating wrongfully to the rhythm of journalistic phrases  “    will hang for ever over this act    it was inclining towards the gutter    of madness or despair”  “i am seriously ill” he muttered to himself with scientific insight already his robust form with an embassy’s secretservice money inherited from mr verloc in his pockets was marching in the gutter as if in training for the task of an inevitable future  already he bowed his broad shoulders his head of ambrosial locks as if ready to receive the leather yoke of the sandwich board  as on that night more than a week ago comrade ossipon walked without looking where he put his feet feeling no fatigue feeling nothing seeing nothing hearing not a sound “an impenetrable mystery   ”  he walked disregarded     “this act of madness or despair”  and the incorruptible professor walked too averting his eyes from the odious multitude of mankind  he had no future  he disdained it  he was a force  his thoughts caressed the images of ruin and destruction  he walked frail insignificant shabby miserable—and terrible in the simplicity of his idea calling madness and despair to the regeneration of the world  nobody looked at him  he passed on unsuspected and deadly like a pest in the street full of men
