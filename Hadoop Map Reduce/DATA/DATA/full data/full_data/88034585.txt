88034585	modern broods or developments unlooked for     chapter itortoises and hares    whateer is good to wish ask that of heaven though it be what thou canst not hope to see  hartley coleridge   the scene was a drawingroom with oldfashioned heavy sash windows opening on a narrow brickwalled towngarden sloping down to a river and neatly kept  the same might be said of the room where heavy oldfashioned furniture handsome but not new was concealed by various flimsy modernisms knicknacks fans brackets china photographs and watercolours a canary singing loud in the window in the winter sunshine  miss prescott announced the maid but finding no auditor save the canary she retreated and miss prescott looked round her with a half sigh of recognition of the surroundings  she was herself a quiet looking gentle lady rather small with a sweet mouth and eyes of hazel in a rather worn face dressed in a soft woollen and grey fur with headgear to suit and there was an air of glad expectation a little flush that did not look permanent on her thin cheeks  is it you my dear miss prescott was the greeting of the older hostess as she entered her grey hair rough and uncovered and her dress of wellused black silk her complexion of the red that shows wear and care  then it is true she asked as the kiss and double shake of the hand was exchanged  may i ask  is it true  may i congratulate you  oh yes it is true said miss prescott breathlessly  i suppose the girls are at the high school  yes they will be at home at one  or shall i send for them  no thank you mrs best  i shall like to have a little time with you first  i can stay till a quarterpast three  then come and take off your things  i do not know when i have been so glad  do the girls know asked miss prescott following upstairs to a comfortable bedroom evidently serving also the purposes of a private room for writing table and account books stood near the fire  they know something kate bell heard a report from her cousins and they have been watching anxiously for news from you  i would not write till i knew more  i hope they have not raised their expectations too high for though it is enough to be an immense relief it is not exactly affluence  i have been with mr bell going into the matter and seeing the place said miss prescott sitting comfortably down in the armchair mrs best placed for her while she herself sat down in another disposing themselves for a talk over the fire  mr bell reckons it at about 600 pounds a year  and an estate  a very pretty cottage in a devonshire valley with the furniture and three acres of land  oh  i believe the girls fancy that it is at least as large as lord coldhursts  yes i was in hopes that they would have heard nothing about it  it came through some of their schoolfellows one cannot help things getting into the air  and there getting inflated like bubbles said miss prescott smiling  well their expectations will have a fall poor dears  and it does not come from their side of the family said mrs best of course not  and it was wholly unexpected was it not  yes i had my name of magdalen from my great aunt tremlett but she had never really forgiven my mothers marriage though she consented to be my godmother  she offered to adopt me on my mothers death and once when my father married again and when we lost him she wrote to propose my coming to live with her but there would have been no payment and so  yes you dear good thing you thought it your duty to go and work for your poor little stepmother and her children  what else was my education good for which has been a costly thing to poor father  and then the old lady was affronted for good and never took any more notice of me nor answered my letters  i did not even know she was dead till i heard from mr bell who had learnt it from his lawyers  it was quite right of her  dear magdalen i am so glad said mrs best crossing over to kiss her for the first stiffness had worn off and they were together again as had been the solicitors daughter and the chemists daughter who went to the same school till magdalen had been sent away to be finished in germany  dear sophy i wish you had the good fortune too  oh my galleons are coming when george has prospered a little more in queensland and comes to fetch me  sophia and he say they shall fight for me said mrs best who had been bravely presiding over a highschool boardinghouse ever since her husband a railway engineer had been killed by an accident and left her with two children to bring up  dear children they are very good to me  i am sure you have been goodness itself to us said magdalen in taking the care of these poor little ones when their mother died  i dont know how to be thankful enough to you and for all the blessings we have had  and that this should have come just now especially when my life with lady milsom is coming to an end  indeed  yes the little boys are old enough for school and the colonel is going to take a house at shrewsbury where his mother will live with them and want me no longer  you have been there seven years  yes and very happy  when fanny married lady milsom was left alone and would not part with me and then came the two little boys from india so that she had an excuse for retaining me but that is over now or will be in a few weeks time  i had been trying for an engagement and finding that beside your highschool diploma young ladies i am considered quite passee  my dear  with your art and music and all  too true  and while i was digesting a polite hint that my terms were too high and therewith agathas earnest appeal to be sent to girton there comes this inheritance  taking my burthen off my back and making me ready to throw up my heels like a young colt  ah you will be taking another burthen perhaps  no doubt i suppose so but let me find it out by degrees  i can only think as yet of having my dear girls to myself moi as the french would say after having seen so little of them  it has been very unfortunate  epidemics have been strangely inconvenient  yes  first there was whooping cough here to destroy the summer holidays then came the milsoms measles and i could not go and carry infection  oh and then freddy broke his leg and his grandmother was too nervous to be left with him  and by and by some one told her the scarlatina was in the town  it really was you know  any way it would have been sheer selfish inhumanity to leave her and then she had a real illness which frightened us all very much next came influenza to every one  and these last holidays  what should the newlycome little one from india do but catch a fever in the red sea and i had to keep guard over the brothers at weymouth till she was reported safe and i dont believe it was infectious after all  still i am tired of other peoples stairs  it is nearly five years since you have been with them except for that one peep you took at weston  and that is a great deal at their age  agatha was a vehement reader she would hardly look at me so absorbed was she in the york and lancaster rose which i had brought her  she is rather like that now  i conclude that you will wish to take them away  not this time at any rate till the house is fit to put over their heads  besides you have so mothered them dear sophy that i could not bear to make a sudden parting  there will be pain especially over little thekla and polly  but if george comes home this spring and i go out to queensland with him perhaps i should have asked you to take this house off my hands  may be it would be prudent in you to do so even now considering all things only i believe that transplanting would be good for them all  i am glad you think so for i have a perfect longing for that little house of my own  you will be able to give them a superior kind of society to what they have had access to here  there is a good deal that i should like to talk over with you before they come in  agatha seems to be in despair at her failure  so is all the house for we were very proud of her and of course we all thought it a fad of the examiners but perhaps our headmistress might not say the same  she is a good hardworking girl though and ambitious and quite worth further training  i am glad of being able to secure it to her at least and by the time her course is finished i shall be able to judge about the others  you thought of taking them in hand yourself  certainly how nice it will be to teach my own kin and not endless strangers lovable as they have been  it will be very good for them all to see something of life and manners superior to what i can give them here  you will take them into a fresh sphere andas things werebesides that i could not i did not know whether their lives would not lie among our people here  dear sophy dont concern yourself  i am quite certain you would never let them fall in with anything hurtful  why no  i hope not but if i had known what was coming i dont think i should have asked you to consent to vera and theklas spending their holidays at mr warings country house  very worthy people you said  i remember tom waring a very nice boy and jessie dale went to school with usi liked her  fancy them having a country house  waring grange they call it  he has got on wonderfully as upholsterer decorator and auctioneer  it is a very handsome one with a garden that gets the prizes at the horticultural shows  they are thoroughly good people but i was afraid afterwards that there had been a good deal of noisiness among the young folks at christmas hubert delrio was there and i fancy there was some nonsense going on  ah the delrios  are they here  yes poor fred did not make his art succeed when he had a family to provide for and he is the head of the art school here  his son has a good deal of talent and very prudently has got taken on by the firm of eccles and co who do a great deal of architectural decoration  the boy is doing very well but there have been giggles and whispers that make me rejoice that vera should be out of the neighbourhood  is she not very pretty  you will be very much struck with her i think and paulina is pretty too and more thoughtful  she would not go with thekla because waring grange is far from church and she would not disturb her christmas and epiphany  she is the most religious of them all and puts me in mind of our old missionary castles in the air  ah what castles they were  and they seem further off than ever or perhaps you will fulfil them and go and teach the australian blacks  a very unpromising field said mrs best though i hear there is a sister angela at the station who does wonders with them  i hear the quarter strikingthey will be back directly  ah before they come we ought to talk over means  something is owing for these last holidays  oh sophy i cannot find words to say how thankful i am to you for having helped me through this time even to your own loss  it has made our life possible  indeed i was most thankful to do all i could for poor agnes children and though i did not gain by them like my other boarders i never lost and they have been a great joy to me yes and a help by giving my house a character  when i recollect how utterly crushed down i felt seven years ago when their mother died and aunt magdalen refused help and how despairingly i prayed i feel all the more that there is an answer to even feeble almost worldly prayer  that it could not be when it was that you might be enabled to do the duty that was laid on you my dear  and with the exchange of a kiss the two good women set themselves to practical pounds shillings and pence which was just concluded when the patter of feet up the stone steps and voices in the hall announced the return of mrs bests boarders  just as magdalen was opening the door there darted up with the air of a privileged favourite a little person of ten years old with flying brown hair and round rosy cheeks exclaiming breathlessly is she come  the answer was to take her up with a motherly hug and my dear little thekla  there was not time for more than a hurried glance and embrace of the three on the steps of the stair in their sailor hats and blue serge but when in ten minutes more the whole party twenty in number were seated round the dining table observation was possible  agatha as senior scholar sat at the foot of the table fully occupied in dispensing irish stew  she had a sensible face to which projecting teeth gave a character and a brow that would have shown itself finer but for the overhanging mass of hair  vera and paulina were so much alike and so nearly of the same age that they were often taken for twins but on closer inspection vera proved to be the prettiest with a more delicately cut nose clearer complexion and bluer eyes but paulina with paler cheeks had softer eyes and more pencilled brows as well as a prettier lip and chin though she would not strike the eye so much as her sister little thekla was a roundfaced rosy little thing childish for her nearly eleven years smiling broadly and displaying enough white teeth to make magdalen forebode that they would need much attention if they were not to be a desight like agathas  she sat between mrs best and magdalen and in the first pause when the first course had just been distributed she looked up with a great pair of grey eyes and asked in a shrill clear little voice sister may i have a bicycle  we will see about it my dear returned magdalen unwilling to pledge herself  but havent you got a fortune undauntedly demanded thekla  something like it thekla  you shall hear about it after dinner and magdalen felt her colour flushing up under all those young eyes  kitty best said  but here mrs best interposed  we dont talk over such things at table thekla  take care with the gravy  did mr jones give a lesson this morning  yes a very long one said vera  it was about the exact force of the words in the revised version added agatha compared with the greek  that must have been very interesting said magdalen  vera and her neighbour looked at one another and shrugged their shoulders while some one else broke in with the news that another girl had not come back because she was down with influenza and magdalen suspecting that shop was not talked at table and also that the scripture passage could not well be discussed there saw that it was wise to let the conversation drift off by mrs bests leading into anecdotes of the influenza  all were glad when grace was chanted and the five sisters could retreat into the drawingroom which mrs best let them have to themselves for the half hour before magdalens train and the young ones return to the high school  she was at once established with thekla on her lap and the others perched round on chairs and footstools  of course the first question was and is it really true  it is true my dears that my old great aunt has left me a house and some money but you must not flatter yourselves that it is a great estate  only maynt i have a bicycle began thekla again  child i believe you have bicycles on the brain said agatha but sister you do mean that we shall be better off and i shall be able to go on with my education  yes my dear i think i can promise you so much said magdalen caressing the serge shoulder  o thanks  girton cried agatha  there is much that i must inquire about before i decide  again came elsie warner has a bicycle and she is no older than me please sister  hush now my little thekla said the sister kindly i will talk to mrs best and see whether she thinks it will be good for you  thekla subsided with a pout and magdalen was able to explain her circumstances and plans a little more in detail seeing however that the girls had no idea of the value of money paulina asked whether it meant being as well off as the colonel and lady mary   who keep a carriage and pair and a butler interposed vera  oh no my dear  if i keep any kind of carriage it will be only a basket or governess cart and a pony or donkey  thats all right said agatha  i would not be rich and stupid for the world  small fear of that said magdalen laughing  our home the goyle is not more than a cottage in a beautiful devonshire valley  whats the name of it  the goyle  i believe it is a diminutive of gully a narrow ravine it is lovely even now and will be delightful when you come to me in april  shall i leave school asked vera  i shall be seventeen in may  you will all leave school  mrs best has made it easy to me by her wonderful goodness in keeping you on cheaper terms but if agatha goes to the university you must be content to work for a time with me  oh cried thekla  shall i have always holidays  my bicycle  everybody burst out laughing at thisnot a very trained cachinnation but more of the giggle even in agatha and magdalen answered  you will have plenty of time for bicycling if the hills are not too steep but i hope to make your lessons pleasant to you  she did not know whether to mention mrs bests intention of soon giving up her house which would have much increased her difficulties but for her legacy and agatha said you know i think that vera and polly both ought to make a real study of music  they both have talent and cultivation would do a great deal for it  agatha spoke in a dogmatic way that amused magdalen and she said well i shall be able to judge when we are at the goyle  vera i think you sing  vera looked shy and agatha said she has a good voice and madame lardner thinks it would answer to send her to some superior conservatoire in process of time  vera did not commit herself as to her wishes and mrs best returned to say that if miss prescott wished to see the headmistress it was time to set out for the school and accordingly the whole party walked up together to the school magdalen with agatha who was chiefly occupied in explaining how entirely it was owing to the one sidedness of the examiners that she had not gained the scholarship magdalen had heard of such examiners before from the mothers of her pupils  she had to wish her sisters goodbye for the next three months not having gathered very much about them except their personal appearance  she administered a sovereign to each of them as they parted  agatha thanked her in a tone as if afraid to betray what a boon it was vera with an eager kiss asking if she could spend it as she liked paulina with a certain grave propriety and thekla of course wanted to know whether it would buy a bicycle or if not how many rides could be purchased from it  when they were absorbed in the routine of the day the interview with the head mistress disclosed what magdalen had expected that agatha was an industrious ambitious girl with very good abilities quite worth cultivating though not extraordinary that vera had a certain sort of cleverness but no application and not much taste for anything but music and that paulina was a good dutiful plodding girl who surpassed brighter powers by dint of diligence  the little one was a mere child who had not yet come much under notice from the higher authorities  on the whole magdalen went away with pleasant hopes and the affectionate impulses of kindred blood rising within her to complete her term with lady milsom by whom she could not well be spared till towards easter while in the meantime her house was being repaired    chapter iithe goyle    a poor thing but mine ownshakespeare  thaay stwuns thaay stwuns thaay stwuns thaay stwuns t hughes scouring of the white horse  magdalen prescott stood on her own little terrace  her house was like many devonian ones built high on the slope of a steep hill running down into a narrow valley and her abode was almost at the narrowest part where a little lively brawling stream descended from the moor amid rocks and brushwood  if the history of the place were told it had been built for a shooting box then inherited by a lawyer who had embellished and spent his holidays there and afterwards his youngest daughter a lonely and retiring woman had spent her latter years there  the house was low stone built and roofed with rough slate with a narrow verandah in front and creepers in bud covering it  then came a terrace just wide enough for a carriage to drive up and below flowerbeds bordered with stones found what vantage ground they could between the steep slopes of grass that led almost precipitously down to the stream where the ground rose equally rapidly on the other side  moss ivy rhododendrons primroses anemones and the promise of ferns were there and the adjacent beds had their full share of hepaticas and all the early daffodil kinds  behind and on the southern side lay the kitchen garden also a succession of steps and beyond as the ravine widened were small meadows each with a big stone in the midst  the gulley or goyle narrowed as it rose and there was a disused limestone quarry all wreathed over with creeping plants a birch tree growing up all white and silvery in the middle and above the house and garden was wood not of fine trees and interspersed with rocks but giving shade and shelter  the opposite side had likewise fields below with one grey farm house peeping in sight and red cattle feeding in one and above the same rocky woodland meeting the other at the quarry and then after a little cascade had tumbled down from the steeper ground giving place to the heathery peaty moor which ended more than two miles off in a torr like a small sphinx  this could not be seen from magdalens territory but from the highest walk in her kitchen garden she could see the square tower of arnscombe her parish church and on a clear day the glittering water of rockstone bay  to magdalen it was a delightful view and delightful too had been the arranging of her house and preparing for her sisters  all the furniture and contents of the abode had been left to her  it was solid and handsome of its kind belonging to the days of the retired qc and some of it would have been displaced for what was more fresh and tasteful if magdalen had not consulted economy  so she depended on basketchairs screens brackets and drapery to enliven the ancient mahagony and rosewood and she had accumulated a good many water colours vases and knickknacks  the old grand piano was found to be past its work so that she went the length of purchasing a cottage one for the drawingroom and another for the sittingroom that was to be the girls own property and on which she expended much care and contrivance  it opened into the drawingroom and like it had glass doors into the verandah as well as another door into the little hall  the drawingroom had a bow window looking over the fields towards the south and this way too looked the diningroom in which magdalen bestowed whatever was least interesting such as the hume and smollett and gibbon of her grandfathers library and her own school books from which she hoped to teach thekla  her upstairs arrangements had for the moment been rather disturbed by mrs bests wishing to come with her pupils but she decided that agatha should at once take possession of her own pretty room and the two next sisters of theirs while she herself would sleep in the dressing room which she destined to thekla giving up her own chamber to mrs best for these few days and sending theklas little bed to agathas room  and there she stood on the little terrace thinking how lovely the purple light on the moor was and how all the newcomers would enjoy such a treat  she had abstained from meeting them at the station having respect to the capacities of the horse even upon his native hills and she had hired a farmers cart to meet them and bring their luggage  already she had a glimpse of the carriage toiling up one hill then disappearing between the hedges and it was long before her gate already open was reached and at her own own door she received her little sister followed by the others  and the first word she heard even before she had time to pay the driver was my dear magdalen what a road  poor mrs best as the payment was put into the mans hand magdalen looked round and saw she looked quite worn out  yes said paulina bumped to pieces and tired to death  i was afraid they had been mending the roads said magdalen  mending  strewing them with rocks if you please said agatha  and such a distance added paulina  not quite three miles replied magdalen  here is some tea to repair you  my dear magdalenin a chorusthat really is quite impossible it must be five at least  your nearest town ten miles off sighed vera  your nearest church cried paulina  up in the wilds said agatha  magdalen felt as if these speeches were so many drops of water in her face and that of her beautiful goyle but she rose in its defence  it actually is less than three miles she said  i have walked it several times and the cabs only charge three  that is testimony said mrs best smiling but hills perhaps reckon for miles in ones feelings  particularly before you are rested said magdalen setting her down in a comfortable wicker chair  you will think little of it on your own feet vera and the church is much nearer paulina only on the other side of the hill  may i have a bicycle of my own burst in thekla again while every one began laughing and agatha told her that sister would think her brains were cycling   with centric and concentric scribbled oer cycle and epicycle orb in orb   epicycle cried vera  i saw it advertised in the queen  a splendid one  ah  magdalen you will think i have not taught them their milton said mrs best as both elders burst out laughing and agatha said in an undertone dont make yourself such a goose vera  i should think it rather rough sailing for bikes said paulina  i should have thought so myself returned magdalen but the clipstone girls do not seem to think so  i see them sailing merrily into rockstone  you have neighbours then said vera  certainly  rockstone supplies a good deal  here are various cards of people whose visits are yet to be returned  clipstone is further off but the daughters will be nice friends for you  i met one of them before when she was staying at lord rotherwoods  but i am afraid your boxes are hardly come yet  still you will like to take off your things before dinner even if you cannot unpack  she led the way and disposed of each girl in her new quarters explaining to agatha that hers and her little lodger were only temporary but it struck upon her rather painfully that the only word of approbation or comfort came from mrs best and there were no notes at all of admiration of the scenery  well she said to herself much is not to be expected from people who have been tired and shaken up in a station cab over newlymended roads  were they as bad when i came  but then i could look out and did not hear poor sophys groans all the way  i rather wish she had not come with them though i am glad to see her again for this last time  meantime the four girls had congregated in the room appropriated to vera and paulina  here are the necessaries of life said agatha handing out a brush and comb  that slow wain may roll its course in utter darkness before it comes here  to the other end of nowhere said vera  and i am so tired whined thekla  these tight boots do hurt me so  i want to go to bed  paulina was already on her knees removing the boots and accommodating a pair of slippers to the little feet  we might as well be in a desert island continued vera shut up from everything with an old frump  take care said agatha in warning signing towards thekla  i am sure she looks jolly and goodnatured said paulina  but did you hear what elsie lee always calls her our maiden aunt  all three laughed and vera added all the girls say she cant be less than fifty  topsy  you know she is only sixteen years older than i am  well thats half a hundred  sixteen and nineteen what do they make  oh never mind your sums  she has got the face and look of half a hundred  now i thought her face and her dress like a girls said paulina  yes said vera thats just the way with old maids  they dress themselves up youthfully and affect girlish airs and are all the more horrid  thats your experience said agatha  but theres the waggon creeping up at a snails pace  let us run down and see after our things    chapter iiithe first sunday    speed on speed on the footpath way    and merrily hunt the stilea a merry heart goes all the way    a sad tires in a milea  shakespeare   sunday morning rose with new and bright hopes  the girls looked out at their window and saw that it was a beautiful morning and that the spring sunshine glowed upon the purple summits of the hills agatha supposed there would be a pleasant walk to church paulina said she had heard good accounts of the services in that part of the country vera hoped that they would see what their neighbours were like and thekla was delighted with the jolly garden and places to scramble in  on this first sunday they were let alone to explore the garden before the walk to church which magdalen foresaw would be a long affair with mrs best  after their decorous stillness at breakfast it was a contrast to hear the merry voices and laughter outside but it subsided as soon as she approached though she did not hear the murmured ripple here comes maiden aunt  beholdquite a spicy hat  in truth magdalens hat was a pretty new one not by any means unsuitable to her age and appearance and altogether her air was more stylish than the country town breeding was accustomed to her dress perfectly plain but well made  vera was perhaps the most sensible of the perfection of the turnout agatha chiefly felt that her more decorated skirt and mantle had their inconveniences in walking through the red mud of the lanes impeded by books and umbrella which left no leisure to admire the primroses that studded the deep banks and which delighted thekla in the freedom of short skirts  magdalen herself had enough to do in steering along such a substantial craft as poor mrs best used to churchgoing along a street and shrouded under a squirrel mantle of many pounds weight  barely in time was the convoy when at last the exhausted lady was helped over the stone stile that led to the churchyard  highly picturesque was the grey structure outside but within modernism had not done much the chancel was feebly fitted after the ideas of the fifties but the faded woodwork of the nave was intact and magdalen still had to sit in the grim pew of her predecessors  the girls looks at each other might have suited the entrance to a condemned cell and the pulpit towered above them with a faded green cushion that seemed in danger of tumbling down over their heads  the service was a plain one but reverent and careful the music had a considerable element of harmonium mixed with schoolchild voices and the sermon from an elderly man was a good one but when the move to go out was made and the young ones were beyond earshot of their elders the exclamations were well i never thought to have gone back to georgian era  exactly the element of our maiden aunt  and nobody to be seen  naggie why do they shut one up in boxes  just to daunt flapsys roving eye tickle my dear  dont polly  there was nobody to be seen if we hadnt been in a box  of course no one comes there but stately old farmers and their smart daughters  i saw one with a gainsborough hat and a bunch of cocks feathers with a scarlet cactus cocking it up behind  flapsy made use of her opportunities you see  being emparocked in a pew cannot daunt her spirit of research  now nag i only meant to show you what impossible people they are  natives who will repay the study perhaps continued agatha reading as though from a book of travels  we were able to observe a group of the aborigines at their devotions  conspicuous was a not ungraceful young female whose head ornamented with a plume of feathers towered above the enclosure in which she was secluded while an aged fakir hakem or medicine man pronounced from a loftier structure resembling a sentry box  children children thats the wrong way came magdalens voice from behind  you must turn into that lane  wait a moment  they waited till mrs bests lagging steps allowed magdalen to come up with them but dead silence fell on them when mrs best observed you were very merry  they could not speak of the cause  perhaps magdalen divined something for she said we hope to make some improvements and so indeed does mr earl but he is very poor besides newcomers must work slowly  the doubt whether she had heard agathas speech made the girls conscious enough to keep from responding as she meant them to do by cheerful criticisms and indeed the task of cheering and dragging on mrs best was quite enough to occupy her  there was only three years difference in their ages but this seemed to have made a great interval between one whose metier had been to be youthful and active and her who had to be staid and dignified  the early dinner passed in all demureness and formality and the poor visitor was too much tired for any more services to be thought of for her  magdalen explained that when the days would be longer she thought of walking to rockstone for evensong but now the best way was to go to the chapel at clipstone which was nearer than either of the others  there is a lovely little chapel there beautifully fitted up by lord rotherwood and sir jasper merrifield for the hamlet she said  how far asked mrs best  about a mile and a half across the fields further by the road  you will find your bicycles available when you know the way  dont we go to rockstone asked paulina  i am sure there is a really satisfactory church there  st kenelms do you mean  that is not so near as st andrews church but that is very satisfactory and i go to one or other of them on weekdays  it is too late to come back on these spring sundays  i should not like to live among so many churches said mrs best and so far from them all  you love your old parish church like a faithful old churchwoman said magdalen  well you see i am faithful enough to go to my parish in the morning but i think we may be discursive afterwards there is a sunday school in which i was waiting to offer help till our party was made up  magdalen had looked twice for a responding smile first from agatha and then from paulina but none was awakened  the girls clustered together in the bedroom and the word goody passed between them  tempered by respect for my lord and sir jasper added agatha  and avoiding st kenelms because it is the real correct church said paulina  oh yes cried vera  mr hubert delrio went to see it in case eccles and beamster should have an order  we must go there  of course said paulina with a sympathetic nod  but said agatha there will be an embargo on all acquaintance except the grandees at clipstone  i shall never drop old friends cried vera  i am a rock of crystal as regards them whatever swells may require if they burst themselves like the frog and the ox  well done crystal rock but suppose the old friends slide off and drop you laughed agatha  vera tossed her head and thekla ran in to say that sister was ready  the walk was shorter and pleasanter than that in the morning over moorland but with a good road but all magdalen discovered on the walk was that though the girls had attended botanical classes they did not recognise spearwort when they saw it and agatha thought the old catalogue fashions of botany were quite exploded  this was a sentiment and it gave hopes of something like an argument and a conversation but they were at that moment overtaken by the neighbouring farmers wife who wanted to give miss prescott some information about a setting of eggs which she did at some length and with a rapid utterance of dialect that amused while it puzzled magdalen and her inquiries and comments were decided to be thoroughly goodwife by all save thekla who hailed the possible ownership of a hen and chicken as almost equal to that of a bicycle  magdalen further discovered that theklas name in common use was tickle or else ticktick paulina was of course paula or polly vera had her old baby title of flapsy which somehow suited her restless nervous motions and agatha had become nag  well it was the fashion of the day though not a pretty one but magdalen recollected with some pain her fathers pleasure in the selection of saintly names for his little daughters and she wondered how he would have liked to hear them thus transmuted  there had been something bordering on sentiment in her fathers character and something in paulinas expression made her hope to see it repeated by inheritance  she saw the countenance brighten out of the mornings antagonistic air when they entered the little chapel at clipstone and saw the altar adorned and carefully decked with white narcissus and golden daffodils  the little chapel was old and plain very small but reverently cared for  there was no choir but the chairs of those who could sing were placed near the harmonium which was played by one of the young ladies from the large gabled house to which the chapel was attached and the singing had the refined tones that belong to the music of cultivated people  the congregation was evidently of poor folks from the hamlet dependants of the great house and the family itself a greyhaired finelooking general a tall darkeyed lady a tall youth a schoolboy and four girlsone of whom was musician and the other presided over the school children  the service was reverent the catechising good and effective the sermon brief and summing up in a spiritual and devotional manner magdalen was happy and trusted that paulina was so likewise  she expected to hear some commendation as they walked home but vera alone kept with her to examine her on the names and standing of the persons she had seen on which there was as yet little to tell for the first move towards acquaintance had not yet been made  all that was known was that there were sir jasper and lady merrifield connections of lord rotherwood who owned most of the rockstone property and who with his family had once been staying in the country house where magdalen had been governess but it was a long time ago and she only recollected that there were some nice little girls  at least she said no more but her friend thought the more  i suppose they will call said vera  most likely they will  has nobody called  mr earl the vicar of arnscombe  he has promised to tell me how we can be of use here  i believe there is great want of a lady at the sunday school  this did not interest veraand she went on asking questions about the neighbourhood and whether any of the rockstone people had left cards and whether there were any parties garden or evening at rockstonemore than magdalen could yet answer though she was glad to promote any sort of conversation with either of the girls who did not stand aloof from her  i say the ma maiden aunt knows nobody but that old clergyman who wants her to teach his sunday school  im out of that thank goodness said agatha  and sunday schools are a delusion only hindering the children from going to church with their parents said paulina  and if nobody calls and they all think her no better than an old governess how awfully slow it will be continued vera  i do not suppose that will last said agatha  there is rockstone remember  ten miles off said vera disconsolately  oh nag nag isnt it horrid  we shall be just smart enough to be taken for swells and know nobody and the swells wont have us because she is a governess we might as well be upon a desert island at once  agatha could not help laughing and repeating    i am out of humanitys reach    i must finish my journey alone  never hear the sweet music of speech    i start at the sound of my own   but really nag broke in paulina it is horrid  here we are equidistant from three or four churches and condemned to the most behind the world of them all and then to the one where there is this distant fragrance of swells instead of the only catholic one  agatha had a little more common sense than the other two and she responded   after all you know you are better off than if you were still at school and the ma is a good old soul at the bottom and you may manage her depend on it  though i wish she had let me go to girton  magdalen and mrs best meantime were going over future prospects and old times  mrs bests destination was albertstown in queensland where her son george had a good practice as a doctor and where he assured her she would find church privilegeseven a cathedral so called and a bishopthough bishop fulmort was always out on some expedition among the colonists or the natives but among his clergy there was always sunday service  in fact magdalen thought the good old lady expected to find a town more like filsted than the goyle there was a sisterhood located there too which tried mostly in vain to train the wild native womenan attempt at which george best laughed though he allowed that the sisters were splendid nurses especially sister angela who had a wonderful way of bringing cases round  magdalen could feel secure that her old friend would be near kind people and presently mrs best returning to the actual neighbourhood observed   merrifield  it is not a common name  no but i do not think this is the same family  this is a retired general living in a house of lord rotherwoods  i once met one of his little girls who came to castle towers with the rotherwood party and though she had a brother of the name he was evidently not the same person  mrs best asked no more for telltale colour had arisen in magdalens cheeks and she had been the confidante of an engagement with a certain henry merrifield who had been employed in the bank at filsted when magdalen was a very young girl  his father had come down suddenly had found debt and dissipation had broken all off decidedly and no more had been heard of the young man  it was many years previously but those cheeks and the tone of the reply made her suspect that there was still poignancy in the remembrance    chapter ivcycles    what flowers grow in my field wherewith to dress thee  e barrett browning  mrs best departed early the next morning  it was probably a parting for life between the two old friends and magdalen keenly felt the severance from the one person whom she had always known and on whose sympathy she could rely  their conversations had been very precious to her and she felt desolate without the entire companionship  yet on the other hand she felt as if she could have begun better with her sisters if sophy best had not come with them to hand them over as it were when she wanted to start on the same level with them and be more like their contemporary than their authority  they all stood on the terrace watching the fly go down the hill and she turned to them and said   we will all settle ourselves this morning and you will see how the land lies so that tomorrow we can arrange our day and see what work to do  thekla when you have had a run round the garden you might bring your books to the diningroom and let me see how far you have gone  oh sister it is holidays  well my dear you have had a week and your holiday time cannot last for ever  looking at your books cannot spoil it  yes it will they are so nasty  perhaps you will not always think so but now you had better put on your hat and your thick boots for the grass is still very wet and explore the country  the same advice to you she added turning to the others it is warm here but the dew lies long on the slopes  we have got a great deal too much to do said agatha for dawdling about just now  really she was chiefly prompted by the satisfaction of not being ordered about and the other two followed suit while magdalen turned away to her household business  they found the housemaid in possession of the bedrooms so that the unpacking plans could not conveniently be begun and while agatha was struggling with the straps of a book box thekla burst in upon them  oh nag nag there is the loveliest angel of a bicycle in the stable and a dear little pony besides  new tyre wheels he says  a bicycle  well if she has got it for us she is an angel indeed said vera  it is a big one said thekla but the pony is a dear little thing pixy is his name and i can ride him  do come flapsy and see earwaker will show you  it is he that does the oiling of pixy and harnessing the bicycle  i mean  tick tick which does he oil and which does he harness said paula  that little tongue wants both said agatha  but do do come and see said thekla not at all disconcerted by being laughed at and vera came only asserting her independence by not putting on either hat or boots  thekla led the way to the stable tucked under the hill at the back and presiding over a linhay as she had already learnt to call the tiny farmcourt containing accommodation for two cows a pig and sundry fowls  there was a shed attached with a wicker pony carriage and the bicycle a handsome modern one with all the newest appendages including the nevertires as thekla had translated them  but disappointment was in store for vera  magdalen came out during the inspection and was received with   sister you never told us of this beauty  it was a parting present from general mansell she said and he took great pains to get me a very good one  and you bike  oh yes i learnt to go out with the colvins  but i do not venture to use it much here unless the road is good  those rocks freshly laid towards rockstone would make regular havoc of the pneumatic tyres  vera saw that this was prohibitive and felt too much vexed to mention theklas version of the same but magdalen asked have you learnt  they were always going to teach me at warner grange but it always snowed or rained or skated i mean we skated or something whenever hubert had time but i am perfectly dying to learn  well before you expire we may teach you a little on these smoother paths and hire one perhaps by the time the stones are passable just at present i think our own legs and pixys are safer for that descent  vera was pacified enough to look on with a certain degree of complacency while thekla was enraptured at being set to take out the eggs from the hens nests  but the conclave in the sittingroom on veras report decided selfish old thing it is only an excuse  of course we should take care not to spoil it  it shows what will be the way with everything  no one knew of a still more secret conclave within magdalens own breast one of those held at times by many an elder between the claims of loyalty to the keepsakes of affection and old association and the gratification of present desires  magdalen thought of the rules of convents forbidding the appropriation of personal trifles and wondered if it were wise if stern but for the present she decided that it could not be her duty to risk what had been carefully and kindly selected for her in unpractised and careless hands and she further compromised the matter by reckoning whether her funds which were not excessive would admit of the hire or purchase of machines that might allay the burning aspirations of her young people  the upshot of her reckoning was that when they all met at the early dinner she announced i think we might go to rock quay this afternoon between the pony carriage and shankss mare  i want to ask about some lessons and we could see about the hire of a bicycle for you to learn upon  it was only agatha who answered thank you but it is not worth while for me i shall be away so soon  thekla cried out me tooand paulina mumbled something  in truth besides the thought of the bicycle in the stable the other two had lived enough in the countrytown atmosphere to be foolishly disgusted at being obliged to dine early  that they had always been used to it made them only think it beneath their age as well as their dignity and what a horrid nuisance had been on their tongues when the bell was ringing  moreover they had enough of silly prejudice about them to feel aggrieved at the sight of hash nice as it was with fresh vegetables and they were not disposed to good temper when they sat down to their meal  they perhaps properly means the middle pair for agatha had more notion of manners and of respect and thekla had an endless store of chatter about her discoveries  the ponycarriage was brought round in due time but just then another vehicle of the same kind only prettier and with two ponies was seen at the gate too late for the barbarian instinct of rushing away to hide from morning visitors to be carried out before lady merrifield and a daughter were up the slope and on the levelled road before the verandah  i think this is an old acquaintance said lady merrifield as she shook hands though perhaps mysie is grown out of remembrance  oh yes said an honest openfaced maiden eagerly putting out her hand  dont you remember miss prescott our all staying at castle towers  i came with phyllis devereux and she and i took poor betty bernard out after blackberries and she thought it was a mad bull when it was a railway whistle and ran into a cowpond and cousin rotherwood came and captain grantley and got her out  magdalen was smiling and nodding recollection and added it was really one of the boys  oh yes   i thought it was a crazy bull    firing a blunderbuss   she paused for recollection and magdalen went on    i thought it was a crazy bull    firing a blunderbuss i looked again and lo it was    a water polypus oh guard my life i said for she    will make an awful fuss   ah do you remember that cried mysie  i have so often tried to recollect what it really was when she looked again  captain grantley made it you know when we were trying to comfort betty  i remember you and lady phyllis said you would go and confess to mrs bernard and take all the blame and lord rotherwood said he would escort you  yes and betty said it was no good for if her mother forgave her ten times over still that spiteful french maid would put her to bed and say she had no robe convenable went on mysie  but then you took her to your own room and washed her and mended her so that she came out all right at luncheon and nobody knew anything but she thought that horrid woman guessed and tweaked her hair all the harder for it  poor child she looked as if she were under a tyranny  have you seen her since  no but phyllis tells me she has burst forth into liberty bicycles and wild doings that would drive her parents to distraction if she dreamt of them  how is lady phyllis  did i not hear that the family had gone abroad for her health  oh yes and i went with them  they all had influenza and were frightened but it ended in our meeting with franceska vanderkist the very most charming looking being i ever did see and ivinghoe had fallen in love with her when she was miranda and he married her like a real old hero  do you remember ivinghoe  no i suppose he was one of an indistinguishable troop of schoolboys  i remember lord rotherwoods good nature and fun when he met the bedraggled party said magdalen smiling  that is what every one remembers about him said lady merrifield smiling  you have imported a large party of youth miss prescott  my young sisters responded magdalen but i shall soon part with agatha she is going to oxford  indeed  to which college  i have a daughter at oxford and a niece just leaving cambridge  such is our lot in these days  no not this one but her elder sister gillian is at lady catharines  i am going to st roberts said agatha abruptly  close to lady catharines  gillian will be glad to tell her anything she would like to ask about it  you had better come over to tea some afternoon  the time was fixed and then magdalen showed some of the advertisements of tuition in art music languages and everything imaginable which had begun to pour in upon her and was very glad of a little counsel on the reputation of each professor  lady merrifield saying however that her experience was small as her young people in general were not musical with the single exception of her son wilfred who was at home reading to go up for the civil service and recreating himself with the choral society and lessons on the violin  my youngest is fifteen she said and we provide for her lessons amongst us except for the school of art and calisthenics at the high school which is under superior management now and very much improved  mysie echoed oh calisthenics are such fun and took the reins to drive away  oh she is very nice exclaimed mysie as they drove down the hill  yes there is something very charming about her  i wonder whether sam made a great mistake  mamma what do you mean  have i been meditating aloud  you said when you met her at castle towers she asked you whether you had a brother harry  yes she did  i only said yes but he was going to be a clergyman and when she heard his age she said he was not the one she had known i did not speak of cousin henry because you said we were not to mention him  what was it if i may know mamma  there is no reason that you should not except that it is a painful matter to mention to bessie or any of the stokesley cousins  harry was never like the rest i believe but i had never seen him since he was almost a baby  he never would work and was not fit for any examination  our harry used to say that bessie and david had carried off all the brains of the family  the others have sense and principle though  well they put their hal into a bank at filsted and by and by they found he was in a great scrape with gambling debts and i believe that but for the forbearance of the partners he might have been prosecuted for embezzling a sumor at least he was very near it besides which he had engaged himself to an attorneys daughter very young and with a very disagreeable mother or stepmother  the admiral came down in great indignation thought these prescotts had inveigled poor henry broke everything hastily off and shipped him off to canada to his brothers george and john  they found some employment for him but susan and bessie doubt whether they were very kind to him and in a few years more he was in fresh scrapes and with worse stains and questions of his integrity  it ended in his running away to the states and no trace has been found of him since  i am afraid he took away money of his brothers  how long ago was it mamma  at least twenty years  it was while we were in malta  who would have thought of those dear stokesley cousins having such a skeleton in their cupboard  ah my dear no one knows the secrets of others hearts  and you really think that this miss prescott was his love  i know it was the same name and bessie told me that he used to talk to her of his magdalen or maidie and when i heard of your meeting her at castle towers i wondered if it were the same  and now i see what she is and what she is undertaking for these young sisters i have wondered whether your uncle was wise to insist on the utter break and whether she might not have been an anchor to hold him fast to his moorings  only said mysie if he had really cared would he have let his father break it off so entirely  i think your uncle expected implicit obedience  but said mysie and left the rest unsaid while both she and her mother went off into meditations on different lines on the exigencies of parental discipline and of the requirements of fullgrown hearts  and on the whole the younger one was the most for strict obedience the experienced parent in favour of liberty  but then mysie was old fashioned and dutiful    chapter vclipstone friends    what idle progeny succeed to chase the rolling circles speed or urge the flying ballgray   the afternoon at clipstone was a success  gillian was at home and every one found congeners  lady merrifields sister miss mohun pounced upon miss prescott as a coadjutor in the alphabet of good works needed in the neglected district of arnscombe where mr earl was wifeless and the farm ladies heedless but they were interrupted by mysie running up to claim miss prescott for a game at croquet uncle redgie was so glad to see the hoops come into fashion again and vera and paula hardly knew the game they had always played at lawn tennis but they were delighted to learn for uncle redgie proved to be a very finelooking retired general and there was a lad besides grown to manly height and one boy at home for easter who caring not for croquet went with primrose to exhibit to thekla the tame menagerie where a mungoose called of course raki raki was the last acquisition  she was also shown the kittens of the beloved begum and presented with phoebus a tabby with a wise face and a head marked like a greek lyre to be transplanted to the goyle in due time  if sister will let me have it said thekla  of course she will said primrose  mysie says she is so jolly  dear me all the girls at our school said she was a regular old maid  what shocking bad form exclaimed primrose  just like cads of girls muttered fergus unheard for thekla continuedwhy they said she must be our maiden aunt instead of our sister  the best thing going said fergus  maiden aunts in books are always horrid said thekla  then the books ought to be hung drawn and quartered and spifflicated besides said fergus  fergus doesnt like anybody so well as aunt jane said primrose because nobody else understands his machines  thekla made a grimace  ah said primrose  i see it is just as mamma and mysie said when they came home that miss prescott was very nice indeed and it was famous that she should make a home for you all only they were afraid you seemed as ifyou might betiresome ended primrose looking for a word  well you know she wants to be our governess said thekla  well repeated primrose  and of course no one ever likes their governess  this aphorism so uttered by thekla provoked a yell from primrose echoed by fergus and primrose getting her breath declared that dear miss winter was a great darling and since she had gone away mores the pity mamma was real governess to herself valetta and mysie and she always looked at their translations and heard their reading if gillian was not at home  and they are quite grownup young ladies  mysie is but i dont know about val  only i dont see why any one should be silly and do nothing if one is grown up ever so much said primrose  as the eiffel tower put in fergus  nonsense said primrose bent on being improving  dont you know what that old book of mammas says when will miss rosamonds education be finished  she answered never  thekla gave a groan whether of pity for rosamond or for herself might be doubted and a lopeared rabbit was a favourable diversion  there was a triad who seemed to be of rosamonds opinion regarding education for agatha was eagerly availing herself of the counsel of gillian and the books shown to her with the further assistance of the cousin dolores mohun now an accredited lecturer in technical classes though making her home and headquarters at clipstone  theklas views of young ladyhood were a good deal more fulfilled by the lessons on cycling which were going on among the other young people after the game of croquet had ended  every size and variety seemed to exist among the clipstone population under certain regulations of not coasting down the hills the girls not going out alone and never into the town but always putting up at aunt janes  vera and paulina were in ecstasy and there was a continual mounting attempting and nearly falling or turning anywhere but the right little screams and much laughter jasper attending upon vera who in spite of her failures looked remarkably pretty and graceful upon valettas machine while paula whom mysie and valetta were both assisting learnt more easily and steadily but looked on with a few qualms as to the entire crystal rock constancy that vera had professed more especially when jasper volunteered to come over to the goyle and give another lesson  magdalen after her game at croquet had spent a very pleasant time with lady merrifield and her brother and sister till they were imperiously summoned by primrose to come and give consent to the transfer of phoebus or to choose between him and the mufti to whom thekla had begun to incline  the whole party adjourned to the back settlements where magdalen was edified by the antics of the mungoose and admired the begum and her progeny with a heartiness that would have won theklas heart save that she remembered hearing vera say over the domestic cat in the morning that mas were always devoted to cats  but on the whole the visit had done much to reconcile the young sisters to their new surroundings books bicycles and kitten had reconciled them even to the intimacy with swells  the hired bicycle and tricycle had arrived in their absence and the moment breakfast was over the next morning the three younger ones all rushed off to the enjoyment and at ten minutes past the appointed hour for the early reading and study agatha felt obliged to go out and tell them that the ma was sitting like patience on a monument waiting for them on which three tongues said bother and she ought to let us off till the proper end of the holidays  then you should have propitiated her by asking leave after the scripture was done said agatha you might have known she would not let you off that  bother said vera again just like an ma  i did forget said paula and you know it was only just going through a lesson for forms sake like the old superlative  they had in fact read the day before when thekla had made such frightful work of every unaccustomed word and the elders by one or two observations had betrayed so much ignorance alike of samuels history and of the gospel of st luke that she had resolved to endeavour at a thorough teaching of the old and new testaments for the first hour on alternate days giving one day in the week to catechism and prayer book  she asked what they had done before  mrs best always read something at prayers  something  something out of the bible  no the testament  i am sure it was the bible it was so fat  and saul was in it and we had him yesterday  that was st paul before he was converted said paula  there their knowledge seemed to end and it further appeared that mrs best heard the catechism and collect on sundays from the unconfirmed and had tried to get the gospel repeated by heart but had not succeeded  we did not think it fair said vera  none of the other houses did  yes said agatha miss ferriss did  oh she is a regular old prot said paula almost a dissenter and it is not the gospel either only texts out of her own head  polly said agatha  texts out of her own head  it is bible of course only what she fancies and they have to work out the sermon and if they cant do the sermon a text  they might as well be dissenters at once said paula  janet mleod is said vera  it was really dissentish  magdalen could not help saying so you would not learn the gospel because dissenters learnt pieces of scripture  you seem to me like the roman catholic child who said there were five sacraments there ought to be seven but the protestants had got two of them  she was sorry she had said it for though agatha laughed the other two drew into themselves as if their feelings were hurt  these are the boardinghouse habits she said  what is done at the high school itself  the vicar comes when he has time and gives a lecture on an epistle said agatha or a curate if he doesnt but i was working for the exam and didnt go this last term  what was it polly  on theon the apollonians answered paulina hesitating  my dear where did he find it  i know it was something about apollo said vera  it was corinthians said paula  i ought to have recollected but the lectures are very dull and disjointed you said so yourself nag and the rector is very low church  so you could not learn from him  really sister said agatha the lectures are not well managed they are in too many hands and too uncertain and it is not easy to learn much from them  well that being the case i think we had better begin at the beginning  suppose i ask you to say the first answer in the catechism  on which vera said they had all been confirmed except thekla and passed it on to her  however the endeavours of that halfhour need not be recounted and the moment halfpast ten chimed out the young ladies jumped up and would have been off to the bicycles if magdalen had not felt that the time was come for asserting authority and said not yet if you please  we cannot waste whole days  you know herr gnadiger is coming tomorrow and it would be well to practise that sonata beforehand you ought each to practise it paula you had better begin and vera you prepare this first scene of marie stuart to read with me when theklas lessons are over  change over when paula has done  it is of no use my doing anything while anyone is playing said vera  nonsense agatha muttered but magdalen said you can sit in the drawingroom or your own room  come ticktick wheres your slate come along  dont sulk flapsy said the elder sister it is of no use  the ma means to be minded and will be and you know it is all for your good  i hate my good said naughty vera  so does every one when it is against the grain said agatha but remember it is a preparation for a free life of our own  it is our cross said paula as she placed herself on the music stool with a look of resignation almost comical  nor did her performance interfere with the equations which agatha was diligently working out but vera though refusing to take refuge from the piano to which in fact she was perfectly inured worried her elder as much as she durst by inquiries after the meaning of words or what horrid verb to look out in the dictionary and it was a pleasing change when paula proceeded to work the same scene out for herself without having recourse to explanations so that agatha was undisturbed except by the careless notes which almost equally worried magdalen in the more distant diningroom  this was really the crisis of the battle of study  as the girls were accustomed to it and knew that they were of an age to be ground down they followed agathas advice and submitted without further open struggle though there was a good deal of low murmur and the foremans work was not essentially disagreeable even while vera maintained what she believed to be an axiom that governesses were detestable and that the ma must incur the penalty of acting as such  very soon after luncheon appeared three figures on bicycles  wilfred merrifield with mysie and valetta come to give another lesson on the flying circles speed  magdalen came out with her young people to enjoy their amusement as well as to watch over her own precious machine as vera said  it was admired as became connoisseurs in the article and she soon saw that wilfred was to be trusted with the care of it so she consented to its being ridden in the practice provided it was not taken out into the lanes  mysie turned off from the practising where she was not wanted and joined miss prescott in walking through the garden terraces and planning what would best adorn them talking over favourite books and enjoying themselves very much then going on to the quarry where mysie looked about with a critical eye to see if it displayed any fresh geological treasures to send fergus in quest of  she began eagerly to pour forth the sisters neverending tale of her brothers cleverness and thus they came down the outside lane to the lower gate seeing beforehand the sparkle of bicycles in its immediate proximity  it was not open but vera might be seen standing with one hand on the latch the other on magdalens bicycle her face lifted with imploring enticing smiles to wilfred who had fallen a little back while paula had decidedly drawn away  none of them had seen magdalen and mysie till they were round the low stone wall and close upon them  there was a general start and vera exclaimed we havent been outside  no we havent  and it is not the rockquay road either sister  i only wanted a run down that lane up above  wilfred laughed a little oddly  it was quite plain that he had been withstanding the temptress only how long would the resistance have lasted  downright mysie exclaimed it would have been a great shame if you had and i am glad wilfred hindered you  thank you said magdalen smiling to him  you know better than my sisters what devon lanes and pneumatic tyres are  perhaps wilfred was a little vexed though he had resisted for he was ready to agree with mysie that they could not stay and drink tea  but he did not escape his sisters displeasure for mysie began at once how lucky it was that we came in time  i do believe that naughty little thing was just going to talk you over into doing what her sister had forbidden  a savage old selfish bear  it was only the lane  full of crystals as sharp as needles enough to cut any tyre in two said mysie  like your tongue eh mysie  well you did not do it  that is a comfort  you would not let her transgress and ruin her sisters good bicycle  she is an uncommonly pretty little sprite and the selfish hag of a sister only left orders that i was to take care of the bike  i could see where there was a stone as well as anybody else  hag angrily cried mysie she is the only nice one of the whole lot  vera is a nasty little thing or she would never think of meddling with what does not belong to her or trying to persuade you to allow it  i call it abominable selfishness dog in the mangerish to shut up such a machine as that and condemn her sisters to one great lumbering one  thats one account said valetta  paula said it was only till they had learnt to ride properly and till the stones have a little worn in  yes said mysie i could see vera is an exaggerating monkey just talking over and deluding will just as men like when they get a silly fit  by this time wilfred had thought it expedient to put his bicycle to greater speed and indulge in a long whistle to show how contemptible he thought his sisters as he went out of hearing  paulina is nice and good said valetta she has heard all about st kenelms and wants to go there  yes and she means to be a sister of charity only she is afraid her sister is narrow and low church  that is stuff and nonsense said mysie  i have had a great deal of talk with miss prescott  she loves all the same books that we do she is going to have g f s and mothers union and all at poor arnscombe and she told me to call her magdalen  with which proofs of congeniality valetta could not choose but be impressed    chapter vithe frescoes of st kenelms    earn well the thrifty months nor wed raw haste halfsister to delaytennyson   the deferred expedition to rockquay also began magdalen driving vera and thekla  she was pleased with her visitors and hoped that the girls would feel the same but vera began by declaring that that miss merrifield was not pretty  not exactly but it is an honest winning face  so broad and such a wide mouth and no style at all as i should have expected after all that about lords and ladies  an old blue serge and sailor hat  you dont expect people to drive about the country in silk attire  well perhaps she is not out  sister do you know i am seventeen  yes my dear certainly  oh look look theres a dear little calf broke in thekla and oh what horns the cows have  i shall be afraid to go near them was it only a sham mad bull when the little girl ran into the pond  it was the railway whistle and she had never heard it in the fields  she rushed away in a great fright and ran into the pond full of horrible black mud  the gentlemen heard the scream and dragged her out and it would have all been fun and a good story if she had not been so much afraid of the french ladys maid  it is curious how the sight of those brown eyes brought the whole scene back to me  we all grew so fond of mysie merrifield in the few days we spent together and she is very little altered  is she out asked vera once more  oh yes she cannot be less than twenty  and i am seventeen said vera returning to the charge  i ought to be out  if there are nice invitations i shall be quite ready to accept them for you  but i am too old for the schoolroom and lessons and masters  too old or too wise said magdalen laughing  i have got into the highest form in everything  every one at filston of my age is leaving off all the bother  not agatha  oh but agatha is  is what  agatha is awfully clever and wants to be something  something  but do you want to evaporate  to be nothing at all i mean said magdalen seeing her first word was bewildering and thekla put in   flapsy couldnt go off in steam could she  isnt that evaporating  i think what she wants is to be a young lady at large  eh vera only i dont quite see how that is to be managed even if it is quite a worthy ambition  but we will talk that over another time  do you see how pretty those sails are crossing the bay  neither girl seemed to have eyes for the lovely blue of the sea in the spring sunshine nor the striking forms of ruddy peaks of rock that enclosed it  uneducated eyes she thought as she slowly manoeuvred the pony down the steep hill before coming to the rockstone cliff road  the other two girls were following her direction across field and road and making their observations  a dose of lords and ladies said agatha  i thought they were rather nice said paula  i see how it will be said agatha  they will patronise the ma as lady somebodys old governess and she will fawn upon them and run after them and we shall be on those terms  but i thought you meant to be a governess  i shall make my own line  i know how swells look on a governess of the ancien regime and how they will introduce her as the kindly old goody who mends my little ladys frock  the girl had not any airs said paula  she told me about the churches down there in the townnot the ones we went to on sunday but theres one that is very low indeed and st andrews which is their parish church was suiting the moderate high church folk and there is st kenelms very high indeed mr flights i think i have heard of him and it is just the right thing i am sure  dont flatter yourself that the ma will let you have much pleasure in it  it is just what people of her sort think dangerous  but do you know nag i do believe that it is the church that hubert delrio was sent down to study and make a design for  whew  there will be a pretty kettle of fish if he comes down about it  that is if he and flapsy have not forgotten all about the ice and the forfeits at warners grange as is devoutly to be hoped  do you hope it really nag for flapsy really was very muchdid care very much  i have no great faith in flapsys affections surviving the contact with greater swells  poor hubert  perhaps his will not survive common sense  i am sure i hope not for both their sakes  but nag it would be very horrid of them if they had no constancy declared the more romantic paula  it will be a regular mess if they do have it and bring on horrid scrapes with the ma  just think  it is all very well to say she has known hubert all his life but she cant treat him as a gentleman or she wont  she has a position to keep up with all these swells and he will be only the man who paints the church  i only hope he will not come  there will be nothing but bother if he does unless they both have more sense and less constancy than you expect  well this really is a splendid view  old mr delrio would be wild about it  here the steep and stony hill brought them into contact with the pony carriage nor were there any more confidential conversations  the pony was put up at the top of the hill leading from rockstone to rockquay and thence the party walked down for miss prescott to make a few purchases and moreover to begin by gratifying theklas reiterated entreaty for a bicycle though as she was unpractised and growing so fast it was decided to be better to hire a tricycle for practice and one bicycle on which vera and paula might learn the art  the choice was a long one and left only just time for a peep into the two churches and a study of the hours of their services  st kenelms was decided to be a perfect gem ornaments beauty and all a little overdone perhaps in magdalens opinion but perfectly the thing in her sisters  this st andrews fulfilled to her mind being handsome reverent and decorous in all the arrangements while to the younger folk it was all very well but quite of the old times  little did they know of old times beyond the quarter century of their birth  poor old arnscombe might feebly represent them but even that had struggled out of the modern dark ages  magdalen had decided on talking to agatha and seeing how far she understood the situation and she came to her room to put her in possession now that mrs best had left the guest chamber free  this is your home when you are here  you must put up any belongings that you do not want to take to st roberts  thank you it is a nice pleasant room  and my dear may i stay a few minutes  i think we had better have a talk and quite understand one another  very well  it was not quite encouraging but agatha really wished to hear and she advanced a wicker chair for her elder sister and sat down on the window seat  thank you my dear i do not know how much mrs best has told you  she told us that you had always been very good to us and that you had been our guardian ever since we lost our mother  did she tell you what we have of our own that our father could leave us  no  what amounts to about 40 pounds a year apiece  mrs best in her very great goodness has taken you four for that amount though her proper charge is eighty  and she never let any one guess it said agatha more warmly for fear we might feel the difference  how very good of her  she seemed more impressed by mrs bests bounty than by magdalens but probably she took the latter as a matter of course and obligation besides the sense of it involved a sum in subtraction however this was not observed by her sister who did not want to feel obliged  now that this property has come in continued magdalen we can live comfortably together upon it for the present and your expenses at oxford can be paid as well as masters in what may be needful for the others and an allowance for dress  i suppose you will want the 40 pounds while you are at st roberts besides the regular expenses  thank you warmly said  but i want you to understand as i think you do about the future for you must be prepared to be independent  i should have wished for a career if i had been a millionaire said agatha  i believe you would and it is well that you should have every advantage  but the others  if i left you all this property it would not be a comfortable maintenance divided among four and you would not like to be dependent or to leave the last who might not marry to a pittance alone  certainly not said agatha with flashing eyes  then you see that it is needful that you should be able to do something for yourselves  i can give one of you at a time the power of going to the university  i dont think vera or polly would wish for that said agatha  well what would they wish for  i can do something towards preparing them and i can teach thekla but i should like to know what you think would be best for them  veras strong point is music said agatha  she cares for that more than anything else and mr selby thought she had talent and might sing only she must not strain her voice  i dont believe she will do much in any other line  and pollyshe is very good and always does her best because it is right but i dont think anything is any particular pleasure to her except needlework  she is always wanting to make things for the church  she really has a better voice than flapsy and can play better but that is because she is so much steadier  seventeen and sixteen are they not  yes but polly seems ever so much older than flapsy  mrs best showed me that she had higher marks  she must be a thoroughly good girl  that she is cried agatha warmly  she never had any task for getting into mischief  well they are both so young that a little study with me will be good for them and there will be time to judge what they are fit for in art i think they are not much interested  paula draws pretty well but vera hates it  old mr delrio is always cross to her now but agatha stopped short remembering that there might be a reason why the drawing master no longer made her a favourite pupil  do you think him a good judge  yes mrs best thinks much of him  he had an artists education and sometimes has a picture in the water colour exhibition but i believe he did not find it answer and so he took our school of art  agatha had talked sensibly throughout the conference but not confidentially much in fact as she would have discussed her sisters with mrs best  she was glad that at the moment the sound of the piano set them listening  she did not feel bound to mention to sister any more than she would to the head mistress that when staying at mr warings country house a sort of semiflirtation had begun with hubert delrio a young man to whose education his father had sacrificed a great deal and who was a wellinformed and intelligent gentleman in all his ways  he had engaged himself to the great firm of eccles and beamster ecclesiastical decorators and might be employed upon the intended frescoes of st kenelms church  ought sister to be told  but agatha thought it would be betraying confidence to set on the dragon and besides nobody ever could tell how much veras descriptions meant  she knew already that the sweetest countenance in the world and the loveliest dark eyes belonged to a fairly good looking young man and she could also suspect that the squeeze of my hand might be an ordinary shake and the kneeling before the one he loved best might have been only the customary forfeit  on the whole it would be better to let things take their course it was not likely that either was seriously smitten and it was more than probable that hubert delrio would be too busy to look after a young lady now in a different stratum and that vera would have found another sweetest countenance in the world  all this passed through her mind while magdalen listened and pronounced   that is brillianta clever touchonly  yes that is verai know what you are noticing but this is only amusement she is not taking pains  it is very cleverespecially as probably she has no music  but there  pollys  oh yes she is really steadygoing  that is just what you will find her  this is a charming room sister thank you very much  make it your home my dear  but in reality they were not much nearer together than before the conference    chapter viisister and sisters    have we not all amid earths petty strife some pure ideal of a nobler life we lost it in the daily jar and fact and now live idly in a vain regret adelaide procter   agatha was so much absorbed in her preparation for st roberts that she did not pay very much heed to her younger sisters or their relations with magdalen  she had induced them to submit to the regulation of their studies with her pretty much as if she had been mrs best looking upon her however as something out of date and hardly up to recent opinions not realising that of late magdalens world had been a wide one  perhaps in agathas feelings there was an undercurrent inherited from her mother who had always felt the better connected better educated stepdaughter a sort of alien element exciting jealousy by her companionship to her father and after his death apt to be regarded as a scarcely willing and perhaps censorious paymaster  your sister might call it too expensive  i must ask your sister no your sister does not think she can afford it  i am sure she might  her expenses must be nothing  all this had been no preparation for full sisterly confidence with sister even when a sort of grudging gratitude was extracted and agatha had been quite old enough to imbibe an undefined antagonism though being a sensible girl she repressed the manifestations kept her sisters in order and taught them not to love but to submit and herself remained in a state of civil coolness without an approach beyond formal signs of affection and such confidence  it was the more disappointing to magdalen because agatha and paulina both showed so much unconscious likeness to their father not only in features but in little touches of gesture and manner  she longed to pet them and say oh my dears how like papa but the only time she attempted it she was met by a severe uncomprehending look and manner  and agatha went away to oxford without any thawing on her part  the only real ground that had been gained was with little thekla who was soon very fond of sister and depended on her more and more for sympathy and amusement  girls of seventeen and sixteen do not delight in the sports of nineyearolds except in the case of special pets and protegees and thekla was snubbed when a partner was required to assist in dolls dramas or in evening games  only sister would play unreservedly with her unaware or unheeding that this was looked on as keeping up the metier of governess  indeed theklas reports of schoolroom murmurs and sneers about the ma had to be silenced  peace and good will could best be guarded by closed ears  yet even then thekla missed child companionship and even more competition the lack of which rendered her dull and listless over her lessons and when reproved she would beg to be sent to school or at least to attend the high school on her bicycle  not admiring the manners or the attainments of the specimens before her magdalen felt bound to refuse and the sisters pity kept alive the grievance  she had however decided on granting the bicycles  she had found plenty of use for her own for it was possible with prudent use of it avoiding the worst parts of the road to be at early celebration at st andrews and get to the sunday school at arnscombe afterwards and paulina with a little demur decided on giving her assistance there  at a propagation of the gospel meeting at the town hall the misses prescott were introduced to the reverend augustine flight of st kenelms and his mother lady flight who sat next to magdalen and began to talk eagerly of the designs for the ceiling of their church and the very promising young artist who was coming down from eccles and beamster to undertake the work  the church had not yet been seen and the conversation ended in the sisters coming back to tea at which paula was very happy for the talk had something of the rather exclusive high church tone that was her ideal  she had seen it in books but had never heard it before in real life and vera was in a restless state longing to hear whether the promising young artist was really hubert delrio and hoping while she believed that she feared that she should blush when she heard his name  however she did not though mr flight unfolded his rough plans for the frescoes which were to be of virgin and child martyrs magdalen hesitating a little over those that seemed too legendary while old lady flight portly and sentimental declared them so sweet and touching  after tea they went on to the church  just at the entrance of the porch vera clutched at paula with the whisper wasnt that wilfred merrifield  there crossing  nonsense was paulas reply as she lingered over the illuminated list of the hours of services displayed at the door and feeling as if she had attained dreamland as she saw two fully habited sisters enter and bend low as they did so  the church was very elaborately ornamented small but showing that no expense had been spared though there was something that did not quite accord with magdalens ideas of the best taste so that when they went out she answered paulas raptures of admiration somewhat coldly or what so appeared to the enthusiastic girl  the next day meeting miss mohun over cutting out for a working party magdalen asked her about the flights and st kenelms  he is an excellent good man said jane mohun and has laid out immense sums on the church and parish  all his own  not subscription  no  he is the only son of a very rich city man a brewer and came here with his mother as a curate as a good place for health  they found a miserable little corrugatediron place called the kennel chapel and worked it up raising the people and doing no end of good till it came to be a district as st kenelms  very ornamental  oh very said jane warming out of caution as she felt she might venture showing city gorgeousness all over  but it is infinitely to his credit  he had a fortunatus purse and was a spoilt childnot in the bad sensebut with an utterly idolising mother and he tried a good many experiments that made our hair stand on end but he has sobered down and is a much wiser man nowthough i would not be bound to admire all he does  i see there are sisters  do they belong to his arrangements  yes  they are what my brother calls cousins of mercy  the elder one has tried two or three sisterhoods and being dissatisfied with all the rules i fancy she has some notion of trying to set up one on her own account at mr flights  they are both relations of his mother and are really one of his experimentsfancy names and fancy rules of course  i believe the young one wanted to call herself sister philomena but that he could not stand  so they act as parish women here and they do it very well  i liked sister beata when i have come in contact with her and i am sure she is an excellent nurse  they will do your nieces no harm though i dont like the irregular  of this assurance magdalen felt very glad when at the door of the parish room where the ladies were to hold a working party for the missions carrigaboola missions at albertstown she and her nieces were introduced to the two ladies in hoods and veils and paulas eyes sparkled with delight as she settled into a chair next to sister mena  she looked as happy as vera looked bored  conversation was not possible while a missionary memoir was being read aloud but the history of mother constance once lady herbert somerville but then head at dearport and founder of the daughter sisterhood at carrigaboola  to the merrifields it was intensely interesting and also to magdalen but all the time she could see demonstrations passing between paula and sister mena a nicelooking girl much embellished by the setting of the hood and veil as if the lending of a pair of scissors or the turning of a hem were an act of tender admiration  so sweet a look came out on paulas face that she longed to awaken the like  vera meantime looked as if her only consolation lay in the neighbourhood of a window whence she could see up the street as soon as she had found whispers to mysie merrifield treated as impossible  the party at the goyle had begun to fall into regular habits and struggles were infrequent  there was study in the forenoon walks or cycle expeditions in the afternoon varied by the lessons in music and in art which vera and paula attended on wednesdays and fridays the one in the morning the other after dinner  it was possible to go to st andrews matins at ten oclock before the drawing class and to st kenelms at five after the music was over  magdalen whenever it was possible went with her sisters on their bicycles to st andrews and sometimes devised errands that she might join them at st kenelms but neither could always be done by the head of the household  and she could perceive that her company was not specially welcome  valetta the only one of the clipstone family whose drawing was worth cultivating used to ride into rockstone escorted by her brother wilfred who was in course of cramming with a curate on his way to his tutor and vera found in casual but wellcultivated meetings and partings abundant excitement in nods and becks and wreathed smiles and now and then in the gift of a flower  paula on the other hand found equal interest and delight in meetings with sister mena especially after a thunderstorm had driven the two to take refuge at what the sisters called the cell of st kenelm and tea had unfolded their young simple hearts to one another magdalen had called on the sisters and asked them to tea at the goyle and there had come to the conclusion that sister beata was an admirable religious hardworking woman of strong opinions and not much cultivated with a certain provincial twang in her voice  she had a vehement desire for selfdevotion and consecration but perhaps not the same for obedience  she sharply criticised all the regulations of the sisterhoods with which she was acquainted wore a dress of her own device and with sister mena a young cousin of her own meant to make st kenelms a nucleus for a sisterhood of her own invention  sister mena had been bred up in a sisterhoods school from five years old and upwards and had no near relatives  mr flight was saint pope and hero to both and mena knew little beyond the horizon of st kenelms but she and paula were fascinated with one another and magdalen saw more danger in interfering than in acquiescing though she gave no consent to paulinas aspirations after admission into the perfect sisterhood that was to be    chapter viiisnobbishness    why then should vain repinings rise that to thy lover fate denies a nobler name a wide domainscott   the friendship with the sisters was about three weeks old when one morning scaffold poles were being erected in the new side aisle of st kenelms church and superintending them was a tall darkhaired young man  there was a start of mutual recognition and by and by he met paula and vera in the porch and there were eager handclasps and greetings as befitted old friends meeting in a strange place  mr hubert  i heard you were coming  miss vera  miss paula  this is a pleasure  then followed an introduction of sister mena whose elder companion was away attending a sick person  may i ask whether you are living here  two miles off at the goyle at arnscombe with our sister  so i heard  i shall see you again  and he turned aside to give an order bowing as he did so  is he the artist of those sweet designs asked sister mena  did we not tell you  and now he is going to execute them  how delicious  i trust so  we must see him again  we have not heard of edie and nellie nor any one  he will call on you said sister mena  i do not think so said paula  at least his father is really an artist but he is drawingmaster at the high school and hubert works for this firm  they are not what you call in society and our sister is all for getting in with lady merrifield and general mohun and all the swells so it would never do for him to call  she would first be stiff and stuck up said vera and i could not stand that  i thought she was so kind said mena  you dont understand said vera  she would be kind to a workman in a fever but this sortoh no  to be on an equality with the man painting the church said paula no indeed not if he were fra angelico and ary scheffer and michelangelo rolled into one  at that moment the subject referred to in that mighty conglomeration reappeared  he was a handsome young man his touch of italian blood showing just enough to give him a romantic air and sister philomena listened much impressed by the interchange of question and answer about edie and nellie and the dear warings and the happy christmas at the grange and vera blushed again and paula coloured in sympathy as it appeared that mr delrio had never had such a splendid time  the colloquy was ended by mr flight being descried approaching with his mother whereupon the two girls fled away like guilty creatures  presently vera exclaimed oh polly dear what a complication  poor dear fellow he cares for me as much as ever  and you will be staunch to him in spite of all the worldly allurements said paula  well i mean mr wilfred merrifield is not half so handsome returned vera  nor is he engaged in sacred work only bent on frivolity said paula yet see how the ma encourages him with tennis and games and nonsense  poor ma when the encouragement had only been some general merriment and a few games on the lawn paulina who had heard many confidences when vera returned from waring grange believed altogether in the true love of the damsel and hubert delrio who had been wont to single out the prettiest of the girls at filstead and she was resolved to do all she could in their cause being schoolgirl enough to have no scruple as to secrecy towards magdalen though on the next opportunity she poured out all to sister philomenas by no means unwilling ears  lovers had never fallen within the young sisters experience either personally or through friends and they had only been revealed to her in a few very carefullyselected tales where they were more the necessary machinery than the main interest for she had been bred up in an orphanage by sister beata and had never seen beyond it  so to her paulas story little as there was of it was a perfect romance and it gained in colour when she related it to her senior  sister beata hesitated a little having rather more knowledge of the world remembering that vera prescott was not eighteen years old and doubting whether an underhand intimacy ought to be encouraged but then mr flight had spoken of mr delrio as a highly praiseworthy young man of decided catholic principles he was regular at church services and had dined or supped at the vicarage  the intercourse as the girls had explained had been sanctioned by mrs best in their native town where all parties were well known and thus there could be no harm in letting it continue  while as to the elder miss prescott she was understood to be unduly bent on county and titled society and to be exclusive towards inferiors  moreover she was an attendant at st andrews church and thus regarded as out of the pale of sympathy of the st kenelms flock  so no obstacle was put in the way of the gossips for they were really nothing more except that there was admiration of the designs for the side chapel which were of the scripture children on one side and on the other of child martyrs  now and then there was a reference to the chilliness and hardship of living with an unsympathising sister and being obliged to go to churches of which they did not approve  sometimes too there were airy castles of a distant future to be shared by the magnificent architect together with vera while paula nursed in the convent with mother beata and sister philomena  but all this did not prevent an excitement and eager laughter and chatter whenever wilfred merrifield came in the way and he certainly was enough attracted by veras pretty face and lively graces to make his sisters think him very absurd but his mother had seen so many passing fancies among her elder sons as to hold that blindness was better than serious treatment  there was the further effect that magdalen had no suspicion that the vehement attraction to st kenelms went beyond the harmless quarter of the two nursing sisters and some hero worship of mr flight  miss mohun who knew everything had indeed hinted that something foolish might be going on there but magdalen had not decided on the mutual fairness of the two congregations and deferred investigation till agatha should come home when she would have a reasonable if cold person to deal with  nor did theklas chatter excite any suspicion for the only time when she had been present at a meeting with mr delrio she had been half bribed half threatened into silence and she was quite schoolgirl enough to feel that such was the natural treatment of authority though she had become really fond of sister    chapter ixgone over to the enemy    can i teach thee my beloved can i teach thee e b browning   agatha came home in due time and magdalen sent her sister to meet her at the station where they found a merry clipstone party in the waggonette waiting for gillian who was to come home at the same time  there was so much discussion of the new golf ground that vera had hardly a hand or a glance to bestow on mr delrio who jumped out of the same train shook hands with agatha and bestirred himself in finding her luggage and calling a cab  how he is improved  what a pleasing gentlemanly fellow he looks she exclaimed as she waved her thanks while driving off in the cab  is he not said paula while vera bridled and blushed  you will be delighted with his work  i never saw anything more lovely than little st cyriac the martyr  he is taken from mrs hendersons little boy added vera such a dear little darling  and his mother is to be done indeed he has sketched her for st juliet  flapsy  st romeo too i suppose  nonsense nag  there really was a st juliet or julitta and she was his mother and they both were martyrs  i will tell you all the history began paula but agatha interposed  you must like having him down here  sister must be much pleased with him  she used to like old mr delrio  well we have not said much about him owned paula  he does not seem to wish it or expect to be in with swells  we could not stand his being treated like a common housepainter and upholsterer added vera  surely no one does so said agatha  not exactly said paula at least he has had supper at st kenelms vicarage with lady flight and luncheon at carrara with captain and mrs henderson  because he was doing the child interposed vera and thekla says that primrose merrifield says that her aunt janethat is old miss mohunsays that lady flight is not a gentlewoman  what has that to do with magdalen  why she is so taken up with those swells of hers especially now that there is a talk of lord somebodys yacht coming in that she would never treat him as on equal terms but just keep him at a distance like a mere decorator  that seemed to me just what you were doing said agatha when he was so kind and helpful about my box  oh they were all there and we did not want to be talked of said vera blushing  he understands  he understands repeated paula  we do see him at the church and at the sisters  those dear sisters  there is no nonsense about them  you will love them nag  well it does not seem to me to be treating our own sister magdalen fairly  the ma said vera in a tone of wonder  no not to be intimate with a person you do not introduce to her because you do not think she would consider him as on equal terms  sister beata quite approves added paula sincerely not guessing how little sister beata knew of the situation of which she only heard through the medium of her own representations to sister mena  the two girls rushed into the charms of these two sisters and the plan for an entertainment for the maidens of the guild of st milburgha at which they were to assist  it lasted up to the gate of the goyle where magdalen and thekla were ready to meet them and they trooped merrily up the hill agatha keeping to magdalens side in a way that struck her as friendly and affectionate  it seemed to be more truly coming home than the elder sister had dared to anticipate nor indeed did she feel the veiled antagonism to herself that had previously disappointed her  the talk was about st roberts about oxford in general the new friends the principal the games the debates the lectures the sermons the celebrities the undergraduates the concerts the chapels the boats the architecture all were touched on for further discussion by and by as they sat at the evening meal and then on the chairs and cushions in the verandah and through all there was no exclusion of the elder sister but rather she was the one who could appreciate the interest of what agatha had seen and heard and even she was allowed to enter into the amusement of an oxford bon mot sometimes indeed when it was far beyond paula and vera  there was no doubt that the term had much improved agatha even in appearance and manner  she held herself better pronounced better uttered no slangish expressions and twice she repressed little discourtesies on the part of her sisters and neglects such as were not the offspring of tender familiarity but of an indifference akin to rudeness  magdalen had endured knowing how bad it was for their manners but unwilling to become more of an annoyance than could be helped  the indescribable difference in agathas whole manner sent magdalen to bed happier than she had been since the arrival of her sisters and feeling as if agatha had come to her own side of a barrier  perhaps it was quite true for the last two months had been a time of growth with the maiden changing her from a schoolgirl to a student from the brook to the river  she had indeed studied hard but that she had always done as being clever intellectual and ambitious  the difference had been from her intercourse with persons slightly her elders but who did not look on authorities as natural enemies to be tolerated for ones own good  there had been a development of the conscience and soul even in this first term that made her regard her elder sister not merely with a sense of compulsory gratitude and duty but with sympathy and fellow feeling which were the more excited when she saw her own chilliness of last spring carried further by the two young girls  so breakfast went off merrily and after the round of the garden and the pets agatha promised to come when summoned to hear how well thekla could read french  in the meantime she waited in the morning room looking at her sisters books vera pushed aside the venetian blind  dont come in that way flapsy called paula  youll be heard in the diningroom and the ma will tremble at your dusty feet  they arent dusty said vera pulling up the blind with a clatter  arent they laughed paula pointing  you had better go and wipe them said agatha  i dont believe in mas fidgets returned vera  but i do in proper deference to the head of the house said agatha gravely  murder in irish cried vera bouncing away while paula argued really nag life is not long enough to attend to all the mas little worries  polly dear i am afraid we have been on a wrong tack with our sister  i dont like calling her by that name  you began it exclaimed vera dashing in by the door as she spoke  i could not have meant it as a nickname to be always in use  oh yes you did i rememberand an argument was beginning which agatha cut short by saying any way it is bad taste  nag has been so much among the real ma that she is tender about their title  she wants to be one herself said vera and so she will if she goes on getting learned and faddy  in both senses said paula  agatha laughed a little but added no polly the thing is that it is hardly kind or right to put that sort of label upon a person like magdalenwho has done so much for usand  the perverse young hearts could not bear a touch on the chord of gratitude and paula burst in label or libel do you mean  it becomes a libel as you use it  do you want us to call her sister or magdalen the whole scriptural mouthful at once  i believe that to call her magdalen or maidie as my father did would make her feel nearer to us than the formal way of saying sister  i dont mind about changing said paula  she can never be the same to us as dear sister mena  she is so tiresome added vera  she bothers so over my music calling out if i make ever so small a slip and making me go over all again  well she may said paula  she is making little tick play so nicely  just listen  but i cant bear her dragging us off to that horrid old arnscombe church and the nasty stuffy sunday school  that reminds me said agatha gillian merrifield met a relation of mr earls who said that miss prescott had brought quite new life and spirit to the poor old man who had been getting quite out of heart for want of any one to help and sympathise with him  then he ought to make his services more catholic said paula  but nothing will wean her from the old parochial idea  why she would not let me give my winter stockings to sister beatas poor girls but made me darn them and put them by  yes and mine which were bad enough to give away she made me darn first cried vera  she is ever so much worse than the superlative about mending ones clothes  there ought to be another degree of comparison said paula botheratissima  for only think said vera  she wont let us have new hats but only did up the old ones and not with feathers though there is such a love at tebbittss at rockstone  she says it is cruel said paula  cruel to me i am sure and what difference does it make when the birds are once killed  well she did give us those lovely wreaths of lilies said paula  of course but nothing to make them stylish  whats the good of being out if one is to have nothing chic  and she wont let me have a hockey outfit  she says she must see more of it to be able to judge whether to let us play  that just means seeing whether her dear merrifields do said paula  gillian did at st catherines  but you will know soon  did i not hear something about a garden party  oh yes she is talking of one but it will be all swells and croquet and deadly dull  i thought you seemed to be getting on well with the swells if you mean the merrifields especially wilfred if that is his name  bilbil  oh he is all very well said vera if he would not be always so silly and come after me  as if i cared  and only think said paula that she was going to have it on the very day that st milburgas guild has their festival  just as if it was on purpose  did you ask her to keep clear of your engagements  i told her but i dont think she listened  and as another grievance suggested itself to vera she declared and she wont let us join the girls magazine club because she saw one she didnt like on somebodys table  as if we were little babies  she wont let us order books at the library but gets such awfully slow ones chimed in paula or only baby stories fit for thekla she made me return that book dear sister mena lent me because she said it was roman catholic  and hasnt she got thomas a kempis on her table and im sure he was roman catholic  theres consistency  you dont understand began agatha  he was a great saint before the catholics became so roman  oh never mind  it is anything to thwart us cried vera  it is ever so much worse than school  but began agatha and the tone of consideration to that one conjunction caused an outburst  oh nag nag if you are gone over to the enemy what will life be worth  as that terrible question was propounded in burst thekla with oh nag nag they are cutting the hay in the high torr field and sister says we may go and see them before i read my french  oh cried vera with a prolongation into a groan is she going to be tiresome  she has come to be quite a don said paula but never mind we will soon make her all right again  the two sisters had to go to their different classes in the afternoon and wanted agatha to go with them but it was a very warm day and she preferred resting in the garden and to magdalens surprise and pleasure conversation with her  at first it was about oxford matters very interesting but public and external to the home and it did not draw the cords materially closer but when thekla had privately decided that even hanging upon the newly recovered nag was not worth the endurance of anything so tedious and had gone off to assist her beloved old gardener in gathering green gooseberries magdalen observed that she was a very pleasant little pupil and was getting on very well especially with arithmetic  that was the strong point in the junior classes said agatha better taught than it was in my time  i wish she could have more playfellows said magdalen  she would like to go to the high school at rockquay but there are foundations i should wish to lay before having her out of my own hands  i should think you were her best playfellow  she seems very fond of you and very happy  yes said magdalen rather wistfully  i think she generally is so  maidie may i call you by the old home name  and as magdalen answered with a kiss and tearful smile do tell me please if polly and flapsy are nice to you  magdalen was taken by surprise at the pressure of the hand and the eyes that gazed into her face full of expression  she could not keep the drops from rushing to her own eyes though she smiled through them and said as nice as they know how  i am afraid i know what that means said agatha  if i only knew how to prevent their looking on me as their governess continued magdalen but i must have got into the groove and i suppose i do not always remember how much must be tolerated if love has to be won and paula is a thoroughly good girl  yes i am sure she wishes to be said agatha  are those sisters nice that she talks of so eagerly  they are very excellent women but somehow i should have had more confidence in them if they were not unattached or belonged to some regular sisterhood  i wish she had taken instead to mysie merrifield who is more of my sort but no one can control those likings  i dont think gillian very attractive she is so wrapped up in her work confessed agatha  you will see them all i hope for i am giving a garden party next week perhaps  have not they told you  oh yes but polly seemed bent on its not clashing with some festival at st kenelms  therefore i had not fixed the day till i had heard what is settled i have invited people for thursday which will hardly interfere  did you know that the young man who is painting the ceiling at st kenelms church is old mr delrios son hubert  indeed  is he staying here  we must ask him to come up to luncheon or to tea  i am glad he is doing so well  i heard eccles and beamster were to do the decorations i suppose they employ him  i should think it was a very good line to get into  this was on a friday and the next day magdalen proposed driving down in the cool of the evening to see the decorations at st kenelms and their artist but it turned out that he was gone to spend sunday at the cathedral city and all that could be done was to admire the designs and listen to paulas enthusiastic explanation  magdalen consulted agatha whether to send young delrio a card for the garden party but they decided that it was too late for an invitation to be sent though a spoken one might have been possible  besides it was not likely to be pleasant to a stranger who knew no one but the flights and hendersons and those professionally  agatha told her sisters and with one voice they declared that they would not see him patronised while agathas acute senses doubted whether veras objection was not secretly based on the embarrassment of a double flirtation with him and with wilfred merrifield  indeed vera told her gaily  only think nag i did have a jolly ride on the mas bike after all  indeed  then she lent it to you  not she  but she and the little kid were safe gone to avoncester and paula was with her dear sisters so will and i took a jolly spin along the cliff road and it was such screaming fun  only once we thought we saw old sir jasper coming and we got behind a barn but it turned out to be only a tripper and we had such a laugh  paula does not know  what would be the good of telling her with her little nuns schoolgirl mind  she would only make no end of a fuss about a mere bit of fun and nonsense  i think if wilfred merrifield was afraid to meet his father it showed a sense of wrong  sir jasper is a horrid old martineau who never gives them any peace at home but is always after them  a martinet i suppose you mean  i dont think that makes it any better  i should not be happy till magdalen knew  why no harm was done  theres her precious machine all safe  it was just for the fun of the thing and to try how it goes  one cant be kept in like a blessed baby  she never has guessed it  thats the fun of it  i would not return her kindness in such an unladylike way when she is trusting you vera  did magdalen know what had been done  she did guess for there was a mark on the wheel that she did not remember to have known before and it cost her a bitter pang of mistrust but she abstained from inquiries thinking that they might only do harm  but she bought a chain for her bicycle and agatha felt more shame than did vera who tried to believe herself amused by her tacit sense of emancipation    chapter xflown    till now thy soul hath been all glad and gay bid it arise and look on grief today adelaide proctor   there was a guild at st kenelms which was considered by the promoters to be superior to the girls friendly society and which comprised about a dozen young women who attended classes held by sister beata and occasional modest entertainments given by lady flight  one of these was to take place the day before miss prescotts garden party  it was to be given at carrara the very pretty grounds on the top of the cliff belonging to captain henderson the managing partner in the extensive marble works of mr white who lived at rocca marina in the riviera  mrs henderson had resided in mr flights parish and been a member of his congregation and while he was absent for a day or two she had put her garden at the service of the guild of st milburgas for the day  of course vera and paula were delighted to assist but thekla was too young for the amusements of grownup maidens and was much better pleased to help her two elder sisters in preparations for the next day placing tennis nets arranging croquet hoops mustering chairs by the verandah and adorning tables with flowers  agathas assistance was heartily given as making it her own concern and for that reason above all others it was a happy day though a very tiring one to magdalen in spite of the sultry atmosphere and the sight of luridlooking clouds over the moors which did not augur well for the next days weather and caused all the arrangement of chairs and rugs to be prudently broken up and deposited under the verandah  this was done and the evening meal had been taken and thekla had gone to bed before some flashes of lightning made the two sisters wish to see the other pair at home especially as vera was much afraid of lightning and paula apt to be made quite ill by it  the storm rolled on bringing violent gusts of wind and hail though not at the very nearest and such a hurricane of wind and rain ensued that the two watchers concluded that the two girls must have been housed for the night by some of the friends at rock quay and it was near midnight when just as they had gone to their rooms a carriage was heard ascending the hill and they had reached the door before paulina sprang out with the cry is she come home  then at sight of the blank faces of dismay she seized hold of agathas hands and began to sob  mr flight had stepped out of the car at the same moment and answered the incoherent questions and exclamations  young delrio offered to take photographs of the party and that was the last time she was seen  yes sobbed paula sister mena saw her there  we were trying to get up croquet and then i missed her  i tried to find her when the lightning began but i could not find her anywhere though i looked in all the summerhouses  at mrs hendersons or miss mohuns or the sisters asked magdalen catching alarm from each denial  she might have gone home with one of the girls  she would be wild in such a storm said agatha and not know what she was about  sister beata and i have gone to each house said mr flight  when did you say you saw her last  i saw her when we were grouped said paula sister mena when she was helping him to put up his photos  the strange thing is said mr flight though no doubt it will be explained that delrio is missing too  hubert delrio exclaimed agatha  impossible  he must have taken her into the church to be out of the storm  we have tried said the clergyman  and as the round of suggestions began to be despairingly reiterated he said hesitating miss mohun told me that she thought she had seen a boat captain hendersons she believed in the cave with some one rocking in it and certainly that little boat was there when on the hope if it can be called a hope i ran down the steps to look  would it not have been put into the boathouse out of the rain said agatha  the gardener was gone home out of reach round the point but we shall know tomorrow  he thinks they may have rowed out and been caught in the storm cried paula bursting into fresh weeping and magdalen saw the conjecture confirmed by mr flights countenance  i am afraid it is the least distressingthe least unsatisfactory idea said he in much agitation  i thought mr delrio an excellent young man and she indicating his companion tells me you know him and his family well  oh yes said agatha and magdalen in one breath  we have known his father all our lives  nothing can be more respectable  and hubert is as steady and good as possible continued agatha his mother used to come to mrs best and praise him till we were quite tired of his name i am sure he is all right  or i should be much deceived in him said the clergyman  yet there was an idea in paulinas mind  could vera have poured out such an exaggerated tale of oppression and unhappiness as to have induced her old playfellow to carry her off to his mother at filsted she had given some such hint to mr flight on the way but he had not seemed to hear or attend and he was now promising to let the sisters know as soon as possible in the morning whether anything had been discovered and to telegraph to filsted and to the office in london if he should see occasion  then he drove off in what would have been almost daylight but for the pelting of the storm and after a vain attempt to make paula swallow some nourishment magdalen thought it kinder to let agatha carry her off to bed and then she confessed what really gave a certain hope that the pair had been in the habit of murmuring against sister so much that considering poor veras propensity to strong language it was quite possible that hubert might think her cruelly oppressed and for a freak carry her off to his mother to be consoled  agatha tried to believe it for the sake of hushing the exhausted paula who almost went into hysterics as she laughed at the notion of tomorrows telegram that vera was safe at filsted and then allowed herself to be calmed enough to sleep while agatha revolved the notion but found herself unable seriously to believe that sufficient grievance could be brought against sister to induce any man in his senses to take such a step  but then paula had inferred that he was a lover and agatha did not know of what lovers might be capable and she could not but blame herself for not having given more importance to the semiconfidences of her sisters on the first day of her arrival  it was all misery and the two poor girls could find no solace in the morning save in talking to magdalen though that involved the confession of all the murmurs against her the distrust of her kindness and the explanation of the interviews which as far as paula had ever witnessed them were absolutely harmless the only pity being in their concealment  magdalen was manifestly as wretched as they or even more so being convinced of her own shortcoming in not having won the affection or confidence that would have made all open between them  she could not understand why hubert delrio should not have been made known to her  we thought said paula we thought you might not think him enough enoughof a gentleman for your sort of society  i think you might have trusted me to know what was due to an old friend said magdalen but oh i ought to have made you feel that we could think together  perhaps said agatha there was a little consciousness on poor dear veras part that she did not want you to know the terms she was on  they had tried only to let thekla know that they were much alarmed because vera had gone out in a boat and not returned  it was observable that on the principle that where there is life there is hope paula clung to the notion that veras having fled to filsted while the two elder sisters perhaps because they better knew what such a flight might seem to others would almost have preferred to suppose there had been a fatal accident in the midst of youthful innocent sport  the two were lingering sadly over their uneaten breakfast talking more freely when they had sent thekla to feed her pets when mr flight came up on his bicycle but it was plain at the first moment that he had no good news  nothing had been heard  it only appeared that one of the young gardeners at carrara had taken captain hendersons boat without leave to fetch one of the girls but on entering the cove had found the boathouse locked  he had moored the boat to a stake for want of the ring that secured it within  when the storm threatened he ran down to recover it but it was gone and he had concluded that the gardeners had put it into the boathouse  it now appeared that they had not seen it and were very angry at its having been meddled with an oar had drifted up with the morning tide and had been recognised as belonging to the boat but such a gale was blowing that it was impossible to put out to sea or make any search round the coast words could hardly describe the distress of mr flight or of his ladies at not having better looked after the young girl sister beata for never having thoroughly attended to the matter and sister mena for having accepted confidences which if she had only guessed it told her more than there really was to be known  both these two were inclined to the elopement idea partly because it was the least shocking and partly because they had looked at veras grievances through her own spectacles and partly from their unlimited notions of young mens wickedness  their vicar was not of the same opinion knowing hubert better and besides having found his work his orders to his subordinates and the belongings at the lodgings in a state that showed that whatever he had done had been unpremeditated sending off notes to stop the garden party was a sort of occupation broken by many signs much listening and much sorrowful discussion not quite vain since it made paulina more one with magdalen than ever before  poor old mr delrio arrived in the afternoon a thin greyhaired and bearded old man who could only make it too certain that paulas theory of the innocent flight to filsted was impossible moreover he was as certain as a father could be intimate with and therefore confident of his eldest son that though hubert might indulge in a little lively flirtation it could never be otherwise than perfectly harmless  in the terrible suspense and restlessness he went vibrating about in the torrents of moorland rain between rock quay and the goyle on the watch for telegrams from the office in london or his wife at home or for the discovery of anything from the sea or searching in his sons lodgings where nothing was found that did not show him to have been a purehearted young man devoted to his art and fond of poetry  sundry compositions were in the blottingbook one indeed to veras name under the supposition a wrong one 100 that it meant true but mostly rough copies of a poem about the saints julitta and her child cyriac  hope sank as another stormy day rose and still the poor old artist lingered in hopes of news by some returning craft which might have picked up the derelict  his chief comfort was in walking about between the showers with magdalen as an old friend and trying to think of the two as innocent creatures engulfed like mayflies in the stream  sister mena came over wanting to join paula in bewailing entreaties but paula in youthful hardhearted wilfulness declared that it was impossible to see her and it fell to magdalen to try to discuss the grief with her  it turned out that mr flight had spoken severely to her and to the far less implicated sister beata declaring his confidence in them destroyed so that they had begun to consider of throwing up their work in his parish  and it was all my fault said mena sister beata really knew nothing or hardly anything of what vera told me  indeed i can quite understand that you had hardly experience enough to know that it might be wiser not to encourage what was not quite open  but i thoughti thought you  that i was unkind and unsympathising  oh you never could have been  indeed i never meant to be but i am afraid it seemed so to my young sisters  i can quite see how you thought you were acting kindly  oh that is so good of you  and perhaps i being only an elder sister you would not feel that i was the only authority the poor girls have to look to and that it would have been kinder to help them to be content with me  i did not know what you could be said mena greatly soothed and surprised by her caresses  we often do go on in ignorance and get on a wrong tack but you know god pardons our mistakes and i do believe that you will be wiser for all this sorrow and better able to rise to your work  i am sure however it ends that is the reason that such blows are sent to us  mena went back sorrowful and chastened but tenderly hopeful  if miss prescott could forgive surely mr flight could and one still greater    chapter xiadrift    she splashed and she dashed and she turned herself round and heartily wished herself safe on the ground jane taylor   and where were the missing pair  vera had lingered about fancying she was helping to pack the photographic apparatus while the others dispersed  presently seeing no one near hubert delrio said in a gentle diffident voice it would be a great pleasure to me if i might ask you to listen to the verses on st cyriac and his mother that the design brought with it  i should love it better than anything said vera highly flattered  if you would come down this way there is a charming secluded cove where we should be free from interruption  how deliciously romantic  quite stunning cried vera as her cavalier conducted her down a steep path along the side of the cliff to the stony beach where a few red rocks had been manipulated into a tiny harbour with a boathouse for the little skiff in which captain henderson was wont to go round to the marble works on the other side of the headland  the boat looked very inviting as it lay swinging gently in the sluggish waves in the advancing shade of the tall cliff and vera exclaimed with delight as she was assisted into it and placed herself comfortably on the cushion with one hand dabbling in the cool translucent wave  hubert delrio opened his manuscript and began to read his ballad if so it was to be called being the history of the little boy of four years old who being taken with his mother before the tribunal at tarsus was lifted on the propraetors knee but struggled crying out i am a christian till the propraetor in a rage hurled him down  his skull was fractured on the marble pavement and his mother gave thanks for his souls safety when she too was sentenced to be beheaded  great pains had been taken with the nobleminded tale and the verses had considerable merit more perhaps than vera could appreciate  but to read such a production of his own in such surroundings to the auditor whom youthful fancy most preferred was such luxury to both that it was no wonder that under the broad shady hat with the lily wreath she was nodding in the gentle breeze the lapping of the waves and the soft cadence of the poetry till at an effective passage on the mothers death the poet looked up expecting to receive a responsive glance from those blue eyes  not only were they hidden but the cliff was farther off  the mooring rope and the stake were dragging behind in the water  the tide had turned and the boat was already out of reach of the rock where it had been drawn up  his exclamation of dismay awoke vera who would have started up with a little shriek but for his dont dont  ill row back  but he was a landsman whose only knowledge of the water was in an occasional bathe or in a river steamer and his first attempt at placing the oars in the rowlocks resulted in one falling overboard while he helplessly grasped the other and vera screamed again  dont be frightened my dear  dearest dont  we must be seen some one will come out and help us  cant you get on with one oar  they do in pictures  punting  yes but there must be a bottom  no dont move whatever you do  there cant be any danger  fishermen must be about  or we shall be seen from the cliffs  they are getting farther off  cant you shout  hubert shouted and vera added her shriller cries but all in vain and the outgoing tide was carrying them not towards the quay and marble rocks but farther to sea  the waves grew rougher and had crests of foam and discomfort began  once the feather of a steamer was seen on the horizon  they waved handkerchiefs and redoubled their shouts and hubert had to hold his companion to prevent her from leaping up but they never were within the vessels ken and she went on her way while the sea bore them farther and farther  the shore was growing dim and indistinct the sun was sinking and the cloud that had at first shown only a golden border was lifting tall perpendicular masses while the tossing of the little boat became more and more distressing  anxiety and sense of responsibility kept hubert from feeling physical discomfort but vera began to cry and to declare that it would be the death of her if she were not landed immediately  if it were only possible sighed delrio  there must be some way  you are so stupid  oh  there was a flash of lightning  summer lightning  no such thing  there will be a storm and we shall be drowned  oh i wish i had never listened to your nonsense and got into this horrible boat  she was in a state for scolding and scold she did as the clouds rose higher and sheets of lightning more decided how could you  you who know nothing about boats and going on on with those horrid tiresome versesnot minding anythingi wish i had never come near you  vainly the poor young fellow tried to get in a word of consolation it only made her scold the more till there was no question that the storm was raging overhead the hail rattled and splashed the waves raised them to a height then subsided into endless depths the thunder pealed and she clung to hubert too frightened for screaming  his fear was that the cockleshell of a boat should fill and founder he tried to bale out the water with his hat and to make her assist but she seemed incapable and he could only devise laying her down in the bottom of the boat with his coat over her hiding her face in terror  her hat had long ago been blown away and her hair was flapping about  ejaculations were in his heart if not on his lips and once or twice she cried out something like save me but in general it was we are sinking  hold me  we are going  paula nag clutching at his legs so as to hamper him in the baling out the water  the hail passed but there was a solid sheet of rain descending on them undistinguishable from the foam that rushed over them as they went down down down  vera was silenced and hubert drenched and nearly beaten out of life almost welcomed every downward plunge as the last tried to commend his spirit and was amazed to find his little boat lifted up again and the black darkness not so absolute    chapter xiithe kittiwake    good luck to your fishing  whom watch ye tonight a man of mean or a man of mightscott   something black was before the tossed boat  yes and light not lightning  a human voice seemed to be on the blast  hubert delrio essayed to shout but his voice was gone or was blown away  he understood that a vessel must be above him  would it finish all by running him down  he perceived that he was bidden to catch something  a rope  his benumbed hands and the heaving of the boat made him fail once twice and he was being swept away as at last he did grasp a rope and was drawn as it ground his hands close to the dark wall that rose above with lights visible  cheer up cheer up he cried to vera  thank god we are saved  response from her there was none but he could hear the yell of inquiry from ahead and answered here  two  a woman  a second rope was lowered  lash her to it  but as it was evident that delrio could do nothing but hold on and that his companion was helpless a sailor descended from no great elevation and in another moment the senseless girl was hoisted up and received on deck and with some assistance hubert was also on board thinking of nothing but the breathless question is she safe  oh yes  she will soon come round  here  they will see to her as she was carried away and hubert had a perception that she was received by female hands but he was utterly exhausted and unable to see or speak till some stimulant had been poured down his throat and even then he could hardly ask is she safe  yes yes  all right  reviving fast  here  take some more  bed is ready  get rid of those clothes  it was an elderly greyhaired man who spoke and hubert was in no condition to resist as the yacht was pitching considerably though after the boat the motion was almost rest  he instinctively shook his head at the glass but swallowed what was forced upon him and managed to say thanks sitting in boatdrifted offrock quay  all right  never mind  take him down  my berth ivyjephson tuck him in  dont let him speak  never mind my lad  we will hear all about it tomorrow  meantime vera though reviving was conscious of very little save a soft pillow tender hands and warm drink that choked her and then she fell asleep though still she was aware of a strange tossing going on all night and by and by she found herself secured into a sort of narrow shelf and murmuring female voices were at hand  as she moved she heard there you are better now  you can take this then you will be more comfortable  her eyes had opened to a curious sort of twilight and there was a fair girlish head over her with a sweet smiling face  an elderly weatherbeaten face in a hood next appeared and a brown hand holding a cup closed over the top in invalid fashion and a kind strong arm slightly raised her with there there poor dear  the spirit my lady dear the spirit  thats right now then  you must be a baby and a merry reassuring smile broke out as the draught was administered  vera tasted thanked swallowed felt giddy and lay down hearing a lively bit of selfgratulation there mrs griggs im getting my sea legs followed by an ignominious stumble as mrs griggs caught the cup in good time as the vessel gave a lurch which completed veras awakening in the fear of being shaken out on the floor  she looked round to find herself in a tiny room cushioned throughout with strange dancing confused light coming in and the few articles of furniture carefully secured  two young figures were there both dressed in stout blue serge with white trimmings one the darker beside her bed had a face full of kindness and solicitude yet of fun dimpling over continually the other even in that dim light striking vera as something out of the loveliest visions of romance so fair and beautiful was the countenance  a mans voice was at the door  fly  francie  how is she  much better  nearly well  good morning papa dear  is he all right  as sound as a bell  ha  as the door escaped the curtain over it shook and he nearly fell against it saving himself with his hands that was exercise  as the young girls came tumbling up and disappeared behind the curtain where however the voices could be plainly heard had any sleep tonight or this morning  between whiles  o yes  all our bones are still whole as i hope yours and ivys are  come and see  griggs is getting breakfast under difficulties insurmountable to any one but a seagrasshopper  i came to call you damsels and present my inquiries to miss prescott  she will soon be all right  francie and i are so proud of having had a real downright adventure  i trust she will not be the worse and willexcuse me and regard me as incognito  this was said as another lurch drove the grizzled head into the cabin and recovering in another upheaval they all disappeared leaving vera in a dreaming state whence she was only half roused when mrs griggs returned to administer breakfast so far as she could taste it under exhortations pettings and scoldings and she very soon fell asleep again and was thus left sensible all the time of tossings and buffetings but so worn out by the five hours of the boat and so liable to be made ill by the motion of the vessel that it was thought best to leave her to sleep in her berth  she was only aware of voices above talking and laughing or sailor calls being shouted out or now and then of some one coming to look at her and insisting on her taking food  it was not till late in the afternoon that she awoke from what seemed like a strange long uneasy dream and found one of the girls sitting by her and telling her she was better now  yes said vera trying to raise herself finding something over her head and falling back on the pillow but what is it  where is this  this is somewhere out in the channel near off guernsey griggs says but we cannot put in anywhere till the gale goes down  what is it  is it a ship then  o yes said the girl laughing a yacht the kittiwake  sir robert audley has lent it to my brother and we are all going to see the hebrides and staffa and iona  not to take me all up there groaned poor vera in horror  cant you put me out somewhere anywhere  dont be afraid was the muchamused reply  as soon as ever we can put in anywhere we can telegraph to rock quay and put you ashore to go home but we can only run before the wind while the sea is so high  i wish you could come on deck it is so jolly  oh it was too dreadful  beating about in the boat  it must have been mr delrio told us  it was so stupid in him never to see that we had got loose and were drifting off said vera who had never thought of inquiring after him  my father and griggs think he behaved quite like a hero was the answer  he must have managed very well to keep you afloat and saved you all this time  i suppose so said vera  we always did know him or i should not have let him get me into that boat when he minded nothing but his verses  those verses they came all limp and wet out of his pocket and francie made him let her dry them and copy them out and she is so delighted with them  it really is well it is too late to call the baby cyriac  the baby  oh yes  we had to leave him behind though francie was ready to break her heart over it but they said that nothing would do for ivinghoeafter this second influenzabut a sea voyage so she had to make up her mind to leave him to my mother  vera was in a state of bewilderment caring a great deal more for herself and her own sensations than for any of her surroundings and her next question was when do you think we shall be out of this  we shall put into harbour somewhere as soon as the wind lulls  we cannot venture yet though we do steam and then we can telegraph  i am longing to relieve miss prescott  we can take you home all the way  we were on our way into rock quay to take up mysie merrifield if she can go  it really was a wonderful and most merciful thing that we made you out just as it was getting light before running you down  my father saw you first and old griggs would hardly believe it but then we heard mr delrios hail  but it was a terrible business getting you up the ships side  i did not know anything about it  it was so dreadful in the lightning  and my new hat was blown away  and what is become of all my clothes  mrs griggs has them and is drying them  we will lend you a hat to land in  oh when we do  i wish i had never got into that boat but hubert delrio did persuade me so  and he is an old friend  yes he is come to paint the roof of st kenelms church and we want to be attentive to him because my eldest sister would be sure to be cross and keep him at a distance being only that sort of wall painter you know and his father a drawing master  my father is very much pleased with him and thinks him a very superior young man  they have been sitting on deck together talking as much as they could about architecture and italy with their breath all blown away every moment  there  you are really getting better if you would eat something and come on deck you would be well  i will call the sea gnat and see what we have  it was all very wonderful to vera and she began to be interested and to forget her troubles  a slice of very salt ham was brought to her and a glass of something she did not know what and asked if she could have some tea  you could have tea if you like but theres no milk  you see we ought to have been in at rock quay yesterday evening and our stores were not adapted to hold out any longer  we shall have another curious experience though mrs griggs says it wont be so bad as once when they were off the coast of ireland and when they put into a bay with a queer name all kill and bally they could get nothing but potatoes and goats milk  who is mrs griggs  she is wife to the sailing master and like the norsemen her home is on the wave at least in the yacht for she always lives in it and her cabin is quite a sight she is great fun she cooks when there is anything to cook and is stewardess and everything  francie and i knew a maid would be a vain encumbrance so we are taking care of ourselves and if you will let me i will try and set your hair to rights  it was in a fearful tangle after five hours at sea and many more in the berth in the cabin but vera was able to sit up in a dainty dressinggown and submit to treatment not quite that of a hairdresser but made as lively as could be by little jokes and kindly apologies at any extra hard pull at the knots which really seemed as if a witch had twined them and the two began to feel well acquainted with each other over the operation though vera was somewhat impressed when she observed that the brush was ivory handled  her bicycling skirt was in tolerable condition but her once delicate blue blouse was past renovation so she was invested with a borrowed white one and led in triumph to the saloon just as the beautiful francie came to call phyllis and give a helping hand  there were two gentlemen besides hubert delrio and there was a general rejoicing welcome but vera did not think hubert made half enough inquiries or apologies before she was seated at the table where everything was secured and the fare was not very sumptuous or various being chiefly some concoction of rice and scraps of salt beef which francie said was a shame eating up the poor sailors fare also there was potted meat and cheese but all the fresh bread was gone and they praised mrs griggs construction of ham and rice with all the warmth and drollery each could contribute  vera began to be puzzled as to who every one was for no names except phyl fly francie and ivy were heard and the merry greyhaired head of the family was father or papa to every one except of course mr delrio who however seemed at his ease and took a fair share in the talk and once or twice vera thought he said my lord but she did not believe it  i find you are a friend of a special pet of mine mysie merrifield said the father  i know her a little stammered vera but primrose best  nearer your age eh  but mysie is our gem  it looks fit for going on deck  after the apology for a dinner the young married pair went their way he to endeavour to add a fish to their provisions she to look on the father and delrio went where the latter could best study the wonderful tints of sunset over the purple retreating clouds and the still agitated foaming seasights that seemed to be filling him with enchantment and revealing effects in colour while his delight was evidently a new pleasure to his companion  vera was afraid to move and sat on a deck chair with her back to the sunset while phyllis who perhaps would have liked to share in the admiration sat by her so that vera began to accept her as a special friend and to pour out the explanation of how she came to be tossing in an open boat with this one companion  you see poor fellow she said simpering he has been always so devoted to me  everybody observed it and i could not help just gratifying him a little  he does seem to be very full of promise said phyllis  i suppose miss prescott is much pleased with him  my sister magdalen do you mean  well we have not introduced him to her yet  you see he is only painting the church and she is so devoted to swells and makes such a fuss about our manners  indeed  but surely you could not go out with him without her knowing it  she was not at this st milburghas guild you know and sisters beata and mena knew all about it  oh yes she lets us go to them at st kenelms but they are not swells enough for her  mr flights sisterhood are not they  and primrose merrifield says that wilfred declares that they are not ladies but thats all jealousy you know because will doesnt like my friends and magdalen is altogether gone upon grandees  fancy was all that phyllis managed to say  she doesnt want us to be friends with anybody who dont belong to some one with a handle to her name  so foolish and stuck up  so we knew she would not be kind to hubert  i think you had better have tried  i thought her one of the kindest people in the world  ah but you know unfortunately she has been a governess and that teaches toadying  at that moment phyl was called to see the first star over the sea and ran up to her father so as to conceal how nearly she was laughing  hubert delrio came towards vera  can you forgive me vera he said  i shall speak to your sister as soon as i am at home and ask her forgiveness and  oh yes yes  but do tell me who these people are  did you not know  that most kind of men is lord rotherwood  those are lord and lady ivinghoe and  lady phyllis  oh    chapter xiiichimeras dire    quallaitil faire dans cette galere french comedy   veras first thorough awakening the next morning was to hear outside the door are you up fly  i shall be in a minute or two  do you want me  you are a dab at parlezvous  i want you to come ashore with me and cater for the starving crew  what fun  anon anon sir  vera then perceived that she had been bestowed in lady phyllis cabin and that the proper owner was dressing herself in haste before the little shelf of a toilette table  so great had been the confusion of last nights discovery that the poor silly child had only thought of hurrying out of sight and tumbling into bed without speaking to any one and she had not distinctly known when lady phyllis came down a good deal later and disposed of herself on the sofa that mrs griggs had made ready for her  and now the only thing she could think of was to say oh  lady phyllis i didnt know  take care  dont knock your head  we ought to have remembered that boreas or whichever it was was hardly a sufficient introduction are you all right now  you had better go to sleep again till i bring something to eat  we are lying to off some little breton fishing village and i am going with my brother to get some provisions and telegraph if we can  it was long before they came back  vera had another nap dressed herself grew very hungry and came out to find lord rotherwood fishing and his daughterinlaw watching for the boat to put out from the white houses with grey roofs which clustered round their churchtower seemed descending to the waters edge  they were equally famished though mrs griggs stewed up the poor remnants of last nights banquet but at last the little boat appeared gaily dancing over the waves and phyllis making signals of success  oh yes you may be thankful you poor starving beings  here mrs griggs  accept and do all you can  here are eggs and some milk and fresh water four poulets such as they are and a huge monster of a crab but all the bread is leavened and you little guess what ivy and i had to go through before we were allowed to buy anything we were had up to the mayor and had to constater all manner of things about our ship to prove that we were no smugglers  i thought the fat old rogue would have come out to visit the yacht before he would have allowed us a morsel said lord ivinghoe  in which case you might have been found a skeleton father like sir hugh willoughby  and as to our telegrams they wont go till the diligence gets to st malo and what they will make of them there is another question  i did not dare to send more than one for fear they should get mixed up  vera heard the joyous chaff as it fluttered round her not half understanding it any more than if it had been a strange tongue and not always guessing the cause of the fits of laughter chiefly at lord ivinghoes misadventures over which his little sister and his father were well pleased to tease his correctness and his young wife looked a little hurt at his being tormented  he could not remember that braconnier was a poacher by land not by sea and very unnecessarily disclaimed to the maire being such a thing  his father he said was gentilhomme anglais enwhats a yachtyac nonsense thats a longhaired ox  no  non point contrabandiste mais galerien dans galere  and there i interposed said phyllis for fear we should be boarded as escaped galeriens  why galley was a pleasureboat sometimes said ivinghoe and his wife supported him with cleopatras galley  well done francie  to your oars for ivys defence said lord rotherwood  how did you defend us fly from being towed into harbour at brest as runaway convicts  she gabbled away most eloquently to the maire almost as fluently as a born frenchwoman said ivinghoe and persuaded him at last that it was not necessary to come on board to inspect us nor even to detain us till he had sent for instructions to st malo  as ivy managed matters i thought we might be kept as hostages said phyllis  but thanks to her blandishments the solemn official vouchsafed to send off a messenger for us with a telegram  i do not think he sent directions to pursue our suspicious galere added phyllis but i own i shall be glad to be under the lee of old england again  what was your telegram  brevity was safest nor had we money enough for two so all i attempted was delrio to flight rock quay  both safe  picked up by kittiwake  i thought that would be the quickest means of relieving anxiety as we were not sure of other addresses and as to home mamma probably hardly was aware of the storm or if she were she knew the capabilities of yachts and of griggs  right returned his father  poor miss prescott she must have given you up for lost  have you been improving your mind with french telegrams he added turning to delrio  no my lord i found my way to the church a wonderful piece of old normanif it may so be called  i see you have been sketching  griggs here interposed with tidings that eggs and coffee were ready in the saloon the worthy pair having had respect to the general famine and prepared what could be made ready in haste  those who had eaten ashore sat by making an amusing account of their reception and difficulties with language and peasants for this not being an ordinary place of call nothing was ready for sale  vera finding herself for the first time in distinguished company which desired to set her at ease began to be at ease and to desire to shine so she giggled whenever she perceived the slightest excuse even when lord ivinghoe handed her the eggs and hoped she had not too british an appetite for french eggs and lady ivinghoe asked if she had seen the fowls and whether their feathers were ruffled up like a hens that had been given to aunt cherry  her little sister joan she added had asked whether eating the eggs would make her hair curl  or stand on end said phyllis  as i am afraid miss prescotts is doing till your telegram reaches her  did you say it was to go from st malo  yes  i thought that the safest place to have a comprehensible message copied  to whom did you say asked lady ivinghoe  delrio to flight  oh they will know his name and address fast enough when it gets to rock quay  he is the clergyman at st kenelms put in vera in explanation very very advanced ritualist you know  indeed was the answer  oh yes that he is  my sister polly is perfectly devoted to him but we dont go to his church except now and then because my eldest sister is just one of those very oldfashioned people you know who want everything horrid and dull  that is hardly what our cousins think of miss prescott said phyllis  i am so sorry for her anxiety  but i was not sure of the name of her place  the goyle  isnt it frightful said vera  you say she was unprepared for your adventure  oh yes quite  her notions are so dreadfully proper and old fashioned  she hasnt got any sympathy has she hubert  i dont know he said gravely  i have always had the greatest respect for her  respect  so you ought  thats just the thing one has for a slow dear old fogey she said laughing oh hubert  there was a silence and lord rotherwood made an observation upon the wind  vera perceived an awkwardness and by way of repairing it afterwards thought it expedient to communicate to lady phyllis that it might be a pity she had said hubert  it was so awkward only he was such an old acquaintance  i should have thought the awkwardness was incurred long ago said lady phyllis  come you will have no more concealments from miss prescott will you  you will be ever so much more comfortable and find out how kind she is  oh but vera wanted to talk over all her grievances for the pleasure of talking saying very much what she had said before and phyllis tried to endure and put in as much sense as she could without lecturing the girl who struck her as the very silliest she had ever encountered but she was continually called off to admire the receding french coast or to look at the creatures brought up by dredging  she always took care to call vera and not let her feel herself left out but vera if in solitude for a moment reflected on the neglect shown of little people by great ones and when called up to see uncanny slimy creatures or even transparent balls like watery umbrellas only was disgusted and horrified  she began to guess rather truly that lady phyllis wanted to hinder a teteatete between her and hubert delrio  in fact lord rotherwood who was much more of a sympathetic confidenceinviting personage than his stiffer much older seeming son had said to his daughter dont let that poor lad and the girl get together alone fly the boy thinks he is bound to make her an offer  oh father  surely not  no more than if they had been two babies in a walnut shell  so i told him but people dont see what infants they are themselves and i want to hinder him from putting his foot in it before he has seen her auntcousinsister or whoever it is that has the charge of her and she has depicted to him a gorgon with medusas hair claws and alla fancy sketch isnt it  of course sentimental schoolgirl colours  mysie thinks her delightful  at any rate let him get a dose of common sense before committing himself  he is a capital fellow sure to rise has the soul and head and hands for it but he ought not to weight himself with a drag  do you think he is really in love with her  lord rotherwood waved his hands  he thinks so but nobody knows with those boys  i had to tell him at last that i would not have any philandering on board my ship and whatever he might think it his duty to say must be put off for auntsistergorgonmedusa or what not  and i dont think hes very bad fly for he modestly asked permission to sketch francies head for st mildred or milburg or somebody and was ready to run crazy about the tints on that dogfish the young fellow is in the queerest state between the artist and the lover delight and shame  i should like to take him north with us the colours of the cliffs in the isles would soon drive out miss victoriawhats her name  you dont think him like stephen in the mill on the floss who ought to have married maggie tulliver  i believe that is his precedentbut it is sheer stuffpure accidentas a respectable old householder like me is ready to testify to the gorgons and chimeras diregrundys and all  we must encounter rock quay fly if it is only to rescue this unlucky youth  what is he doing now  oh i see drawing francie who sits as stiff as a saint of burnejones  well ill have an eye to them  vera have you finished rudder grange  not quite  i cant make out who lord edward was  why the big dog  did you think he was pomonas hero  i dont know  wasnt pomona very silly  if life was to be taken from storybooks said phyllis in a very didactic mood but you see she imbibed the best side what they really taught her of good  i thought when you gave me the book it was to be an adventure like mine not all standing still in an old river  what do you think hubert delrio ought to do after persuading me into such an awful predicament  tell your sister he is very sorry that you two foolish children got into such a scrape and very thankful that you were saved  we are very thankful to lord rotherwood  i didnt mean to him  to some one else said phyllis reverently  oh of course said vera  but what do you think lady phyllis since her discovery of the title she made a liberal use of it what do you think people will say  that a little girl has had a dangerous adventure and a happy escape  i am seventeen lady phyllis  one is nothing like grown up at seventeen  i declare theres a big steamer coming into sight  i wonder if it belongs to the channel fleet  nothing more sentimental could be extracted for the rest of the voyage    chapter xivpairing time anticipated    i marry without more ado my dear dick red cap what say you cowper   the telegram had been received about midday and mr flight rushed up with it to the goyle just in time to prevent poor old mr delrio from starting hopelessly home  it had suffered a good deal in spelling and precision in spite of lady phylliss precautions but both safe was understood as it was known in rock quay that lord rotherwood and family as the papers had it were yachting in the kittiwake and might be expected in the bay  agatha and paula threw their arms round one another and cried magdalen with a choke in her voice struggled to ask mr flight to lead them in a few words of thanksgiving and as soon as these were over thekla expressed her hopes that they had been cast on a desert island and would bring home man friday  the goyle ladies walked over to clipstone with the good news and the whole party went down afterwards to rockstone to look out for yachts and inquire about possibilities  the kittiwake being a steamer light and swift might be expected in harbour in the course of the night and mr delrio meant to wait for her at his sons lodgings the ladies wished they could do the same and paula was allowed to accept sister beatas humble entreaty to house her  but they did not know how long before the telegraph from st malo the kittiwake from st cadoc had spread her wings and hoisted her feather for happily her coals had held out better than her provisions  so as they were looking their last look from the cliffs of beechcroft miss mohun exclaimed a steamer a yacht  kittiwake  glasses were rushed for and unaccustomed eyes could trace the graceful course through the gentle evening waves towards the quay  every one was on the quay in time to receive the boat which rowed by four smart sailors was seen with the party of six two sailor hats and one red cap being at once spied out among the female figures  then two hats were waved and answered by cheers of welcome and the figures were recognised and unnecessarily numerous hands stretched out to assist the landing from the plank extended to the boat  vera was put first by her kind rescuers lord rotherwoods hand guiding her to the rail and after an insecure step or so she found herself in the arms of paulina sobbing for joy and the little cluster of sisters seemed to know nothing else except thekla who presently in the confusion of the greetings was found by lord rotherwood looking about vaguely and saying but wheres their man friday  you must accept me for him said he  tis friday unless we have lost our reckoning  i hope you think me something promising in the way of savages  young delrios first proceeding even while his father was wringing his hand in speechless welcome and thankfulness was to turn to captain henderson  sir your boat is safe it will be brought in tomorrow  i am much concerned and beg your forgiveness but i had no idea that it was yours till griggs found your name  only one oar is lost and a cushion which i will replace  say no more pray said captain henderson  the fault was my servants who took it without leave and left it out  he must repair the very slight damage  miss mohun wanted the whole troop to come up to beechcroft to drink tea and her relations consented but the hearts of the prescotts were a great deal too full for them not to wish to be alone together and after magdalen had given her hand to lord rotherwood with a fervent you know what i would say my lordbeyond all words they turned homewards but mr flight ran after them to say in a low voice can we meet tomorrow at eight for a service of thanksgiving  and this was gladly accepted  hubert was dragged off by his father  nonsense they dont want your apologies and explanations  it would only be besetting them  come home with me and dont be a fool  but write a few lines to your poor mother after the intolerable fright you have given her meddling and presuming where you had no business a providence it is that you are not half across the atlantic if not at the bottom of it  of course this was the reaction of great anxiety but however meekly hubert submitted to the queer outpouring of affection and however thankful they both were and glad and content over the particulars of the youths work and progress still he was not to be withheld from laying hand and heart at vera prescotts feet as he insisted was due to her and her family after the compromising situation in which he had placed her  his father said it was talking novels and folly but he was a man of three and twenty and could not well be stopped as he was earning his own livelihood and had always been irreproachable  so mr delrio had to leave the matter only expressing discouragement and insisting that it must be no more than an engagement  the thanksgiving took place as arranged and lord rotherwood his daughter and mysie were there  for indeed there had been danger enough during the thunderstorm to make the safety of the kittiwake a matter of thankfulness though the rescue of the boat had caused it to be almost forgotten in the history of the night  lady flight had begged that all would come to breakfast with her and this was accepted by the goyle party but the clipstone ponycarriage was waiting for the others and they could not accede to lady flights impromptu and rather nervous invitation  but before they started lord rotherwood managed to say a few words aside to miss prescott of the impression he had divined from his voyage with hubert delrio whom he thought a young man of great ability and promise and of excellent principles but with a chivalry it was quite refreshing to see in youth perhaps ready to strain honourable scruples almost too far for his own good or that of others  magdalen thought she perceived what had been in the marquiss mind when immediately after her return home hubert and vera came up hand in hand and he informed her of their mutual attachment  i am afraid miss prescott he said that we may not have acted rightly or squarely by you and this last adventure was a most unhappy result of my careless awkwardness and preoccupation  it was the merest accident  we all quite understand  it is not to be thought of  you are very good to say so but  both he and magdalen wished that vera had not been present blushing and smiling or rather simpering and as hubert hesitated over his but magdalen said  vera my dear hubert and i can talk over this better without you you had better go and find paula  only sister please do understand that i care for hubert with all my heart said vera much less childishly than magdalen had expected  however she went while magdalen succeeded in saying what she had intendedthat hubert must not consider himself in the smallest degree bound by what had been accident entirely unintentional and innocent  you are generous miss prescott  you understand  but the world it was public  never mind the world  you see what sensible people think  but indeed miss prescott i cannot leave you to suppose i am only actuated by the fact of that awkward situation  of course that would never have been if i did not deeply entirely love your sister  it has only precipitated matters  i entreat of you to give her to me as one who iswho is devoted to her  if my station is inferior i will work  that is not the point  vera is too young for such things  what does your father say  my father sees that i am right  i see what that means said magdalen smiling  but where is he i should like to talk to him  mr delrio pretty well knowing what was going on was found endeavouring to distract his mind by sketching the goyle  he and magdalen walked up and down the drive together perfectly agreeing that it would be senseless cruelty to permit an early marriage between these two young people and that it was a pity there should be an engagement but this could hardly be prevented since mr delrio could only give advice and leave a selfsupporting worthy son to judge for himself but the elder sister and the trustee could stipulate for delay till vera should be of age  so hubert was called and acquiesced cheerfully observing that he trusted that four years would make him able to render veras life an easy and pleasant one and after heartily thanking both miss prescott and his father he went off to rejoice the heart of the maiden who was sitting under the peartree watching with anxious eyes    chapter xvbroods astray    but ill for him who bettering not with time corrupts the strength of heavendescended will and ever weaker grows through acted crime or seeming genial venial fault  tennyson   man friday hope piccaniny live wellbring her buckra fish from sea  such was the greeting from lord rotherwood to thekla when the whole party walked over in time for tea on the lawn before church at clipstone as he presented her with a facsimile oyster which he had hunted up in a sweet shop making an absurd bow and scrape  poor thekla coloured and mumbled a shy thank you mymy having had a lecture from vera on treating a marquis with over familiarity and it was left to primrose to ask where friday learnt nigger language  by nature missy buckra he responded all same nigger everywhere  and he repeated his bow so drolly that primroses laugh carried theklas along with it as lady phyllis walked up with come father you are wanted to congratulate  eh  am i  so they have perpetrated it have they  mores the pity is what i should say in the palace of truth but the maiden has landed a better fish than she knowsthat is if she have landed him  there take care dont be tiresome papa admonished lady phyllis drawing him on when he met vera with a courtly manner and i hope i see you recovered miss prescott and able to rejoice in the pleasant consequences of your adventure  vera blushed and looked very pretty and modest making not much answer as she retreated among her contemporaries to show them her ring a hoop of pearls which wilfred insisted were roman pearls fishes eyes most appropriate but flapsy felt immeasurably older than wilfred today and able to despise his teasing though hubert delrio was not present and indeed wilfred was not disposed to bestow much of his attention upon her having much more inclination to beset his cousin lady phyllis who surely ought to perceive that he had attained at least the same height as his brother jasper and could in his absence pose as the young man of the household  phyllis had not much to say to him nor after the first to vera though she duly admired the ring so exultantly shown and accepted the assurance that hubert was the dearest fellow in the world  but there was no getting any condolence out of her upon the misery of having to wait four whole years  she said it was a very good thing  there was her cousin gillian who had insisted on waiting three years to finish her education  oh but dear hubert likes me as i am simpered vera  you might wish that he should find more in you to like  gillian said phyllis coming up to her and agatha i want you to assure vera that four years is not such a great trial in waiting  it is what i have been trying to persuade her said agatha she is hardly seventeen  and i would not have been married at seventeen for anything said gillian to the pouting vera  i want to be more worth having  vera did not like it she had heard the like at home and she fell back upon valetta while the others walked on  poor little flapsy said agatha i do hope this engagement may make more of a woman of her  my father was very much struck by mr delrio said phyllis both as artist and personally  you must be glad of the time for putting her up to his level said gillian  do you think such things are to be done asked agatha  yes said phyllis stoutly  you may not make her able to be a senior wrangleroh you are oxfordor capable of it like this gillyflower but you can get the stuff into her that makes a sound sensible wife  gillian caught a little hopeless sigh of can and answered it with when all this effervescence is blown off then will be the time for working at the substance and she may be all the better wife especially for the artist temperament if she is of the homely sort  how angry she would be if she heard you say so returned agatha yet certainly i do feel relieved that wifehood is to be my poor flapsys portion for she is not of the sort that can stand alone and make her own way  there will always be plenty of such women in the world said gillian  so much the better for the world retorted phyllis who had never shown any symptoms of exclusive devotion to any one of the other sex except her father  one thing agatha wanted to know and dared not ask namely what impression vera had made in the kittiwake and what hubert had said about her for she and paula had begun to remark that lover as he was not a word about her heroism had escaped him  and it was as well that she did not hear what the extra plain spoken primrose did not spare the boasting thekla  cousin rotherwood and fly both say they cant think how mr delrio got on with such a silly little hysterical goose upon his hands and that it is a foolish romantic unlucky notion that he ought to be engaged to her  i think mamma will tell miss prescott so  the kittiwake having arrived three days later than had been expected there had been an amount of revolution in the general arrangements  the break up of the high school was to be on an early day of the next week  it had become a much more extensive and public matter than in the days of valetta and maura though these were not so very long ago and there was a great day of exhibitions and speeches to the parents and neighbourhood generally  two ladies had been secured for the purpose elizabeth merrifield and miss arthuret and the former arrived on the saturday afternoon but as the rotherwood party almost overflowed clipstone she was transferred to miss mohun  after the death of their parents about three years previously susan and elizabeth had gone to live at coalham and to be useful to their brother davids parish susan betaking herself to the poor and bessie finding herself specially available in the various forms of improvement undertaken by ladies in modern days  to her own surprise and her sisters discomfiture her talent as a public speaker had become developed  with a little assistance from her sisterinlaw agness unwilling stage experience and entreaties not easily to be withstood came from various quarters that she would come and advocate the good cause  of course she was ever welcome at clipstone and she walked up thither with general mohun arriving just after the others from the goyle and in the general confusion of greetings and the babel of cousinly tongues there were no introductions nor naming of names bessie declared herself delighted with the chance of seeing lady ivinghoe whom she considered more to realise the beauty of women than any one she had hitherto beheld and the fair face had not lost its simplicity but rather gained in loveliness by the sweetness of early motherhood as she and phyllis sat by mysie regaling her with tales of what they regarded as the remarkable precocity of the infant claude reluctantly left to his grandmother  but wheres dolores asked bessie  i miss her among the swarm of mice  dolores is at vale leston answered gillian  she has been a long time making up her mind to go there to geralds home and now she is there they will not let her go till some birthday is over  uncle felixs whispered franceska to mysie  you know it was dear geralds place  she had never seen it  another voice was now raised asking what had become of miss arthuret  she only comes down on monday said bessie  just in time for the meeting  she is too valuable to come for more than one meeting  but who is she  arthurine arthuret  she is a girl or rather woman who has some property at stokesley  in fact she is one of those magnets that seem to attract inheritance without effortlike the hapsburgs though happily she makes a most beneficent though sometimes original use of them  is not that very dangerous said aunt lily  the first came to her early and coming into it very young and overflowing with new ideas she began rather grotesquely but she has tamed down a good deal since and really has done an immense deal of good in finding employment for people making improvements and the like though she is sams pet aversion a tremendous liberal almost a socialist  they are so like cat and dog that susan and i were really glad to be away from stokesley especially at election times but altogether she is an admirable person  lady merrifield thought she detected a start of miss prescott at the name stokesley and that her eyes looked anxiously at the speaker bessie was not of the sandy part of the family  was the unattractive schoolboy once seen like his sisters  all that was observable was startling similitudes to her own children though in them the elements of the handsome dark mohun generally predominated  but by and by in a quiet moment bessie suddenly asked did you say her name was magdalen  lady merrifield laughed  four years may do a good deal at that time of life she said  i suppose no time ever so changeschanges what shall i sayeyesviewscharacters  only constancy in absence is the dangerous thing  there are distinguished examples of of the mischief of being constant without knowing what one is constant to  virulent constancy as mrs malaprop has it  magdalen thanked and smiled  perhaps there was a certain virulent constancy in a remote corner of her heart which had been revived by a certain indescribable look in the eyes and contour of bessie merrifield  and bessie herself while sitting under the verandah with lady merrifield while all the others were walking down to embark lord and lady ivinghoe in the yacht suddenly repeated did you say that her name was magdalen  yes i saw it startled you my dear  it revived an old old story  i do not know whether there was anything in it  who or what is she aunt lily  i only know her as the sister of the girl that the ivinghoes picked up  she is the owner of a little property at arnscombe and has taken home her four young halfsisters to live with her after having slaved for them as a governess till she came into this inheritance she is an excellent person  ah  was her house at filsted  i am not sure  yes i think the young ones were at school there you think  i feel certain  may i tell you aunt lily  some of the others cannot bear to mention my poor hal but to me the worst of the sting is gone since i know he repented  my dear i should be very glad to hear  your father and mother never mention your brother and we were away at the time  poor hal  i am afraid there was a weakness in him  he never had that determination that carried all the others on  he never could get through an examination and my father put him into a bank at filsted  by and by after some years came a letter telling my father he was gambling very seriously getting into temptation and engaging himself to an attorneys daughter  it was while i was living with grandmamma and he used sometimes to look in on me and talk to me about this magdalen  once he showed me her photograph and i thought i knew her face again  but my father went off very angry i have always feared he found poor hal on the verge of tampering with the bank money but he never would say a word  he broke everything up put an end to the engagement if there was one and sent hal off to john and george who had just got their farm in manitoba and were getting on by dint of hard work  they have done very well have they not  yes by working and living harder than any day labourer at stokesley  hal could not stand it andand im afraid the boys were not very merciful to him poor fellow and he got something to do in winnipeg  there he fell in with a speculator called golding they all did in fact he was a plausible man whom they all liked and used to put up at his house when they took waggons in with their produce  he had a daughter and johnnie got engaged to her or thought he was  they all were persuaded to put money into a horrid building speculationhenry what he had brought out the other two what they had realised  well suddenly it all ended  they were all gone golding daughter hal and allyes allthe money the other boys had put in the thing off to the states as we suppose  no trace ever found  really no trace  none  the poor boys lost all they had and were obliged to begin over again  and has really nothing been heard of this unfortunate hal  there is one thing that does give me a hope  there did come to stokesley a letter from a brisbane bank addressed to j and g merrifield to the care of rearadmiral merrifield and in it were bank bills up to the value of what the boys had been robbed of about two hundred and fifty pounds  poor henry must have repented and wished to make restitution  was there no name no clue  none at all  we know no more  but was there no inquiry made at brisbane  it was when my father was very ill  the parcel was not opened at first  i have been always sorry he never heard of it but after all there was no asking of forgiveness nor anything that could be answered  the boys got it with the tidings of our dear fathers death  john came home to see about things george stayed to look after his stokesley  they were well over their troubles by that time and they gave the restored money to david for his churches  and no more was done not even by david said lady merrifield thinking over what she had heard from geraldine grinstead and how the underwoods would have accepted such a token from their lost sheep  david did write to brisbane to the bank but there never was any answer  there is no knowing how it might have been if any one had gone out and done his best but you see we were all much taken up with home duties and cares and i am afraid we have not dwelt enough upon our poor boy and he had much against him  the discipline from my dear father that all the elders responded to with a sort of loyal exultation only frightened him and made him shifty  they despised him and i do not think any of us were as kind to him as we ought to have been though on the whole he liked me the best for he cared for books and quiet pursuits such as all laughed at except david  i wish he could have seen more of david  did your mother hear of this ray of hope  susan thought it best not to tell her  we used to hear her murmuring his name among all ours in her prayers susie sam hal bessie and so on but she never was herself enough to understand and they thought it might only stir her up to expect to see him  oh aunt lily i dont think youany of youwould have gone on so but you are all much more affectionate and demonstrative than our branch of the family  ah my dear i am sure there was a pang in your mothers heart that she never durst mention said lady merrifield her imagination dwelling in terror on her wilfred the one child in whom she could not help detecting the weakness of character of his unhappy cousin depend upon it bessie her prayers were hovering round him all the time and bringing that act of restitution though she was not allowed to hear of it  i had not thought of that said bessie in a low tone though i think david has  i have heard his voice choke over an intercession for the absent  think of it now my dear and do not let habitual reserve hinder you from speaking of it to susan and david though most likely they have the habit already  who knows what united prayer may do with him who deviseth means to bring home his banished  steps returning bessie wiped away her tears in haste actually the first she had shed for the lost hal though there was a heartache too deep for tears    chapter xvithe regiment of women    and happier than the merriest games is the joy of our new and nobler aims f r havergal   miss mohun and miss merrifield encountered miss prescott and agatha among a perfect herd of cycles making bessie laugh over the recollections of the horror caused at stokesley by the arrival of arthurine arthuret on a tricycle twelve years previously  the place was the town hall the high school having proved too small for the number of the intended audience and lord rotherwood having been captured in spite of the kittiwake being pronounced ready to sail and all the younger passengers being actually on board entertaining a party from clipstone  there he sat enthroned on the platform with portraits of himself his elizabethan ancestor and the prince of wales overhead and in propria persona on either side the mayor of rockstone captain henderson and a sprinkling of the committee jane of course being one while in the space beneath was a sea of hats more or less beflowered and befeathered  lord rotherwood began by complaining of an act of piracy  after being exposed to a tempest and forced to put in for supplies here he was captured and called upon to distribute prizes  he perceived that it was a new act of aggression on the part of the ladies proving to what lengths they were coming  tyrants they had always been but to find them wreckers to boot was a novelty  however prizes were the natural sequence of a maritime exploit and he was happy to distribute them to the maidens about to start on the voyage of life hoping that these dainty logbooks would prove a stimulus and a compass to steer by even into unexplored seas such as he believed the betterinformed ladies were about to describe to them  rockstone was used to its marquiss speeches and always enjoyed them and he handed the prizebooks to the recipients with a shake of the hand and a word or two of congratulation appropriate to each especially when he knew their names and then he declared that they were about to hear what education was good for much better than from himself from such noted examples as miss arthuret and miss merrifield better known to them as mesa  wherewith he waved forward miss arthuret a slight youthfullooking lady fashionably attired and made his escape with rapid foot and hasty nods almost furtively while the audience were clapping her  she spoke with voice and utterance notably superior to his wellknown halting periods scarcely saved by long training and use from being a stutter  the female population eagerly listened while she painted in vivid colours the aim of education in raising the status of women and extending their spheres not only of influence in the occult manner which had hitherto been their way of working through others but in an open manner which compelled attention and she dwelt on certain brilliant achievements of women and of others which stood before them and towards which their education passing out of the old grooves was preparing them to take their place among men and temper their harshness and indifference to suffering with the laws of mercy and humanity speaking with an authority and equality such as should ensure attention no longer in home and nursery whispering alone but with open face asserting and claiming justice for the weakest  it was a powerful and effective speech and agathas eye lighted with enthusiasm as did those of several others of the elder scholars and younger teachers as these high aims were unfolded to them  then followed elizabeth merrifield not contradictory but recognising what wide fields had been opened to womanhood dwelling on such being the work of christianity which had always tended to repress the power of brute animal strength and jealousy and to give preponderance to the force of character and the just influence of sweet homely affection  exceptional flashes even in heathen lands and still more under the divine guidance of the israelites showed what women were capable of and ever since a woman had been the chosen instrument of the mystery of the incarnation the church the chosen emblem of the union of humanity with her lord had gradually purified and exalted the sex by training them through the duties of mercy of wifehood and motherhood to be capable of undertaking and fulfilling higher and more extensive tasks always by the appointment and with the help of him who had increased their outside powers for the sake of the weaker ones of his flock  what might by his will in the government and politics of the country be put into their hands no one could tell but it was right to be prepared for it by extending their intellectual ability and knowledge of the past as well as of the laws of physical natureall in short that modern education aimed at opening young minds to pursue with growing faculties  this was what made her rejoice in the studies here followed with good success as the prizes testified so pleasantly and she trusted that the cultivation which here went on so prosperously was leadingif she might use old wellaccustomed wordsto the advancement of gods glory the good of his church aye and to the safety honour and welfare of our sovereign and her dominions  the words brought tears of feeling into the eyes of some but jane mohun could not help observing ah  i was afraid you were going to hold up to us the example of the ants and bees where the old maids do all the working and fighting and governing  dont make gillian regret that she is falling away from the spinsterhood  come aunt jane bessie never did make it the praise of spinsters i am sure married women can do as much as spinsters and have more weight said gillian facing round gallantly and winning the approval of her aunt and of bessie  there was no doubt but that since her engagement she had been much quieter and less opinionative  with what different sensations the same occasion may be attended  to bessie merrifield the primary object was as ever womans work especially her own for the church and the actual business absorbed her  in spite of her evenings talk to her aunt lilias and the sad and painful recollections it had aroused still her only look at magdalen prescotts face was one half of curiosity half of sorrow as of the object of the brief calflove of one of many brothers and who had been now lost sight of with the passing wonder whether if the affection had survived and been encouraged it might have led him to better things  while magdalen felt the poignant renewal of the one romance of a lifetime as she caught tones watched little gestures and recognised those indescribable hereditary similarities which more and more bore in upon her the fraternal connection of the bright earnest woman with the lively pleasant young man who had brought the attraction of a higher tone of manners and cultivation into the country town  no more had been heard of him since his promise to write a promise that had been only once remembered so that she had tried to take refuge in the supposition unlikely as it was that her stepmother had confiscated his letters  all was a blank since that last stolen kiss and the wonder whether she could by any means discover anything further from lady merrifield or gillian so occupied her that she hardly heard the tenor of the two speeches and did not observe agathas glowing cheeks and burning eyes which might have told her that this was one of the moments which direct the current of life  when hubert delrio came up in the evening he was curious to hear about the meeting  his young landlady who had been a high school girl for a short time thought miss arthurets speech the most beautiful discourse that ever was spoken while other reports said that lady flight and miss mohun were very much shocked and thought it unwholesome not to say dangerous and he wanted to know the meaning of it  magdalen was quite dismayed to find how entirely her attention had been absent and how little account she could give of what had passed by her like the wind but she need not have been at a loss for agatha with sparkling eyes and clasped hands burst out into a very able and spirited abstract of the speech and the future it portrayed showing perhaps more enthusiasm than the practised public speaker thought it prudent to manifest  i see said hubert with something of a smile you ladies are charmed with the great future opened to you  im sure said vera perhaps a little nettled by attention paid so long to agatha i cant see the sense of it all i think a woman is made just to love her husband and be his pet without all that fuss about societies and speeches and learning and fuss  and she gave a little caress to huberts hand which was returned as he said she may well be loved but without publicly coming forward she may become the more valuable to her home  of course she may at home or abroad  she ought  began agatha but vera snapped her off  well it only comes to being one of a lot of horrid old maids and you dont want me to be one of them do you darling  come and look at my doves  what do you think of it all sister asked paulina  so far as i grasp the subject said magdalen to whom of course this was not new i think that if a larger scope is to be given to women it is for the sake and under the direction of the church that it can be rightly and safely used  she knew she was speaking by rote and was not surprised that agatha said that is just what one has heard so often and what miss merrifield harped upon  i want to breathe in a fresh atmosphere beyond the old traditions and know which are divine and which are only the superstructure of those who have always had the dominion and justified it in their own way  who gave them that dominion said magdalen  brute strength began agatha  nag nag cried paula  surely you believe  i did not sayi did not meani only meant to think it out and understand what is divine and what is in the eternal fitness of things  here came an interruption leaving magdalen conscious of the want of preparation for guiding the thought of these young things and of selfreproach too for having let herself be so absorbed in the thought of her broken reed of earth beneath as not to have dwelt on what might be the deep impressions of the young sisters under her charge  a few days later as agatha sat reading in the garden two figures appeared on the drive wheeling up their bicycles  one was gillian the other had a general air of the family but much darker and not one of the old acquaintances  advancing to meet them she said i am the only one at home  my sisters are all at lessons or in the village  ill leave a message said gillian  my mother wants you all to come up to picnic tea to see the foxgloves in the dell on monday and to bring mr delrio  oh thank you  i forgot you had not seen my cousin dolores mohun before  mysie calls her a cousintwin if you know what that is  agatha thought the newcomers great pensive dark eyes and overhanging brow under very black hair made her look older than mysie or indeed than gillian herself and when the message had been disposed of the latter continued dolores wanted to know about miss arthurets lecture being rather in that line herself  she could not get home in time for it and i was seeing the kittiwake party on board and only crept in at the other end of the hall in time for bessies faint echoes  i was in the very antipodes said dolores in a haunt of ancient peace whence they would not let me come away soon enough  and agatha aunt jane says she saw you devouring miss arthuret with your eyes said gillian  it gave one a sense of new life said agatha and she related again miss arthurets speech broken only by appreciative questions and comments from dolores auditor to whom in the true fashion of nineteen agatha straightway lost her heart  dolores who had seen much more of the outer world than her cousins and had had besides a deeply felt inward experience which might well render her far more responsive and able to comprehend the questions working in the girls mind and which found expression in i went to st roberts only wanting to get my education carried on so that i might be a better governess but i see now there are much farther on much greater things to aim at than i ever thought of  alps on alps arise said dolores  yestill they lose themselves and where  miss merrifield would say in heaven by way of the church  the all things in earth or under the earth rising up in circles of praise to the cherubim and the great white throne said dolores her dark eyes raised in a moments contemplation  ah  one knows  but is that thought the one to be brought home to every one as if they could bear it always  are not we to do somethingsomethingfor the helping people here in this life not always going on to the other life  temporal or spiritual said dolores or spiritual through temporal  and our part in helping said agatha  there is an immense deal to be thought out said dolores  i feel only at the beginning of the questions and there is study and experience to go to them  you mean what one gets at oxford  partly  thoroughat least as thorough as one canof the physical and material nature of things then of the precedent which then results also of reasoning  metaphysical do you mean or logical  that comes in but i was thinking of mathematical in the indirect training of the mind  it all works into needful equipment and so does actual life  it takes ones breath away  well we have begun our training said dolores with a sweet sad smile  at least i hope so  at st roberts you mean  you have i think  but i believe my aunt will be expecting us  oh  and then they talk about modesty and womanliness and retiring what do you think about all that  that we never shall do any good without it  they were interrupted by the hasty rushing up of paula who had committed her bicycle to vera and came dashing up the steep slope crying o nag nag they are going away  the announcement was interrupted as she perceived the presence of the visitor and they rose to meet her but saw that there were tears in her eyes and she had rushed up so fast that she was panting and could hardly speak though she gave her hand as agatha after naming the two cousins asked who are going  the sisterssister mena with another overflow of tears which made dolores and gillian think they had better retreat and leave her to her sisters consolation so they took leave hastily agatha however coming as far as their machines and confiding to them poor polly it is a great blow to her but i believe it is very good for her  theres stuff in that girl said dolores as soon as they were out of reach  she has the faculty of hearkening as well as of hearing  you would say so if you saw her at a lecture and she is also gaining power of expressing and reproducing said gillian  she will be a power by and by unless some blight comes across her  will me will me it seems as if we had to do it  even mamma whose ideal was chivalry church and home has to be drawn out to take a certain public part aunt jane who only wished to live to potter about among neighbours poor and rich must needs come out of her traditional conventions and relate her experiences and you  oh i am only trying to do the work gerald aimed at  any way we have our work before us whether we call it for the church or mankind  charity or altruism said dolores  may not altruism lead to charity said gillian  sometimes but sometimes disappointment leads only to intolerance of those whose methods differ  altruism will not stand without a foundation said dolores  mysie has been impressing on me with what she heard from phyllis devereux of the work sister angela has been doing at albertstown the most utter selfabnegation through bitter disappointment in her most promising pupilsonly the charity that is rooted could endure it is just the old difference tennyson points out between wisdom and knowledge  and with wisdom come those feminine attributes that agatha began asking about  yes softening gentleness tact  if people have not grown up to them they must be taught as parts of wisdom  gillian sighed  i wonder what ernley armitage will say when he comes home  he wont want you to throw up everything  i dont think he will  but if he didno i think he will be a staff to guide a silly priggish heart to the deeper wisdom    chapter xviifoxgloves and flirtations    with her venturous climbings and tumbles and childish escapes tennyson   hubert delrio pleased and gratified but very shy joined the ladies from the goyle in their walk to clipstone expecting perhaps a good deal of stiffness and constraint since every one at st kenelms told him what a severe and formidable person sir jasper merrifield was and that all lady merrifields surroundings were so very clever  they did want such books ordered in the library  magdalen laughed and said her only chance of seeing a book she wanted was that lady merrifield should have asked for it  at clipstone they were directed to the dell where the foxgloves were unusually fine that year covering one of the banks of the ravine with a perfect cloud of closegrown spikes nodding with thick clustered bells spotted withinside and without of that indescribable light crimson or purple enchanting in reality but impossible to reproduce  it was like a dream of fairy land to hubert to wander thither with his vera count the tiers of bells admire the rings of purple and the crooked stamens measure the height of the tall ones some almost equal to himself in stature and recall the fairy lore and poetry connected with them while vera listened and thought she enjoyed but kept herself entertained by surreptitiously popping the blossoms and trying to wreath her hat with wild roses  thekla meantime admired from the opposite bank in a state of much elevation at acquiring a dear delicious brotherinlaw and insisted on primrose sharing her sentiments till her boasting at last provoked the exclamation i wouldnt be so cocky  i dont make such a fuss if my sisters do go and fall in love  i have two brothersinlaw out in india and gillian has a captain an egyptian hero with a medal a post captain out at sea in the nivelle  you shall see his photograph coloured in his lovely uniform with his sword and all your flapsys man isnt even an officer  he is a poet and thats better  better why if you will have it wilfred and fergus always call him that painter cad broke out primrose who had not outgrown her childish power of rudeness especially out of hearing of her elders  then it is very wicked of them exclaimed thekla when the marquis of rotherwood himself said that hubert delrio is a very superior young man each syllable triumphantly rounded off  primrose was equal to the occasion  oh they all laugh at cousin rotherwood and besides a superior young man does not mean a gentleman  thekla burst into angry tears and sobs which brought gillian and a grave dark young lady from the other side of a rock to inquire what was the matterthere was a confession on the two tongues of she did and i didnt of painter cad superior young man and no gentleman but at last it cleared itself into primrose allowing that to take down theklas conceit she had declared that a very superior young man did not mean a gentleman  i could not have believed that you could have been so abominably illmannered said gillian gravely you ought to apologise to thekla  oh never mind began thekla ashamed and at that moment a frantic barking was heard in the depths and valetta wilfred fergus and a dog or two darted headlong past calling out hedgehogs hedgehogs run come  and primrose giving a hand to thekla joined in the general rush down the glade  a situation relieved said the newcomer   for all ran to see for they took him to be    an egyptian porcupig   quoted gillian  they have wanted such a beast for some time for their menagerie but really primrose is getting much too old to indulge in such babyish incivility to a guest true though the speech was a superior young man not necessarily a gentleman  i am colonial enough to like him the better for the absence of a hall mark  should you have missed it  he is very good looking and has a sensible refined countenance poor man  he is a little too point device too obviously got up for the occasion  too like the best electroplate  no that is not fair for it is not pretence at least i should think there was sound material below and that never would brighten instead of dimming it  according to mysie and fly there is plenty of good taste and his principle is vouched for  mysie is quite furious at any ladylove having gone to sleep to the sound of original verses from a lover  dear old mysie  no she would not  she has a practical vein in her  would you  im not likely to be tried said gillian merrily  catch ernley either practising or not minding his boat  but come  mamma will want me i feel only deputy daughter with mysie away  the two girls rose from the mossy bank and proceeded across the paddock to the opening of the glade  on the turf lady merrifield sat enthroned making a nucleus to the festivities and delicacies of all sorts from sandwiches and cakes down to strawberries cherries and devonshire cream were displayed before her and the others drifted up gradually miss mohun first i am later than i meant to be she said but i was delayed by a talk with sister beata  i never saw a woman more knocked down than she is by that adventure of veras  i know said magdalen rousing herself  it has made her look ten years older and she could not talk it over or let a word be said to comfort her  she says it was all her fault and i should have thought it was that silly little sister menas if that is her name  she considers it her fault for objecting to strict discipline in things of which she did not see the use said jane mohun and so getting absorbed in her own work and having no fixed rule by which to train mena  i see said lady merrifield it reminds me of a story told in madame de chantals life how when par mortification a sister quietly ate up a rotten apple without complaint and another made signs of amusement a rule was made that no one should raise her eyes at meals  it shows that some rules which seem unreasonable may have a foundation  it is an unnatural life altogether said dolores  why should the rotten apple have been swallowed or if it was i should think a joke over it might have been wholesome  hindering priggishness in the mortified sister said gillian  the fact is said lady merrifield that if you vow yourself to an unnatural life so to speak you must submit to the rules that have been found best to work for it  and poor sister beata did neither the one nor the other by her own account said jane  she called herself a sister but disliked each rule and chose to go her own way like any other benevolent woman doing very admirable work herself but letting little mena have the prestige of a sister while too busy to look after her and without rules to restrain her  but surely there has been no harm exclaimed lady merrifield  no harm only a little incipient flirtation with the organist nothing in any one else but not quite like a convent maid  ah  i rather suspected said agatha  i should think the best thing for sister mena would be to go to a good school leave off her veil in which she looks so pretty and be treated like an ordinary girl said lady merrifield  that is just what sister beata intends said miss mohun  she is to sink down into miss marian jenkins to wear a straw hat and blue frock and go to school with the other girls the pupils while sister beata begins life as a probationer at dearport  poor sister beata  she says she has experienced that it is best to learn to obey before one begins to rule  it is most touching to see how humble she is such a real good woman too  i doubt whether she gets a nights rest three days in a week and she looks quite haggard with this distress said jane  she will be a great power by and by  but what will mr flight and st kenelms do without her  he is promised relays of sisters from dearport which has stood so many years that they have a supply  you see he like sister beata tried a little too much to be original and stand aloof  ah said lady merrifield that is the benefit of institutions they hinder works from dying away with the original clergyman or the wonderful woman  but aunt lily put in dolores institutions get slack  they have their downs but they also have their ups  there is something to fall back upon with public schools  yes like croquet laughed aunt jane  we saw it rise and saw it fall and here come all the players the revival  well how went the game  so the party collected and the two generals came in from some vanity of inspection to grumble a little merrily at the open air banquet but to take their places in all good humour and the lively meal began with all the home witticisms yet not such as to exclude strangers  indeed hubert delrio was treated with something like distinction and was evidently very happy with vera by his side perhaps magdalen perceived that there was not the perfect ease of absolute equality and familiarity but his poetical and chivalrous nature was gratified by the notice of a crimean hero and he infinitely admired the dignity and courtesy of lady merrifield and the grace and ease of her daughters finding himself in a new world of exquisite charm for him  and before they broke up magdalen had a quiet time with lady merrifield in which she was able not without a telltale blush even at her years to ascertain that there were two henry merrifields and that alas there was nothing good known of the son of stokesley except that anonymous attempt at restitution which gave hopes of repentance    chapter xviiipalaces or churches    and if i leave the thing that lieth next to go and do the thing that is afar i take the very strength out of my deed  macdonald   those were happy days that succeeded veras engagement  it had made her more womanly or at least less childish and the intercourse with hubert delrio became an increasing delight to her sisters who had never known anything so like a brother  he was at first shy and not at ease with magdalen who on her side perceived the lack of public school and university training but in grain he was so completely a good man a churchman and a gentleman and had so much right sense as well as talent that she liked him thoroughly and began to rely on him as a woman with unaccustomed property is glad to do with a male relation  and to him the society of the goyle was a new charm  he had been brought up to the technicalities and the business relations of art and had a cultivated taste but to be with a thoughtful highly educated lady able to enter into its higher and deeper associations was an unspeakable delight and improvement to him  vera was fairly satisfied as long as he sketched her in various attitudes and held her hand while he talked though she did grudge having so much time spent on taste shakespeare and the musical glasses  paula had various ecclesiastical interests in common with him and began to expand and enter more into realities while thekla had in him a dear delightful delicious brother who petted her bantered her mended her rabbit hutch caught her hedgehog taught her to guide her bicycle drew picture games for her and taught her to sketch  agatha had endless discussions with him on his various aspirations in some of which magdalen took her share sometimes thinking with a pang of regret and selfreproach that that brief time of intercourse with hal merrifield had been spent in youthful nonsense that could have left no permanent influence for good  in fact whether through hubert or through agatha a certain intellectual waft had breathed upon the goyle  hubert was eager for assistance in learning german and italian and read and discussed books of interest and even when he had left rockstone and his work at st kenelms being finished the stimulus was kept up by his letters comments and questions and the younger girls had entirely ceased to form an opposite camp or to view sister as a taskmistress even when agatha had returned to st roberts  mysie had come home very brown fuller of scott than ever for her mother and of hugh miller for fergus for whom she had brought so many specimens that cousin rotherwood declared that she would sink the kittiwake  over the sketches and photographs of iona she and paulina became great friends and paula was admitted to hear accounts of the modern missions that had come from the other harry merrifield among the karens in burmah or again through franciska ivinghoe of her aunt angela underwood who was considered to have a peculiar faculty for dealing with those very unpromising natives the australian gins  franciska remembered her tender nursing and bright manner in the days of fever at vale leston and had a longing hope that she would take a holiday and come home but at present she was bound to the couch of her slowly declining old friend sister constance the mother of dearport  it was another bond of interest with magdalen to whom missions to the heathens had always been a dream  thus had passed a year uneventful and peaceable with visits from hubert whenever he had a day or two to spare  they were looked forward to with delight but if there were a drawback it was in veras viewing him partly as one who held her in a sort of chain and partly as one whom it was pleasant to tease by allowing little casual civilities from wilfred merrifield  for wilfred was an embarrassment to his family  he had never been strong his public school career had been shortened by failure in health and headaches in the summer and coughs in the winter made it needful to keep him at home and trust to cramming at rockstone enforced by his fathers stern discipline and his mothers authoritative influence  thus he was always within reach of the mild social gaieties in which each family indulged and vera was not quite so ready as were his sisters to contrast unfavourably his hatred of all selfimprovement with hubert delrios eagerness to pick up every crumb of information thus deservedly getting on well in his profession  one morning at breakfast hubert opened a letter and made a sudden exclamation and in answer to veras vehement inquiry said it seems that the great millionaire swell pettiferis that his name  oh yes he was at rock quay  well he went to see st kenelms fell in love with the ceiling and offered pratt and pavis any sum they like to decorate a huge new hall he is building in the same style  so they write to propose to me to come and do it with a promise of future work at any terms i like to ask  oh but thats jolly cried vera  cant you  no he said this is immediate and i have two churches reredos and walls on my hands enough to last me all the year  nor could i throw over eccles and beamster  is there an agreement with them asked magdalen  not regularly but mr eccles has been very kind to me and promised me employment for four years to come in fact he has made engagements on that understanding  i see said magdalen  you could not break with them  certainly not  nor do i entirely like the line of this other house it is a good deal more secular  and you have dedicated your talents to the church cried paulina  not that exactly paula he said smiling but i had rather work for the church so i am glad the matter is definitely settled for me  to that he kept though he had a very kind letter from mr eccles who had evidently been applied to wishing not to stand in his light especially as he was engaged to be married and telling him how it might be possible to fairly compensate for the loss to the firm between the lines however it was plain that it would be a great blow only possible because the agreement had been neglected and hubert was only the more determined out of gratitude for the generosity not to break what he felt to be an implied pledge and all the sisters sympathised with his determination  he adhered to it even after his return to london though his father thought it a pity to lose the chance if it could be accepted without discourtesy to mr eccles and he had been interviewed by various parties concerned and there had been an attempt to dazzle him by the prospects held out to him by an enthusiastic young member of the firm  perhaps he was too shrewd entirely to trust them but at any rate he felt his good faith to eccles and beamster a bond to hold him fast from the temptation and his heart was really set on the consecration of the higher uses of his art so that regard to the simple rule of honour was an absolute relief to him  so he wrote to vera who if there were a secret wish on her part did not dare to give it shape while all her sisters to whom she showed the letters that she scarcely comprehended were openmouthed in their admiration  thekla who had been seized with a fit of hagiology went the length of comparing him to st barbara even paula pronounced it a farfetched resemblance  it was some months later that sir ferdinand travis underwood had decided on building a magnificent cathedrallike church for the population rising around him in the rocky mountains and meeting lord rotherwood in london heard of the work at st kenelms and resorted to eccles and beamster as the employers of young delrio  there would be plenty of varieties of beautiful material to be found near at hand in the mountains but hubert was sent first for a short journey in italy to study the effect of the old mosaics as well as the frescoes and then to go out to america to the work that would last a considerable time  vera was much excited by the notion of the italian journey and thought she ought to have been married at once and have shared it including as it did a short visit to rocca marina  but she was scarcely eighteen and neither her trustee nor her elder sister thought it advisable to dispense with the decision that her twenty first birthday must be waited for at which she pouted  hubert came for two nights on his return and was exceedingly full of his tour talking over italian scenes and churches with magdalen who had never seen them but had the descriptions and the history at her fingers ends and listened with delight to all the impressions of a mind full of feeling and poetry  the time was only too short to discuss or look out everything and much was left to be copied and sent after him with many promises on veras part of writing everything for him and translating the books that magdalen would refer to  he was allowed to take vera and paulina to filsted for a hurried visit to his parents  when they came home again it soon became plain that it had not been a success  i am glad to be at home again said paula as the pony carriage turned up the steep drive and the girls jumped out to walk  i am quite glad to feel the stones under my feet again  magdalen laughed  a new sentiment she said  i dont like the stones said vera but i did not know filsted was such a poky place  a dead flat added paula  no sea no torrs one wanted something to look at and such a church  did you see minnie maitland put in thekla  i saw all the maitlands in a hurry said vera  i dont remember which was which  they were all dressed alike in horrid colours hubert said they set his teeth on edge  how was old mrs delrio  just the same as ever lean and pinched  but so kind added paula  she could not make enough of flapsy  i should think not ejaculated vera  enough aye and too much just fancy no dinner napkins and edith went away and made the scones herself  very praiseworthy said magdalen  dont you know how hubert always tells us what a dear devoted good girl she is  well i only hope hubert does not expect me to live in that way said vera  his mother looks like a halfstarved hare and edith is giving lessons as a daily governess  edith is very nice said paula and i never understood before how excellent old mr delrios pictures are  do you remember his country lane  what a pity it did not sell  poor man said magdalen  he married too soon and that has kept him down  it is beautiful to see how proud they are of hubert said paula and his pretty gentle attention and deference to them both  mr delrio is really a gentleman i am sure but maidie she said falling back with her while vera and thekla mounted faster it was very odd to see how different things looked to us from what they seemed when we were at mrs bests  filsted high street has grown so small and one could hardly breathe in mrs delrios stuffy drawing room  and as to waring grange which we used to think just perfect it was all so pretentious and in such bad taste  hubert saw it as much as we did but i could see he was on thorns to hinder flapsy from making observations  certainly the visit had not done much good except in making the girls appreciate the refinement of their surroundings at the goyle  and when letters arrived from hubert at the american vale leston asking questions requiring some research in books either magdalens or at the rock quay library vera dawdled and sighed over them and when the more zealous magdalen or paula took all the trouble and left nothing for her to do but to copy their notes and write the letters she grew cross  it was for hubert and she did not want any one else to meddle  so stupid  if he had only taken pratt and paviss offer there would not have been all this bother  that of course she only ventured to utter before paula and thekla and it made them both so furious that she declared she was only in joke and did not mean it  she was indulging in reflections on the general dulness of her lot and the lack of sympathy in her sisters as she lingered by the confectioners window with her eyes fixed on a gorgeous combination of coloured bonbons when wilfred merrifield sauntered out  fresh from paris he said  going to choose some  oh no i havent got any cash  m a keeps us horribly short  as usual with governors  but look here  pocket this  sweets to the sweet from an old chum  oh will how jolly  such a love of a box  make haste  some of the girls are lurking about and if there is any mischief to be made trust gill for doing it  mischief but before the words were out of her mouth gillian and mysie appeared from the next shop a bootmakers and mysie stood aghast with what are you doing  buying goodies  how very ridiculous  the proper thing between chums isnt it vera said wilfred with an indifferent air  we arent unlucky sunday scholars mysie to be jumped upon  goodbye vera au revoir  he sauntered away with his hands in his pockets while gillian from her eldership of two years and her engagement gravely said vera perhaps you do not fully know but i should say this is not quite the thing  he told you we are just chums exclaimed vera  as if there were any harm in it  youve not got a sweet tooth yourself so you need not grudge me just a few goodies  gillian saw that it was of no use to prolong the dispute either for the place or the time and she hushed mysie who was about to expostulate farther and made her go away with a brief parting such as she hoped would impress on vera that the sisters thought very badly of her discretion and loyalty  they could not hear the reflection they need not be so particular and so cross  hubert never thought of giving me anything nice like this  why should not my chum  such a sweet little box too with a dear girls head on it would polly fuss about it and set on sister  i shall put it into my own drawer and then if they notice it they may think somebody at filsted gave it  no one has any business to worry me about hubert and wilfred being civil to me  he is a gentleman  the gentleman had been overtaken by his sisters  he was walking his bicycle up the hill rather breathlessly and slowly  mysie indignantly began of all the stupid things to do to give goodies to that girl like a baby  i have been wishing to speak to you said gillian  you are going the way to get that foolish girl into a scrape  oh yes of course  sisters uniformly object to a little civility to a pretty girl carelessly answered wilfred  nonsense returned mysie hotly  we dont care only it is not fair on mr delrio  the painter cad  a very good thing too  the sacrifice ought to be prevented  is not that the general sentiment  wilfred cried the scandalised mysie when it is all the other way and he is ever so much too good for her  consummate prig  the cheek of him pretending to a lady  but wilfred went on downright mysie is it only mischief or do you want to marry her yourself  draw your own conclusions responded wilfred mounting his machine and spinning down the hill faster than they could follow on foot  what is to be done gill sighed mysie  ought we to get mamma to speak to him  better not said gillian with more experience  it would only make it worse to take it seriously  half of it is playand half to tease you  and said mysie with due deference to the engaged sister how about mr delrio  will it make him unhappy  if he finds out in time what a horrid little thing it is i should say it would be very well for him but i dont want will to be the means  oh when his examination is over and he gets an appointment he will go away and it will be safe  i have not much hopes of his getting in  oh gill none of us ever failed before  on the side of the goyle not much was known or cared about wilfreds little attentions which were generally out of sight of magdalen and did not amount to much but paula saw enough of them to consult agatha on and to observe that flapsy was going on just as she used to at filsted and she thought hubert would not like it  i believe flapsy cant live without it sighed agatha  but would you speak to her  i dont think she ought to let him give her boxes of bonbonsto keep up in her room and never give a hint to maidie  agatha did speak but the effect was to set vera into crying out at every one being so intolerably cross about such a trifle gillian merrifield and all  did gillian speak to you  yes as if she had any business to do so  i am sure it is not the way she would treat captain armitage  i dont believe she cares for captain armitage one bit  you said yourself that all the girls at oxford thought she cared much more for her horrid examination  i wouldnt be a dry coldhearted insensible stick like her for the world  perhaps she is the more quietly in earnest said agatha repenting a little that she had told before vera the college jokes over what had leaked out of gillians reception of ernley armitage when he had hastened up to oxford as soon as his ship was paid off and she had been called down to him in the lady principals room  report said that she had only prayed him to keep out of the way and not to upset her brain and that he had meekly obeyedas one who knew what it was to have promotion depending on it  it was a half truth exaggerated but it had not a happy effect on vera  nevertheless the finishing push of preparation brought on such a succession of violent headaches as quite to disable the really delicate boy  moreover the tutor declared that there had been little chance of his success and dr  dagger said that he had much better not try again  the best hope for his health and even for his life was to keep him at home for a few years and give him light work  he had never been the pleasantest element in the household and if his parents were glad of the avoidance of the risk of a launch into the world and his mothers love rejoiced in the power of watching over him there were others who felt his temper a continual trial while his career was a perplexity  however captain henderson offered a clerkship at the marble works subject to mr whites approval and this was gratefully accepted nor did agatha come home again at the long vacation for more than two days in which there was no time for consultation with her sisters on matters of uncertain import  miss arthuret and elizabeth merrifield had arranged together to take the old roomy farmhouse on penbeacon for three or four months and there receive parties of young women in need of rest fresh air and in some cases of classes or time for study  it was to be a sort of holiday house though not altogether of idleness and dolores undertook to be a kind of vicepresident with agatha to pursue her reading under her superintendence and to assist in helping others governesses students schoolmistresses from coalham in whose behalf indeed the scheme had been first started and it was extremely delightful to agatha among many others    chapter xixtwo weddings    how happy by my mothers side when some dear friend became a bride to shine beyond the rest i was    in gay embroidery drest vain of my draperys rich brocade i held my flowing locks to braid anstice from the greek   epidemics of marriage set in from time to time said jane mohun gillian has set the fashion  for the rock quay neighbourhood was in a state of excitement over a letter from mrs white of rocca marina announcing the approaching marriage of mr whites niece maura with lord roger grey a nephew of dear emilys husband and heir to the dukedom  the white family were coming home for the wedding and the interest entirely eclipsed that of gillian merrifields  in fact though that young lady somewhat justified the oxford stories she was in a state of much inward agitation between real love for ernley and pain in leaving home so she put on an absolutely imperturbable demeanour  her reserve and dread of comments made her so undemonstrative and repressive to her captain that there were those who doubted whether she cared for him at all or only looked on her wedding as a mediaeval maiden might have done as coming naturally a few years after she had grown up  ernley armytage knew better and so did her parents  the wedding was hurried on by captain armytages appointment to a frigate on the coast of southern america where he had to join at once in lieu of a captain invalided home and gillian accepted the arrangements which would take her to rio as much a matter of course said her aunt as if she had been a wife for ten years  her uncle mr mohun was anxious that the marriage of his sister lilys daughter should take place at the family home beechcroft  if there had been scruples chiefly founded on the largeness of the party and the trouble to mrs mohun these were forgotten in the convenience of being out of the way of rockstone gossip as well as for other reasons  i should certainly have escaped said general mohun  i have no notion of meeting that unmitigated scamp  mr white ought to be warned said jane  youll do so i suppose and much good it will be  i do not imagine that it will  it will be too charming to surpass franciska and ivinghoe but if neither you nor jasper will speak to old tom i shall deliver my conscience to ada  and be advised to mind your own business  nevertheless jane mohun did deliver her conscience when on the day after the arrival there had been loud lamentations over the intended absence of the merrifield family  it would have looked well to make it a double wedding all in the family said mr white  to which miss mohun only answered by a silence which mrs white was unwilling to break but maura exclaimed   but i thought valetta would be sure to be my bridesmaid  such friends as we were at the high school  it did not strike miss mohun that the friendship had been very close or very beneficial but adeline added we thought she would pair so well with vera prescott and then uncle will give all the dresses white silk with cerise trimmings  we ordered them in paris  uncle tom is so generous said maura  there is no end to his kindness  ill go and unpack some of the patterns that miss mohun may see them  she tripped out of the room and jane exclaimed poor child  has emily written to you ada  yes rather stiffly  mr white thinks it aristocratic pride  ada you know it is not that  well i suppose the greys are hardly gratified by the connection though mr white will make it worth their while  you see the duke leaves everything in his power to his daughters so poor roger will be very badly off  but  there was so much expressed in that but that adeline began to answer one of the sentiments she supposed it to convey  he can do it easilyfor all the rest are provided for by the marble works except the two eldest brothers  richard has gone away and alexis oh you know he has notions of his own that mr white does not like  does mr white know all about lord roger or why the duke should cut him off as far as possible  my dear jane it is not charitable to bring things up against young mens follies  it is a pretty considerable folly to have done what compelled him to retire  reginald was called in at the inquiry and knows all about it  but that was ages ago and he has been quite distinguished in the turkish army  yes and i also know that english gentlemen have associated with him as little as possible  i should call it a fatal thing to let maura marry him  what does captain henderson say  mr white thinks that it is all jealousy  and really jenny i do not in the least believe that he will make her unhappy  he is old enough to have quite outgrown all his wild ways and he has quite gentlemanly manners and ways  besides maura likes him and is quite bent upon it  still there was a dissatisfied look on janes face and adeline went on answering it with tears in her eyes  my dear jane i know what you would say and what reginald and all the rest feel that it is not what we should like  but my dear dont let the whole family rise up in arms  it would be of no use only make it painful for me maura is quite bent upon it and she has arrived at turning her uncle round her finger so much that i am sometimes hardly mistress of the house  oh i dont tell any one not lily nor any one but it will really be a relief to me when she is gone with her greek coaxing ways  her uncle is wrapped up in her and so proud of her being a duchess that he would condone anything  indeed i am always afraid of her putting it into his head to suppose that her disappointment about ivinghoe was in any way owing to my family pride  jane was sorry for adeline and able to perceive how the wifely feelings which she had taken on herself by choosing a man of inferior breeding and nature clashed with her hereditary character and principles  you are absolutely relieved that the beechcroft wedding takes all of us out of the way naturally and without offence she said so kindly that ada laid her head on her sisterly shoulder and allowed herself to shed a few tears  yes yes she said i am glad to have so good a reason to mention only i do hope jasper will not object to valettas coming back to be bridesmaid  that would really be a blow and give offence and it would make difficulties with otherseven james henderson who swears by jasper  i have often wished they would have done as i advised and have had this wedding at rocca marina out of the way of everybody  i sometimes think it will be the death of me  do come home to help me through it  she spoke so like the ada of old that it went to janes heart  she promised that she would return in time to give the very substantial assistance in which all believed and the more sentimental support in which nobody believed though her distaste arose tenfold after seeing the bridegroom who looked like an old satyr all the more because maura was like a greek nymph  mrs henderson was much grieved and had tried remonstrance with her sister but found her quite impervious  glad were all the merrifields to escape to the quiet atmosphere of beechcroft where the relations were able to congregate between the court the vicarage and the moredistant rotherwood and the wedding was an ideal one in ecclesiastical beauty and the festivities of those who had known and loved lady merrifield as miss lily in early youth grandmothers who had been her schoolchildren and were pleased to hear that she was a grandmother herself and hoped in a year or two to welcome her grandchildren  alethea and her little somervilles she had seen en route to canada and phyllis was to come in due time when bernard underwood could be spared from the bank in colombo and they would bring their little pair  in the matter of bridesmaids gillian certainly had the advantage for she was amply provided with sisters and cousins dolores coming for a few days for the wedding whereas the six whom maura had provided for beforehand in paris were only as miss jane said scraped up with difficulty from former schoolfellows  lord rogers nieces would not hear of being present  paulina was unwillingly pressed into the service as well as the more willing vera but mysie merrifield was not to be persuaded to give up her visit to lady phyllis and aunt jane could only carry home valetta who held the whole as capital fun and liked the acquisition of the white silk and lace and cerise ribbons  dolores had negotiated that no 6 of the vanderkist girls should spend a year with miss mohun for a final polish at the high school at rock quay so as to be with her brother adrian who was completing his term at the preparatory school before his launch at winchester  wilfred also returned father and uncle having decided that he did not merit a game licence nor to attack the partridges of beechcroft and the prospect of the gaieties of cliffe house consoled him  adeline had to endure her husbands mortification at other disappointments  the ducal family was wholly unrepresented  even emily the connecting link would not venture on the journey and the clerical nephew was not sufficiently gratified by lord rogers intention to se ranger to undertake to officiate and a bishop who had enjoyed the hospitality of rocca marina proved to have other engagements  no clergyman could be imported except mauras brother alexis who had been two years at work at coalham under mr richard burnet and had just been appointed by the newlychosen bishop of onomootka and both were to go out with him as chaplains  in the meantime while the bishop was preparing by tours in england alexis undertook the duties of mr flights curate rejoicing in the opportunity of seeing his elder sister and the old friends with whom he had never been since his unlucky troubles with gillian merrifield now no more  the delight of receiving him compensated to kalliope henderson for much that was distressing to both in mauras choice  the seven years that had passed had made him into a noblelooking man with a handsome classical countenance lighted up by earnestness and devotion a fine voice and much musical skill together with a bright attractive manner that all unconsciously on his part had turned the heads of half the young womanhood of coalham and soon had the same effect at rock quay  vera and paulina were in a state of much excitement over their white silks in which the three other sisters took great pleasure in arraying them and thekla only wished that hubert could see them she should send him out a photograph buying it herself with her own money  she was of course to see the wedding in her sunday white and broad pink sash of the appropriateness of which she was satisfied when at beechcroft they met miss mohuns young friend miss vanderkist in the same garb  she and her brother had been put under magdalens protection as miss mohun was too much wanted at cliffe house to look after them but sir adrian a big boy of twelve wanted to go his own way and only handed her over with hallo miss prescott youll look after this pussycat of ours while aunt jane is dosing aunt ada with salts and sal volatile  sheill introduce you  miss prescott miss felicia vanderkist  she wants to be looked after she is a little kitten that has never seen anything  im off to martins  the stranger did look very shy  she was a slight creature not yet seventeen with an abundant mass of long golden silk hair tied loosely and a very lovely face and complexion so small that she was a miniature edition of lady ivinghoe  her name was wilmet felicia but the latter half had been always used in the family and there was something in the kitten grace that suited the arbitrary contractions well  in fact jane mohun had been rather startled to find that she had the charge of such a little beauty when she saw how people turned around at the station to look certainly not at valetta who was a dark bright damsel of no special mark  at church however every one was in much too anxious a state to gaze at the coming procession to have any eyes to spare for a childish girl in a quiet white frock  st andrews had never seen such a crowded congregation for it was a wedding after mr whites own heart in which nobody dared to interfere not even his wife whatever her good taste might think  so the church was filled and more than filled by all who considered a wedding as legitimate gape seed and themselves as not bound to fit behaviour in church  on such an occasion magdalen being a regular attendant and connected with the bridesmaids was marshalled by a churchwarden into a reserved seat but there they were dismayed by the voices and the scrambling behind them which in the long waiting the vicar from the vestry vainly tried to subdue by severe looks and felicia whose notions of wedding behaviour were moulded on vale lecton and beechcroft looked as if she thought she had got into the house of duessa amid all prides procession as in the prints in the large volumed faerie queene  and when on the sounds of an arrival the bridegroom stood forth the resemblance to sans foy was only too striking while the party swept up the church the bride in the glories of cobweb veil white satin c becomingly drooping on her uncles arm while he beamed forth expansive in figure and countenance with delight  little jasper henderson anxious and patronising to his tiny brother alexis both in white pages dresses picked out with cerise did his best to support the endless glistening train  the bridesmaids costumes taxed the descriptive powers of the milliners in splendour and were scarcely eclipsed by the rich brocade and lace of mrs white as she sailed in on captain hendersons arm but her elaborate veil and feathery bonnet hardly concealed the weary tedium of her face though to the shame well nigh horror of her sister she was rouged  i must i must she said he would be vexed if i looked pale  it was true that he loved her heartily and that he put all the world at her service but she had learnt where he must not be offended and was on her guard  hers had been the last wedding that jane had attended in st andrews  did she repent was janes thought  no probably not  she had the outward luxuries she had craved for and her husband was essentially a good man though not of the caste to which her instincts belongedvery superior in nature and conscience to him to whom his blinded vanity was now giving his beautiful niece a willing sacrifice  it was over  more indecorous whispering and thronging and the procession came down the aisle to be greeted outside by a hail of confetti and rice the schoolboys profiting by the dinner interval and headed by adrian had jostled themselves into the foreground and they ran headlong to the portico of cliffe house to renew the shower  and there unluckily mr white recognised the boy and pleased to have anything with a title to show turned him round to the bridegroom with here lord roger let me introduce a guest sir adrian vanderkist  ha i didnt know poor van had left a son  i knew your father my boy  where was it i saw him last  poor old chap  you must come in to taste the cake my boy began mr white  thank you mr white i must get back to edgars  late already the others are off  not a holiday  for shame  hell excuse you  ill send a note down to say you must stay to drink the health of your fathers old friend  those words settled the matter with adrian  the holiday was enticing and might have overpowered the chances of a scholarship for which he was working but he had begun to know that there were perplexities from which it was safer to retreat and that he had never transgressed his uncle clements warning might be read in the clear open face that showed already the benefits not only of discipline but of selfcontrol  so obedience answered the question though as he again thanked and refused he looked so dogged as he turned and walked off that ethel varney whispered to vera that at school he was called the dutchman if not the boer  nor did he ever mention the temptation or his own resistance  only mr white asked miss mohun to bring him to the dance which was to be given in the evening telling her of his refusal of the invitation to wedding cake and champagne and shemindful of her duty to her charge as hinted by clement underwoodhad not granted the honour of his presence on the score of his school obligations  the afternoon was spent in desultory wanderings about the gardens magdalen and her sisters being invited guests and vera in a continual state of agitated expectation  had not wilfred merrifield always been a cavalier of her own  and here he was paying no attention to her with all the embellishment of her bridesmaids adornments and squiring instead that little insignificant felicia in a simple hat and hair still on her shoulders whilst she had to put up with nothing better than a young varney who was very shy and had never probably mastered croquet  she was an illused mortal and why had she not hubert to show how superior she was to them all in having a piece of property of her own to show off  there was paula too playing animated tennis with that clerical brother of the bride who had been talking to magdalen about the frescoes of st kenelms as if she vera had not the greatest right to know all about those frescoes  even little thekla was better off for she was reigning over a merry party of the little ones which had been got up for the benefit of the small hendersons and of which theodore white had constituted himself the leader being a young man passionately devoted to little children  so when the guests dispersed to eat their dinner at their homes and dress for the dance vera was extremely cross  each of the other three had some delightful experiences to talk over but whether it was mr theodores fun in acting ogre behind the great aloe or mr alexiss achievements with the croquet ball or his information about the red indians and onomootka she was equally ungracious to all she scolded thekla for crumpling her skirt and was quite sure that paula had on the wrong fichu that was meant for her  each bridesmaid had been presented with a bracelet like a snake with ruby eyes but vera fingering hers with fidgeting petulance seemed to have managed to loosen the clasp and when arranging her dress for the evening thought that her snake had escaped  upstairs and downstairs she rushed in hopes of finding it  the cab in which they had returned was gone home to come again and there was the chance that it might be there or in the cliffe house gardens and then the others tried to console her but they were not able to hinder a violent burst of crying which scandalised thekla  i am sure you couldnt cry more if you had lost huberts and that would be something worth crying about  huberts was an ingeniously worked circle of scales of californian gold the first ornament that vera had ever possessed and that all the sisters had set great store by  but with an outcry of joy vera exclaimed heres the snake all safe  i pushed the other up my arm because it looked so plain and dull and it was that which came off  that is a great deal worse than losing the snake said thekla  he has a nasty face and i dont like him with his red eyes  dont be silly returned vera this is a great deal more valuable  surely the value is in the giver said paula to which vera returned in the same vein dont be silly and sentimental polly  she was so much cheered by the recovery of the snake that they brought her off to the evening dance without a fresh fit of ill humour and she sprang out under the portico of cliffe house with her spirits raised to expectation pitch  but disappointment was in store for her  it was not disappointment in other eyes  paula had all the attention she expected or desired she danced almost every time and did not reckon greatly on who might be her partner  what pleased and honoured her most was being asked to dance by captain henderson himself  what was it to vera however that partners came to her young men of rock quay whom she knew already and did not care about  and she never once had the pleasure of saying that she was keeping the next dance for wilfred merrifield  to her perceptions he was always figuring away with felicia vanderkist her golden hair seemed always gleaming with him and though this was not always the case as the nephew of the house was one of those who had duties to guests and was not allowed by his aunts to be remiss yet whenever he was not ordered about by them he was sure to be found by felicias side  veras one consolation was that alexis white took her to supper  to be sure he was a clergyman and had stood talking to lady flight half the time and his conversation turned at once to hubert delrios frescoes but then he was very handsome and graceful in manner and he sympathised with her on the loss of her bracelet and promised to have a search for it by daylight in the gardens    chapter xxfleeting    and variable as the shade by the light quivering aspen made  scott   the bracelet came to light in the gardens of cliffe house the next morning and alexis white walked over to the goyle to return it safely little guessing when he set forth to enjoy the sight of the purple moors and to renew old recollections what a flutter of gratified vanity would be excited in one silly little breast though he only stayed ten minutes and casually asked whether the sisters were coming to lady flights garden party  everybody was going there  miss mohun even took felicia as it was on a saturdays holiday and unwittingly she renewed all the agitation caused by wilfreds admiration and that of others to the allunconscious girl  vera could no longer think herself the reigning belle of rock quay though she talked of felicia as a schoolgirl or a baby or a horrid little forward chit  her excitement was however divided between wilfred and mr alexis white who could not look in her direction without putting her in a state of eagerness  in this however she was not alone  half the ladies were interested about him his manners were charming his voice in church beautiful and his destination as chaplain to a missionary bishop made him doubly interesting while he himself even though his mind was set on higher things was really enjoying his brief holiday and his sister mrs henderson was delighted to promote his pleasure and garden parties and the like flourished as long as weather permitted and as vera was a champion player she was sure to be asked to the tournaments and to have to practise for them  inopportunely there arrived a letter from hubert requiring an answer about the form of ornament in the moulding of the fourteenth century paula dutifully went to the library looked out and traced two or three examples french and english  nothing remained but for vera to write the letter after the early dinner  however she went to sleep in a hammock and only roused herself to recollect that there was to be tea and lawn tennis at carrara  wont you just write to hubert first  oh bother how can i now  dont worry so  but flapsy he really needs it without loss of time  im sure he has no right to make me his clerk in that horrid peremptory way as if one had nothing else to do but wait on his fads  flapsy how can you broke out even thekla  surely it is the greatest honour said paula  well do it yourself then im not going to be bothered for ever  thekla went off in great indignation to beg sister to speak to flapsy and beg her not to use dear hubert so very very badly which of course magdalen refused to do and thekla had her first lesson on the futility of interfering with engaged folk paula meanwhile sent off the despatch with one line to say that vera was too busy to write that day  there had been two or three letters from hubert over which vera had looked cross but had said nothing and at last she came down from her own room and announced passionately there  i have done with mr hubert delrio and have written to tell him so  vera what have you done  written to tell him i have no notion of a man being so tiresome and dictatorial  i dont want a schoolmaster to lecture me and expect me to drudge over his work as if i was his clerk  my dear said magdalen have you had a letter that vexed you  had you not better wait a little to think it over  no  nonsense maidie  he has been provoking ever so long and i wont bear it any longer and she flounced into a chair  provoking  hubert was all paulina could utter in her amazement and horror  oh i daresay you would like it well enough  always at me to slave for him with stupid architectural drawings and stuff as if i was only a sort of clerk or fag  and boring me to read great dull books and preaching to me about them expecting to know what i think  dear me  those nice letters sighed paula  nice  as if any one that was one bit in love would write such as that  no i dont want to marry a schoolmaster or a tyrant  how can you flapsy went on paula so vehemently that magdalen left the defence thus far to her when he only wishes for your sympathy and improvement  the worst plea she could have used thought the elder sister as vera broke out with improvement indeed  if he cared for me he would not think i wanted any improving  but he never did  or he would have taken pratt and povis offer and i should have been living in london and keeping my carriage  or he would have taken me to italy but that horrid home of his and his mother just like a halfstarved hare  i might have seen then it was not fit for me but i was a child and overpersuaded among you all  but i know better now and i know my own mind as i didnt then  so you need not talk  i have done with him  oh flapsy flapsy how can you grieve him so  you dont know what you are throwing away incoherently cried paula collapsing in a burst of tears  maidie maidie why dont you speak to her and tell her how wicked it isandandand  the rest was cut short by sobs  no paula authority or reasoning of mine would not touch such a mood as this  we must leave it to hubert himself  if she really cares for him she will have recovered from her fit of temper by the time his letter can come and it may have an effect upon her if our tongues have not increased her spirit of opposition  i strongly advise you to say nothing  paula tried to take her sisters advice and would have adhered to it but that vera would talk and try to make her declare the rupture to have been justified and this produced an amount of wrangling which did good to no one  magdalen really rejoiced when the frequent golf and tennis parties carried vera on her bicycle out of reach of arguing even if it took her into the alternative of flirtation  thekla cried bitterly and declared that she should never speak to flapsy again but in half an hours time was heard chattering about the hedgehogs meal of cockroaches  in another week the excitement was over  the bishop of onomootka had come and gone after holding meetings and preaching sermons at rock quay and all the villages round and had carried off alexis white with him  nothing had come of the intercourse of the latter with his rich uncle nor of the varieties of encounters with the damsels of rock quay except that society was declared by more than one to have become horridly flat and slow  vera was one of these and the letters received from hubert delrio did not stir up a fresh excitement  there were no persuasions to revoke her decision no urgent entreaties no declaration of being heartbroken  he acquiesced in her assurance that the engagement had been a mistake and he wrote at more length to magdalen avowing that he had for some time past traced discontent in veras letters and fearing that he had been too didactic and peremptory in writing to her  he relinquished the engagement with much regret and should always regard it as having been a fair summer dreambut though undeserving he hoped still to retain miss prescotts kindness and friendship which had been of untold value to him  a little more zeal and distress would have been much more pleasing to vera and she began to be what agatha and thekla called cross and paula called drooping and even excited alarm in her lest flapsy should be going into a decline  but a note came to the goyle which magdalen read alone and likewise she cycled alone to rockstone  miss mohun can you give me a few minutes said she as the trim little figure emerged from beneath the copper beeches basket in hand  by all means i shall not be due at the cuttingout meeting till three oclock  i wanted to consult you about an invitation that mrs white has been so very kind as to give my little sister vera  oh quoth jane mohun in a dry sort of tone  i know that she had wished to take out one of her own nieces to rocca marina but that sir jasper did not wish it and i thought perhaps it would be easier for you than for lady merrifield to tell me whether there is any objection that would apply to vera  i suppose vera wishes to go  she is so wild with delight that it would be a serious thing to disappoint her  mrs white is very kind and good and has thought that she has flagged of late and has supposed it might be due to poor hubert delrio but indeed it was no fault of his  none at all except for outgrowing her  the offer was hinted at to go with valetta even before we knew it was declined at clipstone and that made me anxious to know whether it would be well for me to send vera  i suppose she would pick up pronunciation of languages which would be a great advantage as she will have to earn her own living and mrs white is so good as to promise lessons in arts and music  i hear too it is quite an english colony with a church and schools  oh yes mr white is a very good and careful man about his workmen i have been there at the hendersons wedding and it is a charming place a castle fit for mrs radclyffe with english comforts and an italian garden and an english village on the mountain side  my sister would do all that she promises and would look after any young girl very well you may quite trust her  then is there any fear of italian societynot that poor vera has any attraction of that kind hesitated magdalen  none at all  all the society they have is of english travellers coming with introductions  i fancy it is very dull at times and that adeline wants a young person about her  you need have no fears ah  i see you still want to know why the merrifields dont consent it is not their way  they would not let the rotherwoods have mysie to bring up with phyllis andand val is just the being that needs a mothers eye over her  but i really and honestly think that your vera may quite safely be put under adelines care and that she is likely to be all the better for it  one thing more added magdalen with a little hesitation is your nephew wilfred likely to be one of the party  none at all  his father wants to keep him under his own eye and his mother is anxious about his health nor do i think mr white wants him having his own two nephews who are useful so he will remain under captain henderson here  thank you  that settles it in my mind  i am sure the change to a fresh home will be an excellent thing for my poor vera and that the training of imitation of one to whom she looks up is what she most needs  very true said miss mohun  and as she afterwards said to lady merrifield it was in all sincerity and honesty that i gave the advice to magdalen who is very sensible in the matter  in plain english ada cant do without a lady in waiting and vera probably fancies that lords young or old start from every wave like the spirits of our fathers at rocca marina in which she will probably be disappointed but ada will be a very dragon as to her manners and discretion and not being his own niece old tom white will not be deluded by his ambition and any blandishments of hers  as people go they are very safe guardians and veraflapsy as they call heris just of the composition to be improved and not disimproved by living with ada  probably though i do not like the foolish little puss to be rewarded for throwing over young delrio  he was so much too good for her that i am more inclined to reward her for doing so  agatha however came home somewhat annoyed by the whole arrangement she supposed the rupture with hubert might have been inevitable but she was very sorry for it thinking that vera might have grown up to him and regretting the losing him as a brother  nor did she like the atmosphere of the whites and rocca marina for her featherbrained young sister  dolores had no great opinion of her aunt adeline she said  my dear said magdalen as they sat over their early fire i have talked it over with lady merrifield and miss mohun and they both tell me that mrs white is very sensible and sure to be discreet for any girl in her chargeprobably better for flapsy than a more intellectual woman  but  such a marriage as this one said agatha  it was mr whites own niece and taken out of mrs whites hands said magdalen  besides as agatha still looked unconvinced one thing that made me think the invitation desirable was that it would break off any foolishness with wilfred merrifieldi think it was in their minds too  wilfred  oh there was a little nonsense  less on his side since felicia vanderkist has been here but i think vera has been all the more disposed toto  run after him said agatha  i could fancy it in flapsy but he is such a boy and not half so nicelooking as the rest of them either  my dear agatha i must tell you he reminds me strangely of a young mr merrifield whom i knew at filsted when i was younger than you  a brother of bessie  even so  he got into some kind of trouble at filsted his father came and broke it off and sent him out to canada where i fear he did not do well and nothing has been heard of him since except   she spoke with a catch in her voice which made agatha look up at her and detect a rising colour  nothing she repeated  except an anonymous parcel returning to the brothers in canada the sum he had taken with him  strangely the clue was not followed up and he is lost sight of  but wilfreds air and still more his manner is always recalling his cousin to me and nag dear i could not bear to see vera go through the same trial by my exposing her to the intercourse  not that i know any harm of wilfred but his parents could not like anything of the kind  certainly not  yes i suppose you are right dear old maidie  but agatha pondered over those words that had slipped out the same trial    chapter xxithe electricians       thou shalt have the air of freedom  follow and do me service  the tempest  is agatha in asked dolores mohun jumping off her bicycle as she saw magdalen on a frosty day the next christmas vacation in her garden  she is doing scientific arithmetic with thekla giving me a holiday in fact  you university maidens quite take the shine out of us poor old teachers  ah if we can give shine we cant give substance  but i want to borrow nag if you have no objection  borrow her i am sure it is something she will like  it is in the way of business but she will like it all the same they want me to give a course of lectures on electricity at bexley to the institute and the two high schools and i particularly want a skilled assistant whom i can depend upon not masters nor boys now nag is just what i should like  we should stay at lancelot underwoods a very charming place to be at  isnt he some connection  connection all round  phyllis merrifield married his brother banking in ceylon and may come home any day on a visit and ivinghoes pretty wife is lancelots niece  he edits what is really the crack newspaper of the county in spite of its being true blue conservative church and all  the pursuivant  it has such good literary articles  oh yes  mrs grinstead and canon harewood write them  his wife is a daughter of old dr mayrather a peculiar person but very jolly in her way  but would they like to have agatha imposed upon them  certainly they are just the people to like nothing better and it will only be for a fortnight  i have settled it all with them  at which magdalen looked a little doubtful but dolores reiterated that there need be no scruple she might ask aunt lily if she liked but lance underwood was mayor and member of all the committees and the most openhearted man in the world besides and it was all right  to the further demur as to safety dolores answered that to light a candle or sit by the fire might be dangerous but as long as people were careful it was all right and agatha had already assisted in some experiments at rock quay which had shown her to be thoroughly understanding and trustworthy and capable of keeping off the amateurthe great bugbear  so magdalen consented after rapturous desires on the part of agatha and assurances from general mohun that dolores had it in her by inheritance and by training to meddle with the lightning as safely as human being might and lady merrifield owned with a sigh that she must accept as a fact that what even the heathens owned as a divine mystery and awful attribute had come to be treated as a commonplace business messenger and scientific toy though as mrs gatty puts it the mystery had only gone deeper  so much for the peril and for the other scruple it was set at rest by a hospitable letter from mrs underwood heartily inviting miss agatha prescott as an oxford friend of gillian  so off the two electricians set and after two days of business and sightseeing in london went down to bexley  in the thirdclass carriage in which they travelled they were struck by the sight of a tall lady in mourninga sort of compromise between a conventual and a secular bonnet over short fair hair and holding on her lap a tiny little girl of about six years old with a small pinched delicate face and slightly red hair to whom she pointed out by name each spot they passed herself wearing an earnest absorbed look of recognition as she pointed out familiar landmark after landmark till the darkness came down  also there were two cagesone with a small pink cockatoo and another with two budgerigars  as the train began slackening dolores exclaimed  there he is  lance  lance  oh lance was echoed and setting the child down her companion almost fell across agatha and was at the window as the train stopped  what happened in the next moment no one could quite tell but as the door was torn open there was a mingled cry of angel and of lance and the traveller was in his arms turning the next moment to lift out the frightened little girl who clung tight round her neck while lance held out his hand with dolores  yes  this is dolores angel whom you have never seen  each knew who the other was in a moment and clasped hands in greeting as well as they could with the one and the other receiving birdcages handbags umbrellas and rugs from agatha whom however lance relieved of them with a courteous miss prescott  you have come in for the arrival of my australian sister  what luggage have you  wherewith all was absorbed in the recognition of boxes and therewith a word or two to an old railway official my sister angela  miss angela this is an unexpected pleasure  tom lightfoot is it you  you are not much altered  mr dane i should have known you anywhere with corresponding shakes of the hand  yes thats ours  oh the birds  there they are  all right  oh not the omnibus lance  let the traps go in that  then lena will like to stretch her legs and i must revel in the old street  dolores and agatha felt it advisable to squeeze themselves with the birdcages into the omnibus and leave the brother and sister to walk down together though the little girl still adhered closely to her protectors hand  poor fields little one  yes of course  but tell me tell me of them all  all well all right  but how  the mozambique was out of coal and had to put in at falmouth  you know i came by her because they said the long sea voyage would be best for this child and it was so long since i had heard of any one that i durst not send anywhere till i knewand i knew froggatts would be in its own place  oh theres the new hotel the gas looks just the same  theres the tower of st oswalds all shadowy against the sky  look lena  oh this is home  i know the lamps ive dreamt of them  tired lena dear cold  shall i carry you  no no let me and he lifted her up not unwillingly on her part though she did not speak  you are a light weight he said  i am afraid so answered angel  oh theres the bus stopping at mr pratts door  mine now  we have annexed it  but let me go in by the dear old shop  the window is as of old i see  ernest lamb dont you know me as a respectable tradesman came forward  and achille is it  you are as much changed as this old shop is transmogrified  and they are all well  do you mean bernard  bernard and phyllis may come home any day to deposit a child  they lost their boy and hope to save the elder one  but come angel if you have taken in enough we must go up to those electrical girls dolores is come to give a lecture with the other girl to assist miss prescott  dolores  yes poor geralds love  they are almost myths to me ah as lancelot opened his officedoor now i know where i am  and theres the old staircase  this is the real thing and no mistake  angel angel come to tea  and gertrude comfortable and substantial in loving greeting threw arms round the new comers lance still carrying the child who clung round his neck as he brought her into the room full of his late fellow travellers and also of a group of children  it is as if we had gone back thirty years or more was angelas cry as she looked forth on what had been as little altered as possible from the old family centre and lance setting down the child spoke as the pretty little blueeyed girls advanced to exchange kisses with their new aunt  margaret or pearl whom you knew as a baby etheldred or awdrey and dickie  fely is at marlborough  there take little lenais that her nameto your table and give her some tea  her name is magdalen said angela removing the little black hat and smoothing the hair but lena backed against her and let her hand hang limp in pearls patronising clasp  nor would she amalgamate with the children nor even eat or drink except still beside sister as she called angela  in fact she was so thoroughly worn out and tired as well as shy and frightened that angelas attention was wholly given to her and she could only be put to bed but not in the nursery which as angel said seemed to her like a den of little wild beasts  so she was deposited in the chamber and bed hastily prepared for the unexpected guest and even there being wakeful and feverish from overfatigue there was no leaving her alone and gertrude after seeing her safely installed could only go down with the hope that she would be able to spare her slave or nurse which was it by dinnertime  who is that child so like said dolores in their own room  very like somebody but i cant tell whom said agatha  who did you say she is  i cannot say i exactly know said dolores  i believe she is the daughter of fulbert underwoods mate on a sheepfarm in queensland and that as her mother died when she was born she has been always under the care of this angela living in the sisterhood there  not a sister  not under vows certainly  i never saw her before but i believe she is rather a funny flighty person and that fulbert was afraid at one time that she would marry this childs father  is he alive  which  fulbert died four or five years ago and i think the little girls father must be dead for she is in mourning  theres something very charming about hermiss underwood  yes there is  they all seem to be very fond of her and yet to laugh about her and never to be quite sure what she will do next  did i not hear of her being so useful among the australian black women  no one has ever managed those very queer gins so well and she is an admirable nurse too they say  i am very glad to have come in her way  they did not however see much of her that evening  the head master of the grammar school and his wife the head mistress of the high school and a few others had been invited to meet them and angela could only just appear at dinner trusting to a slumber of her charge but on coming out of the diningroom a wail summoned her upstairs at once and she was seen no more that night  however with morning freshness lena showed herself much less farouche and willing to accept the attentions of mr underwood first and later of his little daughter pearla gentle elder sisterly person who knew how to avert the too rough advances of dickand made warm friends over the pink cockatoo while awdrey was entranced by the beauties of the budgerigars  robina had been informed by telegram and came up from minsterham with her husband looking just like his own father and grown very broad  he was greatly interested in the lecture and went off to it to consider whether it would be desirable for the choristers school lancelot had of course to go and angela declared that she must be brought up to date and rejoiced that lena was able to submit to be left with the other children under the protection of mrs underwood who averred that she abhorred electricity in all its forms and that if lance were induced to light the town or even the shop by that means he must begin by disposing of her by a shock  it was an excellent lecture only the two sisters hardly heard it they could think of nothing but that they were once more sitting side by side in the old hall where they had heard and shared in so many concerts on the gala days of their home life  the two lecturers as well as the rest of the party were urgently entreated to stay to tea at the high school but when the interest of the new arrival was explained the sisters and brother were released to go home canon harewood remaining to content their hostesses    chapter xxiiangel and bear    enough of science and of art    close up those barren leaves come forth and bring with you a heart    that watches and receives  wordsworth  a telegram had been handed to mr mayor which he kept to himself smiling over it and heat leastwas not taken utterly by surprise at the sight of a tall handsome man who stepped forward with something like a shout  angel  lance  why is it robin too  bear bear old bear how did you come  i couldnt stop when i heard at clipstone that angel was here so i left phyllis and the kid with her mother  oh angel angel to meet at bexley after all  they clung together almost as they had done when they were the riotous elements of the household while lance opened the front door and robina mindful of appearances impelled them into the hall bernard exclaiming pratts room  whose teeth is it  dont you want wilmet to hold your hands and make you open your mouth said lance laughing  gertrude who had already received the indian arrival met angela who was bounding up to see to her charge with not come in yet she is gone out with the children quite happily with awdreys doll in her arms  come and enjoy each other in peace  in the office please said angela  that is home  we shall be our four old selves  lance opened the office door and gave a hint to mr lamb while they looked at each other by the fire  bernard was by far the most altered  the others were slightly changed but still their old selves while he was a grave responsible man looking older than lancelot partly from the effects of climate but angela saw enough to make her exclaim here we are dont you feel as if we were had down to felix to be blown up  not a bit altered said bernard looking at the desks and shelves of ledgers with the photographs over the mantelpiecefelix mr froggatt the old foreman and a print of garofalos vision of st augustine hung up long ago by felix as lance explained as a token of the faith to which all human science and learning should be subordinated  a declaration of the pursuivant said angela  how fulbert did look out for pur  i believe it was his only literature  phyllis declares said bernard that nothing so upsets me as a failure in purs arrival  and this is purs heart and centre said robina  only added angela i miss the smell of burnt clay that used to pervade the place and that alda so hated  happily the clay is used up said lance  i could not have brought gertrude and the children here if the ceramic art as they call it had not departed  cherry was so delighted at our coming to live here  she loved the old struggling days  fulbert said he never felt as if he had been at home till he came here  he never took to vale leston  clement and cherry have settled in very happily said robina with convalescent clergy in the vicarage  i say angel let us have a run over there cried bernard you and i together for a bit of mischief  do do let us  though this is real home our first waking to perception and naughtiness it is more than vale leston  we seem to have been up in a balloon all those five happy years  a balloon said bernard  nay it seems to me that till they were over i never thought at all except how to get the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life  it seems to me that i had about as much sense as a green monkey  something sank in though said lance you did not drift off like poor edgar  some one must have done so said angela  i wanted to ask you lancey about advertising for my little lenas people the bishop said i ought  i say exclaimed bernard was it her father that was fulberts mate  i thought he was afraid of your taking up with him  you didnt  no no  let me tell you i want you to know  field and a little wife came over from melbourne prospecting for a place to sit down in they had capital but the poor wife was worn out and ill and after taking them in for a night fulbert liked them  field was an educated man and a gentleman and ful offered them to stay there in partnership  so they stayed and by and by this child was born and the poor mother died  the two great bearded men came galloping over to albertstown from carrigaboola with this new born baby smaller than even theodore was and i had the care of her from the very first and field used to ride over and see the little thing  and said bernard in a rather teasing voice as his eyes actually looked at angelas left hand  ill own it did tempt me  i had had some great disappointments with my native women running wild again and i could not bear my child having a horrid stepmother and there was the glorious free bush life and the horses and the sheep  but then i thought of you all saying angel had broken out again and by and by fulbert came and told me that he was sure there was some ugly mystery and spoke to mother constance and they made me promise not to take him unless it was cleared up  then as you know dear fuls horse fell with him field came and fetched me to their hut and i was there to the last ful told each of us again that all must be plain and explained before we thought of anything in the future  he henry field said he had great hopes that he should be able to set it right  then as you know there was no saving dear fulbert and after that mother constances illness began  oh bear do you recollect her coming in and mothering us in the little sittingroom  i could not stir from her of course while she was with us  and after that harry field came and said he had written a letter to england and when the answer came he would tell me all and i should judge  but i dont think the answer ever did come and he went to brisbane to see if it was at the bank and there he caught a delirious fever and there was an end of it  at that moment something between a whine or a call of sister was heard  up leapt angela and hurried away while lance observed well  thats averted but i am sorry for her  it was not love said robina  or only for the child said bernard and that would have been a dangerous speculation  the child or something else has been very good for her said lance i never saw her so gentle and quiet  and with the same charm about her as ever said bernard  i dont wonder that all the fellows fall in love with her  i hope she wont make havoc among clements sick clergy  i suppose we ought to go up and fulfil the duties of society said robina rising  but first bear tell me how is phyllis  pretty fair he answered  resting with her mother but she has never been quite the thing of late  i almost hope sir ferdinand will see his way to keeping us at home or we shall have to leave our little lily  interruption occurred as a necessary summons to mr mayor and the paternal conclave was broken up and had to adjourn to gertrudes tea in the old sittingroom  i see exclaimed agatha as she looked at the party of children at their supplementary table  i see what the likeness is in that child  dont you dolores  is it not to wilfred merrifield  there is very apt to be a likeness between sandy people begging your pardon angel said gertrude  yes the carroty strain is apt to crop up in families said lance like golden tabbies as you ladies call your stable cats  all the mohuns are dark said dolores and all aunt lilys children except wilfred and is not your phyllis of that colour  phylliss hair is not red but dark auburn said bernard in a tone like offence  i never saw phyllis said darkbrowed dolores but i have heard the aunts talk over the source of thethe fair variety and trace it to the merrifields  uncle jasper is brown and so is bessie but susan is to put it politely just a golden tabby and davids baby promises to be to her great delight as she says he will be a real merrifield  so much for family feeling  sister sister came in a bright tone may i go with pearl and get a stick for ben  he wants something to play with  he is eating his perch  ben it appeared was the pink cockatoo who was biting his perch with his hooked beak  the children had finished their meal and consent was given  only lena come here said angela fastening a silk handkerchief round her neck and adding dont let lena go on the dew pearl she is not used to early english autumn i must get her a pair of thicker boots  what is her name asked agatha catching the sound  magdalen susanna  her father made a point of it instead of his wifes name which i think was caroline  i dont think i ever knew a magdalen except my own elder sister said agatha and susanna  did you say miss merrifield had a sister susan  an excellent sobersided dear old susan  yes susanna was their mothers name said dolores and now that you have put it into my head little lena when she is animated puts me more in mind of bessie than even of wilfred though the colouring is different why  did you never hear said agatha that there was one of the brothers who was a bad lot and ran away  my sister says wilfred is like him  i believe she added that he was her romance  ha exclaimed bernard thats queer  we had a clerk in the bank who gave his name as meriton and who cut and ran the very day he heard that sir jasper merrifield was coming out as commandant  yes he was carroty  i rarely saw wilfred at clipstone but this might very well have been the fellow afraid to face his uncle  angela did not look delighted  she is not destitute you know she said i am her guardian and she will have about two hundred a year  is there a will asked lance  oh yes i have it upstairs  it is all right  it was at the bank at brisbane and they kept a copy  i brought her because the bishop said it was my duty to find out whether there were any relations  certainly said bernard  in our own case remember what joy traviss letter was  angela was silent and presently said you shall see the will when i have unpacked it but there is no doubt about my being guardian  probably not said bernard rather drily  if it be a valid will signed by his proper name said lance  whereupon the two brothers fell into a discussion on points of law not unlike the editor of the pursuivant as he had become known to his family but most unlike the bernard they had known before his departure for the east  at any rate it dissipated the emotional tone of the party and by and by when bernard and angela had agreed to make a bicycle rush to minsterham the next day that is said angela if lena is happy enough to spare me the harewoods took leave  when the children had gone to bed and angela had stayed upstairs so long that gertrude augured that she was waiting till her charge had gone to sleep and that they should have no more of her henceforth but lenas baulked stepmother she came down bringing a document with her which she displayed before her brothers  there was no question but that it was a will drawn up in due form and very short bequeathing his property at carrigaboola queensland to his daughter magdalen susanna and appointing fulbert underwood and angela margaret underwood and my brother samuel her guardian it was dated the year after his daughters birth and was signed henry field with a word interposed which as lance said might be anything but was certainly the right length for the first syllables of merrifield  bernard looked at it and declared it was to the best of his belief the same signature as his former clerk used to write  and this he said looking at the seal is the crest of the merrifieldsthe demi lion  i know it well on sir jaspers seal ring  have you nothing else angel asked lance  here is the certificate of her baptism but that will tell you nothing  no more it did it only called the child the daughter of henry and caroline field and the surname was omitted in the bequest  who was the mother asked lance  i never exactly knew  fulbert thought she had been a person whom field had met in america or somewhere and married in a hurry fulbert said she was rather pretty but she was a poor helpless bewildered thing and very poorly  he wanted to bring her to albertstown for fit help and nursing but she cried so much at the idea of either horse or wagon over thenoroads that it was put off and off and she had only his shepherds housekeeper so it was no wonder she did not live  field was dreadfully cut up and blamed himself extremely for having given way to her but it is as likely as not the journey would have been just as fatal  poor thing  you never heard her surname  no it did not signify  he did not name his child after her  no  i remember fulbert saying he supposed she should be called caroline and he exclaimed no no i always said it should be magdalen and susanna  my sisters name repeated agatha  and susan merrifield added dolores  but she is mine mine cried angela with a tone like herself of a sort of triumphant jealousy  they cant take her away from me  gently angela my dear said lance in a tone so like felix of old that it almost startled her  tell me what arrangement is this about the property  your share of fulberts has never been taken out i think  no macpherson the purchaser you know of fulberts share pays me my amount out of it and agreed to do the same by lena  i dont think the value is quite what it used to be  it rather went down under field but macpherson is all there and it has been a better season  i could sell it all to him hers and mine both but i have thought how it would be as it is her native country and i have not parted with my own to go out again to carrigaboola and bring her up there  i assure you i am up to it she added meeting an amused look  i know a good deal more about sheep farming than either of you gentlemen  i can ride anything but a buckjumper and boss the shepherds and i do love the life no stifling in fields and copses i only wish you would come too bear it would do you ever so much good to get a little red paint on those white bankers hands of yours  well done sister angel  and the brothers both burst out laughing  but really proceeded angela it is by far the best hope of keeping up christianity among those hands  fulbert had a sort of little hut for a chapel and once a month one of the clergy from albertstown came over there i used to ride with him when i could and if i were there i could keep a good deal going till the place is more peopled and we can get a cleric  it is a great opportunity not to be thrown away  i can catch those cockatoos better than a parson  and there are the blacks  the brothers had not the least doubt of it  angela was angela still for better or for worse  or was it for worse  yet she went up to bed chanting    his sister she went beyond the seas and died an old maid among black savagees    chapter xxiiiwillow widows       set your heart at rest the fairyland buys not that child of me  midsummer nights dream  an expedition to minsterham finished the visit of dolores and her faithful nag whose abilities as an assistant were highly appreciated and who came home brilliantly happy to keep her remaining holiday with magdalen while dolores repaired to clipstone bernard had been obliged to go to london to report himself to sir ferdinand travis underwood but his wife and little girl were the reigning joy at clipstone  phyllis looked very white much changed from the buxom girl who had gone out with her father two years ago she had never recovered the loss of the little boy and suffered the more from her husbands inability to bear expression and it was an immense comfort to her to speak freely of her little one to her mother  the little lilias looked frail but was healthy happy and as advanced as a welltrained companion child of six could well be and the darling of the young aunts who expected dolores to echo their raptures and declare the infinite superiority of the ceylonese to that little cornstalk as valetta said  theres no difficulty as to that said dolores laughing  the poor little cornstalk looks as if she had grown up under a blight  it is a grand romance though said mysie only i wish that cousin harry had had any constancy in him  i wonder if magdalen will adopt her was valettas bold suggestion  poor magdalen has had quite adopting enough to do said mysie  besides said dolores sister angela will never let her go  and certainly i never saw any one more taking than sister angela  she is so full of life and of a certain unexpectedness and one knows she has done such noble work  i want to see more of her  you will said mysie  mamma is going to ask her to come for phyllis says there is no one that bernard cares for so much  she was his own companion sister  magdalen might have the little cornstalk said valetta  well said mysie it is rather funny to have twowhat shall i saywillow widows and a child that is neither of theirs  how will they settle it  magdalen had heard from agatha on the first evening of the arrival of the sister and the probability of the identification of little lenas father with the henry merrifield of her former years and she was deeply touched by the bestowal of her nameso much that nag avoided saying more but only kissed her and went to bed  the merrifields discussed the subject dispassionately  sir jasper recollected what his brother had written to him of his anxieties and disappointment in his son henry and of his absconding from manitoba since which time all trace of him had been lost except in the restoration to the two brothers in canada  to the surprise and indignation of sir jasper there had been no attempt to follow it up  if my poor brother edgar had done anything of the kind said bernard none of us would have rested  so far as they could put recollections together this act of restitution must have been made soon after the connection with fulbert underwood began perhaps at the time of the wifes death  if there had been another letter as sister angela thought it was more recent certainly within the last two years  captain samuel merrifield of stokesley had been on a voyage for four years and had not long been at home  his wife had been charged with the forwarding of the letters that she thought of immediate interest and there was an accumulation of those that had been left for his return as yet not looked over  of course sir jasper impelled him to plunge into these and by and by one came to light which mrs merrifield had taken for only some australian gold mines and left to wait especially as it was directed to his father instead of himself  it was a letter full of repentance and entreaties for forgiveness describing in part poor henrys past life and adding that the best thing that had ever befallen him was his association with such a fellow as underwood  it was to be gathered that fulberts uprightness of mind had led him to the first impulse of restitution and he went on to mention his first hasty marriage and the loss of his wife with the kindness of the carrigaboola sisterhood above all of sister angela and declaring his love and admiration for her and his sense that she was the one person who could keep him straight now that her brother was gone  he had more than once offered to her but he found that her brother had solemnly charged her not to accept him till he had made all his past clear before her and could show her that he was acknowledged by his family and had his fathers forgiveness and for this he humbly craved as one deeply sensible of his own demerits  it was piteous to think of the poor fellow waiting and hoping for an answer to such a letter as this and dying without one while all the time it was lying unread in the captains desk and no one even knew of the changed life and fresh hopes  sir jasper was much moved by it but sam said ay ay poor harry always was a plausible fellow and his wife was chiefly concerned to show that the suppression was not by her fault  sir jasper had brought the will with him and the certificate of the childs baptism  both were met with a little hesitation  so little had been said in the letter about the marriage that the captain wanted to know more and also whether the will had been properly proved in australia and whether it had force in england  in that case he was surely the right person to have the custody of his brothers child  his wife who had been bred up in a different school was not by any means satisfied that she should be consigned to a member of a sisterhood  david came to stokesley saw the letter and agreed with his brother on the expediency of obtaining full proof of the validity of the will in both queensland and england and put in hand the writing of inquiries for the purpose from the legal authorities at brisbane for which purpose angela had to be consulted  she had been having left the budgerigars to the delight of pearl and awdrey in the meantime at vale leston enjoying the atmosphere of peace that prevailed wherever were clement and geraldine and hailed with delight by all her old village friends as well as lady vanderkist and her somewhat thinned flock  she won adrians heart by skating or golfing with him and even on one or two hunting days joining in his pursuit of the chase being altogether as he said ever so much better a fellow than even his youngest sister joan and entrancing them all with tales of kangaroos  lena had really a tame kangaroo at carrigaboola  oh why did they not bring it home as well as ben the polly  she quite pined for it and had tears in her eyes when it was spoken of  indeed the joyous young vanderkists were too much for the delicate little girl and sorry as angela was to leave vale leston she was not ungrateful for an invitation to the goyle where there was more room for them than at clipstone in the holidays and with the bernard underwoods making it their headquarters  lena and she were much better and happier with sister always at her service and paula and thekla were delighted to amuse her  paula was in a state of delight with sister angela only a little puzzled by the irregularity of her course though it was carefully explained that she had never been under any vows  to hear of her doings among the australian women was a romance often as there had been disappointment  paula is a born sister said angela a much truer one than i have ever been for there does not seem to be any demon of waywardness to drive her wild  these talks with magdalen often prolonged hours after the young people had gone to bed were a great solace to both the elders girls like mysie merrifield and phyllis devereux thought sitting up to converse a propensity peculiar to themselves and to their own age of new experiences and speculations but the two old girls whose experiences were not new and whose speculations had a certain material foundation they were equally fascinating  there were no small jealousies in either of themwillow widows though mysies name stuck  there was nothing but comfort to magdalen in the certainty of the ultimate coming home of one who had finished a delusive dream of her younger days and been yearned after with a heartache now quenched and angela who had never been the least in love with henry merrifield could quite afford her interest in the scanty records of his younger days and fill up all she knew of the measure of the latter and better days  there was another bond for mrs bests daughter was as distances go a neighbour to carrigaboola and resorted thither on great occasions  angelas vision began to be to take magdalen and her sisters out to carrigaboola where a superior school for colonists daughters was much needed and where paula might enter the sisterhood  she longed all the more when she saw how much better magdalen could deal with lena as to teaching and restraint than she could  the child was very backward and could hardly read words of one syllable though she knew any amount of scripture history and legends of saints and was very fairly intelligent but though she was devoted to sister always hanging on her and never quite happy when out of sight of her she had hardly any notion of prompt obedience or of giving up her own way  angelas visit to vale leston had been partly spoilt by the little girls fretful worry at the elder children and by the somewhat uncalled for fears that all the vanderkists were hard on the poor little colonial damsel but whether it was the air of rock quay or the quiet influence of miss prescott lena certainly improved in health at the goyle and was much more amenable and less rudely shy but her guardian trembled at hearing that pending captain merrifields correspondence with brisbane the sisters susan and elizabeth were coming to miss mohuns to see their niece there being no room for them at clipstone  they camesusan plump comfortable and goodnatured looking as like an apricot as ever with an air many years more than three above her sister bessie who as ever was brisk and bright scarcely middle aged in face dress or demeanour  they arrived too late for visiting and only dined at clipstone to be introduced to bernard underwood and see their cousin phyllis whom they had once met when all were small children  dolores was much amused as she told her aunt jane to see how gratified they were at the sanguine colouring of phyllis and wilfred quite merrifields they said though phyllis with auburn eyes and hair was far handsomer than any other of the clan had ever been and wilfred had simply commonplace carrots and freckles  the fun is said jane to remember how some of us mohuns have sighed at lilys having any yellow children and till we saw stokesley specimens wondering where the strain came from  as if it signified  it does in some degree said dolores something hereditary goes with the complexion  i dont know said jane  i believe too much is made in these days of heredity and by those who believe least in the bible indications on the effect forgetting the counteracting grace  well said dolores wilfred was always a bete noire to meno not noirein my younger days and i cant help being glad he is not of our strain  though you know the likeness was the first step to identifying that poor little girl  poor child  i am afraid she will be a bone of contention  the two aunts were at clipstone early and might be satisfied with the true merrifield tints of magdalen susanna but perhaps she had been over much warned to be gracious for the very contrary was the effect  she had been very civil to her greataunt lilias and had allowed both her uncles to take her up in their arms but she retreated upon angela planted an elbow on the wellknown lap turned her back and put a skinny little finger in her mouth by way of answer to susans advances advances which had hardly ever before been repelled even by the most untamable of infants  angela tried to coax lift her up and turn her round but this only led to the shoulder being the hidingplace and it might be suspected that there was a lurking perception that these strangers asserted a closer claim than the beloved sister  she would not even respond to susans doll or bessies picture book and bessie advised leaving her alone and turned to the window with agatha who was nothing loth to tell of her bexley and minsterham experiences  angela tried to talk about the voyage or any thing that might save the child from being discussed or courted but susans heart was in the subject and she had not enough tact or knowledge of the world to turn away from it  regret for the past was strong within her and she could not keep from asking how much little magdalen at full length remembered of her father how much she had been with him whether he had much altered whether there were a photograph of him and a great deal more with tears in her eyes and a trembling in her voice which made angela feel much for her even while vexed at her pertinacity for the child was by no means the baby she looked like but perfectly well able to listen and understand and this consciousness made her own communications much briefer and more reserved than otherwise they would have been  bessie with more perception saw the embarrassment turned round from agatha went up to the cockatoo in his cage and asked in a pleasant voice if magdalen would show him to her and tell her his name  angela was glad enough to break off poor susans questioning and come forward with the child still clinging to incite the bird to display the rose colour under his crest put up a grey claw to shake hands and show off his vocabulary laughing herself and acting merriment as she did so in hopes to inspire lena  come ben tell how you were picked up under a gum tree quite a baby a little grey ball and brought over in the shepherds pocket for a present to the little boss and how we fed you and nursed you till you turned all rosecolour and lovely  there put up your crest and make red revelations  cant you speak  fetch him a banana lena  that will open his mouth  at sight of the banana the bird put his head on one side and croaked in a hoarse whisper yo ho  no you need not be afraid of any more sailors language said angela  they were as careful as possible on board  i overheard once hold hard tom polly pink is up there and shes a regular lady born  whereupon polly indulged in a ridiculous chuckle holding the banana cleverly in one foot while angela laughed and chattered more and more nervously but only succeeded in disgusting the visitors by what susan at least took for unbecoming flippancy  that sister said susan as they drove away does not seem to me at all the person to have the charge of henrys poor little girl  i wish she had not thrust herself in said bessie to prevent me from getting on with the child over the cockatoo  she calls herself a sister  i dont understand it for she seems to have been bent on marrying poor henry  she never took any vows  then why does she wear a ridiculous cap over all that hair  by and by they were met by bernard underwood striding along holloa have you seen angel and her darling  she is a perfect slave to the little thing and one only gets fragments of her  she seems very fond of her said bessie  just kept her alive you see  poor old angel  she is all for one thing at a time  are you going up to clipstone  i think we shall find phyllis at beechcroft  yes she is driving there to lunch and angel is to bring the little cornstalk over to make friends with our lily  i trust the creature goes to sleep now and i may get a word out of angel  wherewith he dashed on and the two ladies agreed that those underwoods seemed to be curiously impulsive  they were however much better satisfied with the ceylonese lily who was a very well trained civilised specimen conversing very prettily over one of aunt janes picture books which bessie looked at with her and showing herself fully able to read the titles beneath a feat of which lena was quite incapable though she was less on the defensive than she had shown herself at the goyle and angela was far more at her ease than when she was conscious that fields original love was watching the introduction to his sisters besides bernards presence was sunshine to her and the two expanded into bright reminiscences and merry comparisons of their two lives absolutely delightful to themselves and to phyllis and her aunt jane and which would have been the same to elizabeth if she had not been worried at susans evident misunderstanding ofand displeasure atthe quips and cranks of the happy brother and sister also she was bent on promoting an intercourse between lily and lena over the doll she had brought for the former  she was a little hurt that lena had not been accompanied by the blueeyed article with preposterously long eyelashes that had been bestowed on her at the goyle but the little australian had no opinion of dolls and had let the one bought for her at sydney be thrown overboard by the ships monkey  that was cruel said lily fondling her blackeyed specimen  she could not feel reasoned lena with contempt  i dont know said lily knitting her brows  its not all make believe  i do love my rosamunda rowena and she loves me and i shall tell her not to be jealous of this dear betsinda  for do you know when rosamunda was ill in the red sea father carried her up and down on deck and made her a dear little deck chair  but she is not alive  she couldnt be sighed lena  i like my ben and my kangaroo  oh i do want to go back to my kangaroo  and does lily want to go back to her rikitiki asked lilys father lifting a little girl on each knee so that they might be visavis when certainly his own had the advantage in beauty as she answered leaning against him grannys better than rikitiki  for which pretty speech some of the ladies gave her much credit but her father with a tender arm round her said ah you are a sentimental little pussycat  is anything here as good as carrigaboola  eh lena  but lena resolutely shook her carrots but kept silence while bernard turned over the leaves of a great book of natural history till as a page was displayed with a large kangaroo under a bluegum tree with a yellow wattle tree beside him her lips quivered her face puckered and she burst into an uncontrollable fit of crying oh  i want to go home home  sister sister take me home  angela was in a minute beside her took her within loving arms and carried her off    chapter xxivcruel lawyers    tender companions of our serious days    who colour with your kisses smiles and tears lifes worn web woven over wasted ways  lowell  there was a good deal of worry and anxiety for some little time while correspondence was going on about henry merrifields will and in the meantime angela decided to board with miss prescott since her charge was certainly much better in health there and besides as mrs bernard merrifield was naturally at clipstone it became the head quarters of her husband though he made many excursions to his own people and on business affairs to sir ferdinand travis underwood in london  and clipstone suited him well for his holiday  sir jasper had of course a certain amount of intercourse with the garrison at avoncester and the officers stationed there at present had already some acquaintance with bernard underwood who was known to be a champion in ceylon in all athletic sports especially polo and cricket  tall and well made he had been devoted to all such games in his youth and they had kept up his health in his sedentary occupation  now in his leisure time his prowess did much to efface the fame of the much younger and slighter alexis white and so far as might be angela enjoyed the games with him keeping well within bounds but always feeling activity a wholesome outlet for her superfluous strength and above all delighting in an interval of being a child again with her bear of old times and her superabundant life energy and fun amazed all especially by the contrast with her poor little languid charge who seemed as jane mohun said centuries older  the merrifield lads were also devoted to him  even fergus was somewhat distracted from his allegiance to dolores and her experiments and in the very few days that christmas afforded for skating could think of nothing else  and as to wilfred his whole mind seemed to be set on sports and marble works to be only an incident thrown in  bernard whom he followed assiduously and who took him to avoncester and introduced him to young officers began to have doubts whether he had done wisely  bernard had in his time vexed felixs soul by idleness and amusement but he had been one betted upon not himself given to betting  he loved football and cricket for their bodily excitement not the fictitious one of a looker on or reader of papers and it struck him that wilfred knew a good deal too much about this more dangerous side of races and athletics  he said so to angela and she answered oh nonsense  young men are out of it if they dont know the winning horse  even pur had to be up to the derby  and angela had her own bitter trial in the decision of the lawyers not only was the signature of the will unsatisfactory from the confusion between field and merrifield but the two witnesses failed to be traced john shepherd and george jones were not to be identified and though brisbane might accept wills easily an english court of law required more certainty  the little daughter being the only child and natural heiress this was not felt to be doing her any injury but the decision deprived her of the guardian her father had chosen and angela was in despair  she was ready to write to the pursuivant to the bishop of albertstown to the lord chancellor with an exposition of the wicked injustice and hardness of heart of lawyers and the inexpedience of taking the poor child from her earliest motherly friend expressly chosen by her father  all bernards common sense and magdalens soothing were needed to make her hold her peace when correspondence made it plain that the guardianship being assumed by the uncles captain merrifield would not hear for a moment of the scheme of taking the child out to carrigaboola  in his opinion and his sister susans the only fit thing to be done with her was to place her with the two aunts at coalham to be educated  he came down to rock quay to inspect her it was a cold raw day with the moors wrapped in mist and the poor little maid looked small peaky and pinched  he was sure that the dry winds of the north were what she needed wanted to carry her off immediately and looked regardless of angelas opinion though backed by miss prescott that it would be highly dangerous to take the delicate child of a semitropical climate off in the depth of winter to a northerly town  angela walked off to ask dr dagger to inspect the child and give his opinion while captain sam repaired to clipstone to visit his relations and lunch with them  he did not meet with all the sympathy he expected  lady merrifield said that coalham had not agreed with her own son harry and that little lena ought not to be taken there till after the cold winds of spring were over and her daughters all chimed in with a declaration that angela underwood was perfectly devoted to the little one and that no one else could make her happy  petting her spoiling her scoffed the captain  why susan and bessie were full of the contrast with your little girl  health began phyllis  an indian child too he went on  just showing what a little good sense in the training can do  no indeed  since i am to be her guardian i have no notion of swerving from my duty and letting poor hals child be bred up to sisterhoods and all that flummery  it will just break angelas heart cried valetta with tears in her eyes at which the captain looked contemptuous  i must say added bernard that i should think it little short of murderous to take that unlucky child from the one woman who understands her up into the bleak north at this time of year  decidedly added sir jasper  miss underwood deserves every consideration in dealing with the child who has been always her sole charge  wherewith he changed the conversation by a question about stokesley but he held to his dictum when alone with his nephew and as he was the only person for whose opinion captain sam had any respect it had its effect though there was a sense that he might be biassed by his soninlaw and his herd of womanfolk and that he did not partake mrs samuel merrifields dislike to the very name of sister or of anything not commonplace  angela obtained dr daggers opinion to reinforce her own and lady merrifields and the captain was obliged to give way so far as to consent to magdalen as he insisted on calling her being allowed to remain at arnscombe till after easter when her aunts were to fetch her to coalham there to send her to the kindergarten  after angelas period of raging against law and lawyers and all the stokesley family and being on the verge of impertinence to captain merrifield she submitted to the prospect more quietly than her friends had dared to hope  lance had almost expected her to deport her charge parrot and all suddenly and secretly by an australian liner and had advised bernard on a fleeting meeting at bexley to be on his guard if she hinted at anything so preposterous but bernard shook his head and said angel was more to be trusted than her elders thought  waves and storms dont go over us for nothing i hope he said  and he found himself right on his return  angela had bowed her head to the inevitable and was quietly trying to prepare her little charge for the change accustoming her to more discipline and less petting  when angela proposed to walk over to clipstone with her brother on his return and the whine was set up let me go sister it was answered no my dear it is too far for you  you must stay and walk with paula  i want to go with sister  you must be a good child and do as sister tells you  no i cant have any fretting  paula will show you how to drive your hoop  keep her moving fast paula dont let her fret and get cold  and angela actually detached the clinging hand and put it into paulinas and holding up her finger silenced the burst of weeping though tears sprang to her own eyes as she resolutely turned away and after running out and shutting the back gate after her put her arm with a clinging gesture into bernards  thats right he said pressing her hand  cruel she said but better by and by for her  oh bear if one could but learn to lie still and say thou didst it when it is human agency that takes away the desire of ones eyes with a stroke  the desire of thine eyes repeated bernard  how often i thought of that last february  it was the only time he had referred to the loss of his little boy his wife had told her mother that he could not bear to mention it and had poured out all her own feelings of sorrow and her struggle for cheerfulness and resignation alone with her or with mysie but he had shrunk from the least allusion to the little two year old felix who slept beneath a palm tree at colombo  now however still holding his sisters hand he drifted into all the particulars of the little ways the baby language the dawning understanding and the very sudden sharp illness carrying the beautiful boy away almost before they were aware of danger and he took out the photograph from his breast and showed her the little face so recalling old fond remembrances  forbear to cry make no mourning for the dead he repeated  yes the boy is saved the wear and tear and heat and burthen of the day but it is very hard to be thankful  ah and it is all the harder if you have to leave your lily  ifyes but travis may so arrange that we can stay or i make only one voyage out to settle matters and then come home for good  if you are still bent on carrigaboola you might come as far as frisco with me  i may have to go there about the californian affairs  that would be jolly  yes i think it will clench the matter for i believe i am of more good at carriga than anywhere else though the heart of it is taken out of it for me but one lives on and gets on somehow without a heart or a heart set where i suppose it ought not to be entirely at least  and indeed i think that little one taught me better than ever before how to love  thats what the creatures are sent us for said bernard in a low voice  and here are looming in the distance all the posse of girls to meet us  ahh breathed angela withdrawing her arm  well bear you have given me something to look forward to whether it comes to anything or not  it will help me to be thankful  i know they are good people and the child will do well when once the pining and bracing are over  they are her own people and it is right  right you are angel said bernard with a fresh squeeze of the hand as he resumed his own cheerful resolute voice ere joining his sistersinlaw  what  angela without her satellite cried primrose  too far murmured angela but mysie tried to hush her sister perceiving the weaning process and respecting angela for it  and the next moment angela was challenging bernard to a game at golf    chapter xxvbear as adviser    weary soul and burthened sore labouring with thy secret load  keble  the early spring brought a new development  thekla who attended classes at the high school came home with unmistakable tokens of measles and primrose did the same in common with most of their contemporaries at rockstone  nor was there any chance that either lily underwood at clipstone or lena merrifield at the goyle would escape indeed they both showed an amount of discomfort that made it safer to keep them where they were than to try to escape in the sharp east wind and frost  no one was much dismayed at what all regarded as a trifling ailment even if dignified as german  angela owned that she regarded it as a relief since infection might last till the summer and the only person who wasas he ownedtrying to laugh at himself with angela was bernard who could not keep out of his minds eye a little grave at colombo  as he walked home at the turning he saw a figure wearily toiling upwards which proved to be wilfred  holloa you are at home early  i had an intolerable headache  measles eh  no such thing  once when i was a kid in malta  but i say bear he added coming up with quickened pace you could do me no end of a favour if you would advance me twenty pounds  whew bernard whistled  there is lady day coming and i can pay you thenmost assuredly and an asseveration or two was beginning  twenty pounds dont fly promiscuously about the country muttered bernard chiefly for the sake of giving himself time  but i tell you i shall have a quarter from the works and a quarter from my father with his hand to his head  thatsthats  awful skinflints both of them  how is a man to do so cramped up as that  oh and how is a man to do if he spends it all beforehand  i tell you bernard i must have it oror it will break my mothers heart  and as to my father idid cut my throatid go to sea before he knew  advance it to me bear  you know what it is to be in an awful scrape  get me through this once and ill never  bernard did not observe that the scrape of his boyhood over the drowned stingo had hardly been of the magnitude that besought for twenty pounds  he waived the personal appeal and asked what is the scrape  why that intolerable swindler and ruffian hart deceived me about racket and  a horse at avoncester said bernard light beginning to dawn on him  i made sure it was the only way out of it all and they said racket was as sure as death and now the brute has come in third  hart swears there was foul play but whats that to me  im done for unless you will help me over  if it is a betting debt the only safe way is to have it out with your father and have done with it  you dont know what my father is  just made of iron  you might as well put your hand under a nasmyths hammer  and as he saw that his hearer was unconvinced besides it is ever so much more than what i put upon racket  that was only the way out of it  it is all up with me if he hears of it  you might as well pitch me over the cliff at once  well what is it then  incoherently wilfred stammered out what bernard understood at last to mean that he had got into the habit of betting at the billiard table surreptitiously kept up in ivinghoe terrace in a house of richard whites not for any excessive sums and with luck at first on his side than otherwise but at last he had become involved for a sum not in itself very terrible to elder years and his creditor was in great dread of pressure from his employers and insisted on payment  wilfred who seemed to have a mortal terror of his father beyond what bernard could understand had been unable to believe that the offence for so slight a sum might be forgiven if voluntarily confessed had done the worst thing he could he had paid the debt with a cheque which had unfortunately passed through his hands at the office trusting in a few days to recover the amount by a bet upon the horse in full security of success  and now  before the predicament was made clear wilfred reeled and would have fallen if bernard had not supported him and he mumbled something about giddiness and dazzling insisting at the same time that it was nothing but the miserable pickle and that if bernard would not see him out of it he might as well let him lie there and have done with it  happily they were in the immediate neighbourhood of the house and it was possible to get him into the hall before he entirely collapsed upon a chair but seeming to recover fresh vigour from alarm at the sound of voices he rushed at the stairs and dashed up rapidly the two flights to his own room only throwing back the words dead secret mind  bernard was glad to have made no promise and indeed wilfreds physical condition chiefly occupied him at the moment for one or two of the girls were hurrying in asking what was the matter and at the answer he is gone up to his room with a bad headache valetta declared with satisfaction then he has got it  we told him so but he would go to the office and bernard so has lily  pleasing information said bernard nettled and amused at the tone of triumph while mysie throwing behind her the words it may be nothing went off to call mrs halfpenny who was in a state of importance and something very like pleasure  bernard strode up to his wifes room leaving valetta halfway in her exposition that when all the family had been laid low by measles at malta wilfred had been a very young infant and it had always been doubtful whether he had been franked or not and how he had been reproached with looking ill in the morning but had fiercely insisted on going down to the office which he was usually glad to avoid on any excuse  by the time the household met at dinner it was plain that they had to resign themselves to being an infected family though there were not many probable victims and they were likely only to have the disorder favourably with the exception of wilfred who had evidently got a severe chill and could only be reported as very ill though still he vehemently resented any suspicion of being subject to such a babyish complaint  but when the break up for the night was just over lady merrifield came in search of bernard entreating him to come to speak to wilfred who was more and more feverish almost lightheaded and insisting that he must speak to bear bear had not promised reiterating the summons so that there was no choice but to comply with it  he found wilfred flushed with fever and violently restless starting up in bed as he entered and crying out bear bear will you will you  you did not promise  i will see about it  lie down now  theres nothing to be done to night  but promise promise  and not a word  all this was reiterated till wilfred at last was exhausted for the time and to a certain degree pacified by the reassuring voice in which bernard soothed him and undertook to take the matter in hand hardly knowing what he undertook and only feeling the necessity of quieting the perilous excitement and of helping the mother to bring a certain amount of tranquillity  his own little girl was going on well and quite capable of being amused in the morning by being compared to a lobster or a tiger lily and primrose was reported in an equally satisfactory state ready either for sleep or continuous reading by her sisters  only wilfred was in the same or a more anxious state of fever and as soon as bernard had satisfied himself that there was no special use in his remaining in the house he set out for the marble works office having made up his mind as to one part of what he had expressed as seeing about it  he had hardly turned into the cliffe road before he met captain henderson walking up and they exchanged distant inquiries and answers as to whether each might be thought dangerous to the others home after which they forgathered and compared notes as to invalids  the captain had heard of wilfreds going home ill and was coming he said to inquire  he seems very seriously ill was the answer  i imagine there has been a chill and a check  i was coming to speak to you about him  he has spoken to you  both could now consult freely  it is a very anxious matternot so much for the actual amount as for the habits that it shows  the amount  oh i have made up that as regards the firm  i could not let it come before sir jasper especially in the present state of things  i meant to give the young chap a desperate fright and rowing but that will have to be deferred  you must let me take it  no no  remember sir jasper was my commanding officer and i and my wife owe everything to him  i could supply the amount so that no one would guess from the accounts that anything had been amiss  bernard could hardly allow himself to be thus relieved but there was the comfort of knowing that wilfreds name was safe and that the unstained family honour would not have to suffer shame  still the other debts remained of which captain henderson had been only vaguely suspicious till the two took counsel on them  wilfred had not given up the name of the person for whom he had meant to borrow from the office but captain henderson had very little doubt who it was and it was agreed that he should receive the amount through a cheque of bernard on brown and travis underwood from captain hendersons hands with a scathing rebuke and peremptory assurance of exposure to mr white and consequent dismissal if anything more of the same kind among the younger men were detected  the man was a clever artist in his first youth and had always been something of a favourite with the authorities and had a highly respectable father so captain henderson meant to spare him as much as possible and endeavour to ascertain how far the mischief had gone among the young men connected with the marble works also to consult mr white on the amount of stringency in the measures used to put a stop to it  all this of course passed out of bernard underwoods hands and knowledge but a sad and anxious day was before him  all the young girls were going on well but wilfred was increasingly ill all day and continually calling for bernard  being told i have settled the matter did not satisfy him  he looked eagerly about the room to find whether his mother were present and fancying she was absent demanded does he know  do they know reiterating again and again it was necessary to tell lady merrifield that there was an entanglement about money matters on his mind which had been settled but towards evening he grew worse and more lightheaded apparently under the impression that only bernard could guard him from something unknown or conceal whenever he was conscious of the presence of his mother and on his fathers entrance he hid his face in the pillows and trembled of course to their exceeding distress and perplexity and when he believed no one present but bernard and mrs halfpenny he became more and more rambling sometimes insisting that his father must not know sometimes abusing all connected with the racing bet and more often fancying that he was going to be arrested for robbing the firm the enormity of the sum and of the danger increasing with the fever and therewith his horror of his fathers knowing  it was of no use for his mother to hang over him hold his hands and assure him that she knew as in fact she did for bernard had been obliged to make a cursory explanation and that nothing could hinder her loving him still he forgot it in the next interruption and turned from her with terror and dismay and once he nearly flung himself out of bed fancying that the policeman was coming  bernard held him on this occasion and told him nothing will do you good willie but to tell your father and he will keep all from you let him know and it will be all right  it only seemed to add to his misery and terror  something that passed in his hearing gave him the impression that he was in great danger if not actually dying but his cry was still for bernard who had not ventured to go to bed but it was still oh bear save me dont let me die with this upon my name  i cant go to god  theres nothing for it wilfred but to tell your father  he will pardon you  your mother has you see  tell him and when he forgives you will know that god does  it will come right  let me call him  let me bring him my boy my dear boy entreated his mother  you know he will  wilfred seemed as if he did not know but still held fast by bernards strong hands as though there were support in them and when in a few moments sir jasper entered the room there was the same clinging gesture and endeavour to hide in spite of the gentle sweetness of the tone of well my poor boy  it was bernard who was obliged to say turning the poor flushed face towards him wilfred wishes to say  father it came with a gasp at last ive done it  ive disgraced us all  forgive  he was repeating his own exaggerated ideas of what his crime had been and what sir jasper would have said to him if all had been discovered in any other way  do not think of it now my boy  i forgive you whatever it is  thereupon dr dagger entered  he turned every one out except mrs halfpenny and gave a draught which silenced the patient and put him to sleep in a few minutes  while bernard hastily satisfied the parents that a good deal was exaggerated feeling and that an old soldier must have known of a good many worse things in his time though not so near home  there was a general sense of relief in the morning for wilfreds attack had become an ordinary though severe one and the other cases were going on well  but sir jasper who had not been able to grasp the extent of wilfreds delinquency and had been persuaded by his despair that it was much more serious than it really was called his soninlaw into council and demanded whether the whole could have been told  bernard was certain that it was so and related his transactions with captain henderson much of course to the fathers relief so far as the outer world was concerned but what principally grieved him besides the habits thus discovered was his sons abject terror of him not only in the exaggeration of illness but in his mode of speaking of him  it had never been thus with any of his sons before  claude the soldier had always been satisfactory so had harry the clergyman though often widely separated from the parents in their wandering life but the bond of confidence had never been broken jasper had never teased any one but his sisters  fergus too the youngest of all the sons and of an individual rather peculiar nature was growing up in straight grooves of his own but wilfred who from delicate health had been the most at home had never seemed to open to his father  the family discipline of the general seemed only to oppress and terrify him and the irregularities and subterfuges that had from time to time been detected had been met with just anger never received in such a manner as to call forth the tenderness of forgiveness  each discovery of a misdemeanour had only been the prelude to fresh and worse concealments and hardening  and experience of mankind did not give any decided hope that even the last days agony of repentance would be the turning over of a new leaf when convalescence should bring the same surroundings and temptations and perhaps the like disproportionate indignation and impatience in dealing with errors and constitutional weakness  and the example of my brothers poor son is not encouraging he added he who seems to have owed everything to your brother and sister  yet poor fulbert and i were to our homes perhaps not the black sheep but at any rate the vagrant ones  and what made a difference to you may i ask  strong infusion by character and example of principle said bernard thoughtfully then real life and having to be ones own safeguard with nothing to fall back on  as my brother told me at his last i should swim when my plank was gone  yes but plainly you were never weak and as bernard did not answer at once oldfashioned severity used to be the rule with lads but it seems only to alienate them now and make them think themselves unjustly treated  what is one to do with these boys  a question which bernard could not answer though it carried him back with a strange yearning yet resignation to the little figure that had curled round on his knee and the hopes connected with the hands that had caressed his cheek  he thought over it the more the next week when he was called to sit by wilfred who was getting better and anxious to talk  my father is very kind he said  oh yes very kind now but it will be all the same when i get well  you see bear how can a man be always dawdling about with a lot of girls  theres dolores bothering with her science and fergus every bit as bad and mysie after her disgusting schoolchildren and val and prim horrid little empty chatterboxes and if one does turn to a jolly girl for a bit of fun their tongues all go to work so that you would think the skies were going to fall and if one goes in for a bit of a spree down comes the general like a sledgehammer  i wish you would take me out with you bear  the same idea had already been undeveloped in bernards mind and ever on his tongue when alone with his wife but he kept it to himself and only committed himself to you would not find an office in colombo much more enlivening  there would be something to seesomething to do  it would not be all as dull as ditchwaterjust driving one to do something to get away from the girls and their fads  this was nearly a fortnight from the night of crisis when wilfred very weak was still in bed when primrose and lily were up and about but threatened with whooping cough  thekla much in the same case and very cross and little lena weak caressing and dependant but angelically good and patient so much so that magdalen and angela were quite anxious about her    chapter xxvinew paths    ill put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes  shakespeare  the visitation had not been confined to the high school  the little cheaplybuilt rows for workmen and fishermen had suffered much more severely owing chiefly to the parents callous indifference to infection  kismet as they think it said jane mohun and still more to their want of care  chills were caught fevers and diphtheria ensued and there was an actual mortality among the children at the works and at arnscombe  mr flight begged for help from the nursing sisterhood at dearport and to her great joy sister beata was sent down to him with another who was of the same standing as angela and delighted to have a glimpse of her though angela thought it due to her delicate charge and the merrifields not to plunge into actual nursing while lena needed her hourly attention and was not yet in a state for the training to do without it to continue  paulina however being regarded as infection proof was permitted to be an attendant and messenger of her dear sister beata to her own great joy  she was now nineteen and her desire to devote herself to a sisterhood had never wavered and intercourse with sister angela had only strengthened it  oh maidie she said i do not think there can be any life so good or so happy as being really given up to our lord and his work among the sick and poor  my dear he can be served if you are in the world provided you are not of the world and if you keep yourself from the evil  yes but why should i run into the world  it is not evil i know so far as you and all your friends can manage but it stirs up the evil in ones self  and so would a sisterhood  that is a world too  i suppose it is and that there would be temptation but there is a great deal to help one to keep right  and oh to have ones work in real good to christs poor or in missions instead of in all these outside silly nonsensical diversions that one doubts about all the time  if you would only let me go back with dear sister beata and sister elfleda as a probationer  you could not be any more yet said magdalen but i will think about it and talk it over with sister angela  you know your friend sister mena as she called herself does not mean to be a sister but a governess  yes she wrote to me  she has never seen or known anything outside the convent and it is all new and turns her head said paulina wisely  i know she helped me to be all the more silly about vera and poor hubert delrio  magdalen promised to talk the matter over with sister angela  i should call it a vocation said angela  i have watched her ever since i have been here and i am sure her soul is set on these best things in a steady earnest way  she has always been an exceedingly good girl ever since i have had to do with her said magdalen  i have hardly had a fault to find with her except a little exaggeration in the direction of st kenelms  a steady not a fitful flame said angela  but she is so young  if you will believe me magdalen such a home as that dearport sisterhood is a precious thingi have not been worthy of it  i have been a wild colt carried about by all manner of passing excitements oh dear love of sheer fun and daring enterprise and amusement in shocking every one even my very dearest whom i loved best  i have done things too dreadful to think of and been utterly unreasonable and unmanageable and proud of it but always that sisterhood has been like a cord drawing me  i never quite got free of it even when i sent back my medal and fancied it had been playing at superstition  i was there for a month as almost a baby and the atmosphere has brought peace ever since  that and my brother and sister constance and bishop fulmort have been the saving of me if anything has  i mean if they will have me to spend a little time at dearport after all this perplexity is over and i know how it is with lena and i could see how it is with paula if you liked  magdalen accepted the suggestion perhaps the more readily because of a fleeting visit from hubert delrio who had finished his frescoes at the american vale leston and came for a day or two to mr flights she had sometimes doubted whether the supposed love of vera had not been a good deal diffused among the young ladies and might not so far awaken in paulina as to render her vocation doubtful but there were no such symptoms  paula was quiet and cheerful with a friendly welcome but no excitement but it was thekla now fifteen who was all blushes whenever hubert looked or spoke to her all her forwardness gone and shyness or decidedly awkwardness set in resulting chiefly in giggle  hubert looked more manly and substantial and he had just had an order for an important london church which pleased him much and involved another journey to italy to study some of the designs in the lombardic churches  not that there was any chance of meeting vera  mr and mrs white had spent the last summer at baden and vera who had many pretty little drawingroom talents and was always obliging had been very acceptable there  this winter an attack of rheumatism had made them decide on trying algiers with a view to the atlas marbles and then german baths again might claim them for the summer  in fact the fear of infection had rendered rock quay a deserted place during the easter vacation  fergus merrifield might not come near primrose and lily and was charmed to accept an invitation from his friend and admirer adrian vanderkist to vale leston where he would be able to explore the geology of penbeacon to say nothing of the coast while his sister felicia who had been one of the victims remained to be disinfected with miss mohun  dolores was at vale leston priory and agatha prescott with her so as to have a clean bill of health for her return to oxford for her last term  the holy week was calm and grave and the two girls with anna vanderkist and her little sisters were very happy over their primroses and anemones on easter eve with the beautiful altar cross that no one could manage like aunt cherry whose work was confined to that and to the two crosses on the graves  another notion soon occupied them  there was a vague idea that a sort of convalescent or childrens hospital might be established for the training of women intending to study medicine or nursing chiefly at miss arthurets expense and dolores was anxious to consider the possibility of placing it in the sweet mountain air tempered by the sea breezes of penbeacon  it was an idea to make mrs grinstead shudder but neither she nor her niece anna vanderkist could forget geralds view that penbeacon was not only to be the playground of vale leston and they always felt as if dolores had a certain widows right to influence any decision  so she cheerfully acquiesced in what in her secret heart seemed only a feeble echo of the past though to the young generations it was a very happy hopeful present when all the youthful party under the steerage of mary and anna and the escort of sir adrian and fergus started off with ponies donkeys cycles and sturdy feet to picnic on penbeacon if possible in the march winds well out of the way of the clay works  how fergus divided his cares between the strata and dolores kodak how even his photography could not spoil aunt alda how charming a group of sisters dolores contrived to produce how adrian was the proud pioneer into a coach adorned with stalactites and antediluvian bones how anna collected milkwort and violets for aunt cherry how a sly push sent little joan in a headlong career down a slope that might have resulted in a terrible fall but did only cause a tumble and great fright and a severe reprimand from the elder sisters how agatha was entranced by the glorious view in the clearness of spring how they ate their sandwiches and tried to think it was not cold how grey east wind mist came over the distance and warned them it was time to trot downall this must belong to the annals of later vale leston and of those years of youth which in each generation leave impressions as of sunbeams for life  and on their return dolores found a letter which filled her with a fresh idea  it was from her father in new zealand telling her that there was an opening for her to come and give a course of lectures on electricity at canterbury auckland and the other towns and proposing to her to come out with her lady assistant when she might very probably extend her tour to australia  would you come naggie asked dolores  oh  i should like nothing half so well  if you could only wait till my turn is over and the exam  of course  why we shall not have finished the correspondence till after the examination  how capital it will be  my father will like your bright face and you will think him like fergus grown older will your sister consent  oh  magdalen will be glad enough to have me off on a career  we will write and prepare her mind  i believe i am not to go home so as to bring a clean bill of health to st roberts  i really think added dolores that magdalen would make an admirable head matron or whatever you call it  dear old thing  she is very fond of her goyle  true but sophys engineer husband tells us that a new line is projected to rock quay through the very heart of the goyle act of parliament compulsory sale and all  well work might console her for being uprooted and she is quite youthful enough to take to it with spirit  besides that she would greatly console clement and cherry for the profanation of their penbeacon  i declare i will suggest it to arthurine  so the two young people resolved not without a consciousness that what was to them a fresh and inspiring gale to the elder generation was winds have rent thy sheltering bowers    chapter xxviia sentence    what should we give for our beloved  e b browning  no sooner had the visitors departed than the others now out of quarantine appeared at vale leston  angela was anxious to spend a little time there and likewise to have lena overhauled by tom may the child had never really recovered and was always weakly and whereas on the journey lily now in high health was delighted with all she saw though she could not compare penbeacon to adams peak lena lay back in sister angelas arms almost a dead weight hardly enduring the bustle of the train though she tried not to whine as long as she saw her pink ben looking happy in his cage  angela was an experienced nurse and was alarmed at some of the symptoms that others made light of  mrs grinstead had thought things might be made easier to her if the miss merrifields came to meet her and hear the doctors opinion and elizabeth accepted her invitation arriving to see the lovely peaceful world in the sweet blossoming of an early may the hedges spangled with primroses and the hawthorns showing sheets of snow while the pear trees lifted their snowy pyramids and lily in her white frock darted about the lawn in joyous play with her father under the tree and the grey cloister was gay with wisteria  angela was sitting in the boat safely moored with a book in her hand the pink cockatoo on the gunwale nibbling at a stick and the girl lying on a rug partly on her lap  phyllis and anna who had come out on the lawn made elizabeth pause  thats the way they go on said phyllis  all day long angela is reading to the child either the water babies or the history of joseph  or crooning to her the story of the cross said anna and as soon as one is ended she begins it again and lena will not let her miss or alter a single word  they go on more than half the night added phyllis  bear sat up long over his letters and accounts and as he went up he heard the crooning and looked in and the very moment angela paused there came the little plaintive voice go on please  women are following  but is not that spoiling her asked bessie  a look of sad meaning passed between her two companions  phyllis shook her head slightly and instead of answering conducted bessie on to the bank when angela looked up and made a sign that she could not move or speak for the child was asleep  the yellow head was shaded by angelas parasol the thin hair lying ruffled on the black dress and the small face looked more pinched than when the aunt had last seen it nearly a year previously  she had watched the decay of aged folks but she was unused to the illnesses of children and she recoiled with a little shock as she looked down at the little wasted face with a slight flush of sleep  recovery from measles she said  phyllis smiled a little pitifully as her own little girl all radiant with health and joy came skipping up performing antics over her fathers hand  take care lily dont wake poor little lena was murmured quietly  northern breezes began bessie but the voices had broken the light slumber and as angela began see lena here is aunt bessie the effect was to make her throw herself over angelas shoulder and hide her face and when her protector tried to turn her round and reason her into courtesy she began to cry in a feeble manner  she has had a bad night said motherly phyllis let her alone  may not i get down into the boat asked lily  ill be very good  there would have been a little hesitation but at the voice lena looked up and called lily lily  bernard lifted his small daughter down elizabeth was not sorry to be led away for the present and when after a turn in the rose garden she came back the two children were sitting with arms round one another holding a conversation with ben the cockatoo and making him dance on one of the benches of the boat under angelas supervision lest he should end by dancing overboard  the rich fair hair shining dark blue eyes and plump glowing cheeks of lily were a contrast to the wan wasted colouring of her little cousin but lena was more herself now than when just awake and let lily lead her up and introduce her as it might be called to cousin bessie as lily called her a less formidable sound than aunt elizabeth  they were both kissed and she endured it  angela was as her brothers and sisters said very good and scrupulously abstained from absorbing the child all the evening letting elizabeth show her pictures and tell her stories to which by lilys example she listened quietly enough and with interest  when the two children went off hand in hand to their beds elizabeth said really magdalen is improved  if you leave lily with her phyllis i think we should get on beautifully  the bracing air will do wonders for them both  thank you said poor phyllis forbearingly we have not made our plans about lily yet  but elizabeth thought out a beautiful scheme of discipline and study in the long light hours of the morning and began to feel herself drawn towards her delicate little niece feeling sure that the little thing would soon be susans darling if susan could be brought to endure the cockatoo walking loose about the house  early in the day professor may appeared and was hailed as an old friend by all the underwoods  he rejoiced to see clement looking well and active and as to this fellow he said looking at bernard it shows what development will do  not quite the young bear of stoneborough said clement leaning affectionately on his broad shoulder our skittish pair are grown very soberminded  but you have not told us of your father  my father is very well  he walks down every day to sit with my wife and visits a selection of his old patients who are getting few enough now  this is not my patient i suppose  unless you are ready to prescribe only laughing and good jersey cows milk said bernard pulling the long silky brown hair wheres mother little one  mother sent me to say aunt angel is ready if dr may will come up to aunt cherrys room  lena is frightened and they did not like to leave her  it was a long visit after phyllis had come down and walking up and down the cloister with bessie merrifield listened to her schemes of education for the little maidens  lily she liked and admired and she was convinced that magdalens weak health and spirits were the result of the spoiling system  phyllis trembled a little as she heard of the knocking about outofdoors ways that had certainly produced fine strong healthy frames and upright characters but she forbore to say that if her little girl had to be left it would be to her mother and mysie  by and by tom came down and finding geraldine alone in the drawing room he answered her inquiry with a very grave look  poor little thing  you do not think well of her  is it as angel feared  confirmed disease from original want of development of heart measles accelerated it  i doubt her lasting six months though it may be longer or less  have you told angel  she knew it more or less  she is ready to bear it though one can see how her soul is wrapped up in the child and the child in her  one thing tom will you tell miss merrifield yourself and alone and make her feel that it is an independent opinion  it may save both the poor child and angel a great deal  are you prepared to keep her here  of course we are  it is angels natural home  clement and i could think of nothing else  i knew you would say so  if i understand rightly there is something like a jealousy of her case in the merrifields prompted greatly by their wish to expiate any neglect of her father  that is what i gather from what phyllis tells me  what a lovely countenance hers is in expression  no wonder bernard has softened down  there is strength and solidity as well as sweetness in her face  ah there they are  i will call phyllis in  bessie merrifield has almost walked her to death by this time  so phyllis was called and told  what she said was i only hope he will make her understand that it could not be helped and it was not angelas fault  tom may had wisdom enough to make this clear in what was a greater shock to elizabeth than it was to angela who had suspected enough to be prepared for the sentence and had besides a good deal of hospital experience which enabled her thoroughly to understand the professors explanations  so indeed did it seem to elizabeth at the time he was speaking but she had lived a good deal in london and had a great idea that a london physician must be superior to a man who had lived in the country and moreover whom all the household called tom and she asked mrs grinstead if he were really so clever  indeed i think he is and i have seen a great deal of his treatment  you may quite trust him  he lives down here at stoneborough for his fathers sake or he would be quite at the head of his profession  superior to the two doctors brownlow  i should not say superior but quite equal  the brownlows said clement looking up from his paper helped me through an ordinary malarial fever  john lucas is a brilliant specialist in such cases but certifying an affection of the heart tom may latterly has treated me better  as far as i understand the case of your little niece i should say both that it was more in the line of tom may and likewise that it would be very hurtful to her to take her about and subject her to more examinations  poor little thing no doubt it would be a terrible distress acquiesced bessie but still if it is bracing that she needs northern air might make all the difference  clement sighed a little hopelessly over making a woman understand or give way and returned to his newspaper while geraldine tried to argue that air could not make much difference speaking in the interest of the child herself and of her sister  elizabeth listened and agreed but there was in the merrifield family a fervour of almost jealous expiation of their neglect of henry inattention to his daughter and desire to appropriate her and to restore her to health strength and wisdom in spite of her wouldbe stepmother  they hate me as much as if i were her stepmother cried angela  i wish i was to have a right to protect her  no clem ill not break out if i can help it as long as they dont worry her and i think bessie does see the rights of it  yes the peaceful thoughtful atmosphere of vale leston unlike the active bustle of coalham had an insensible influence on elizabeths mind and she saw that angelas treatment of the child always cheerful though tender was right and that it would be sheer cruelty to separate them  she promised to use all her power to prevent any such step and finally left vale leston perfectly satisfied that it was impossible to take lena with her  but her family did not see it thus especially mrs samuel merrifield the childs guardian  she insisted that it was her husbands duty to bring the little one to london for advice and to remove her from all the weakening morbid influences of vale leston    chapter xxviiisummoned    what would we give to our beloved  e b browning  i wish they all would not go so very fast said little lena hiding her face against him from the whirl of cabs and omnibuses  they bewilder us savages said angela smiling  remember we are from the wilds  she shall have her tea and a good rest said marilda and then i have asked her uncle and aunts to meet you at dinner and fernan hopes to bring home another old friend  whom do you think angel  oh  not our bishop  yes the bishop of albertstown  he is actually in town fernan saw him yesterday at the church house  oh that is joy cried angela and lena raised her head with is it minemine own bishop  mine own mine own bishop and godfather my sweet said angela more to us in our own way than any one else  oh it is joy  how happy clement will be  it was with much feeling almost akin to shame that bessie wrote to angela this decision of her brother that a london authority must be consultednot dr brownlow but one whom mrs sam had heard highly spoken of  that man cried angela  i have heard of him  he is a regular mealymouthed old woman of a doctor  and she is so well just now how horrid to shake her up again  oh bear if i could only sail away with her to queensland  you would if it was ten years ago said bernard  yes  is it the way of the world or learning resignation that makes one know one must submit  giving up an idol is a worse thing when the idol is made of flesh and blood  bernard wanted to see sir ferdinand so made it an excuse for helping his sister on the way and he did so effectively for his knee and broad breast were lenas great restingplace and his stories of monkeys and elephants were almost as good as kangaroos  was there not a kangaroo to be seen in london which she apparently thought would be a place of about the size of albertstown  lady underwood had insisted on receiving the travellers from vale leston in her house in kensington and there was her broad kindly face looking out for them at the station and her likewise broad and kindly carriage ready to carry them from it  how natural all looked to angela with all her associations of being a naughty wild mischievous schoolgirl the general plague and problem  but always a dear said marilda with her habit of forgetting everybodys faults  why didnt you bring your wife bernard and your little girl for this darlings playfellow  she is her best playfellow said angela adelas joan is too rough and fitter for adrians companion  she is my playfellow said bernard holding her up  look out lena  heres father thames to go over  and fernan is so glad added marilda  for bishop robert fulmort had when vicar of st wulstans been the guide and helper of ferdinand traviss time of trial and disappointment as well as the spiritual father of clement underwood he had known and dealt with angela in her wayward girlhood and aided her bitter repentance and in these later days in australia had been her true fatherly friend counsellor and comforter in the trials and perplexities that had befallen her  bernard read in her lifted head and brightened eye that she felt the meeting him almost a compensation for the distress and perplexity of this journey to london  bernard carried the little girl up to the room and laid her down to sleep off her fatigue while marilda waited on her and angela with her wonted bustling affection extremely happy to have two of her best beloved cousins under her roof  bernard went off to find sir ferdinand at his office and quiet prevailed till nearly dinner time when lena awoke and would not be denied one sight of her godfather  so angela dressed her in her white frock and smoothed her thin yellow hair and took her down to the great stiff handsome room that all emilias efforts had never made to look liveable  emilia brown was there very fashionably attired but eager for news of vale leston and the merrifields soon arrived with oh here she is from the captain well she looks better than i expected  poor little dear observed his wife dressed in a low dress and thin fringe on her forehead in honour of what to the country mind was a grand dinner party at which angelas plain black dress and tight white cap were an unbecoming sight  elizabeth was there kissing angela with real sympathy and lena who had grown a good deal more accustomed to strange relations endured the various embraces without discourtesy  but when the door opened and the greyheaded bishop came in there was a low half scream of oh oh and with one leap she was in his arms as he knelt on one knee and clasped her holding out a hand to angela whose eyes were full of tears of relief and trust  marilda gave a glad welcome but they were startled by perceiving that the joy of meeting had brought on a spasm of choking on lena who was gasping in a strange sort of agony  angela took her in her arms and carried her out of the room  marilda presently following came back reporting that the little girl had been relieved by a shower of tears but was still faint and agitated and that angela could not leave her but begged that they would not wait dinner  such sensitiveness needs anxious care said elizabeth  if it be not the effect of spoiling  just affectation replied the sisterinlaw in a decided voice which made bessie glad that the poor childs home was not to be among the rough boys at stokesley who were not credited with any particular feelings  angelas absence gave the bishop the opportunity of telling what she had been during her years at albertstown what a wonderful power among the natives though not without disappointment and she had been still more effective among the settlers and their daughters carrigaboola fulberts farm had been an oasis of hope and rest to the few clergy of his scanty staff and fulbert himself had been a tower of strength for influence over the settlers who had fallen in his way by his unswerving uprightness and honour with the deeper principles of religion little talked of but never belied  even after his death the power he had been told over all with whom he had come in contact  bernard heard it with immense pleasure as did the faithful ferdinand and marilda while elizabeth felt more and more that sister angela was not to be treated as she feared sam and his wife were inclined to do as a mere interloper in their family affairs but as one to be not merely considered with gratitude but even reverenced  indeed sam began to feel it as he saw how the other men both practical business men listened and were impressed but it was not quite the case with his wife who did not particularly esteem colonial bishops and still less sisterhoods or devotion to missionary efforts especially among the australian blacks whom her old geography book had told her were the most degraded and hopeless of natives scarcely removed from mere animals  when angela appeared half through dinner time and said that lena was safely asleep and marilda sat her down to be happy in exchange of carrigaboola tidings with her bishop fernando greeted her with a reverence not undeserved though perhaps all the more from the contrast to the mischievous little sprite who used to disturb the days of his philandering with alda  how much shocked mrs samuel was when the magnificent sir ferdinand whom she regarded with awe as a millionaire was flippantly answered by this extraordinary sister thank you fernan i should like to have a sight of the old office  i hope you have a descendant of the old cat betty  didnt she come from your grandmother marilda  do you remember her being found playing tricks with the nugget just come from victoria  that was in her kitten days said ferdinand  is that personal fernan  a compliment angel said the bishop  kittens alter a good deal  not much for the better said angela  if you only could see mrs lamb who used to be the very moral of a kitten scratchiness and all  i thought her very much improved said lady underwood gravely  oh yes grown into a sleek and personable tabby able to wave her tail at the tip and tuck her pawsher velvet pawswell under her and lick her lips over theoh dearwhat do you call ityour menu is quite too much for us poor savages marilda  a bit of damper is quite enough for us isnt it bishop  varied with opossum and fern root he said smiling but thats only when we have lost our way  the talk drifted off to the history of a shepherds child who had strayed into the bush and after much searching in which the bishop and fulbert had been half starved had finally been found and carried home by angelas crack gin as she told it to bernard and as marilda thought the poor child was in a trap it had to be translated into favourite pupil though bernard carried on the joke by asking marilda if she thought the natives cannibals given to the snaring of mankind  altogether it was a thoroughly merry evening such as comes to pass in the meeting of old friends and comrades in too large numbers for grave discourse but with habits of close intercourse and associations of all kinds  emilia and her husband tried in all courtesy not to let the merrifields feel themselves neglected and indeed bessie was only too glad to listen and join at times in the talk but it all went outside mrs sam who was on the whole scandalised at the laughter of a bishop and a sister  indeed it was true that bishop fulmort naturally a grave man very much so in his early days comported himself on this occasion as if he realised southeys wish    that in mine age as cheerful i might be like the green winter of the holly tree   at any rate that evening was long a bright remembrance  lena slept all night and was so fresh and well in the morning that angela foreboded that the examination might not detect her delicacy  they met mrs merrifield and took her with them to the doctors lady underwood travis having placed her carriages at their disposal  it was very much as angela had expected knowing by hospital reputation what the doctor was supposed to be to old ladies and fanciful mothers while perhaps he had also heard of her fracas long ago at the hospital  for he was not more courteous to her than could be helped treating her much as if she were only the nursery maid and hardly looking at the opinion which she had made professor may write out for him  to her mind it was a very cursory examination that he made and the upshot of his opinion triumphantly accepted by mrs merrifield was that there was nothing seriously amiss with the child that she only needed care regularity and bracing and that the stifling gasping spasms were simply the effect of hysteria  hysteria  angela felt as if she should run wild as she heard mrs merrifields complacent remarks on having always thought so and being sure that a few weeks of good air and good management would make an immense difference  the need of not alarming or prejudicing the poor little victim was all that kept angela in any restraint and mrs merrifield went on to say that she had promised her youngest boy who was with her in london to take him to the zoological gardens and it would be a good opportunity for magdalen to see them  is that where there is a kangaroo asked lena so eagerly that angela though thinking that mornings work enough for the feeble strength could not withstand her  besides if the merrifields were to have her wholly in another day what was the use of standing out for one afternoon  one comfort was that elizabeth who would really have the charge of the child had much more good sense and knowledge of the world than her sisterinlaw  still angela felt the only way of bearing it was that after setting mrs merrifield down she stopped the carriage at a church she knew to have a noontide litany knelt there with the little girl beside her and tried to say thy will be done  to thy keeping i commit her  her hours came to help her   quench thou the fires of hate and strife    the wasting fever of the heart from perils guard her feeble life    and to our souls thy help impart   she was able to be calm and to utter none of her rage when they came back to luncheon and marilda declaring she liked nothing so well as seeing children at the zoo wished to go with the party  all save mrs merrifield and her boy had gone different ways in london so there was plenty of room in the barouche  the boys mind was set on riding on the elephant and they walked on that way turning aside however to the yard where towered the kangaroo tall gentle graceful and gracious  lena sprang forward with a cry of joy and clasped her hands but in one moment the same spasm at first of ecstasy then of overpowering feeling becoming agony came over her and gasping and choking angela held her in her arms and carried her to a seat holding her up loosening her clothes but still she did not come round  her aunt tried to say hysteric  some one brought water but it was of no usethere were still the labouring gasps and the convulsive motion  let us take her home marilda said  nothing but hysterics repeated the aunt  i will stay with jackie  marilda found her servant and the carriage and in the long drive a few drops of strong stimulant at a chemists brought a little relief though scarcely consciousness and when angela had carried her up to her room there was a blueness about the lips a coldness about the fingers that told much  marilda had at once sent for dr brownlow as the nearest and he was at home but he could only look and do nothing but attempt to revive circulation all in vain and with marilda standing by with one convulsive clutch of angelas hand the true mother of her orphaned life little lena sank to a peaceful rest from the tribulations that awaited her here    chapter xxixsafe    rest beyond all grief and pain death to thee is truest gain keble  angelas nearest and best friends had anticipated that the peaceful climax of all her cares would be a relief to her and so indeed in the long run it would be to her higher sense and she would be thankful  but even those who knew her most thoroughly had not estimated the pangs of personal affection and deprivation of the child she had fostered with a mothers tenderness for seven years and the absolute suffering of the sudden parting even though it was to security of bliss instead of doubt and uneasiness  she was quite broken and really ill with neuralgia and exhaustion unable to attend the funeral which the merrifields wished to have at stokesley and unfit for anything but lying still with the pink parrot on the rail below kindly watched over by good marilda  the strain of many disturbed nights the perplexities the struggle for resignation all coming after a succession of trying events in australia had told heavily upon her  indeed no one guessed how much she had undergone physically as well as spiritually till marilda would not be denied the consulting dr brownlow who questioned her closely and extorted confessions of the long continued strain of exertion  rest was all she needed and marilda took care that she had it bringing robina up from minsterham to make it more effectual and letting her have visits from her bishop and from bernard as they could afford the time both being very and variously busy  angela had made up her mind to go out to australia again and to make carrigaboola an endowment for the sisterhood but the means of doing this could best be arranged there and she intended to go out when her bishop should return in the autumn feeling that her vocation was there though there was a blank in all she had most cared for on earth in that home  as soon as she had recovered she wished to spend a fortnight at dearport beginning with a retreat that was held there  remembering her old career there and the abrupt close of her novitiate she felt and spoke as if she was to be received as in penitence but to the sisters who surrounded her it was more as if they were receiving a saint  when she came back to vale leston she had recovered cheerfulness more equable than it had ever been and cherry and alda found her a charming companion  there was much going on at vale leston just then  miss arthuret and dolores were at penbeacon seriously considering of the scheme of converting the old farm house into a kind of place of study for girls who wanted to work at various technicalities and to fit themselves for usefulness or for self maintenance  there was to be more or less of the convalescent home or house of rest in combination and it had occurred to dolores that there could hardly be a better head of such an establishment than magdalen prescott  magdalen had been asked to the priory to meet angela to whom it was now a comfort and pleasure to talk of her treasure so much less lost to her than in the uncongenial surroundings threatened at coalham and the invitation followed by the proposal came at a not unpropitious moment  a railway company after much surveying much disputing and many heartburnings were actually obtaining an act of parliament empowering it to lay its cruel hands upon the goyle running its viaducts down the ravine of arnscombe and destroy all the peace and privacy  it did much as agatha had said to make the new scheme of penbeacon acceptable though  that comes of making ones nest she sighed and thinking ones self secure in it for life  oh it is worse and more changeable in this latter century than in any other  does the world go round faster  of course it does said geraldine  think how many fashions how many styles how many ways of thinking have passed away even in our own time  and what have they left behind them  something good i trust  coral cells stones for the next generation of zoophytes to stand upon to reach up higher  is it higher  in one sense i hope  the same foundation remember and each cell forms a rock for the futurea white and beautiful cell remember as it grows unconsciously beneath this creature  magdalen smiled delighted with the illustration  it forms into the rocks the strong foundations of the earth she said  when it has undergone its baptism beneath the sea added geraldine but practically and unpoetically perhapshow the young folk mount upon all our little achievements in church matters and think them nearly as oldfashioned and despicable as we did pews and black gowns  or how attempts like the schools that brought up robina and angela have shot out into high schools colleges professions and i know not what besides  ah we come to my old notions for my sisters  i thought they would have been governesses like myself but they married and now tell me what do you think of this scheme of miss mohun and agatha  you know dolores is going to her father first  i never saw him but lady merrifield and jane tell me he is a very wise highlyprincipled person perfectly to be trusted and they like all that they have heard of his young wife  i should think if agatha is to become a scientific lecturer she could not begin her career under better training  career exactly  people used not to talk of careers  life and career  tortoise and hare eh  but the hare may and ought still to reach the goal and have her cell built even if she does have her wander yahr like the young barnacles before becoming attached  no she need not become the barnacle goose  that is fabulous said mrs grinstead laughing off a little of her seriousness and adding tell me of the other girls  i think vera did not come home last year  no nor the year before  she has a good many pretty little talents and is very obliging  mrs white seems to be very fond of her and did not want to spare her when they went to gastein for the summer and this year when there was so much infection about i could not press it  is it true that there is anything between her and petros white  i know miss mohunjaneinfers it but i dont like to build upon it  i should build on most inferences that jane mohun ventured to make known said geraldine smiling and paulinas fate is pretty well fixed i suppose  dear child she has never had any other purpose since i first knew her thoroughly and i do not think her present stay at dearport will disenchant her  i think she is really devoted not to the theoretical romance of a sisterhood but to the deeper full purpose of selfdevotion  i can fully believe it of her  hers have not been the ups and downs of my angela though indeed after all she has gone through there is something in her face that brings to my mind after that ye have suffered awhile stablish strengthen settle you  it is a lovely countenanceso patient and yet so bright  i do not think anything in all her life has tried her so much as the distress about little lena and after knowing her wildnessto use a weak word for itunder other troubles i see what grace and self control have done for her  you still keep your thekla she added as the girl flashed by in company with a coeval vanderkist  for a few years to come though i am beginning to feel like the old hens who do but bring their children up to launch them on the waters  well it is happy if the launch can be made with hope present as well as faith and to see what angel has become after many vicissitudes not confined to her first years of youth is an immense encouragement  to angelas great delight the affairs of brown and underwood were found to require inspection at san francisco as well as at colombo where bernard was to put the firm into the hands of one of the browns who was to meet him there and he would then be able to come home to the central office in england  it was not expedient for phyllis to make the voyage for so brief a stay so it was decided that she should remain with her mother and she declared that she should be happy about bernard being taken care of if angela before settling in at carrigaboola would go and stay with him at ceylon  no one can tell the pleasure it is she said to magdalen to borrow ones own especial brother from his wife for a little while  oh yes i know it goes against the grain with him and it is right it should but the poor old sister enjoys her treat nevertheless and notwithstanding  there was a great family gathering at vale leston including both the harewoods and the bishop of albertstown came to spend that last fortnight in england with clement the boy who had been committed to him as a chorister then trained as a young deacon and almost driven out in his inexperience to the critical charge of the neglected parish and the old squire only to be recalled after seven years to the more important charge in london on the bishops appointment there to serve till strength gave way and he must perforce return to his former home  there was a farewell picnic of the elders at penbeacon merry and yet wistful in its hopeful auguries that the loved play place would be a glad and beneficial home  it was a strange retrospect talked over by the two old friends in deep thankfulness yet humility over their own shortcomings and failures and no less strange were the recollections of the wild noisy insubordinate schoolgirl whom the bishops sister had failed to tame and who had to both seemed to live only on sensation whether religious or secular and who had been one continual care and perplexity to each  by turns they had thought that the full church system acted as a hotbed on her peculiar temperament and at others they had thought it only an alternative to the amusements of vanity and flirtation  each had felt himself a failure with regard to her and had hoped for a fresh start from each crisis of repentance notably from the death of felix only to be disappointed by some fresh aberration  however in queensland her work had been noble and thoroughly effective in many cases it had involved much selfdenial and even danger and though these might agree with her native spirit of adventure there had likewise been not fitful but steadily earnest devotion in her convent life as well as the tenderest reverent care of mother constance in a long and painful decline and therewith a steady cheerful influence which had immensely assisted the growth of fulberts character  for some years past sister angela had been not a care but a trusty helper to the bishop and the later trials and difficulties especially the sore rending of the tie with the being she had come to love with all the force of her strong nature had been borne in a manner that bore witness to the subduing of that overrebellious and vehement spirit  and as she said to geraldine on the last evening as they bade good night this has been the very happiest time i ever spent hereyes happier than in those exultant days of new possession and liberty oh yes all experiments as it were bold ventures selfreproach and failure defiance and fun and thenoh the ache i would not confess the glory of being provoking and oh the final anguish i brought on myself and on you all and i went on when it began to wear away still stifling the sting which revived whenever i came home and all was renewed  really whenever i shammed it was only remorse  i dont think that real repentance and the peace after it began till those quiet days with dear mother constance  and is it peace now  yes i think so  even the parting with my child has not torn me up i can say it is wellfar better than leaving her far better indeed  and felix is what he meant to be my treasure not my accuser  oh i am glad to have been at home and made it all up to bear awayand leave with you the sense of peace  all who had loved and feared for her were very happy over her when all joined in that farewell service on her own birthday st michael and all angels day  the party were joined by dolores and wilfred at liverpool bernard having undertaken to establish the latter at colombo in hands as safe as might be    chapter xxxthe maiden rocks    what need we more if hearts be true our voyage safe our port in view  keble  a telegram that a steamer had been wrecked on the maiden rocks filled three homes with dismay  the rocks were sought out in maps and found to be specks lying between county antrim and scotlandno doubt terrible in their reality  another day brought something more definite  it was the afra wrecked in the fog of october 11th  boats got off  that was all but a days post brought letters of which the fullest was from dolores   corncastle larne co  antrim ireland october 12  dearest aunt lily   i trust phyllis has by this time heard from bernard as i heard him called on as a good oarsman to go in the first boat and we saw angelas bonnet  wethat is wilfred nag and the bishopare all safe here with eight or nine others  will will do well i trust he quite owes his life to nag  this is how it was  we had not long been out of the mersey before an impenetrable fog came down upon us and we could not see across the deck but on we went on what proved to be our blind way till after a night and day just as we were getting up from dinner there came a hideous shock and concussion throwing us all about the room and in less than a minute it was repeated with horrible crackings tearings yells and shouts  no one needed to tell us what it meant and down came the call dont wait to save your things only wraps ladies  up on deck  life belts if you can  i remember bernard standing at the top of the ladder helping us up and somehow i understand from him that we were on a reef and might either remain there and sink or be washed off  the fog was clearing and there was a dim light up high somewhere one of the lighthouses i believe  i dont quite know how it all went i think we kept in the background round the bishop and that a boat full of emigrant women was put off  i know there were only about half a dozen women left who had been crying and refusing to leave their husbands and about thirty altogether men and women were somehow got into our boat with the chief mate the bishop all consolation and prayer poor wilfred limp cold and trembling for he had been very seasick till the last moment when bernard pulled him out of his berth and put him into a lifebelt  the sea was not very rough with an east wind but the mate said the current was so strong he could make no way against it  it would bring us on to the irish cliffs and then god help us  knowing what that coast is i thought there was no hope and as it was beginning to grow light there rose an awful wall all black and white ready to close upon us but just as i set my teeth and tried to recollect prayers or follow the bishops but i could only squeeze agatha harder and harder there was a fresh shouting among the men and the boat was heaved up in a fearful way then down  it was tide and we were near upon breakers but there were answering shouts or so they saidi believe a line was thrown and a light shown  but as the boat rose again nag and i expected to be hurled on the rocks the next moment and clung together  but insteadthough the waves had almost torn us asunder we were lying on a stony beach and human hands were dragging at us voices calling and shouting about our not being dead  god had helped us  we had been carried into a clift where there is a coastguard station and the good men had come down and were helping us on shore but before i well knew anything agatha was on her feet i heard her cry wilfred wilfred and then i saw her dragging him quite like a dead thing out of the surf just in time before another great wave rushed in which would have washed them both back if a man had not grappled her at the very moment calling out let go let go hes a dead man  she did not let go when the wave broke happily just short of them and another came to help and saved them from being sucked back  then the bishop came and assured us that he was alive and got the men to carry him up to the coastguard cottages indeed it was an awful escape for of our boatload most were lost altogether three lie dead dashed against the rock and two more the mate one of them have broken limbs  wilfred was unconscious for a long time at least an hour but by the help of spoonfuls of whiskey he came round to a dreamy kind of state and he does not seem to suffer much and the bishop the preventive man and nag all are sure no limbs are broken but he seems incapable of movement except his hands  it may be only jar upon the spine and go off in another day or two but we do not dare to send for a doctor or anything else indeed till we have some money for we all of us have lost everything except five shillings in my pocket and two in nags  even our wraps were washed offi believe agatha gave hers to a shivering woman in the boat  the bishop too gave away his coat forgetting to secure his purse  but the people are very kind to usnorth or scotch irish presbyterians i thinkfor they dont seem to know what to make of his being a bishop when they found he was not rc though they call him his reverence  please send us an order to get cashed at larne six miles off where this is posted  wilfred lies on the good preventive womans bed clean and fairly comfortable and they have made a shakedown in their parlour for nag and me  the bishop says he is well off but i believe he is always looking after the mate and the other man in the other house and sleeps if at all in a chair  nag is the nurse  she had ambulance lessons you know when at the high school and profited by them more than i ever did and wilfred likes to have her about him and when he is dazed as he always is at first waking he calls her vera  but dont be uneasy about him dear aunt lily  deadly seasickness a night of tossing and cold and then this terrible landing may well upset him and probably he will be on his legs by the time you get this letter  i find our disaster was on the maiden rocks a horrible group i only wonder that any one gets past them  there are five of them the wicked sirens and three have lighthouses but not very efficient ones and apt to disappear in the fog and there are reefs beneath on one of which we came to grief  the folk here think a wreck on these maidens absolutely fatal so we cannot be but most thankful for being alive though it is a worse experience than the rotuma earthquake  fergus would think the place worth all we have undergone  the crags are wonderful chalk at the bottom basalt above and of course all round to the giants causeway it is finer still  well may we as the bishop is always doing give thanks that we were taken by the divine hand guiding tide and current to this milder and less inhospitable opening  we can afford to dispense with less majesty for one of those finer cliffs would have been our destruction  this is going to larne where there is a railway station and something of a town and the bishop has written to the doctor of the place  i will write again when he has been here  i hope to send you another and more cheery account tomorrow or whenever post goes  nag is writing to her sister  i trust you will have heard of bernard and angela  their boat was a better one than ours and certainly got off safely  let us know as soon you can  your most loving niece  d m mohun   agatha had also written to magdalen very briefly to assure her of her safety and thankfulness and to say she could not leave wilfred till more efficient care arrived or till she had means to come back with  she was evidently too busy over her patient to have much possibility of writing even if she had paper which seemed to be scarce at corncastle  the bishop also wrote to clement and to sir jasper and others but he also could say little only that he trusted that angela and bernard were safe elsewhere having heard them called and as he believed seen them off in the first boat so that probably they had been already heard of before these letters arrived  their own party had been spared from being dashed against the rocks almost by a miracle and agatha prescotts courage and readiness as now her nursing faculties were beyond all praise as indeed was the brave patience of miss mohun  he could only look on and be thankful and hope for tidings of those who were as his own children  the next days letters spoke of the doctor as so much perplexed about wilfred and nothing had been heard at larne of the other boats  but no tidings came there was too much cause to fear that the first boat had been borne away by the currents and swamped  lady merrifield could not leave phyllis in such a crisis of suspense and sir jasper was hardly fit for such a journey so that his wife was much relieved when her brother general mohun came to clipstone and undertook to hasten out to corncastle with money and appliances including a nurse  oh reggie always good at need  i hardly dare to send my good old halfpenny  no mamma send me  you know i had the ambulance lessons with nag said mysie and we could get a real nurse from belfast or dublin if it was wanted  so it was arranged and uncle and niece started but hope faded more and more  were those two precious young lives so early quenched    chapter xxxithe wreck    how purer were earth if all its martyrdoms if all its struggling sighs of sacrifice were swept away e hamilton king  no tidings of bernard and angela  the suspense began to diminish into wanhope or despair and the brothers and sisters continued to say that they were sorry above all for phyllis whose gentle sweetness had made her one with them  but at last one forenoon a telegram was put into clements hand dated from ewmouth   muriel ellen ewmouth harbour october 14th  blaine to rev underwood  brother here  come to infirmary   clement and geraldine lost no time in driving to the infirmary too anxious to speak to one another  blaines name was known to them as a gwenworth lad who had gone to sea and risen to be sailing master of the muriel ellen a trader plying between londonderry and bristol he with another who proved to be the american captain of the afra were at the gate of the hospital where an ambulance had just entered  oh  sir as clement held out his hand i could not save her  id have given my life  my brother as clement returned his grasp fervently  weve just got him in here sir  i hope  i hope  and heres the doctor  the house surgeon who of course knew the rector of vale leston met him with best see him before we touch him it will set his mind at restyou must be prepared sirno better not you mrs grinstead  clement followed in silence leaving geraldine to the care of the matron  all he was allowed to see was a ghastly deathlike face and form covered with rugs lying prostrate on a mattress but as he came in at the sound of his step there was a quiver of recognition the eyes opened and looked up the lips moved and as clement bent down with a kiss there was a faint sound gasped out telegraph to clipstone  i will i will at once  it was noble  then was added she gave herself for the bishop for me  then the eyes closed and unconsciousness seemed to prevail  some one came and put clement aside saying   go now sir you shall hear  clement who thought it might be death would have stayed at hand but he was turned away and could only murmur an inarticulate blessing and prayer as he meant to fulfil the earnest desire that was thought to have been conned over and over again by bernard as these half sentences recurred again and again in semiconsciousness his telegram despatched clement returned to his sister to hear from the two masters all they had to tell  captain miller of the afra had slight hurts which had been looked to before he should take the train for london and blaine had waited to tell his story before pursuing his voyage to bristol both indeed to hear the report of the patient and likewise to collect the news of the few who had been landed at corncastle to the great relief of captain miller but of the first boat there were no tidings and blaine thought there was little probability that it had not sunk or been dashed against the crags of the savage coast  captain millers account was that not long after leaving the mersey there had set in an impenetrable fog lasting for a night and a day there was perhaps some confusion as to charts and the scarcely visible lights upon the maidens  at any rate the afra had suddenly struck on a reef and shifting at once had been hopelessly rent so as to leave no hope save in the boats  every one seemed to have behaved with the resolute fortitude and unselfishness generally shown by english and americans in the like circumstances  the sea was not in a dangerous state and there was a steady east wind so that the boats were lowered without much difficulty and most of the women disposed of in the first  before the second could be put off however the water had reached the fires there was a violent lurch the ship had heeled completely over washing many overboard and of course causing a great confusion among those who had been steady before and making the deck almost perpendicular  the captain however succeeded in lowering another boat and putting into it as he trusted the few remaining women the bishop and most of the men  this was of course that which had safely reached corncastle and of which he only now heard  the last boat was so overcrowded that he with three of his crew had thought it best to remain for the almost desperate chance of being picked up before they sank  he had supposed mr underwood had been washed overboard in the heeling over of the ship and that his sister had been put into the first boat but presently he heard a call  oh help me please  and he became aware that sister angela was hanging over her brother who lay crushed by a heavy chest which had fallen on him and thrown him against the gunwale though a moan or two showed him to be still alive  the remaining sailors removed the weight lifted him and laid him in the best place and position they could while his sister hung over him and supported his head  to millers dismayed exclamation at finding a woman still on board she replied   it was no fault of yours  i hid below  other livesthe bishops were what mattered  i am glad to be here  he believed that mr underwood had revived enough to know his sister for he had heard her voice talking to him  yes and singing but it was not for very long  the wreck was in motion being carried by current and tide along the channel and if it did not sink might be perceived now that daylight had come and a signal of distress might be seen by some passing vessel  seen it was in fact and that there were persons to be rescued and blaine who was on his way from londonderry to bristol in the muriel ellen a cattleboat possessed a boat in which to attempt a rescue  all that experienced sailors could do in transferring the helpless and unconscious form to the boat first and then to the sloop had been done but it was no wonder that in the transit angela more heedful of her brothers safety than her own had fallen between and been lost in the waves to the extreme grief of tom blaine who had been one of her scholars and devoted to her as all the boys of vale leston were  the cattleboat had few facilities for comfort and all he could do was to let mr bernard underwood lie as softly as could be contrived on deck and make sail for ewmouth so as to land him as near home as possible  how far he had been conscious it was impossible to say though once he had asked for angela but had seemed to understand from an evasion that she was missing and had said no more but muttered parts of these requests as if afraid of not being capable of them  all this had been told or implied while messages came down that the surgeons did not think the injuries need be mortal provided the exhaustion and exposure had not fatal consequences  the left arm two ribs and the leg had been broken and were reduced before the doctors ventured on a hopeful report with which to send home the brother and sister  one sight clement was allowed of a more unconscious but much less distressed face and one murmur noble phyllis and he was promised a telegram later in the day  the two hardly knew which to feel most grief or thankfulness the loss or the mercy and yetand yetafter the fitful wayward yet always devout life with all its strains there was a sense of wistful acceptance of such a close  they felt it all the more deeply when a day or two later bernard was able to say at intervals for the injury rendered speech difficult and almost dangerous as clement leant over him   yes  i woke to see her face over me all bright in wavy hair just as when we were children and she said bear  bear we are going together  then somehow she tried to help me to trust for phyllis and lily  then his voice sank but presently he added there was more but it is like a dream  she was singing in her own own voice  there was lead kindly light and when it came to angel faces smile there was a cryquite gladthere there on the water  felix  coming for us  oh and another one  lord into thy hands  that is all i knowa kiss here and yes thanks  for me  but the lifting hurt so much that i lost all sense when she must have fallen between the wreck and the boat  you are glad for her  mine own mine angel  safe home said clement  oh thankworthy    chapter xxxiianchored    safe home safe home in port    rent cordage shattered deck torn sails provision short    and only not a wreck but all the joy upon the shore to tell our voyage the perils oer  safe home  it might be said in another sense for bernard for he was naturally so strong and healthy that the effects of exposure and exhaustion were not long in passing off the injury to the chest proved to be only temporary and having cased him like a statue in plaster of paris the surgeons decided to the joy of his family that the more serious injuries would be better recovered from in the fresh air of vale leston than in the fishy muddy atmosphere of ewmouth  so he was transported thither and installed in felixs study among the familiar sights and sounds and where another joy awaited him and where he lay in happy stillness  phyllis had borne up bravely through the suspense never relinquishing a strong assurance of hope but when that hope was actually crowned by the first telegram the reaction set in and she had broken down so entirely that her mother durst not let her move at first and indeed accompanied her and her little girl as far as the junction being herself on the way to larne  and geraldines heart was at peace when she saw phyllis sitting by the bed her hand in his content to see and not to speak  another visitor appeared the following day namely the bishop of albertstown who had remained at larne till he could see his fellow passengers in safe hands  then he had crossed to bristol and before his hurried visit to his sisters he could not but come to see his beloved old pupil clement and share with him those reminiscences of her who as he had only now learnt had given her young superabundant life for him a man growing into age whose work might be nearly done  he only saw bernard in silence but heard from clement the account of those last moments which showed how entirely angela had been conscious of what she was doing and how willingly she had devoted herself to save those whom she loved and valued  while yet they talked there was a fresh arrival  sir ferdinand travis underwood who could not forbear the running down to hear perfectly all that was to be heard and to make arrangements that might relieve bernards mind if he were indeed on the way of recovery  in fact almost the first thought after that of the wife and child had been the security of the drenched stained and soiled pocket book nor would the patient be satisfied till he had been allowed himself to hand it over to the head of his firm with there fernan safe though smashed with me  tell brown  never mind brown or anything else but getting well bernard  i have taken our passage for next week  i shall get things arranged so that you need not think of being wanted again out there  we will find a berth for you in the office in town as soon as you are about again  bernards eye lightened  i hope  but ferdinand would not let him either thank or hope scarcely even allow any words from phyllis who could not be grateful enough for the relief  to alda who had received her old companion since marilda seemed unable to let her husband out of her sight it was explained that she was going too happen what would  oh yes it was true she was a shocking bad sailor but she was not going to have fernans ships running upon rocks or getting on fire or anything of that sort without her  she wanted to see about ludmilla schmetterling who was reported to have found a lover while studying at a class in the states and she also meant to settle her own especial niece emilia whose husband was to take bernards place in ceylon and who had become heartily tired of londons secondrate gaieties  those thus concerned met at the memorial service in the morning before the bishop quitted them where many parishioners gathered who had been spellbound in angelas freakish days of early girlhood and who were greatly touched when the committal to the deep was inserted from the forms of prayer to be used at sea  it brought a deep sense of awe and thankfulness to those who had feared and wondered through the stormy uncertain life and now could exult in what was almost a martyrdom and had brought their beloved one to the great pure grave as her baptism for eternity  some months later while bernard still lay on his couch but could speak and be glad he rejoiced indeed for a sore in his heart was healed when two fair babes were brought to hima boy who would be as another firstborn son and a little maiden who would bear that name which had become dear and saintly in the peculiar calendar of vale leston    chapter xxxiiifarewell    nay your pardon  cry you forward  yours are youth we hope but i  browning  the visit of the bishop of albertstown had in fact been deferred till he could quit his fellowsufferers especially wilfred who could not well be left to the charge of the two girls with the larne doctor evidently in difficulty about his case  it was with great joy that a telegram was received with tidings that general mohun and mysie were on the way and also magdalen prescott who met them at liverpool being unable to stay away from agatha under such circumstances  at belfast they obtained a trained nurse and a doctor was to follow them  the joy of the meeting between magdalen and agatha was almost that of mother and daughter and nothing could be more entirely convincing that they were one  indeed agatha was thoroughly worn out for the main strain of attendance had fallen upon her since the bishop was fully occupied with some of the seriously hurt in other cottages and though dolores tried to be helpful it was chiefly in outside work and attempts at sick cookery in which she was rather too scientific and found the lack of appliances very inconvenient  besides cousin though she was or perhaps for that very reason wilfred was far less amenable to her voice than agathas and if she attempted authority it was sure to rouse all the resistance left in him  agatha had been constantly on the alert liable to be called on every halfhour to soothe fretful distress over impossible impatience at delay anger at want of comforts and dolefulness over the chances of improvements and abuse whether just or not of the only accessible doctor  in fact magdalen on seeing how utterly worn out she was and how little space the cottages afforded thought it best now that the patient was in the hands of sister uncle and nurse to carry her off at once by the return car to larne and dolores thought it best to accompany them after mysie had hung on her as one restored from death  but mysie was absorbed in her brother and dolores had a strong yearning to be with her father so strong that she decided not to return to england but to procure a second outfit at belfast and to set forth again from thence nothing daunted for as she said not carelessly such things did not happen immediately after in a second voyage  in fact though thankful and impressed by the loss of the others she had gone through the crisis of the life of her heart and affections and she had likewise been once in imminent peril through a convulsion of nature  thus she was inclined to look on the wreck and the irish cliffs as an experience in the way of business so she was resolved to see the giants causeway and to make notes upon it for her lectures  but it was a different thing with agatha  she had been brought face to face with death and though the actual time had been spent in hurry and bustle and even the subsequent tossing in the boat had been not so much waiting and thinking as attending to others more terrified and injured than herself and there followed the incessant waiting on wilfred still the experiences had worked in  she rested very silently dwelling little to magdalen on her thoughts but each word she said and her very countenance showed that she had made a great step in life and realised the spiritual world which hitherto had been outside her lifenot disbelieved but almost matter of speculation and study  she was not at all desirous of falling back from dolores whose grave steadiness and fortitude the result of a truly brave and deep trust had given her a sense of confidence and protection  so they wrote and arranged for their passage and with magdalen spent the intermediate time in needful preparations at belfast and in an expedition to the causeway where they laid in a stock of notes and observations all in a spirit that made magdalen feel that she knew both in a manner she had never done before and loved them with a deep value and confidence  wilfred meanwhile made very slow if any progress  they took him to belfast as soon as it was possible and his mother came to him  he was gentle and quiet with little power of movement and scarcely any of thought and in a consultation of doctors the verdict was given that he must be carefully tended for months if not for years to come and though there might finally be full recovery yet it would depend on the most tender and careful treatment of body and mind  london doctors when he could be moved thither confirmed the decision and he began a helpless invalid life in which a certain indifference and dulness made him a much less peevish and trying patient than would have been anticipated  mysie was his willing but intelligent slave and his mother was not only thankful to have him brought back to her at any price but reallythough she would not have confessed it even to herselfwas less troubled and anxious about him than she had been since he had begun to roam in youths uncertain wilds  indeed there were hopes that slow recovery might find him a much changed person in character  he had become so uninterested in his former predilections that he heard with little emotion that vera was to marry petros white  i thought she would take up with some cad he said  but his family were really glad that this wedding was to take place at rocca marina whither the two sisters and magdalen were invited  paulina would not go  she still resented the treatment of hubert delrio and she was devoted to her study of nursing at the dearport sisterhood but magdalen thought it right to take thekla and give her the advantages of improvement in languages and the sight of fine scenery  and certainly rocca marina was a wonderful place for marriages vera handsome and happy and likely to turn into a fairly good commonplace wife had no sooner been sent off on a honeymoon tour to greece and egypt and mrs white had begged the other two to prolong their visit considering perhaps if one or the other aunt or niece could not be promoted to the vacant post of ladyinwaiting than hubert delrio came to secure specimens of marble for some mosaic work on which he was engaged  he was fast becoming a man of mark whom the whites were delighted to receive and entertain and who was delighted to be with the old friends who had had so great an influence on his life  and was it magdalen alone to whom he chiefly looked up as his helper and guide  so he thought but before the time of separation had come he had found out that thekla was far prettier than ever vera had been and with a mind and principleno flapsy but a real sympathetic and poetic nature which had grown up in these years  young as she was their destinies were fixed  and magdalen  the railroad had obtained authority to pass through the goyle and thus break up her home and shelter  still she was not tempted by adeline whites desire to make her a companion but rather she accepted the plan on which dolores had first started and on which elizabeth merrifield and miss arthuret were set of making her the head of their home at penbeacon partly a convalescent home and partly a training college for young women in need of technical instruction in nursing or other possible feminine avocations  tom may was delighted with all it might set on foot and clement saw in her leading the hopes that a high and pure spirit might inspire it    footnotes
