     281      epilogue                                     300      how robin hood cane to be an outlaw  in merry england in the time of old when good king henry the second ruled the land there lived within the green glades of sherwood forest near nottingham town a famous outlaw whose name was robin hood no archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill and cunning as his nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore merry men that roamed with him through the greenwood shades right merrily they dwelled within the depths of sherwood forest suffering neither care nor want but passing the time in merry games of archery or bouts of cudgel play living upon the kings venison washed down with draughts of ale of october brewing  not only robin himself but all the band were outlaws and dwelled apart from other men yet they were beloved by the country people round about for no one ever came to jolly robin for help in time of need and went away again with an empty fist  and now i will tell how it came about that robin hood fell afoul of the law  when robin was a youth of eighteen stout of sinew and bold of heart the sheriff of nottingham proclaimed a shooting match and offered a prize of a butt of ale to whosoever should shoot the best shaft in nottinghamshire now quoth robin will i go too for fain would i draw a string for the bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good october brewing so up he got and took his good stout yew bow and a score or more of broad clothyard arrows and started off from locksley town through sherwood forest to nottingham  it was at the dawn of day in the merry maytime when hedgerows are green and flowers bedeck the meadows daisies pied and yellow cuckoo buds and fair primroses all along the briery hedges when apple buds blossom and sweet birds sing the lark at dawn of day the throstle cock and cuckoo when lads and lasses look upon each other with sweet thoughts when busy housewives spread their linen to bleach upon the bright green grass sweet was the greenwood as he walked along its paths and bright the green and rustling leaves amid which the little birds sang with might and main and blithely robin whistled as he trudged along thinking of maid marian and her bright eyes for at such times a youths thoughts are wont to turn pleasantly upon the lass that he loves the best  as thus he walked along with a brisk step and a merry whistle he came suddenly upon some foresters seated beneath a great oak tree fifteen there were in all making themselves merry with feasting and drinking as they sat around a huge pasty to which each man helped himself thrusting his hands into the pie and washing down that which they ate with great horns of ale which they drew all foaming from a barrel that stood nigh each man was clad in lincoln green and a fine show they made seated upon the sward beneath that fair spreading tree then one of them with his mouth full called out to robin hulloa where goest thou little lad with thy onepenny bow and thy farthing shafts  then robin grew angry for no stripling likes to be taunted with his green years  now quoth he my bow and eke mine arrows are as good as shine and moreover i go to the shooting match at nottingham town which same has been proclaimed by our good sheriff of nottinghamshire there i will shoot with other stout yeomen for a prize has been offered of a fine butt of ale  then one who held a horn of ale in his hand said ho listen to the lad why boy thy mothers milk is yet scarce dry upon thy lips and yet thou pratest of standing up with good stout men at nottingham butts thou who art scarce able to draw one string of a twostone bow  ill hold the best of you twenty marks quoth bold robin that i hit the clout at threescore rods by the good help of our lady fair  at this all laughed aloud and one said well boasted thou fair infant well boasted and well thou knowest that no target is nigh to make good thy wager  and another cried he will be taking ale with his milk next  at this robin grew right mad hark ye said he yonder at the glades end i see a herd of deer even more than threescore rods distant ill hold you twenty marks that by leave of our lady i cause the best hart among them to die  now done cried he who had spoken first and here are twenty marks i wager that thou causest no beast to die with or without the aid of our lady  then robin took his good yew bow in his hand and placing the tip at his instep he strung it right deftly then he nocked a broad clothyard arrow and raising the bow drew the gray goose feather to his ear the next moment the bowstring rang and the arrow sped down the glade as a sparrowhawk skims in a northern wind high leaped the noblest hart of all the herd only to fall dead reddening the green path with his hearts blood  ha cried robin how likest thou that shot good fellow i wot the wager were mine an it were three hundred pounds  then all the foresters were filled with rage and he who had spoken the first and had lost the wager was more angry than all  nay cried he the wager is none of thine and get thee gone straightway or by all the saints of heaven ill baste thy sides until thou wilt neer be able to walk again knowest thou not said another that thou hast killed the kings deer and by the laws of our gracious lord and sovereign king harry thine ears should be shaven close to thy head  catch him cried a third  nay said a fourth let him een go because of his tender years  never a word said robin hood but he looked at the foresters with a grim face then turning on his heel strode away from them down the forest glade but his heart was bitterly angry for his blood was hot and youthful and prone to boil  now well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left robin hood alone but his anger was hot both because the youth had gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that he had been quaffing so of a sudden without any warning he sprang to his feet and seized upon his bow and fitted it to a shaft ay cried he and ill hurry thee anon and he sent the arrow whistling after robin  it was well for robin hood that that same foresters head was spinning with ale or else he would never have taken another step as it was the arrow whistled within three inches of his head then he turned around and quickly drew his own bow and sent an arrow back in return  ye said i was no archer cried he aloud but say so now again  the shaft flew straight the archer fell forward with a cry and lay on his face upon the ground his arrows rattling about him from out of his quiver the gray goose shaft wet with his hearts blood then before the others could gather their wits about them robin hood was gone into the depths of the greenwood some started after him but not with much heart for each feared to suffer the death of his fellow so presently they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to nottingham town  meanwhile robin hood ran through the greenwood gone was all the joy and brightness from everything for his heart was sick within him and it was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man  alas cried he thou hast found me an archer that will make thy wife to wring i would that thou hadst neer said one word to me or that i had never passed thy way or een that my right forefinger had been stricken off ere that this had happened in haste i smote but grieve i sore at leisure and then even in his trouble he remembered the old saw that what is done is done and the egg cracked cannot be cured  and so he came to dwell in the greenwood that was to be his home for many a year to come never again to see the happy days with the lads and lasses of sweet locksley town for he was outlawed not only because he had killed a man but also because he had poached upon the kings deer and two hundred pounds were set upon his head as a reward for whoever would bring him to the court of the king  now the sheriff of nottingham swore that he himself would bring this knave robin hood to justice and for two reasons first because he wanted the two hundred pounds and next because the forester that robin hood had killed was of kin to him  but robin hood lay hidden in sherwood forest for one year and in that time there gathered around him many others like himself cast out from other folk for this cause and for that some had shot deer in hungry wintertime when they could get no other food and had been seen in the act by the foresters but had escaped thus saving their ears some had been turned out of their inheritance that their farms might be added to the kings lands in sherwood forest some had been despoiled by a great baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquireall for one cause or another had come to sherwood to escape wrong and oppression  so in all that year fivescore or more good stout yeomen gathered about robin hood and chose him to be their leader and chief then they vowed that even as they themselves had been despoiled they would despoil their oppressors whether baron abbot knight or squire and that from each they would take that which had been wrung from the poor by unjust taxes or land rents or in wrongful fines but to the poor folk they would give a helping hand in need and trouble and would return to them that which had been unjustly taken from them besides this they swore never to harm a child nor to wrong a woman be she maid wife or widow so that after a while when the people began to find that no harm was meant to them but that money or food came in time of want to many a poor family they came to praise robin and his merry men and to tell many tales of him and of his doings in sherwood forest for they felt him to be one of themselves  up rose robin hood one merry morn when all the birds were singing blithely among the leaves and up rose all his merry men each fellow washing his head and hands in the cold brown brook that leaped laughing from stone to stone then said robin for fourteen days have we seen no sport so now i will go abroad to seek adventures forthwith but tarry ye my merry men all here in the greenwood only see that ye mind well my call three blasts upon the bugle horn i will blow in my hour of need then come quickly for i shall want your aid  so saying he strode away through the leafy forest glades until he had come to the verge of sherwood there he wandered for a long time through highway and byway through dingly dell and forest skirts now he met a fair buxom lass in a shady lane and each gave the other a merry word and passed their way now he saw a fair lady upon an ambling pad to whom he doffed his cap and who bowed sedately in return to the fair youth now he saw a fat monk on a pannierladen ass now a gallant knight with spear and shield and armor that flashed brightly in the sunlight now a page clad in crimson and now a stout burgher from good nottingham town pacing along with serious footsteps all these sights he saw but adventure found he none at last he took a road by the forest skirts a bypath that dipped toward a broad pebbly stream spanned by a narrow bridge made of a log of wood as he drew nigh this bridge he saw a tall stranger coming from the other side thereupon robin quickened his pace as did the stranger likewise each thinking to cross first  now stand thou back quoth robin and let the better man cross first  nay answered the stranger then stand back shine own self for the better man i wet am i  that will we presently see quoth robin and meanwhile stand thou where thou art or else by the bright brow of saint aelfrida i will show thee right good nottingham play with a clothyard shaft betwixt thy ribs  now quoth the stranger i will tan thy hide till it be as many colors as a beggars cloak if thou darest so much as touch a string of that same bow that thou holdest in thy hands  thou pratest like an ass said robin for i could send this shaft clean through thy proud heart before a curtal friar could say grace over a roast goose at michaelmastide  and thou pratest like a coward answered the stranger for thou standest there with a good yew bow to shoot at my heart while i have nought in my hand but a plain blackthorn staff wherewith to meet thee  now quoth robin by the faith of my heart never have i had a cowards name in all my life before i will lay by my trusty bow and eke my arrows and if thou darest abide my coming i will go and cut a cudgel to test thy manhood withal  ay marry that will i abide thy coming and joyously too quoth the stranger whereupon he leaned sturdily upon his staff to await robin  then robin hood stepped quickly to the coverside and cut a good staff of ground oak straight without new and six feet in length and came back trimming away the tender stems from it while the stranger waited for him leaning upon his staff and whistling as he gazed round about robin observed him furtively as he trimmed his staff measuring him from top to toe from out the corner of his eye and thought that he had never seen a lustier or a stouter man tall was robin but taller was the stranger by a head and a neck for he was seven feet in height broad was robin across the shoulders but broader was the stranger by twice the breadth of a palm while he measured at least an ell around the waist  nevertheless said robin to himself i will baste thy hide right merrily my good fellow then aloud lo here is my good staff lusty and tough now wait my coming an thou darest and meet me an thou fearest not then we will fight until one or the other of us tumble into the stream by dint of blows  marry that meeteth my whole heart cried the stranger twirling his staff above his head betwixt his fingers and thumb until it whistled again  never did the knights of arthurs round table meet in a stouter fight than did these two in a moment robin stepped quickly upon the bridge where the stranger stood first he made a feint and then delivered a blow at the strangers head that had it met its mark would have tumbled him speedily into the water but the stranger turned the blow right deftly and in return gave one as stout which robin also turned as the stranger had done so they stood each in his place neither moving a fingersbreadth back for one good hour and many blows were given and received by each in that time till here and there were sore bones and bumps yet neither thought of crying enough nor seemed likely to fall from off the bridge now and then they stopped to rest and each thought that he never had seen in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff at last robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun so shrewd was the stroke that the stranger came within a hairsbreadth of falling off the bridge but he regained himself right quickly and by a dexterous blow gave robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to flow then robin grew mad with anger and smote with all his might at the other but the stranger warded the blow and once again thwacked robin and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the water as the queen pin falls in a game of bowls  and where art thou now my good lad shouted the stranger roaring with laughter  oh in the flood and floating adown with the tide cried robin nor could he forbear laughing himself at his sorry plight then gaining his feet he waded to the bank the little fish speeding hither and thither all frightened at his splashing  give me thy hand cried he when he had reached the bank i must needs own thou art a brave and a sturdy soul and withal a good stout stroke with the cudgels by this and by that my head hummeth like to a hive of bees on a hot june day  then he clapped his horn to his lips and winded a blast that went echoing sweetly down the forest paths ay marry quoth he again thou art a tall lad and eke a brave one for neer i bow is there a man betwixt here and canterbury town could do the like to me that thou hast done  and thou quoth the stranger laughing takest thy cudgeling like a brave heart and a stout yeoman  but now the distant twigs and branches rustled with the coming of men and suddenly a score or two of good stout yeomen all clad in lincoln green burst from out the covert with merry will stutely at their head  good master cried will how is this truly thou art all wet from head to foot and that to the very skin  why marry answered jolly robin yon stout fellow hath tumbled me neck and crop into the water and hath given me a drubbing beside  then shall he not go without a ducking and eke a drubbing himself cried will stutely have at him lads  then will and a score of yeomen leaped upon the stranger but though they sprang quickly they found him ready and felt him strike right and left with his stout staff so that though he went down with press of numbers some of them rubbed cracked crowns before he was overcome  nay forbear cried robin laughing until his sore sides ached again he is a right good man and true and no harm shall befall him now hark ye good youth wilt thou stay with me and be one of my band three suits of lincoln green shalt thou have each year beside forty marks in fee and share with us whatsoever good shall befall us thou shalt eat sweet venison and quaff the stoutest ale and mine own good righthand man shalt thou be for never did i see such a cudgel player in all my life before speak wilt thou be one of my good merry men  that know i not quoth the stranger surlily for he was angry at being so tumbled about if ye handle yew bow and apple shaft no better than ye do oaken cudgel i wot ye are not fit to be called yeomen in my country but if there be any man here that can shoot a better shaft than i then will i bethink me of joining with you  now by my faith said robin thou art a right saucy varlet sirrah yet i will stoop to thee as i never stooped to man before good stutely cut thou a fair white piece of bark four fingers in breadth and set it fourscore yards distant on yonder oak now stranger hit that fairly with a gray goose shaft and call thyself an archer  ay marry that will i answered he give me a good stout bow and a fair broad arrow and if i hit it not strip me and beat me blue with bowstrings  then he chose the stoutest bow among them all next to robins own and a straight gray goose shaft wellfeathered and smooth and stepping to the markwhile all the band sitting or lying upon the greensward watched to see him shoothe drew the arrow to his cheek and loosed the shaft right deftly sending it so straight down the path that it clove the mark in the very center aha cried he mend thou that if thou canst while even the yeomen clapped their hands at so fair a shot  that is a keen shot indeed quoth robin mend it i cannot but mar it i may perhaps  then taking up his own good stout bow and nocking an arrow with care he shot with his very greatest skill straight flew the arrow and so true that it lit fairly upon the strangers shaft and split it into splinters then all the yeomen leaped to their feet and shouted for joy that their master had shot so well  now by the lusty yew bow of good saint withold cried the stranger that is a shot indeed and never saw i the like in all my life before now truly will i be thy man henceforth and for aye good adam bell1 was a fair shot but never shot he so        1 adam bell clym o the clough and william of cloudesly      were three noted northcountry bowmen whose names have been      celebrated in many ballads of the olden time   then have i gained a right good man this day quoth jolly robin what name goest thou by good fellow  men call me john little whence i came answered the stranger  then will stutely who loved a good jest spoke up nay fair little stranger said he i like not thy name and fain would i have it otherwise little art thou indeed and small of bone and sinew therefore shalt thou be christened little john and i will be thy godfather  then robin hood and all his band laughed aloud until the stranger began to grow angry  an thou make a jest of me quoth he to will stutely thou wilt have sore bones and little pay and that in short season  nay good friend said robin hood bottle thine anger for the name fitteth thee well little john shall thou be called henceforth and little john shall it be so come my merry men we will prepare a christening feast for this fair infant  so turning their backs upon the stream they plunged into the forest once more through which they traced their steps till they reached the spot where they dwelled in the depths of the woodland there had they built huts of bark and branches of trees and made couches of sweet rushes spread over with skins of fallow deer here stood a great oak tree with branches spreading broadly around beneath which was a seat of green moss where robin hood was wont to sit at feast and at merrymaking with his stout men about him here they found the rest of the band some of whom had come in with a brace of fat does then they all built great fires and after a time roasted the does and broached a barrel of humming ale then when the feast was ready they all sat down but robin placed little john at his right hand for he was henceforth to be the second in the band  then when the feast was done will stutely spoke up it is now time i ween to christen our bonny babe is it not so merry boys and aye aye cried all laughing till the woods echoed with their mirth  then seven sponsors shall we have quoth will stutely and hunting among all the band he chose the seven stoutest men of them all  now by saint dunstan cried little john springing to his feet more than one of you shall rue it an you lay finger upon me  but without a word they all ran upon him at once seizing him by his legs and arms and holding him tightly in spite of his struggles and they bore him forth while all stood around to see the sport then one came forward who had been chosen to play the priest because he had a bald crown and in his hand he carried a brimming pot of ale now who bringeth this babe asked he right soberly  that do i answered will stutely  and what name callest thou him  little john call i him  now little john quoth the mock priest thou hast not lived heretofore but only got thee along through the world but henceforth thou wilt live indeed when thou livedst not thou wast called john little but now that thou dost live indeed little john shalt thou be called so christen i thee and at these last words he emptied the pot of ale upon little johns head  then all shouted with laughter as they saw the good brown ale stream over little johns beard and trickle from his nose and chin while his eyes blinked with the smart of it at first he was of a mind to be angry but found he could not because the others were so merry so he too laughed with the rest then robin took this sweet pretty babe clothed him all anew from top to toe in lincoln green and gave him a good stout bow and so made him a member of the merry band  and thus it was that robin hood became outlawed thus a band of merry companions gathered about him and thus he gained his righthand man little john and so the prologue ends and now i will tell how the sheriff of nottingham three times sought to take robin hood and how he failed each time     robin hood and the tinker  now it was told before how two hundred pounds were set upon robin hoods head and how the sheriff of nottingham swore that he himself would seize robin both because he would fain have the two hundred pounds and because the slain man was a kinsman of his own now the sheriff did not yet know what a force robin had about him in sherwood but thought that he might serve a warrant for his arrest as he could upon any other man that had broken the laws therefore he offered fourscore golden angels to anyone who would serve this warrant but men of nottingham town knew more of robin hood and his doings than the sheriff did and many laughed to think of serving a warrant upon the bold outlaw knowing well that all they would get for such service would be cracked crowns so that no one came forward to take the matter in hand thus a fortnight passed in which time none came forward to do the sheriffs business then said he a right good reward have i offered to whosoever would serve my warrant upon robin hood and i marvel that no one has come to undertake the task  then one of his men who was near him said good master thou wottest not the force that robin hood has about him and how little he cares for warrant of king or sheriff truly no one likes to go on this service for fear of cracked crowns and broken bones  then i hold all nottingham men to be cowards said the sheriff and let me see the man in all nottinghamshire that dare disobey the warrant of our sovereign lord king harry for by the shrine of saint edmund i will hang him forty cubits high but if no man in nottingham dare win fourscore angels i will send elsewhere for there should be men of mettle somewhere in this land  then he called up a messenger in whom he placed great trust and bade him saddle his horse and make ready to go to lincoln town to see whether he could find anyone there that would do his bidding and win the reward so that same morning the messenger started forth upon his errand  bright shone the sun upon the dusty highway that led from nottingham to lincoln stretching away all white over hill and dale dusty was the highway and dusty the throat of the messenger so that his heart was glad when he saw before him the sign of the blue boar inn when somewhat more than half his journey was done the inn looked fair to his eyes and the shade of the oak trees that stood around it seemed cool and pleasant so he alighted from his horse to rest himself for a time calling for a pot of ale to refresh his thirsty throat  there he saw a party of right jovial fellows seated beneath the spreading oak that shaded the greensward in front of the door there was a tinker two barefoot friars and a party of six of the kings foresters all clad in lincoln green and all of them were quaffing humming ale and singing merry ballads of the good old times loud laughed the foresters as jests were bandied about between the singing and louder laughed the friars for they were lusty men with beards that curled like the wool of black rams but loudest of all laughed the tinker and he sang more sweetly than any of the rest his bag and his hammer hung upon a twig of the oak tree and near by leaned his good stout cudgel as thick as his wrist and knotted at the end  come cried one of the foresters to the tired messenger come join us for this shot ho landlord bring a fresh pot of ale for each man  the messenger was glad enough to sit down along with the others who were there for his limbs were weary and the ale was good  now what news bearest thou so fast quoth one and whither ridest thou today  the messenger was a chatty soul and loved a bit of gossip dearly besides the pot of ale warmed his heart so that settling himself in an easy corner of the inn bench while the host leaned upon the doorway and the hostess stood with her hands beneath her apron he unfolded his budget of news with great comfort he told all from the very first how robin hood had slain the forester and how he had hidden in the greenwood to escape the law how that he lived therein all against the law god wot slaying his majestys deer and levying toll on fat abbot knight and esquire so that none dare travel even on broad watling street or the fosse way for fear of him how that the sheriff had a mind to serve the kings warrant upon this same rogue though little would he mind warrant of either king or sheriff for he was far from being a lawabiding man then he told how none could be found in all nottingham town to serve this warrant for fear of cracked pates and broken bones and how that he the messenger was now upon his way to lincoln town to find of what mettle the lincoln men might be  now come i forsooth from good banbury town said the jolly tinker and no one nigh nottinghamnor sherwood either an that be the markcan hold cudgel with my grip why lads did i not meet that mad wag simon of ely even at the famous fair at hertford town and beat him in the ring at that place before sir robert of leslie and his lady this same robin hood of whom i wot i never heard before is a right merry blade but gin he be strong am not i stronger and gin he be sly am not i slyer now by the bright eyes of nan o the mill and by mine own name and thats wat o the crabstaff and by mine own mothers son and thats myself will i even i wat o the crabstaff meet this same sturdy rogue and gin he mind not the seal of our glorious sovereign king harry and the warrant of the good sheriff of nottinghamshire i will so bruise beat and bemaul his pate that he shall never move finger or toe again hear ye that bully boys  now art thou the man for my farthing cried the messenger and back thou goest with me to nottingham town  nay quoth the tinker shaking his head slowly from side to side go i with no man gin it be not with mine own free will  nay nay said the messenger no man is there in nottinghamshire could make thee go against thy will thou brave fellow  ay that be i brave said the tinker  ay marry said the messenger thou art a brave lad but our good sheriff hath offered fourscore angels of bright gold to whosoever shall serve the warrant upon robin hood though little good will it do  then i will go with thee lad do but wait till i get my bag and hammer and my cudgel ay let me but meet this same robin hood and let me see whether he will not mind the kings warrant so after having paid their score the messenger with the tinker striding beside his nag started back to nottingham again  one bright morning soon after this time robin hood started off to nottingham town to find what was adoing there walking merrily along the roadside where the grass was sweet with daisies his eyes wandering and his thoughts also his bugle horn hung at his hip and his bow and arrows at his back while in his hand he bore a good stout oaken staff which he twirled with his fingers as he strolled along  as thus he walked down a shady lane he saw a tinker coming trolling a merry song as he drew nigh on his back hung his bag and his hammer and in his hand he carried a right stout crabstaff full six feet long and thus sang he       in peascod time when hound to horn      gives ear till buck be killed      and little lads with pipes of corn      sit keeping beasts afield  halloa good friend cried robin  i went to gather strawberries  halloa cried robin again  by woods and groves full fair  halloa art thou deaf man good friend say i  and who art thou dost so boldly check a fair song quoth the tinker stopping in his singing halloa shine own self whether thou be good friend or no but let me tell thee thou stout fellow gin thou be a good friend it were well for us both but gin thou be no good friend it were ill for thee  and whence comest thou my lusty blade quoth robin  i come from banbury answered the tinker  alas quoth robin i hear there is sad news this merry morn  ha is it indeed so cried the tinker eagerly prythee tell it speedily for i am a tinker by trade as thou seest and as i am in my trade i am greedy for news even as a priest is greedy for farthings  well then quoth robin list thou and i will tell but bear thyself up bravely for the news is sad i wot thus it is i hear that two tinkers are in the stocks for drinking ale and beer  now a murrain seize thee and thy news thou scurvy dog quoth the tinker for thou speakest but ill of good men but sad news it is indeed gin there be two stout fellows in the stocks  nay said robin thou hast missed the mark and dost but weep for the wrong sow the sadness of the news lieth in that there be but two in the stocks for the others do roam the country at large  now by the pewter platter of saint dunstan cried the tinker i have a good part of a mind to baste thy hide for thine ill jest but gin men be put in the stocks for drinking ale and beer i trow thou wouldst not lose thy part  loud laughed robin and cried now well taken tinker well taken why thy wits are like beer and do froth up most when they grow sour but right art thou man for i love ale and beer right well therefore come straightway with me hard by to the sign of the blue boar and if thou drinkest as thou appearestand i wot thou wilt not belie thy looksi will drench thy throat with as good homebrewed as ever was tapped in all broad nottinghamshire  now by my faith said the tinker thou art a right good fellow in spite of thy scurvy jests i love thee my sweet chuck and gin i go not with thee to that same blue boar thou mayst call me a heathen  tell me thy news good friend i prythee quoth robin as they trudged along together for tinkers i ween are all as full of news as an egg of meat  now i love thee as my brother my bully blade said the tinker else i would not tell thee my news for sly am i man and i have in hand a grave undertaking that doth call for all my wits for i come to seek a bold outlaw that men hereabouts call robin hood within my pouch i have a warrant all fairly written out on parchment forsooth with a great red seal for to make it lawful could i but meet this same robin hood i would serve it upon his dainty body and if he minded it not i would beat him till every one of his ribs would cry amen but thou livest hereabouts mayhap thou knowest robin hood thyself good fellow  ay marry that i do somewhat quoth robin and i have seen him this very morn but tinker men say that he is but a sad sly thief thou hadst better watch thy warrant man or else he may steal it out of thy very pouch  let him but try cried the tinker sly may he be but sly am i too i would i had him here now man to man and he made his heavy cudgel to spin again but what manner of man is he lad  much like myself said robin laughing and in height and build and age nigh the same and he hath blue eyes too  nay quoth the tinker thou art but a green youth i thought him to be a great bearded man nottingham men feared him so  truly he is not so old nor so stout as thou art said robin but men do call him a right deft hand at quarterstaff  that may be said the tinker right sturdily but i am more deft than he for did i not overcome simon of ely in a fair bout in the ring at hertford town but if thou knowest him my jolly blade wilt thou go with me and bring me to him fourscore bright angels hath the sheriff promised me if i serve the warrant upon the knaves body and ten of them will i give to thee if thou showest me him  ay that will i quoth robin but show me thy warrant man until i see whether it be good or no  that will i not do even to mine own brother answered the tinker no man shall see my warrant till i serve it upon yon fellows own body  so be it quoth robin and thou show it not to me i know not to whom thou wilt show it but here we are at the sign of the blue boar so let us in and taste his brown october  no sweeter inn could be found in all nottinghamshire than that of the blue boar none had such lovely trees standing around or was so covered with trailing clematis and sweet woodbine none had such good beer and such humming ale nor in wintertime when the north wind howled and snow drifted around the hedges was there to be found elsewhere such a roaring fire as blazed upon the hearth of the blue boar at such times might be found a goodly company of yeomen or country folk seated around the blazing hearth bandying merry jests while roasted crabs2 bobbed in bowls of ale upon the hearthstone well known was the inn to robin hood and his band for there had he and such merry companions as little john or will stutely or young david of doncaster often gathered when all the forest was filled with snow as for mine host he knew how to keep a still tongue in his head and to swallow his words before they passed his teeth for he knew very well which side of his bread was spread with butter for robin and his band were the best of customers and paid their scores without having them chalked up behind the door so now when robin hood and the tinker came thereto and called aloud for two great pots of ale none would have known from look or speech that the host had ever set eyes upon the outlaw before       2 small sour apples  bide thou here quoth robin to the tinker while i go and see that mine host draweth ale from the right butt for he hath good october i know and that brewed by withold of tamworth so saying he went within and whispered to the host to add a measure of flemish strong waters to the good english ale which the latter did and brought it to them  by our lady said the tinker after a long draught of the ale yon same withold of tamwortha right good saxon name too i would have thee knowbreweth the most humming ale that eer passed the lips of wat o the crabstaff  drink man drink cried robin only wetting his own lips meanwhile ho landlord bring my friend another pot of the same and now for a song my jolly blade  ay that will i give thee a song my lovely fellow quoth the tinker for i never tasted such ale in all my days before by our lady it doth make my head hum even now hey dame hostess come listen an thou wouldst hear a song and thou too thou bonny lass for never sing i so well as when bright eyes do look upon me the while  then he sang an ancient ballad of the time of good king arthur called the marriage of sir gawaine which you may some time read yourself in stout english of early times and as he sang all listened to that noble tale of noble knight and his sacrifice to his king but long before the tinker came to the last verse his tongue began to trip and his head to spin because of the strong waters mixed with the ale first his tongue tripped then it grew thick of sound then his head wagged from side to side until at last he fell asleep as though he never would waken again  then robin hood laughed aloud and quickly took the warrant from out the tinkers pouch with his deft fingers sly art thou tinker quoth he but not yet i bow art thou as sly as that same sly thief robin hood  then he called the host to him and said here good man are ten broad shillings for the entertainment thou hast given us this day see that thou takest good care of thy fair guest there and when he wakes thou mayst again charge him ten shillings also and if he hath it not thou mayst take his bag and hammer and even his coat in payment thus do i punish those that come into the greenwood to deal dole to me as for thine own self never knew i landlord yet that would not charge twice an he could  at this the host smiled slyly as though saying to himself the rustic saw teach a magpie to suck eggs  the tinker slept until the afternoon drew to a close and the shadows grew long beside the woodland edge then he awoke first he looked up then he looked down then he looked east then he looked west for he was gathering his wits together like barley straws blown apart by the wind first he thought of his merry companion but he was gone then he thought of his stout crabstaff and that he had within his hand then of his warrant and of the fourscore angels he was to gain for serving it upon robin hood he thrust his hand into his pouch but not a scrap nor a farthing was there then he sprang to his feet in a rage  ho landlord cried he whither hath that knave gone that was with me but now  what knave meaneth your worship quoth the landlord calling the tinker worship to soothe him as a man would pour oil upon angry water i saw no knave with your worship for i swear no man would dare call that man knave so nigh to sherwood forest a right stout yeoman i saw with your worship but i thought that your worship knew him for few there be about here that pass him by and know him not  now how should i that neer have squealed in your sty know all the swine therein who was he then an thou knowest him so well  why yon same is a right stout fellow whom men hereabouts do call robin hood which same  now byr lady cried the tinker hastily and in a deep voice like an angry bull thou didst see me come into thine inn i a staunch honest craftsman and never told me who my company was well knowing thine own self who he was now i have a right round piece of a mind to crack thy knaves pate for thee then he took up his cudgel and looked at the landlord as though he would smite him where he stood  nay cried the host throwing up his elbow for he feared the blow how knew i that thou knewest him not  well and truly thankful mayst thou be quoth the tinker that i be a patient man and so do spare thy bald crown else wouldst thou neer cheat customer again but as for this same knave robin hood i go straightway to seek him and if i do not score his knaves pate cut my staff into fagots and call me woman so saying he gathered himself together to depart  nay quoth the landlord standing in front of him and holding out his arms like a gooseherd driving his flock for money made him bold thou goest not till thou hast paid me my score  but did not he pay thee  not so much as one farthing and ten good shillings worth of ale have ye drunk this day nay i say thou goest not away without paying me else shall our good sheriff know of it  but nought have i to pay thee with good fellow quoth the tinker  good fellow not me said the landlord good fellow am i not when it cometh to lose ten shillings pay me that thou owest me in broad money or else leave thy coat and bag and hammer yet i wot they are not worth ten shillings and i shall lose thereby nay an thou stirrest i have a great dog within and i will loose him upon thee maken open thou the door and let forth brian if this fellow stirs one step  nay quoth the tinkerfor by roaming the country he had learned what dogs weretake thou what thou wilt have and let me depart in peace and may a murrain go with thee but oh landlord an i catch yon scurvy varlet i swear he shall pay full with usury for that he hath had  so saying he strode away toward the forest talking to himself while the landlord and his worthy dame and maken stood looking after him and laughed when he had fairly gone  robin and i stripped yon ass of his pack main neatly quoth the landlord  now it happened about this time that robin hood was going through the forest to fosse way to see what was to be seen there for the moon was full and the night gave promise of being bright in his hand he carried his stout oaken staff and at his side hung his bugle horn as thus he walked up a forest path whistling down another path came the tinker muttering to himself and shaking his head like an angry bull and so at a sudden bend they met sharply face to face each stood still for a time and then robin spoke  halloa my sweet bird said he laughing merrily how likest thou thine ale wilt not sing to me another song  the tinker said nothing at first but stood looking at robin with a grim face now quoth he at last i am right glad i have met thee and if i do not rattle thy bones within thy hide this day i give thee leave to put thy foot upon my neck  with all my heart cried merry robin rattle my bones an thou canst so saying he gripped his staff and threw himself upon his guard then the tinker spat upon his hands and grasping his staff came straight at the other he struck two or three blows but soon found that he had met his match for robin warded and parried all of them and before the tinker thought he gave him a rap upon the ribs in return at this robin laughed aloud and the tinker grew more angry than ever and smote again with all his might and main again robin warded two of the strokes but at the third his staff broke beneath the mighty blows of the tinker now ill betide thee traitor staff cried robin as it fell from his hands a foul stick art thou to serve me thus in mine hour of need  now yield thee quoth the tinker for thou art my captive and if thou do not i will beat thy pate to a pudding  to this robin hood made no answer but clapping his horn to his lips he blew three blasts loud and clear  ay quoth the tinker blow thou mayest but go thou must with me to nottingham town for the sheriff would fain see thee there now wilt thou yield thee or shall i have to break thy pretty head  an i must drink sour ale i must quoth robin but never have i yielded me to man before and that without wound or mark upon my body nor when i bethink me will i yield now ho my merry men come quickly  then from out the forest leaped little john and six stout yeomen clad in lincoln green  how now good master cried little john what need hast thou that thou dost wind thy horn so loudly  there stands a tinker quoth robin that would fain take me to nottingham there to hang upon the gallows tree  then shall he himself hang forthwith cried little john and he and the others made at the tinker to seize him  nay touch him not said robin for a right stout man is he a metal man he is by trade and a mettled man by nature moreover he doth sing a lovely ballad say good fellow wilt thou join my merry men all three suits of lincoln green shalt thou have a year besides forty marks in fee thou shalt share all with us and lead a right merry life in the greenwood for cares have we not and misfortune cometh not upon us within the sweet shades of sherwood where we shoot the dun deer and feed upon venison and sweet oaten cakes and curds and honey wilt thou come with me  ay marry will i join with you all quoth the tinker for i love a merry life and i love thee good master though thou didst thwack my ribs and cheat me into the bargain fain am i to own thou art both a stouter and a slyer man than i so i will obey thee and be thine own true servant  so all turned their steps to the forest depths where the tinker was to live henceforth for many a day he sang ballads to the band until the famous allan a dale joined them before whose sweet voice all others seemed as harsh as a ravens but of him we will learn hereafter     the shooting match at nottingham town  then the sheriff was very wroth because of this failure to take jolly robin for it came to his ears as ill news always does that the people laughed at him and made a jest of his thinking to serve a warrant upon such a one as the bold outlaw and a man hates nothing so much as being made a jest of so he said our gracious lord and sovereign king himself shall know of this and how his laws are perverted and despised by this band of rebel outlaws as for yon traitor tinker him will i hang if i catch him upon the very highest gallows tree in all nottinghamshire  then he bade all his servants and retainers to make ready to go to london town to see and speak with the king  at this there was bustling at the sheriffs castle and men ran hither and thither upon this business and upon that while the forge fires of nottingham glowed red far into the night like twinkling stars for all the smiths of the town were busy making or mending armor for the sheriffs troop of escort for two days this labor lasted then on the third all was ready for the journey so forth they started in the bright sunlight from nottingham town to fosse way and thence to watling street and so they journeyed for two days until they saw at last the spires and towers of great london town and many folks stopped as they journeyed along and gazed at the show they made riding along the highways with their flashing armor and gay plumes and trappings  in london king henry and his fair queen eleanor held their court gay with ladies in silks and satins and velvets and cloth of gold and also brave knights and gallant courtiers  thither came the sheriff and was shown into the kings presence  a boon a boon quoth he as he knelt upon the ground  now what wouldst thou have said the king let us hear what may be thy desires  o good my lord and sovereign spake the sheriff in sherwood forest in our own good shire of nottingham liveth a bold outlaw whose name is robin hood  in good sooth said the king his doings have reached even our own royal ears he is a saucy rebellious varlet yet i am fain to own a right merry soul withal  but hearken o my most gracious sovereign said the sheriff i sent a warrant to him with thine own royal seal attached by a right lusty knave but he beat the messenger and stole the warrant and he killeth thy deer and robbeth thine own liege subjects even upon the great highways  why how now quoth the king wrathfully what wouldst thou have me do comest thou not to me with a great array of menatarms and retainers and yet art not able to take a single band of lusty knaves without armor on breast in thine own county what wouldst thou have me do art thou not my sheriff are not my laws in force in nottinghamshire canst thou not take thine own course against those that break the laws or do any injury to thee or thine go get thee gone and think well devise some plan of thine own but trouble me no further but look well to it master sheriff for i will have my laws obeyed by all men within my kingdom and if thou art not able to enforce them thou art no sheriff for me so look well to thyself i say or ill may befall thee as well as all the thieving knaves in nottinghamshire when the flood cometh it sweepeth away grain as well as chaff  then the sheriff turned away with a sore and troubled heart and sadly he rued his fine show of retainers for he saw that the king was angry because he had so many men about him and yet could not enforce the laws so as they all rode slowly back to nottingham the sheriff was thoughtful and full of care not a word did he speak to anyone and no one of his men spoke to him but all the time he was busy devising some plan to take robin hood  aha cried he suddenly smiting his hand upon his thigh i have it now ride on my merry men all and let us get back to nottingham town as speedily as we may and mark well my words before a fortnight is passed that evil knave robin hood will be safely clapped into nottingham gaol  but what was the sheriffs plan  as a usurer takes each one of a bag of silver angels feeling each coin to find whether it be clipped or not so the sheriff as all rode slowly and sadly back toward nottingham took up thought after thought in turn feeling around the edges of each but finding in every one some flaw at last he thought of the daring soul of jolly robin and how as he the sheriff knew he often came even within the walls of nottingham  now thought the sheriff could i but persuade robin nigh to nottingham town so that i could find him i warrant i would lay hands upon him so stoutly that he would never get away again then of a sudden it came to him like a flash that were he to proclaim a great shooting match and offer some grand prize robin hood might be overpersuaded by his spirit to come to the butts and it was this thought which caused him to cry aha and smite his palm upon his thigh  so as soon as he had returned safely to nottingham he sent messengers north and south and east and west to proclaim through town hamlet and countryside this grand shooting match and everyone was bidden that could draw a longbow and the prize was to be an arrow of pure beaten gold  when robin hood first heard the news of this he was in lincoln town and hastening back to sherwood forest he soon called all his merry men about him and spoke to them thus  now hearken my merry men all to the news that i have brought from lincoln town today our friend the sheriff of nottingham hath proclaimed a shooting match and hath sent messengers to tell of it through all the countryside and the prize is to be a bright golden arrow now i fain would have one of us win it both because of the fairness of the prize and because our sweet friend the sheriff hath offered it so we will take our bows and shafts and go there to shoot for i know right well that merriment will be agoing what say ye lads  then young david of doncaster spoke up and said now listen i pray thee good master unto what i say i have come straight from our friend eadom o the blue boar and there i heard the full news of this same match but master i know from him and he got it from the sheriffs man ralph o the scar that this same knavish sheriff hath but laid a trap for thee in this shooting match and wishes nothing so much as to see thee there so go not good master for i know right well he doth seek to beguile thee but stay within the greenwood lest we all meet dole and woe  now quoth robin thou art a wise lad and keepest thine ears open and thy mouth shut as becometh a wise and crafty woodsman but shall we let it be said that the sheriff of nottingham did cow bold robin hood and sevenscore as fair archers as are in all merry england nay good david what thou tellest me maketh me to desire the prize even more than i else should do but what sayeth our good gossip swanthold is it not a hasty man burneth his mouth and the fool that keepeth his eyes shut falleth into the pit thus he says truly therefore we must meet guile with guile now some of you clothe yourselves as curtal friars and some as rustic peasants and some as tinkers or as beggars but see that each man taketh a good bow or broadsword in case need should arise as for myself i will shoot for this same golden arrow and should i win it we will hang it to the branches of our good greenwood tree for the joy of all the band how like you the plan my merry men all  then good good cried all the band right heartily  a fair sight was nottingham town on the day of the shooting match all along upon the green meadow beneath the town wall stretched a row of benches one above the other which were for knight and lady squire and dame and rich burghers and their wives for none but those of rank and quality were to sit there at the end of the range near the target was a raised seat bedecked with ribbons and scarfs and garlands of flowers for the sheriff of nottingham and his dame the range was twoscore paces broad at one end stood the target at the other a tent of striped canvas from the pole of which fluttered manycolored flags and streamers in this booth were casks of ale free to be broached by any of the archers who might wish to quench their thirst  across the range from where the seats for the better folk were raised was a railing to keep the poorer people from crowding in front of the target already while it was early the benches were beginning to fill with people of quality who kept constantly arriving in little carts or upon palfreys that curveted gaily to the merry tinkle of silver bells at bridle reins with these came also the poorer folk who sat or lay upon the green grass near the railing that kept them from off the range in the great tent the archers were gathering by twos and threes some talking loudly of the fair shots each man had made in his day some looking well to their bows drawing a string betwixt the fingers to see that there was no fray upon it or inspecting arrows shutting one eye and peering down a shaft to see that it was not warped but straight and true for neither bow nor shaft should fail at such a time and for such a prize and never was such a company of yeomen as were gathered at nottingham town that day for the very best archers of merry england had come to this shooting match there was gill o the red cap the sheriffs own head archer and diccon cruikshank of lincoln town and adam o the dell a man of tamworth of threescore years and more yet hale and lusty still who in his time had shot in the famous match at woodstock and had there beaten that renowned archer clym o the clough and many more famous men of the longbow were there whose names have been handed down to us in goodly ballads of the olden time  but now all the benches were filled with guests lord and lady burgher and dame when at last the sheriff himself came with his lady he riding with stately mien upon his milkwhite horse and she upon her brown filly upon his head he wore a purple velvet cap and purple velvet was his robe all trimmed about with rich ermine his jerkin and hose were of seagreen silk and his shoes of black velvet the pointed toes fastened to his garters with golden chains a golden chain hung about his neck and at his collar was a great carbuncle set in red gold his lady was dressed in blue velvet all trimmed with swans down so they made a gallant sight as they rode along side by side and all the people shouted from where they crowded across the space from the gentlefolk so the sheriff and his lady came to their place where menatarms with hauberk and spear stood about waiting for them  then when the sheriff and his dame had sat down he bade his herald wind upon his silver horn who thereupon sounded three blasts that came echoing cheerily back from the gray walls of nottingham then the archers stepped forth to their places while all the folks shouted with a mighty voice each man calling upon his favorite yeoman red cap cried some cruikshank cried others hey for william o leslie shouted others yet again while ladies waved silken scarfs to urge each yeoman to do his best  then the herald stood forth and loudly proclaimed the rules of the game as follows  shoot each man from yon mark which is sevenscore yards and ten from the target one arrow shooteth each man first and from all the archers shall the ten that shooteth the fairest shafts be chosen for to shoot again two arrows shooteth each man of these ten then shall the three that shoot the fairest shafts be chosen for to shoot again three arrows shooteth each man of those three and to him that shooteth the fairest shafts shall the prize be given  then the sheriff leaned forward looking keenly among the press of archers to find whether robin hood was among them but no one was there clad in lincoln green such as was worn by robin and his band nevertheless said the sheriff to himself he may still be there and i miss him among the crowd of other men but let me see when but ten men shoot for i wot he will be among the ten or i know him not  and now the archers shot each man in turn and the good folk never saw such archery as was done that day six arrows were within the clout four within the black and only two smote the outer ring so that when the last arrow sped and struck the target all the people shouted aloud for it was noble shooting  and now but ten men were left of all those that had shot before and of these ten six were famous throughout the land and most of the folk gathered there knew them these six men were gilbert o the red cap adam o the dell diccon cruikshank william o leslie hubert o cloud and swithin o hertford two others were yeomen of merry yorkshire another was a tall stranger in blue who said he came from london town and the last was a tattered stranger in scarlet who wore a patch over one eye  now quoth the sheriff to a manatarms who stood near him seest thou robin hood among those ten  nay that do i not your worship answered the man six of them i know right well of those yorkshire yeomen one is too tall and the other too short for that bold knave robins beard is as yellow as gold while yon tattered beggar in scarlet hath a beard of brown besides being blind of one eye as for the stranger in blue robins shoulders i ween are three inches broader than his  then quoth the sheriff smiting his thigh angrily yon knave is a coward as well as a rogue and dares not show his face among good men and true  then after they had rested a short time those ten stout men stepped forth to shoot again each man shot two arrows and as they shot not a word was spoken but all the crowd watched with scarce a breath of sound but when the last had shot his arrow another great shout arose while many cast their caps aloft for joy of such marvelous shooting  now by our gracious lady fair quoth old sir amyas o the dell who bowed with fourscore years and more sat near the sheriff neer saw i such archery in all my life before yet have i seen the best hands at the longbow for threescore years and more  and now but three men were left of all those that had shot before one was gill o the red cap one the tattered stranger in scarlet and one adam o the dell of tamworth town then all the people called aloud some crying ho for gilbert o the red cap and some hey for stout adam o tamworth but not a single man in the crowd called upon the stranger in scarlet  now shoot thou well gilbert cried the sheriff and if thine be the best shaft fivescore broad silver pennies will i give to thee beside the prize  truly i will do my best quoth gilbert right sturdily a man cannot do aught but his best but that will i strive to do this day so saying he drew forth a fair smooth arrow with a broad feather and fitted it deftly to the string then drawing his bow with care he sped the shaft straight flew the arrow and lit fairly in the clout a fingersbreadth from the center a gilbert a gilbert shouted all the crowd and now by my faith cried the sheriff smiting his hands together that is a shrewd shot  then the tattered stranger stepped forth and all the people laughed as they saw a yellow patch that showed beneath his arm when he raised his elbow to shoot and also to see him aim with but one eye he drew the good yew bow quickly and quickly loosed a shaft so short was the time that no man could draw a breath betwixt the drawing and the shooting yet his arrow lodged nearer the center than the other by twice the length of a barleycorn  now by all the saints in paradise cried the sheriff that is a lovely shaft in very truth  then adam o the dell shot carefully and cautiously and his arrow lodged close beside the strangers then after a short space they all three shot again and once more each arrow lodged within the clout but this time adam o the dells was farthest from the center and again the tattered strangers shot was the best then after another time of rest they all shot for the third time this time gilbert took great heed to his aim keenly measuring the distance and shooting with shrewdest care straight flew the arrow and all shouted till the very flags that waved in the breeze shook with the sound and the rooks and daws flew clamoring about the roofs of the old gray tower for the shaft had lodged close beside the spot that marked the very center  well done gilbert cried the sheriff right joyously fain am i to believe the prize is thine and right fairly won now thou ragged knave let me see thee shoot a better shaft than that  nought spake the stranger but took his place while all was hushed and no one spoke or even seemed to breathe so great was the silence for wonder what he would do meanwhile also quite still stood the stranger holding his bow in his hand while one could count five then he drew his trusty yew holding it drawn but a moment then loosed the string straight flew the arrow and so true that it smote a gray goose feather from off gilberts shaft which fell fluttering through the sunlit air as the strangers arrow lodged close beside his of the red cap and in the very center no one spoke a word for a while and no one shouted but each man looked into his neighbors face amazedly  nay quoth old adam o the dell presently drawing a long breath and shaking his head as he spoke twoscore years and more have i shot shaft and maybe not all times bad but i shoot no more this day for no man can match with yon stranger whosoeer he may be then he thrust his shaft into his quiver rattling and unstrung his bow without another word  then the sheriff came down from his dais and drew near in all his silks and velvets to where the tattered stranger stood leaning upon his stout bow while the good folk crowded around to see the man who shot so wondrously well here good fellow quoth the sheriff take thou the prize and well and fairly hast thou won it i bow what may be thy name and whence comest thou  men do call me jock o teviotdale and thence am i come said the stranger  then by our lady jock thou art the fairest archer that eer mine eyes beheld and if thou wilt join my service i will clothe thee with a better coat than that thou hast upon thy back thou shalt eat and drink of the best and at every christmastide fourscore marks shall be thy wage i trow thou drawest better bow than that same coward knave robin hood that dared not show his face here this day say good fellow wilt thou join my service  nay that will i not quoth the stranger roughly i will be mine own and no man in all merry england shall be my master  then get thee gone and a murrain seize thee cried the sheriff and his voice trembled with anger and by my faith and troth i have a good part of a mind to have thee beaten for thine insolence then he turned upon his heel and strode away  it was a right motley company that gathered about the noble greenwood tree in sherwoods depths that same day a score and more of barefoot friars were there and some that looked like tinkers and some that seemed to be sturdy beggars and rustic hinds and seated upon a mossy couch was one all clad in tattered scarlet with a patch over one eye and in his hand he held the golden arrow that was the prize of the great shooting match then amidst a noise of talking and laughter he took the patch from off his eye and stripped away the scarlet rags from off his body and showed himself all clothed in fair lincoln green and quoth he easy come these things away but walnut stain cometh not so speedily from yellow hair then all laughed louder than before for it was robin hood himself that had won the prize from the sheriffs very hands  then all sat down to the woodland feast and talked among themselves of the merry jest that had been played upon the sheriff and of the adventures that had befallen each member of the band in his disguise but when the feast was done robin hood took little john apart and said truly am i vexed in my blood for i heard the sheriff say today thou shootest better than that coward knave robin hood that dared not show his face here this day i would fain let him know who it was who won the golden arrow from out his hand and also that i am no coward such as he takes me to be  then little john said good master take thou me and will stutely and we will send yon fat sheriff news of all this by a messenger such as he doth not expect  that day the sheriff sat at meat in the great hall of his house at nottingham town long tables stood down the hall at which sat menatarms and household servants and good stout villains1 in all fourscore and more there they talked of the days shooting as they ate their meat and quaffed their ale the sheriff sat at the head of the table upon a raised seat under a canopy and beside him sat his dame       1 bondservants  by my troth said he i did reckon full roundly that that knave robin hood would be at the game today i did not think that he was such a coward but who could that saucy knave be who answered me to my beard so bravely i wonder that i did not have him beaten but there was something about him that spoke of other things than rags and tatters  then even as he finished speaking something fell rattling among the dishes on the table while those that sat near started up wondering what it might be after a while one of the menatarms gathered courage enough to pick it up and bring it to the sheriff then everyone saw that it was a blunted gray goose shaft with a fine scroll about the thickness of a goose quill tied near to its head the sheriff opened the scroll and glanced at it while the veins upon his forehead swelled and his cheeks grew ruddy with rage as he read for this was what he saw       now heaven bless thy grace this day      say all in sweet sherwood      for thou didst give the prize away      to merry robin hood  whence came this cried the sheriff in a mighty voice  even through the window your worship quoth the man who had handed the shaft to him     will stutely rescued by his companions  now when the sheriff found that neither law nor guile could overcome robin hood he was much perplexed and said to himself fool that i am had i not told our king of robin hood i would not have gotten myself into such a coil but now i must either take him captive or have wrath visited upon my head from his most gracious majesty i have tried law and i have tried guile and i have failed in both so i will try what may be done with might  thus communing within himself he called his constables together and told them what was in his mind now take ye each four men all armed in proof said he and get ye gone to the forest at different points and lie in wait for this same robin hood but if any constable finds too many men against him let him sound a horn and then let each band within hearing come with all speed and join the party that calls them thus i think shall we take this greenclad knave furthermore to him that first meeteth with robin hood shall one hundred pounds of silver money be given if he be brought to me dead or alive and to him that meeteth with any of his band shall twoscore pounds be given if such be brought to me dead or alive so be ye bold and be ye crafty  so thus they went in threescore companies of five to sherwood forest to take robin hood each constable wishing that he might be the one to find the bold outlaw or at least one of his band for seven days and nights they hunted through the forest glades but never saw so much as a single man in lincoln green for tidings of all this had been brought to robin hood by trusty eadom o the blue boar  when he first heard the news robin said if the sheriff dare send force to meet force woe will it be for him and many a better man besides for blood will flow and there will be great trouble for all but fain would i shun blood and battle and fain would i not deal sorrow to womenfolk and wives because good stout yeomen lose their lives once i slew a man and never do i wish to slay a man again for it is bitter for the soul to think thereon so now we will abide silently in sherwood forest so that it may be well for all but should we be forced to defend ourselves or any of our band then let each man draw bow and brand with might and main  at this speech many of the band shook their heads and said to themselves now the sheriff will think that we are cowards and folk will scoff throughout the countryside saying that we fear to meet these men but they said nothing aloud swallowing their words and doing as robin bade them  thus they hid in the depths of sherwood forest for seven days and seven nights and never showed their faces abroad in all that time but early in the morning of the eighth day robin hood called the band together and said now who will go and find what the sheriffs men are at by this time for i know right well they will not bide forever within sherwood shades  at this a great shout arose and each man waved his bow aloft and cried that he might be the one to go then robin hoods heart was proud when he looked around on his stout brave fellows and he said brave and true are ye all my merry men and a right stout band of good fellows are ye but ye cannot all go so i will choose one from among you and it shall be good will stutely for he is as sly as eer an old dog fox in sherwood forest  then will stutely leaped high aloft and laughed loudly clapping his hands for pure joy that he should have been chosen from among them all now thanks good master quoth he and if i bring not news of those knaves to thee call me no more thy sly will stutely  then he clad himself in a friars gown and underneath the robe he hung a good broadsword in such a place that he could easily lay hands upon it thus clad he set forth upon his quest until he came to the verge of the forest and so to the highway he saw two bands of the sheriffs men yet he turned neither to the right nor the left but only drew his cowl the closer over his face folding his hands as if in meditation so at last he came to the sign of the blue boar for quoth he to himself our good friend eadom will tell me all the news  at the sign of the blue boar he found a band of the sheriffs men drinking right lustily so without speaking to anyone he sat down upon a distant bench his staff in his hand and his head bowed forward as though he were meditating thus he sat waiting until he might see the landlord apart and eadom did not know him but thought him to be some poor tired friar so he let him sit without saying a word to him or molesting him though he liked not the cloth for said he to himself it is a hard heart that kicks the lame dog from off the sill as stutely sat thus there came a great house cat and rubbed against his knee raising his robe a palmsbreadth high stutely pushed his robe quickly down again but the constable who commanded the sheriffs men saw what had passed and saw also fair lincoln green beneath the friars robe he said nothing at the time but communed within himself in this wise yon is no friar of orders gray and also i wot no honest yeoman goeth about in priests garb nor doth a thief go so for nought now i think in good sooth that is one of robin hoods own men so presently he said aloud o holy father wilt thou not take a good pot of march beer to slake thy thirsty soul withal  but stutely shook his head silently for he said to himself maybe there be those here who know my voice  then the constable said again whither goest thou holy friar upon this hot summers day  i go a pilgrim to canterbury town answered will stutely speaking gruffly so that none might know his voice  then the constable said for the third time now tell me holy father do pilgrims to canterbury wear good lincoln green beneath their robes ha by my faith i take thee to be some lusty thief and perhaps one of robin hoods own band now by our ladys grace if thou movest hand or foot i will run thee through the body with my sword  then he flashed forth his bright sword and leaped upon will stutely thinking he would take him unaware but stutely had his own sword tightly held in his hand beneath his robe so he drew it forth before the constable came upon him then the stout constable struck a mighty blow but he struck no more in all that fight for stutely parrying the blow right deftly smote the constable back again with all his might then he would have escaped but could not for the other all dizzy with the wound and with the flowing blood seized him by the knees with his arms even as he reeled and fell then the others rushed upon him and stutely struck again at another of the sheriffs men but the steel cap glanced the blow and though the blade bit deep it did not kill meanwhile the constable fainting as he was drew stutely downward and the others seeing the yeoman hampered so rushed upon him again and one smote him a blow upon the crown so that the blood ran down his face and blinded him then staggering he fell and all sprang upon him though he struggled so manfully that they could hardly hold him fast then they bound him with stout hempen cords so that he could not move either hand or foot and thus they overcame him  robin hood stood under the greenwood tree thinking of will stutely and how he might be faring when suddenly he saw two of his stout yeomen come running down the forest path and betwixt them ran buxom maken of the blue boar then robins heart fell for he knew they were the bearers of ill tidings  will stutely hath been taken cried they when they had come to where he stood  and is it thou that hast brought such doleful news said robin to the lass  ay marry for i saw it all cried she panting as the hare pants when it has escaped the hounds and i fear he is wounded sore for one smote him main shrewdly i the crown they have bound him and taken him to nottingham town and ere i left the blue boar i heard that he should be hanged tomorrow day  he shall not be hanged tomorrow day cried robin or if he be full many a one shall gnaw the sod and many shall have cause to cry alackaday  then he clapped his horn to his lips and blew three blasts right loudly and presently his good yeomen came running through the greenwood until sevenscore bold blades were gathered around him  now hark you all cried robin our dear companion will stutely hath been taken by that vile sheriffs men therefore doth it behoove us to take bow and brand in hand to bring him off again for i wot that we ought to risk life and limb for him as he hath risked life and limb for us is it not so my merry men all then all cried ay with a great voice  so the next day they all wended their way from sherwood forest but by different paths for it behooved them to be very crafty so the band separated into parties of twos and threes which were all to meet again in a tangled dell that lay near to nottingham town then when they had all gathered together at the place of meeting robin spoke to them thus  now we will lie here in ambush until we can get news for it doth behoove us to be cunning and wary if we would bring our friend will stutely off from the sheriffs clutches  so they lay hidden a long time until the sun stood high in the sky the day was warm and the dusty road was bare of travelers except an aged palmer who walked slowly along the highroad that led close beside the gray castle wall of nottingham town when robin saw that no other wayfarer was within sight he called young david of doncaster who was a shrewd man for his years and said to him now get thee forth young david and speak to yonder palmer that walks beside the town wall for he hath come but now from nottingham town and may tell thee news of good stutely perchance  so david strode forth and when he came up to the pilgrim he saluted him and said good morrow holy father and canst thou tell me when will stutely will be hanged upon the gallows tree i fain would not miss the sight for i have come from afar to see so sturdy a rogue hanged  now out upon thee young man cried the palmer that thou shouldst speak so when a good stout man is to be hanged for nothing but guarding his own life and he struck his staff upon the ground in anger alas say i that this thing should be for even this day toward evening when the sun falleth low he shall be hanged fourscore rods from the great town gate of nottingham where three roads meet for there the sheriff sweareth he shall die as a warning to all outlaws in nottinghamshire but yet i say again alas for though robin hood and his band may be outlaws yet he taketh only from the rich and the strong and the dishonest man while there is not a poor widow nor a peasant with many children nigh to sherwood but has barley flour enough all the year long through him it grieves my heart to see one as gallant as this stutely die for i have been a good saxon yeoman in my day ere i turned palmer and well i know a stout hand and one that smiteth shrewdly at a cruel norman or a proud abbot with fat moneybags had good stutelys master but known how his man was compassed about with perils perchance he might send succor to bring him out of the hand of his enemies  ay marry that is true cried the young man if robin and his men be nigh this place i wot right well they will strive to bring him forth from his peril but fare thee well thou good old man and believe me if will stutely die he shall be right well avenged  then he turned and strode rapidly away but the palmer looked after him muttering i wot that youth is no country hind that hath come to see a good man die well well perchance robin hood is not so far away but that there will be stout doings this day so he went upon his way muttering to himself  when david of doncaster told robin hood what the palmer had said to him robin called the band around him and spoke to them thus  now let us get straightway into nottingham town and mix ourselves with the people there but keep ye one another in sight pressing as near the prisoner and his guards as ye can when they come outside the walls strike no man without need for i would fain avoid bloodshed but if ye do strike strike hard and see that there be no need to strike again then keep all together until we come again to sherwood and let no man leave his fellows  the sun was low in the western sky when a bugle note sounded from the castle wall then all was bustle in nottingham town and crowds filled the streets for all knew that the famous will stutely was to be hanged that day presently the castle gates opened wide and a great array of menatarms came forth with noise and clatter the sheriff all clad in shining mail of linked chain riding at their head in the midst of all the guard in a cart with a halter about his neck rode will stutely his face was pale with his wound and with loss of blood like the moon in broad daylight and his fair hair was clotted in points upon his forehead where the blood had hardened when he came forth from the castle he looked up and he looked down but though he saw some faces that showed pity and some that showed friendliness he saw none that he knew then his heart sank within him like a plummet of lead but nevertheless he spoke up boldly  give a sword into my hand sir sheriff said he and wounded man though i be i will fight thee and all thy men till life and strength be gone  nay thou naughty varlet quoth the sheriff turning his head and looking right grimly upon will stutely thou shalt have no sword but shall die a mean death as beseemeth a vile thief like thee  then do but untie my hands and i will fight thee and thy men with no weapon but only my naked fists i crave no weapon but let me not be meanly hanged this day  then the sheriff laughed aloud why how now quoth he is thy proud stomach quailing shrive thyself thou vile knave for i mean that thou shalt hang this day and that where three roads meet so that all men shall see thee hang for carrion crows and daws to peck at  o thou dastard heart cried will stutely gnashing his teeth at the sheriff thou coward hind if ever my good master meet thee thou shalt pay dearly for this days work he doth scorn thee and so do all brave hearts knowest thou not that thou and thy name are jests upon the lips of every brave yeoman such a one as thou art thou wretched craven will never be able to subdue bold robin hood  ha cried the sheriff in a rage is it even so am i a jest with thy master as thou callest him now i will make a jest of thee and a sorry jest withal for i will quarter thee limb from limb after thou art hanged then he spurred his horse forward and said no more to stutely  at last they came to the great town gate through which stutely saw the fair country beyond with hills and dales all clothed in verdure and far away the dusky line of sherwoods skirts then when he saw the slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow shining redly here and there on cot and farmhouse and when he heard the sweet birds singing their vespers and the sheep bleating upon the hillside and beheld the swallows flying in the bright air there came a great fullness to his heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears and he bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw the tears in his eyes thus he kept his head bowed till they had passed through the gate and were outside the walls of the town but when he looked up again he felt his heart leap within him and then stand still for pure joy for he saw the face of one of his own dear companions of merry sherwood then glancing quickly around he saw wellknown faces upon all sides of him crowding closely upon the menatarms who were guarding him then of a sudden the blood sprang to his cheeks for he saw for a moment his own good master in the press and seeing him knew that robin hood and all his band were there yet betwixt him and them was a line of menatarms  now stand back cried the sheriff in a mighty voice for the crowd pressed around on all sides what mean ye varlets that ye push upon us so stand back i say  then came a bustle and a noise and one strove to push between the menatarms so as to reach the cart and stutely saw that it was little john that made all that stir  now stand thou back cried one of the menatarms whom little john pushed with his elbows  now stand thou back thine own self quoth little john and straightway smote the man a buffet beside his head that felled him as a butcher fells an ox and then he leaped to the cart where stutely sat  i pray thee take leave of thy friends ere thou diest will quoth he or maybe i will die with thee if thou must die for i could never have better company then with one stroke he cut the bonds that bound the others arms and legs and stutely leaped straightway from the cart  now as i live cried the sheriff yon varlet i know right well is a sturdy rebel take him i bid you all and let him not go  so saying he spurred his horse upon little john and rising in his stirrups smote with might and main but little john ducked quickly underneath the horses belly and the blow whistled harmlessly over his head  nay good sir sheriff cried he leaping up again when the blow had passed i must een borrow thy most worshipful sword thereupon he twitched the weapon deftly from out the sheriffs hand here stutely he cried the sheriff hath lent thee his sword back to back with me man and defend thyself for help is nigh  down with them bellowed the sheriff in a voice like an angry bull and he spurred his horse upon the two who now stood back to back forgetting in his rage that he had no weapon with which to defend himself  stand back sheriff cried little john and even as he spoke a bugle horn sounded shrilly and a clothyard shaft whistled within an inch of the sheriffs head then came a swaying hither and thither and oaths cries and groans and clashing of steel and swords flashed in the setting sun and a score of arrows whistled through the air and some cried help help and some a rescue a rescue  treason cried the sheriff in a loud voice bear back bear back else we be all dead men thereupon he reined his horse backward through the thickest of the crowd  now robin hood and his band might have slain half of the sheriffs men had they desired to do so but they let them push out of the press and get them gone only sending a bunch of arrows after them to hurry them in their flight  oh stay shouted will stutely after the sheriff thou wilt never catch bold robin hood if thou dost not stand to meet him face to face but the sheriff bowing along his horses back made no answer but only spurred the faster  then will stutely turned to little john and looked him in the face till the tears ran down from his eyes and he wept aloud and kissing his friends cheeks o little john quoth he mine own true friend and he that i love better than man or woman in all the world beside little did i reckon to see thy face this day or to meet thee this side paradise little john could make no answer but wept also  then robin hood gathered his band together in a close rank with will stutely in the midst and thus they moved slowly away toward sherwood and were gone as a storm cloud moves away from the spot where a tempest has swept the land but they left ten of the sheriffs men lying along the ground woundedsome more some lessyet no one knew who smote them down  thus the sheriff of nottingham tried thrice to take robin hood and failed each time and the last time he was frightened for he felt how near he had come to losing his life so he said these men fear neither god nor man nor king nor kings officers i would sooner lose mine office than my life so i will trouble them no more so he kept close within his castle for many a day and dared not show his face outside of his own household and all the time he was gloomy and would speak to no one for he was ashamed of what had happened that day     robin hood turns butcher  now after all these things had happened and it became known to robin hood how the sheriff had tried three times to make him captive he said to himself if i have the chance i will make our worshipful sheriff pay right well for that which he hath done to me maybe i may bring him some time into sherwood forest and have him to a right merry feast with us for when robin hood caught a baron or a squire or a fat abbot or bishop he brought them to the greenwood tree and feasted them before he lightened their purses  but in the meantime robin hood and his band lived quietly in sherwood forest without showing their faces abroad for robin knew that it would not be wise for him to be seen in the neighborhood of nottingham those in authority being very wroth with him but though they did not go abroad they lived a merry life within the woodlands spending the days in shooting at garlands hung upon a willow wand at the end of the glade the leafy aisles ringing with merry jests and laughter for whoever missed the garland was given a sound buffet which if delivered by little john never failed to topple over the unfortunate yeoman then they had bouts of wrestling and of cudgel play so that every day they gained in skill and strength  thus they dwelled for nearly a year and in that time robin hood often turned over in his mind many means of making an even score with the sheriff at last he began to fret at his confinement so one day he took up his stout cudgel and set forth to seek adventure strolling blithely along until he came to the edge of sherwood there as he rambled along the sunlit road he met a lusty young butcher driving a fine mare and riding in a stout new cart all hung about with meat merrily whistled the butcher as he jogged along for he was going to the market and the day was fresh and sweet making his heart blithe within him  good morrow to thee jolly fellow quoth robin thou seemest happy this merry morn  ay that am i quoth the jolly butcher and why should i not be so am i not hale in wind and limb have i not the bonniest lass in all nottinghamshire and lastly am i not to be married to her on thursday next in sweet locksley town  ha said robin comest thou from locksley town well do i know that fair place for miles about and well do i know each hedgerow and gentle pebbly stream and even all the bright little fishes therein for there i was born and bred now where goest thou with thy meat my fair friend  i go to the market at nottingham town to sell my beef and my mutton answered the butcher but who art thou that comest from locksley town  a yeoman am i and men do call me robin hood  now by our ladys grace cried the butcher well do i know thy name and many a time have i heard thy deeds both sung and spoken of but heaven forbid that thou shouldst take aught of me an honest man am i and have wronged neither man nor maid so trouble me not good master as i have never troubled thee  nay heaven forbid indeed quoth robin that i should take from such as thee jolly fellow not so much as one farthing would i take from thee for i love a fair saxon face like thine right wellmore especially when it cometh from locksley town and most especially when the man that owneth it is to marry a bonny lass on thursday next but come tell me for what price thou wilt sell me all of thy meat and thy horse and cart  at four marks do i value meat cart and mare quoth the butcher but if i do not sell all my meat i will not have four marks in value  then robin hood plucked the purse from his girdle and quoth he here in this purse are six marks now i would fain be a butcher for the day and sell my meat in nottingham town wilt thou close a bargain with me and take six marks for thine outfit  now may the blessings of all the saints fall on thine honest head cried the butcher right joyfully as he leaped down from his cart and took the purse that robin held out to him  nay quoth robin laughing loudly many do like me and wish me well but few call me honest now get thee gone back to thy lass and give her a sweet kiss from me so saying he donned the butchers apron and climbing into the cart he took the reins in his hand and drove off through the forest to nottingham town  when he came to nottingham he entered that part of the market where butchers stood and took up his inn2 in the best place he could find next he opened his stall and spread his meat upon the bench then taking his cleaver and steel and clattering them together he trolled aloud in merry tones       2 stand for selling       now come ye lasses and eke ye dames      and buy your meat from me      for three pennyworths of meat i sell      for the charge of one penny       lamb have i that hath fed upon nought      but the dainty dames pied      and the violet sweet and the daffodil      that grow fair streams beside       and beef have i from the heathery words      and mutton from dales all green      and veal as white as a maidens brow      with its mothers milk i ween       then come ye lasses and eke ye dames      come buy your meat from me      for three pennyworths of meat i sell      for the charge of one penny  thus he sang blithely while all who stood near listened amazedly then when he had finished he clattered the steel and cleaver still more loudly shouting lustily now wholl buy wholl buy four fixed prices have i three pennyworths of meat i sell to a fat friar or priest for sixpence for i want not their custom stout aldermen i charge threepence for it doth not matter to me whether they buy or not to buxom dames i sell three pennyworths of meat for one penny for i like their custom well but to the bonny lass that hath a liking for a good tight butcher i charge nought but one fair kiss for i like her custom the best of all  then all began to stare and wonder and crowd around laughing for never was such selling heard of in all nottingham town but when they came to buy they found it as he had said for he gave goodwife or dame as much meat for one penny as they could buy elsewhere for three and when a widow or a poor woman came to him he gave her flesh for nothing but when a merry lass came and gave him a kiss he charged not one penny for his meat and many such came to his stall for his eyes were as blue as the skies of june and he laughed merrily giving to each full measure thus he sold his meat so fast that no butcher that stood near him could sell anything  then they began to talk among themselves and some said this must be some thief who has stolen cart horse and meat but others said nay when did ye ever see a thief who parted with his goods so freely and merrily this must be some prodigal who hath sold his fathers land and would fain live merrily while the money lasts and these latter being the greater number the others came round one by one to their way of thinking  then some of the butchers came to him to make his acquaintance come brother quoth one who was the head of them all we be all of one trade so wilt thou go dine with us for this day the sheriff hath asked all the butcher guild to feast with him at the guild hall there will be stout fare and much to drink and that thou likest or i much mistake thee  now beshrew his heart quoth jolly robin that would deny a butcher and moreover i will go dine with you all my sweet lads and that as fast as i can hie whereupon having sold all his meat he closed his stall and went with them to the great guild hall  there the sheriff had already come in state and with him many butchers when robin and those that were with him came in all laughing at some merry jest he had been telling them those that were near the sheriff whispered to him yon is a right mad blade for he hath sold more meat for one penny this day than we could sell for three and to whatsoever merry lass gave him a kiss he gave meat for nought and others said he is some prodigal that hath sold his land for silver and gold and meaneth to spend all right merrily  then the sheriff called robin to him not knowing him in his butchers dress and made him sit close to him on his right hand for he loved a rich young prodigalespecially when he thought that he might lighten that prodigals pockets into his own most worshipful purse so he made much of robin and laughed and talked with him more than with any of the others  at last the dinner was ready to be served and the sheriff bade robin say grace so robin stood up and said now heaven bless us all and eke good meat and good sack within this house and may all butchers be and remain as honest men as i am  at this all laughed the sheriff loudest of all for he said to himself surely this is indeed some prodigal and perchance i may empty his purse of some of the money that the fool throweth about so freely then he spake aloud to robin saying thou art a jolly young blade and i love thee mightily and he smote robin upon the shoulder  then robin laughed loudly too yea quoth he i know thou dost love a jolly blade for didst thou not have jolly robin hood at thy shooting match and didst thou not gladly give him a bright golden arrow for his own  at this the sheriff looked grave and all the guild of butchers too so that none laughed but robin only some winked slyly at each other  come fill us some sack cried robin let us eer be merry while we may for man is but dust and he hath but a span to live here till the worm getteth him as our good gossip swanthold sayeth so let life be merry while it lasts say i nay never look down i the mouth sir sheriff who knowest but that thou mayest catch robin hood yet if thou drinkest less good sack and malmsey and bringest down the fat about thy paunch and the dust from out thy brain be merry man  then the sheriff laughed again but not as though he liked the jest while the butchers said one to another before heaven never have we seen such a mad rollicking blade mayhap though he will make the sheriff mad  how now brothers cried robin be merry nay never count over your farthings for by this and by that i will pay this shot myself een though it cost two hundred pounds so let no man draw up his lip nor thrust his forefinger into his purse for i swear that neither butcher nor sheriff shall pay one penny for this feast  now thou art a right merry soul quoth the sheriff and i wot thou must have many a head of horned beasts and many an acre of land that thou dost spend thy money so freely  ay that have i quoth robin laughing loudly again five hundred and more horned beasts have i and my brothers and none of them have we been able to sell else i might not have turned butcher as for my land i have never asked my steward how many acres i have  at this the sheriffs eyes twinkled and he chuckled to himself nay good youth quoth he if thou canst not sell thy cattle it may be i will find a man that will lift them from thy hands perhaps that man may be myself for i love a merry youth and would help such a one along the path of life now how much dost thou want for thy horned cattle  well quoth robin they are worth at least five hundred pounds  nay answered the sheriff slowly and as if he were thinking within himself well do i love thee and fain would i help thee along but five hundred pounds in money is a good round sum besides i have it not by me yet i will give thee three hundred pounds for them all and that in good hard silver and gold  now thou old miser quoth robin well thou knowest that so many horned cattle are worth seven hundred pounds and more and even that is but small for them and yet thou with thy gray hairs and one foot in the grave wouldst trade upon the folly of a wild youth  at this the sheriff looked grimly at robin nay quoth robin look not on me as though thou hadst sour beer in thy mouth man i will take thine offer for i and my brothers do need the money we lead a merry life and no one leads a merry life for a farthing so i will close the bargain with thee but mind that thou bringest a good three hundred pounds with thee for i trust not one that driveth so shrewd a bargain  i will bring the money said the sheriff but what is thy name good youth  men call me robert o locksley quoth bold robin  then good robert o locksley quoth the sheriff i will come this day to see thy horned beasts but first my clerk shall draw up a paper in which thou shalt be bound to the sale for thou gettest not my money without i get thy beasts in return  then robin hood laughed again so be it he said smiting his palm upon the sheriffs hand truly my brothers will be thankful to thee for thy money  thus the bargain was closed but many of the butchers talked among themselves of the sheriff saying that it was but a scurvy trick to beguile a poor spendthrift youth in this way  the afternoon had come when the sheriff mounted his horse and joined robin hood who stood outside the gateway of the paved court waiting for him for he had sold his horse and cart to a trader for two marks then they set forth upon their way the sheriff riding upon his horse and robin running beside him thus they left nottingham town and traveled forward along the dusty highway laughing and jesting together as though they had been old friends but all the time the sheriff said within himself thy jest to me of robin hood shall cost thee dear good fellow even four hundred pounds thou fool for he thought he would make at least that much by his bargain  so they journeyed onward till they came within the verge of sherwood forest when presently the sheriff looked up and down and to the right and to the left of him and then grew quiet and ceased his laughter now quoth he may heaven and its saints preserve us this day from a rogue men call robin hood  then robin laughed aloud nay said he thou mayst set thy mind at rest for well do i know robin hood and well do i know that thou art in no more danger from him this day than thou art from me  at this the sheriff looked askance at robin saying to himself i like not that thou seemest so well acquainted with this bold outlaw and i wish that i were well out of sherwood forest  but still they traveled deeper into the forest shades and the deeper they went the more quiet grew the sheriff at last they came to where the road took a sudden bend and before them a herd of dun deer went tripping across the path then robin hood came close to the sheriff and pointing his finger he said these are my horned beasts good master sheriff how dost thou like them are they not fat and fair to see  at this the sheriff drew rein quickly now fellow quoth he i would i were well out of this forest for i like not thy company go thou thine own path good friend and let me but go mine  but robin only laughed and caught the sheriffs bridle rein nay cried he stay awhile for i would thou shouldst see my brothers who own these fair horned beasts with me so saying he clapped his bugle to his mouth and winded three merry notes and presently up the path came leaping fivescore good stout yeomen with little john at their head  what wouldst thou have good master quoth little john  why answered robin dost thou not see that i have brought goodly company to feast with us today fye for shame do you not see our good and worshipful master the sheriff of nottingham take thou his bridle little john for he has honored us today by coming to feast with us  then all doffed their hats humbly without smiling or seeming to be in jest while little john took the bridle rein and led the palfrey still deeper into the forest all marching in order with robin hood walking beside the sheriff hat in hand  all this time the sheriff said never a word but only looked about him like one suddenly awakened from sleep but when he found himself going within the very depths of sherwood his heart sank within him for he thought surely my three hundred pounds will be taken from me even if they take not my life itself for i have plotted against their lives more than once but all seemed humble and meek and not a word was said of danger either to life or money  so at last they came to that part of sherwood forest where a noble oak spread its branches wide and beneath it was a seat all made of moss on which robin sat down placing the sheriff at his right hand now busk ye my merry men all quoth he and bring forth the best we have both of meat and wine for his worship the sheriff hath feasted me in nottingham guild hall today and i would not have him go back empty  all this time nothing had been said of the sheriffs money so presently he began to pluck up heart for said he to himself maybe robin hood hath forgotten all about it  then while beyond in the forest bright fires crackled and savory smells of sweetly roasting venison and fat capons filled the glade and brown pasties warmed beside the blaze did robin hood entertain the sheriff right royally first several couples stood forth at quarterstaff and so shrewd were they at the game and so quickly did they give stroke and parry that the sheriff who loved to watch all lusty sports of the kind clapped his hands forgetting where he was and crying aloud well struck well struck thou fellow with the black beard little knowing that the man he called upon was the tinker that tried to serve his warrant upon robin hood  then several yeomen came forward and spread cloths upon the green grass and placed a royal feast while others still broached barrels of sack and malmsey and good stout ale and set them in jars upon the cloth with drinking horns about them then all sat down and feasted and drank merrily together until the sun was low and the halfmoon glimmered with a pale light betwixt the leaves of the trees overhead  then the sheriff arose and said i thank you all good yeomen for the merry entertainment ye have given me this day right courteously have ye used me showing therein that ye have much respect for our glorious king and his deputy in brave nottinghamshire but the shadows grow long and i must away before darkness comes lest i lose myself within the forest  then robin hood and all his merry men arose also and robin said to the sheriff if thou must go worshipful sir go thou must but thou hast forgotten one thing  nay i forgot nought said the sheriff yet all the same his heart sank within him  but i say thou hast forgot something quoth robin we keep a merry inn here in the greenwood but whoever becometh our guest must pay his reckoning  then the sheriff laughed but the laugh was hollow well jolly boys quoth he we have had a merry time together today and even if ye had not asked me i would have given you a score of pounds for the sweet entertainment i have had  nay quoth robin seriously it would ill beseem us to treat your worship so meanly by my faith sir sheriff i would be ashamed to show my face if i did not reckon the kings deputy at three hundred pounds is it not so my merry men all  then ay cried all in a loud voice  three hundred devils roared the sheriff think ye that your beggarly feast was worth three pounds let alone three hundred  nay quoth robin gravely speak not so roundly your worship i do love thee for the sweet feast thou hast given me this day in merry nottingham town but there be those here who love thee not so much if thou wilt look down the cloth thou wilt see will stutely in whose eyes thou hast no great favor then two other stout fellows are there here that thou knowest not that were wounded in a brawl nigh nottingham town some time agothou wottest when one of them was sore hurt in one arm yet he hath got the use of it again good sheriff be advised by me pay thy score without more ado or maybe it may fare ill with thee  as he spoke the sheriffs ruddy cheeks grew pale and he said nothing more but looked upon the ground and gnawed his nether lip then slowly he drew forth his fat purse and threw it upon the cloth in front of him  now take the purse little john quoth robin hood and see that the reckoning be right we would not doubt our sheriff but he might not like it if he should find he had not paid his full score  then little john counted the money and found that the bag held three hundred pounds in silver and gold but to the sheriff it seemed as if every clink of the bright money was a drop of blood from his veins and when he saw it all counted out in a heap of silver and gold filling a wooden platter he turned away and silently mounted his horse  never have we had so worshipful a guest before quoth robin and as the day waxeth late i will send one of my young men to guide thee out of the forest depths  nay heaven forbid cried the sheriff hastily i can find mine own way good man without aid  then i will put thee on the right track mine own self quoth robin and taking the sheriffs horse by the bridle rein he led him into the main forest path then before he let him go he said now fare thee well good sheriff and when next thou thinkest to despoil some poor prodigal remember thy feast in sherwood forest neer buy a horse good friend without first looking into its mouth as our good gaffer swanthold says and so once more fare thee well then he clapped his hand to the horses back and off went nag and sheriff through the forest glades  then bitterly the sheriff rued the day that first he meddled with robin hood for all men laughed at him and many ballads were sung by folk throughout the country of how the sheriff went to shear and came home shorn to the very quick for thus men sometimes overreach themselves through greed and guile     little john goes to nottingham fair  spring had gone since the sheriffs feast in sherwood and summer also and the mellow month of october had come all the air was cool and fresh the harvests were gathered home the young birds were full fledged the hops were plucked and apples were ripe but though time had so smoothed things over that men no longer talked of the horned beasts that the sheriff wished to buy he was still sore about the matter and could not bear to hear robin hoods name spoken in his presence  with october had come the time for holding the great fair which was celebrated every five years at nottingham town to which folk came from far and near throughout the country at such times archery was always the main sport of the day for the nottinghamshire yeomen were the best hand at the longbow in all merry england but this year the sheriff hesitated a long time before he issued proclamation of the fair fearing lest robin hood and his band might come to it at first he had a great part of a mind not to proclaim the fair but second thought told him that men would laugh at him and say among themselves that he was afraid of robin hood so he put that thought by at last he fixed in his mind that he would offer such a prize as they would not care to shoot for at such times it had been the custom to offer a half score of marks or a tun of ale so this year he proclaimed that a prize of two fat steers should be given to the best bowman  when robin hood heard what had been proclaimed he was vexed and said now beshrew this sheriff that he should offer such a prize that none but shepherd hinds will care to shoot for it i would have loved nothing better than to have had another bout at merry nottingham town but if i should win this prize nought would it pleasure or profit me  then up spoke little john nay but hearken good master said he only today will stutely young david of doncaster and i were at the sign of the blue boar and there we heard all the news of this merry fair and also that the sheriff hath offered this prize that we of sherwood might not care to come to the fair so good master if thou wilt i would fain go and strive to win even this poor thing among the stout yeomen who will shoot at nottingham town  nay little john quoth robin thou art a sound stout fellow yet thou lackest the cunning that good stutely hath and i would not have harm befall thee for all nottinghamshire nevertheless if thou wilt go take some disguise lest there be those there who may know thee  so be it good master quoth little john yet all the disguise that i wish is a good suit of scarlet instead of this of lincoln green i will draw the cowl of my jacket about my head so that it will hide my brown hair and beard and then i trust no one will know me  it is much against my will said robin hood neertheless if thou dost wish it get thee gone but bear thyself seemingly little john for thou art mine own righthand man and i could ill bear to have harm befall thee  so little john clad himself all in scarlet and started off to the fair at nottingham town  right merry were these fair days at nottingham when the green before the great town gate was dotted with booths standing in rows with tents of manycolored canvas hung about with streamers and garlands of flowers and the folk came from all the countryside both gentle and common in some booths there was dancing to merry music in others flowed ale and beer and in others yet again sweet cakes and barley sugar were sold and sport was going outside the booths also where some minstrel sang ballads of the olden time playing a second upon the harp or where the wrestlers struggled with one another within the sawdust ring but the people gathered most of all around a raised platform where stout fellows played at quarterstaff  so little john came to the fair all scarlet were his hose and jerkin and scarlet was his cowled cap with a scarlet feather stuck in the side of it over his shoulders was slung a stout bow of yew and across his back hung a quiver of good round arrows many turned to look after such a stout tall fellow for his shoulders were broader by a palmsbreadth than any that were there and he stood a head taller than all the other men the lasses also looked at him askance thinking they had never seen a lustier youth  first of all he went to the booth where stout ale was sold and standing aloft on a bench he called to all that were near to come and drink with him hey sweet lads cried he who will drink ale with a stout yeoman come all come all let us be merry for the day is sweet and the ale is tingling come hither good yeoman and thou and thou for not a farthing shall one of you pay nay turn hither thou lusty beggar and thou jolly tinker for all shall be merry with me  thus he shouted and all crowded around laughing while the brown ale flowed and they called little john a brave fellow each swearing that he loved him as his own brother for when one has entertainment with nothing to pay one loves the man that gives it to one  then he strolled to the platform where they were at cudgel play for he loved a bout at quarterstaff as he loved meat and drink and here befell an adventure that was sung in ballads throughout the midcountry for many a day  one fellow there was that cracked crowns of everyone who threw cap into the ring this was eric o lincoln of great renown whose name had been sung in ballads throughout the countryside when little john reached the stand he found none fighting but only bold eric walking up and down the platform swinging his staff and shouting lustily now who will come and strike a stroke for the lass he loves the best with a good lincolnshire yeoman how now lads step up step up or else the lasses eyes are not bright hereabouts or the blood of nottingham youth is sluggish and cold lincoln against nottingham say i for no one hath put foot upon the boards this day such as we of lincoln call a cudgel player  at this one would nudge another with his elbow saying go thou ned or go thou thomas but no lad cared to gain a cracked crown for nothing  presently eric saw where little john stood among the others a head and shoulders above them all and he called to him loudly halloa thou longlegged fellow in scarlet broad are thy shoulders and thick thy head is not thy lass fair enough for thee to take cudgel in hand for her sake in truth i believe that nottingham men do turn to bone and sinew for neither heart nor courage have they now thou great lout wilt thou not twirl staff for nottingham  ay quoth little john had i but mine own good staff here it would pleasure me hugely to crack thy knaves pate thou saucy braggart i wot it would be well for thee an thy cocks comb were cut thus he spoke slowly at first for he was slow to move but his wrath gathered headway like a great stone rolling down a hill so that at the end he was full of anger  then eric o lincoln laughed aloud well spoken for one who fears to meet me fairly man to man said he saucy art thou thine own self and if thou puttest foot upon these boards i will make thy saucy tongue rattle within thy teeth  now quoth little john is there never a man here that will lend me a good stout staff till i try the mettle of yon fellow at this half a score reached him their staves and he took the stoutest and heaviest of them all then looking up and down the cudgel he said now i have in my hand but a splint of wooda barley straw as it wereyet i trow it will have to serve me so here goeth thereupon he cast the cudgel upon the stand and leaping lightly after it snatched it up in his hand again  then each man stood in his place and measured the other with fell looks until he that directed the sport cried play at this they stepped forth each grasping his staff tightly in the middle then those that stood around saw the stoutest game of quarterstaff that eer nottingham town beheld at first eric o lincoln thought that he would gain an easy advantage so he came forth as if he would say watch good people how that i carve you this cockerel right speedily but he presently found it to be no such speedy matter right deftly he struck and with great skill of fence but he had found his match in little john once twice thrice he struck and three times little john turned the blows to the left hand and to the right then quickly and with a dainty backhanded blow he rapped eric beneath his guard so shrewdly that it made his head ring again then eric stepped back to gather his wits while a great shout went up and all were glad that nottingham had cracked lincolns crown and thus ended the first bout of the game  then presently the director of the sport cried play and they came together again but now eric played warily for he found his man was of right good mettle and also he had no sweet memory of the blow that he had got so this bout neither little john nor the lincoln man caught a stroke within his guard then after a while they parted again and this made the second bout  then for the third time they came together and at first eric strove to be wary as he had been before but growing mad at finding himself so foiled he lost his wits and began to rain blows so fiercely and so fast that they rattled like hail on penthouse roof but in spite of all he did not reach within little johns guard then at last little john saw his chance and seized it right cleverly once more with a quick blow he rapped eric beside the head and ere he could regain himself little john slipped his right hand down to his left and with a swinging blow smote the other so sorely upon the crown that down he fell as though he would never move again  then the people shouted so loud that folk came running from all about to see what was the ado while little john leaped down from the stand and gave the staff back to him that had lent it to him and thus ended the famous bout between little john and eric o lincoln of great renown  but now the time had come when those who were to shoot with the longbow were to take their places so the people began flocking to the butts where the shooting was to be near the target in a good place sat the sheriff upon a raised dais with many gentlefolk around him when the archers had taken their places the herald came forward and proclaimed the rules of the game and how each should shoot three shots and to him that should shoot the best the prize of two fat steers was to belong a score of brave shots were gathered there and among them some of the keenest hands at the longbow in lincoln and nottinghamshire and among them little john stood taller than all the rest who is yon stranger clad all in scarlet said some and others answered it is he that hath but now so soundly cracked the crown of eric o lincoln thus the people talked among themselves until at last it reached even the sheriffs ears  and now each man stepped forward and shot in turn but though each shot well little john was the best of all for three times he struck the clout and once only the length of a barleycorn from the center hey for the tall archer shouted the crowd and some among them shouted hey for reynold greenleaf for this was the name that little john had called himself that day  then the sheriff stepped down from the raised seat and came to where the archers stood while all doffed their caps that saw him coming he looked keenly at little john but did not know him though he said after a while how now good fellow methinks there is that about thy face that i have seen erewhile  mayhap it may be so quoth little john for often have i seen your worship and as he spoke he looked steadily into the sheriffs eyes so that the latter did not suspect who he was  a brave blade art thou good friend said the sheriff and i hear that thou hast well upheld the skill of nottinghamshire against that of lincoln this day what may be thy name good fellow  men do call me reynold greenleaf your worship said little john and the old ballad that tells of this adds so in truth was he a green leaf but of what manner of tree the sheriff wotted not  now reynold greenleaf quoth the sheriff thou art the fairest hand at the longbow that mine eyes ever beheld next to that false knave robin hood from whose wiles heaven forfend me wilt thou join my service good fellow thou shalt be paid right well for three suits of clothes shalt thou have a year with good food and as much ale as thou canst drink and besides this i will pay thee forty marks each michaelmastide  then here stand i a free man and right gladly will i enter thy household said little john for he thought he might find some merry jest should he enter the sheriffs service  fairly hast thou won the fat steers said the sheriff and hereunto i will add a butt of good march beer for joy of having gotten such a man for i wot thou shootest as fair a shaft as robin hood himself  then said little john for joy of having gotten myself into thy service i will give fat steers and brown ale to all these good folk to make them merry withal at this arose a great shout many casting their caps aloft for joy of the gift  then some built great fires and roasted the steers and others broached the butt of ale with which all made themselves merry then when they had eaten and drunk as much as they could and when the day faded and the great moon arose all red and round over the spires and towers of nottingham town they joined hands and danced around the fires to the music of bagpipes and harps but long before this merrymaking had begun the sheriff and his new servant reynold greenleaf were in the castle of nottingham     how little john lived at the sheriffs  thus little john entered into the sheriffs service and found the life he led there easy enough for the sheriff made him his righthand man and held him in great favor he sat nigh the sheriff at meat and he ran beside his horse when he went ahunting so that what with hunting and hawking a little and eating rich dishes and drinking good sack and sleeping until late hours in the morning he grew as fat as a stallfed ox thus things floated easily along with the tide until one day when the sheriff went ahunting there happened that which broke the smooth surface of things  this morning the sheriff and many of his men set forth to meet certain lords to go ahunting he looked all about him for his good man reynold greenleaf but not finding him was vexed for he wished to show little johns skill to his noble friends as for little john he lay abed snoring lustily till the sun was high in the heavens at last he opened his eyes and looked about him but did not move to arise brightly shone the sun in at the window and all the air was sweet with the scent of woodbine that hung in sprays about the wall without for the cold winter was past and spring was come again and little john lay still thinking how sweet was everything on this fair morn just then he heard faint and far away a distant bugle note sounding thin and clear the sound was small but like a little pebble dropped into a glassy fountain it broke all the smooth surface of his thoughts until his whole soul was filled with disturbance his spirit seemed to awaken from its sluggishness and his memory brought back to him all the merry greenwood lifehow the birds were singing blithely there this bright morning and how his loved companions and friends were feasting and making merry or perhaps talking of him with sober speech for when he first entered the sheriffs service he did so in jest but the hearthstone was warm during the winter and the fare was full and so he had abided putting off from day to day his going back to sherwood until six long months had passed but now he thought of his good master and of will stutely whom he loved better than anyone in all the world and of young david of doncaster whom he had trained so well in all manly sports till there came over his heart a great and bitter longing for them all so that his eyes filled with tears then he said aloud here i grow fat like a stallfed ox and all my manliness departeth from me while i become a sluggard and dolt but i will arouse me and go back to mine own dear friends once more and never will i leave them again till life doth leave my lips so saying he leaped from bed for he hated his sluggishness now  when he came downstairs he saw the steward standing near the pantry doora great fat man with a huge bundle of keys hanging to his girdle then little john said ho master steward a hungry man am i for nought have i had for all this blessed morn therefore give me to eat  then the steward looked grimly at him and rattled the keys in his girdle for he hated little john because he had found favor with the sheriff so master reynold greenleaf thou art anhungered art thou quoth he but fair youth if thou livest long enough thou wilt find that he who getteth overmuch sleep for an idle head goeth with an empty stomach for what sayeth the old saw master greenleaf is it not the late fowl findeth but ill faring  now thou great purse of fat cried little john i ask thee not for fools wisdom but for bread and meat who art thou that thou shouldst deny me to eat by saint dunstan thou hadst best tell me where my breakfast is if thou wouldst save broken bones  thy breakfast master fireblaze is in the pantry answered the steward  then fetch it hither cried little john who waxed angry by this time  go thou and fetch it thine own self quoth the steward am i thy slave to fetch and carry for thee  i say go thou bring it me  i say go thou fetch it for thyself  ay marry that will i right quickly quoth little john in a rage and so saying he strode to the pantry and tried to open the door but found it locked whereat the steward laughed and rattled his keys then the wrath of little john boiled over and lifting his clenched fist he smote the pantry door bursting out three panels and making so large an opening that he could easily stoop and walk through it  when the steward saw what was done he waxed mad with rage and as little john stooped to look within the pantry he seized him from behind by the nape of the neck pinching him sorely and smiting him over the head with his keys till the yeomans ears rang again at this little john turned upon the steward and smote him such a buffet that the fat man fell to the floor and lay there as though he would never move again there quoth little john think well of that stroke and never keep a good breakfast from a hungry man again  so saying he crept into the pantry and looked about him to see if he could find something to appease his hunger he saw a great venison pasty and two roasted capons beside which was a platter of plovers eggs moreover there was a flask of sack and one of canarya sweet sight to a hungry man these he took down from the shelves and placed upon a sideboard and prepared to make himself merry  now the cook in the kitchen across the courtyard heard the loud talking between little john and the steward and also the blow that little john struck the other so he came running across the court and up the stairway to where the stewards pantry was bearing in his hands the spit with the roast still upon it meanwhile the steward had gathered his wits about him and risen to his feet so that when the cook came to the stewards pantry he saw him glowering through the broken door at little john who was making ready for a good repast as one dog glowers at another that has a bone when the steward saw the cook he came to him and putting one arm over his shoulder alas sweet friend quoth hefor the cook was a tall stout manseest thou what that vile knave reynold greenleaf hath done he hath broken in upon our masters goods and hath smitten me a buffet upon the ear so that i thought i was dead good cook i love thee well and thou shalt have a good pottle of our masters best wine every day for thou art an old and faithful servant also good cook i have ten shillings that i mean to give as a gift to thee but hatest thou not to see a vile upstart like this reynold greenleaf taking it upon him so bravely  ay marry that do i quoth the cook boldly for he liked the steward because of his talk of the wine and of the ten shillings get thee gone straightway to thy room and i will bring out this knave by his ears so saying he laid aside his spit and drew the sword that hung by his side whereupon the steward left as quickly as he could for he hated the sight of naked steel  then the cook walked straightway to the broken pantry door through which he saw little john tucking a napkin beneath his chin and preparing to make himself merry  why how now reynold greenleaf said the cook thou art no better than a thief i wot come thou straight forth man or i will carve thee as i would carve a sucking pig  nay good cook bear thou thyself more seemingly or else i will come forth to thy dole at most times i am as a yearling lamb but when one cometh between me and my meat i am a raging lion as it were  lion or no lion quoth the valorous cook come thou straight forth else thou art a coward heart as well as a knavish thief  ha cried little john cowards name have i never had so look to thyself good cook for i come forth straight the roaring lion i did speak of but now  then he too drew his sword and came out of the pantry then putting themselves into position they came slowly together with grim and angry looks but suddenly little john lowered his point hold good cook said he now i bethink me it were ill of us to fight with good victuals standing so nigh and such a feast as would befit two stout fellows such as we are marry good friend i think we should enjoy this fair feast ere we fight what sayest thou jolly cook  at this speech the cook looked up and down scratching his head in doubt for he loved good feasting at last he drew a long breath and said to little john well good friend i like thy plan right well so pretty boy say i let us feast with all my heart for one of us may sup in paradise before nightfall  so each thrust his sword back into the scabbard and entered the pantry then after they had seated themselves little john drew his dagger and thrust it into the pie a hungry man must be fed quoth he so sweet chuck i help myself without leave but the cook did not lag far behind for straightway his hands also were deeply thrust within the goodly pasty after this neither of them spoke further but used their teeth to better purpose but though neither spoke they looked at one another each thinking within himself that he had never seen a more lusty fellow than the one across the board  at last after a long time had passed the cook drew a full deep breath as though of much regret and wiped his hands upon the napkin for he could eat no more little john also had enough for he pushed the pasty aside as though he would say i want thee by me no more good friend then he took the pottle of sack and said he now good fellow i swear by all that is bright that thou art the stoutest companion at eating that ever i had lo i drink thy health so saying he clapped the flask to his lips and cast his eyes aloft while the good wine flooded his throat then he passed the pottle to the cook who also said lo i drink thy health sweet fellow nor was he behind little john in drinking any more than in eating  now quoth little john thy voice is right round and sweet jolly lad i doubt not thou canst sing a ballad most blithely canst thou not  truly i have trolled one now and then quoth the cook yet i would not sing alone  nay truly said little john that were but ill courtesy strike up thy ditty and i will afterward sing one to match it if i can  so be it pretty boy quoth the cook and hast thou eer heard the song of the deserted shepherdess  truly i know not answered little john but sing thou and let me hear  then the cook took another draught from the pottle and clearing his throat sang right sweetly   the song of the deserted shepherdess       in lententime when leaves wax green      and pretty birds begin to mate      when lark cloth sing and thrush i ween      and stockdove cooeth soon and late      fair phillis sat beside a stone      and thus i heard her make her moan      o willow willow willow willow      ill take me of thy branches fair      and twine a wreath to deck my hair       the thrush hath taken him a she      the robin too and eke the dove      my robin hath deserted me      and left me for another love      so here by brookside all alone      i sit me down and make my moan      o willow willow willow willow      ill take me of thy branches fair      and twine a wreath to deck my hair       but neer came herring from the sea      but good as he were in the tide      young corydon came oer the lea      and sat him phillis down beside      so presently she changed her tone      and gan to cease her from her moan      o willow willow willow willow      thou mayst een keep thy garlands fair      i want them not to deck my hair  now by my faith cried little john that same is a right good song and hath truth in it also  glad am i thou likest it sweet lad said the cook now sing thou one also for neer should a man be merry alone or sing and list not  then i will sing thee a song of a right good knight of arthurs court and how he cured his hearts wound without running upon the dart again as did thy phillis for i wot she did but cure one smart by giving herself another so list thou while i sing   the good knight and his love       when arthur king did rule this land      a goodly king was he      and had he of stout knights a band      of merry company       among them all both great and small      a good stout knight was there      a lusty childe and eke a tall      that loved a lady fair       but nought would she to do with he      but turned her face away      so gat he gone to far countrye      and left that lady gay       there all alone he made his moan      and eke did sob and sigh      and weep till it would move a stone      and he was like to die       but still his heart did feel the smart      and eke the dire distress      and rather grew his pain more sharp      as grew his body less       then gat he back where was good sack      and merry com panye      and soon did cease to cry alack      when blithe and gay was he       from which i hold and feel full bold      to say and eke believe      that gin the belly go not cold      the heart will cease to grieve  now by my faith cried the cook as he rattled the pottle against the sideboard i like that same song hugely and eke the motive of it which lieth like a sweet kernel in a hazelnut  now thou art a man of shrewd opinions quoth little john and i love thee truly as thou wert my brother  and i love thee too but the day draweth on and i have my cooking to do ere our master cometh home so let us een go and settle this brave fight we have in hand  ay marry quoth little john and that right speedily never have i been more laggard in fighting than in eating and drinking so come thou straight forth into the passageway where there is good room to swing a sword and i will try to serve thee  then they both stepped forth into the broad passage that led to the stewards pantry where each man drew his sword again and without more ado fell upon the other as though he would hew his fellow limb from limb then their swords clashed upon one another with great din and sparks flew from each blow in showers so they fought up and down the hall for an hour and more neither striking the other a blow though they strove their best to do so for both were skillful at the fence so nothing came of all their labor ever and anon they rested panting then after getting their wind at it they would go again more fiercely than ever at last little john cried aloud hold good cook whereupon each rested upon his sword panting  now will i make my vow quoth little john thou art the very best swordsman that ever mine eyes beheld truly i had thought to carve thee ere now  and i had thought to do the same by thee quoth the cook but i have missed the mark somehow  now i have been thinking within myself quoth little john what we are fighting for but albeit i do not rightly know  why no more do i said the cook i bear no love for that pursy steward but i thought that we had engaged to fight with one another and that it must be done  now quoth little john it doth seem to me that instead of striving to cut one anothers throats it were better for us to be boon companions what sayst thou jolly cook wilt thou go with me to sherwood forest and join with robin hoods band thou shalt live a merry life within the woodlands and sevenscore good companions shalt thou have one of whom is mine own self thou shalt have three suits of lincoln green each year and forty marks in pay  now thou art a man after mine own heart cried the cook right heartily and as thou speakest of it that is the very service for me i will go with thee and that right gladly give me thy palm sweet fellow and i will be thine own companion from henceforth what may be thy name lad  men do call me little john good fellow  how and art thou indeed little john and robin hoods own righthand man many a time and oft i heard of thee but never did i hope to set eyes upon thee and thou art indeed the famous little john and the cook seemed lost in amazement and looked upon his companion with open eyes  i am little john indeed and i will bring to robin hood this day a right stout fellow to join his merry band but ere we go good friend it seemeth to me to be a vast pity that as we have had so much of the sheriffs food we should not also carry off some of his silver plate to robin hood as a present from his worship  ay marry is it said the cook and so they began hunting about and took as much silver as they could lay hands upon clapping it into a bag and when they had filled the sack they set forth to sherwood forest  plunging into the woods they came at last to the greenwood tree where they found robin hood and threescore of his merry men lying upon the fresh green grass when robin and his men saw who it was that came they leaped to their feet now welcome cried robin hood now welcome little john for long hath it been since we have heard from thee though we all knew that thou hadst joined the sheriffs service and how hast thou fared all these long days  right merrily have i lived at the lord sheriffs answered little john and i have come straight thence see good master i have brought thee his cook and even his silver plate thereupon he told robin hood and his merry men that were there all that had befallen him since he had left them to go to the fair at nottingham town then all shouted with laughter except robin hood but he looked grave  nay little john said he thou art a brave blade and a trusty fellow i am glad thou hast brought thyself back to us and with such a good companion as the cook whom we all welcome to sherwood but i like not so well that thou hast stolen the sheriffs plate like some paltry thief the sheriff hath been punished by us and hath lost three hundred pounds even as he sought to despoil another but he hath done nought that we should steal his household plate from him  though little john was vexed with this he strove to pass it off with a jest nay good master quoth he if thou thinkest the sheriff gave us not the plate i will fetch him that he may tell us with his own lips he giveth it all to us so saying he leaped to his feet and was gone before robin could call him back  little john ran for full five miles till he came to where the sheriff of nottingham and a gay company were hunting near the forest when little john came to the sheriff he doffed his cap and bent his knee god save thee good master quoth he  why reynold greenleaf cried the sheriff whence comest thou and where hast thou been  i have been in the forest answered little john speaking amazedly and there i saw a sight such as neer before mans eyes beheld yonder i saw a young hart all in green from top to toe and about him was a herd of threescore deer and they too were all of green from head to foot yet i dared not shoot good master for fear lest they should slay me  why how now reynold greenleaf cried the sheriff art thou dreaming or art thou mad that thou dost bring me such a tale  nay i am not dreaming nor am i mad said little john and if thou wilt come with me i will show thee this fair sight for i have seen it with mine own eyes but thou must come alone good master lest the others frighten them and they get away  so the party all rode forward and little john led them downward into the forest  now good master quoth he at last we are nigh where i saw this herd  then the sheriff descended from his horse and bade them wait for him until he should return and little john led him forward through a close copse until suddenly they came to a great open glade at the end of which robin hood sat beneath the shade of the great oak tree with his merry men all about him see good master sheriff quoth little john yonder is the hart of which i spake to thee  at this the sheriff turned to little john and said bitterly long ago i thought i remembered thy face but now i know thee woe betide thee little john for thou hast betrayed me this day  in the meantime robin hood had come to them now welcome master sheriff said he hast thou come today to take another feast with me  nay heaven forbid said the sheriff in tones of deep earnest i care for no feast and have no hunger today  nevertheless quoth robin if thou hast no hunger maybe thou hast thirst and well i know thou wilt take a cup of sack with me but i am grieved that thou wilt not feast with me for thou couldst have victuals to thy liking for there stands thy cook  then he led the sheriff willynilly to the seat he knew so well beneath the greenwood tree  ho lads cried robin fill our good friend the sheriff a right brimming cup of sack and fetch it hither for he is faint and weary  then one of the band brought the sheriff a cup of sack bowing low as he handed it to him but the sheriff could not touch the wine for he saw it served in one of his own silver flagons on one of his own silver plates  how now quoth robin dost thou not like our new silver service we have gotten a bag of it this day so saying he held up the sack of silver that little john and the cook had brought with them  then the sheriffs heart was bitter within him but not daring to say anything he only gazed upon the ground robin looked keenly at him for a time before he spoke again then said he now master sheriff the last time thou camest to sherwood forest thou didst come seeking to despoil a poor spendthrift and thou wert despoiled thine own self but now thou comest seeking to do no harm nor do i know that thou hast despoiled any man i take my tithes from fat priests and lordly squires to help those that they despoil and to raise up those that they bow down but i know not that thou hast tenants of thine own whom thou hast wronged in any way therefore take thou thine own again nor will i dispossess thee today of so much as one farthing come with me and i will lead thee from the forest back to thine own party again  then slinging the bag upon his shoulder he turned away the sheriff following him all too perplexed in mind to speak so they went forward until they came to within a furlong of the spot where the sheriffs companions were waiting for him then robin hood gave the sack of silver back to the sheriff take thou thine own again he said and hearken to me good sheriff take thou a piece of advice with it try thy servants well ere thou dost engage them again so readily then turning he left the other standing bewildered with the sack in his hands  the company that waited for the sheriff were all amazed to see him come out of the forest bearing a heavy sack upon his shoulders but though they questioned him he answered never a word acting like one who walks in a dream without a word he placed the bag across his nags back and then mounting rode away all following him but all the time there was a great turmoil of thoughts within his head tumbling one over the other and thus ends the merry tale of little john and how he entered the sheriffs service     little john and the tanner of blyth  one fine day not long after little john had left abiding with the sheriff and had come back with his worships cook to the merry greenwood as has just been told robin hood and a few chosen fellows of his band lay upon the soft sward beneath the greenwood tree where they dwelled the day was warm and sultry so that while most of the band were scattered through the forest upon this mission and upon that these few stout fellows lay lazily beneath the shade of the tree in the soft afternoon passing jests among themselves and telling merry stories with laughter and mirth  all the air was laden with the bitter fragrance of the may and all the bosky shades of the woodlands beyond rang with the sweet song of birdsthe throstle cock the cuckoo and the wood pigeonand with the song of birds mingled the cool sound of the gurgling brook that leaped out of the forest shades and ran fretting amid its rough gray stones across the sunlit open glade before the trysting tree and a fair sight was that halfscore of tall stout yeomen all clad in lincoln green lying beneath the broadspreading branches of the great oak tree amid the quivering leaves of which the sunlight shivered and fell in dancing patches upon the grass  suddenly robin hood smote his knee  by saint dunstan quoth he i had nigh forgot that quarterday cometh on apace and yet no cloth of lincoln green in all our store it must be looked to and that in quick season come busk thee little john stir those lazy bones of thine for thou must get thee straightway to our good gossip the draper hugh longshanks of ancaster bid him send us straightway twentyscore yards of fair cloth of lincoln green and mayhap the journey may take some of the fat from off thy bones that thou hast gotten from lazy living at our dear sheriffs  nay muttered little john for he had heard so much upon this score that he was sore upon the point nay truly mayhap i have more flesh upon my joints than i once had yet flesh or no flesh i doubt not that i could still hold my place and footing upon a narrow bridge against eer a yeoman in sherwood or nottinghamshire for the matter of that even though he had no more fat about his bones than thou hast good master  at this reply a great shout of laughter went up and all looked at robin hood for each man knew that little john spake of a certain fight that happened between their master and himself through which they first became acquainted  nay quoth robin hood laughing louder than all heaven forbid that i should doubt thee for i care for no taste of thy staff myself little john i must needs own that there are those of my band can handle a sevenfoot staff more deftly than i yet no man in all nottinghamshire can draw gray goose shaft with my fingers nevertheless a journey to ancaster may not be ill for thee so go thou as i bid and thou hadst best go this very evening for since thou hast abided at the sheriffs many know thy face and if thou goest in broad daylight thou mayst get thyself into a coil with some of his worships menatarms bide thou here till i bring thee money to pay our good hugh i warrant he hath no better customers in all nottinghamshire than we so saying robin left them and entered the forest  not far from the trysting tree was a great rock in which a chamber had been hewn the entrance being barred by a massive oaken door two palmsbreadth in thickness studded about with spikes and fastened with a great padlock this was the treasure house of the band and thither robin hood went and unlocking the door entered the chamber from which he brought forth a bag of gold which he gave to little john to pay hugh longshanks withal for the cloth of lincoln green  then up got little john and taking the bag of gold which he thrust into his bosom he strapped a girdle about his loins took a stout pikestaff full seven feet long in his hand and set forth upon his journey  so he strode whistling along the leafy forest path that led to fosse way turning neither to the right hand nor the left until at last he came to where the path branched leading on the one hand onward to fosse way and on the other as well little john knew to the merry blue boar inn here little john suddenly ceased whistling and stopped in the middle of the path first he looked up and then he looked down and then tilting his cap over one eye he slowly scratched the back part of his head for thus it was at the sight of these two roads two voices began to alarum within him the one crying there lies the road to the blue boar inn a can of brown october and a merry night with sweet companions such as thou mayst find there the other there lies the way to ancaster and the duty thou art sent upon now the first of these two voices was far the louder for little john had grown passing fond of good living through abiding at the sheriffs house so presently looking up into the blue sky across which bright clouds were sailing like silver boats and swallows skimming in circling flight quoth he i fear me it will rain this evening so ill een stop at the blue boar till it passes by for i know my good master would not have me wet to the skin so without more ado off he strode down the path that lay the way of his likings now there was no sign of any foul weather but when one wishes to do a thing as little john did one finds no lack of reasons for the doing  four merry wags were at the blue boar inn a butcher a beggar and two barefoot friars little john heard them singing from afar as he walked through the hush of the mellow twilight that was now falling over hill and dale right glad were they to welcome such a merry blade as little john fresh cans of ale were brought and with jest and song and merry tales the hours slipped away on fleeting wings none thought of time or tide till the night was so far gone that little john put by the thought of setting forth upon his journey again that night and so bided at the blue boar inn until the morrow  now it was an ill piece of luck for little john that he left his duty for his pleasure and he paid a great score for it as we are all apt to do in the same case as you shall see  up he rose at the dawn of the next day and taking his stout pikestaff in his hand he set forth upon his journey once more as though he would make up for lost time  in the good town of blyth there lived a stout tanner celebrated far and near for feats of strength and many tough bouts at wrestling and the quarterstaff for five years he had held the midcountry champion belt for wrestling till the great adam o lincoln cast him in the ring and broke one of his ribs but at quarterstaff he had never yet met his match in all the country about besides all this he dearly loved the longbow and a sly jaunt in the forest when the moon was full and the dun deer in season so that the kings rangers kept a shrewd eye upon him and his doings for arthur a blands house was apt to have aplenty of meat in it that was more like venison than the law allowed  now arthur had been to nottingham town the day before little john set forth on his errand there to sell a halfscore of tanned cowhides at the dawn of the same day that little john left the inn he started from nottingham homeward for blyth his way led all in the dewy morn past the verge of sherwood forest where the birds were welcoming the lovely day with a great and merry jubilee across the tanners shoulders was slung his stout quarterstaff ever near enough to him to be gripped quickly and on his head was a cap of doubled cowhide so tough that it could hardly be cloven even by a broadsword  now quoth arthur a bland to himself when he had come to that part of the road that cut through a corner of the forest no doubt at this time of year the dun deer are coming from the forest depths nigher to the open meadow lands mayhap i may chance to catch a sight of the dainty brown darlings thus early in the morn for there was nothing he loved better than to look upon a tripping herd of deer even when he could not tickle their ribs with a clothyard shaft accordingly quitting the path he went peeping this way and that through the underbrush spying now here and now there with all the wiles of a master of woodcraft and of one who had more than once donned a doublet of lincoln green  now as little john stepped blithely along thinking of nothing but of such things as the sweetness of the hawthorn buds that bedecked the hedgerows or gazing upward at the lark that springing from the dewy grass hung aloft on quivering wings in the yellow sunlight pouring forth its song that fell like a falling star from the sky his luck led him away from the highway not far from the spot where arthur a bland was peeping this way and that through the leaves of the thickets hearing a rustling of the branches little john stopped and presently caught sight of the brown cowhide cap of the tanner moving among the bushes  i do much wonder quoth little john to himself what yon knave is after that he should go thus peeping and peering about i verily believe that yon scurvy varlet is no better than a thief and cometh here after our own and the good kings dun deer for by much roving in the forest little john had come to look upon all the deer in sherwood as belonging to robin hood and his band as much as to good king harry nay quoth he again after a time this matter must een be looked into so quitting the highroad he also entered the thickets and began spying around after stout arthur a bland  so for a long time they both of them went hunting about little john after the tanner and the tanner after the deer at last little john trod upon a stick which snapped under his foot whereupon hearing the noise the tanner turned quickly and caught sight of the yeoman seeing that the tanner had spied him out little john put a bold face upon the matter  hilloa quoth he what art thou doing here thou naughty fellow who art thou that comest ranging sherwoods paths in very sooth thou hast an evil cast of countenance and i do think truly that thou art no better than a thief and comest after our good kings deer  nay quoth the tanner boldlyfor though taken by surprise he was not a man to be frightened by big wordsthou liest in thy teeth i am no thief but an honest craftsman as for my countenance it is what it is and for the matter of that thine own is none too pretty thou saucy fellow  ha quoth little john in a great loud voice wouldst thou give me backtalk now i have a great part of a mind to crack thy pate for thee i would have thee know fellow that i am as it were one of the kings foresters leastwise muttered he to himself i and my friends do take good care of our good sovereigns deer  i care not who thou art answered the bold tanner and unless thou hast many more of thy kind by thee thou canst never make arthur a bland cry a mercy  is it so cried little john in a rage now by my faith thou saucy rogue thy tongue hath led thee into a pit thou wilt have a sorry time getting out of for i will give thee such a drubbing as neer hast thou had in all thy life before take thy staff in thy hand fellow for i will not smite an unarmed man  marry come up with a murrain cried the tanner for he too had talked himself into a fume big words neer killed so much as a mouse who art thou that talkest so freely of cracking the head of arthur a bland if i do not tan thy hide this day as neer i tanned a calfs hide in all my life before split my staff into skewers for lambs flesh and call me no more brave man now look to thyself fellow  stay said little john let us first measure our cudgels i do reckon my staff longer than thine and i would not take vantage of thee by even so much as an inch  nay i pass not for length answered the tanner my staff is long enough to knock down a calf so look to thyself fellow i say again  so without more ado each gripped his staff in the middle and with fell and angry looks they came slowly together   now news had been brought to robin hood how that little john instead of doing his bidding had passed by duty for pleasure and so had stopped overnight with merry company at the blue boar inn instead of going straight to ancaster so being vexed to his heart by this he set forth at dawn of day to seek little john at the blue boar or at least to meet the yeoman on the way and ease his heart of what he thought of the matter as thus he strode along in anger putting together the words he would use to chide little john he heard of a sudden loud and angry voices as of men in a rage passing fell words back and forth from one to the other at this robin hood stopped and listened surely quoth he to himself that is little johns voice and he is talking in anger also methinks the other is strange to my ears now heaven forfend that my good trusty little john should have fallen into the hands of the kings rangers i must see to this matter and that quickly  thus spoke robin hood to himself all his anger passing away like a breath from the windowpane at the thought that perhaps his trusty righthand man was in some danger of his life so cautiously he made his way through the thickets whence the voices came and pushing aside the leaves peeped into the little open space where the two men staff in hand were coming slowly together  ha quoth robin to himself here is merry sport afoot now i would give three golden angels from my own pocket if yon stout fellow would give little john a right sound drubbing it would please me to see him well thumped for having failed in my bidding i fear me though there is but poor chance of my seeing such a pleasant sight so saying he stretched himself at length upon the ground that he might not only see the sport the better but that he might enjoy the merry sight at his ease  as you may have seen two dogs that think to fight walking slowly round and round each other neither cur wishing to begin the combat so those two stout yeomen moved slowly around each watching for a chance to take the other unaware and so get in the first blow at last little john struck like a flash andrapthe tanner met the blow and turned it aside and then smote back at little john who also turned the blow and so this mighty battle began then up and down and back and forth they trod the blows falling so thick and fast that at a distance one would have thought that half a score of men were fighting thus they fought for nigh a half an hour until the ground was all plowed up with the digging of their heels and their breathing grew labored like the ox in the furrow but little john suffered the most for he had become unused to such stiff labor and his joints were not as supple as they had been before he went to dwell with the sheriff  all this time robin hood lay beneath the bush rejoicing at such a comely bout of quarterstaff by my faith quoth he to himself never had i thought to see little john so evenly matched in all my life belike though he would have overcome yon fellow before this had he been in his former trim  at last little john saw his chance and throwing all the strength he felt going from him into one blow that might have felled an ox he struck at the tanner with might and main and now did the tanners cowhide cap stand him in good stead and but for it he might never have held staff in hand again as it was the blow he caught beside the head was so shrewd that it sent him staggering across the little glade so that if little john had had the strength to follow up his vantage it would have been ill for stout arthur but he regained himself quickly and at arms length struck back a blow at little john and this time the stroke reached its mark and down went little john at full length his cudgel flying from his hand as he fell then raising his staff stout arthur dealt him another blow upon the ribs  hold roared little john wouldst thou strike a man when he is down  ay marry would i quoth the tanner giving him another thwack with his staff  stop roared little john help hold i say i yield me i yield me i say good fellow  hast thou had enough asked the tanner grimly holding his staff aloft  ay marry and more than enough  and thou dost own that i am the better man of the two  yea truly and a murrain seize thee said little john the first aloud and the last to his beard  then thou mayst go thy ways and thank thy patron saint that i am a merciful man said the tanner  a plague o such mercy as thine said little john sitting up and feeling his ribs where the tanner had cudgeled him i make my vow my ribs feel as though every one of them were broken in twain i tell thee good fellow i did think there was never a man in all nottinghamshire could do to me what thou hast done this day  and so thought i also cried robin hood bursting out of the thicket and shouting with laughter till the tears ran down his cheeks o man man said he as well as he could for his mirth a didst go over like a bottle knocked from a wall i did see the whole merry bout and never did i think to see thee yield thyself so hand and foot to any man in all merry england i was seeking thee to chide thee for leaving my bidding undone but thou hast been paid all i owed thee full measure pressed down and overflowing by this good fellow marry a did reach out his arm full length while thou stood gaping at him and with a pretty rap tumbled thee over as never have i seen one tumbled before so spoke bold robin and all the time little john sat upon the ground looking as though he had sour curds in his mouth what may be thy name good fellow said robin next turning to the tanner  men do call me arthur a bland spoke up the tanner boldly and now what may be thy name  ha arthur a bland quoth robin i have heard thy name before good fellow thou didst break the crown of a friend of mine at the fair at ely last october the folk there call him jock o nottingham we call him will scathelock this poor fellow whom thou hast so belabored is counted the best hand at the quarterstaff in all merry england his name is little john and mine robin hood  how cried the tanner art thou indeed the great robin hood and is this the famous little john marry had i known who thou art i would never have been so bold as to lift my hand against thee let me help thee to thy feet good master little john and let me brush the dust from off thy coat  nay quoth little john testily at the same time rising carefully as though his bones had been made of glass i can help myself good fellow without thy aid and let me tell thee had it not been for that vile cowskin cap of thine it would have been ill for thee this day  at this robin laughed again and turning to the tanner he said wilt thou join my band good arthur for i make my vow thou art one of the stoutest men that ever mine eyes beheld  will i join thy band cried the tanner joyfully ay marry will i hey for a merry life cried he leaping aloft and snapping his fingers and hey for the life i love away with tanbark and filthy vats and foul cowhides i will follow thee to the ends of the earth good master and not a herd of dun deer in all the forest but shall know the sound of the twang of my bowstring  as for thee little john said robin turning to him and laughing thou wilt start once more for ancaster and we will go part way with thee for i will not have thee turn again to either the right hand or the left till thou hast fairly gotten away from sherwood there are other inns that thou knowest yet hereabouts thereupon leaving the thickets they took once more to the highway and departed upon their business     robin hood and will scarlet  thus they traveled along the sunny road three stout fellows such as you could hardly match anywhere else in all merry england many stopped to gaze after them as they strode along so broad were their shoulders and so sturdy their gait  quoth robin hood to little john why didst thou not go straight to ancaster yesterday as i told thee thou hadst not gotten thyself into such a coil hadst thou done as i ordered  i feared the rain that threatened said little john in a sullen tone for he was vexed at being so chaffed by robin with what had happened to him  the rain cried robin stopping of a sudden in the middle of the road and looking at little john in wonder why thou great oaf not a drop of rain has fallen these three days neither has any threatened nor hath there been a sign of foul weather in earth or sky or water  nevertheless growled little john the holy saint swithin holdeth the waters of the heavens in his pewter pot and he could have poured them out had he chosen even from a clear sky and wouldst thou have had me wet to the skin  at this robin hood burst into a roar of laughter o little john said he what butter wits hast thou in that head of thine who could hold anger against such a one as thou art  so saying they all stepped out once more with the right foot foremost as the saying is  after they had traveled some distance the day being warm and the road dusty robin hood waxed thirsty so there being a fountain of water as cold as ice just behind the hedgerow they crossed the stile and came to where the water bubbled up from beneath a mossy stone here kneeling and making cups of the palms of their hands they drank their fill and then the spot being cool and shady they stretched their limbs and rested them for a space  in front of them over beyond the hedge the dusty road stretched away across the plain behind them the meadow lands and bright green fields of tender young corn lay broadly in the sun and overhead spread the shade of the cool rustling leaves of the beechen tree pleasantly to their nostrils came the tender fragrance of the purple violets and wild thyme that grew within the dewy moisture of the edge of the little fountain and pleasantly came the soft gurgle of the water all was so pleasant and so full of the gentle joy of the bright maytime that for a long time no one of the three cared to speak but each lay on his back gazing up through the trembling leaves of the trees to the bright sky overhead at last robin whose thoughts were not quite so busy woolgathering as those of the others and who had been gazing around him now and then broke the silence  heyday quoth he yon is a gaily feathered bird i take my vow  the others looked and saw a young man walking slowly down the highway gay was he indeed as robin had said and a fine figure he cut for his doublet was of scarlet silk and his stockings also a handsome sword hung by his side the embossed leathern scabbard being picked out with fine threads of gold his cap was of scarlet velvet and a broad feather hung down behind and back of one ear his hair was long and yellow and curled upon his shoulders and in his hand he bore an early rose which he smelled at daintily now and then  by my life quoth robin hood laughing saw ye eer such a pretty mincing fellow  truly his clothes have overmuch prettiness for my taste quoth arthur a bland but neertheless his shoulders are broad and his loins are narrow and seest thou good master how that his arms hang from his body they dangle not down like spindles but hang stiff and bend at the elbow i take my vow there be no bread and milk limbs in those fine clothes but stiff joints and tough thews  methinks thou art right friend arthur said little john i do verily think that yon is no such roseleaf and whippedcream gallant as he would have one take him to be  pah quoth robin hood the sight of such a fellow doth put a nasty taste into my mouth look how he doth hold that fair flower betwixt his thumb and finger as he would say good rose i like thee not so ill but i can bear thy odor for a little while i take it ye are both wrong and verily believe that were a furious mouse to run across his path he would cry la or alackaday and fall straightway into a swoon i wonder who he may be  some great barons son i doubt not answered little john with good and true mens money lining his purse  ay marry that is true i make no doubt quoth robin what a pity that such men as he that have no thought but to go abroad in gay clothes should have good fellows whose shoes they are not fit to tie dancing at their bidding by saint dunstan saint alfred saint withold and all the good men in the saxon calendar it doth make me mad to see such gay lordlings from over the sea go stepping on the necks of good saxons who owned this land before ever their greatgrandsires chewed rind of brawn by the bright bow of heaven i will have their illgotten gains from them even though i hang for it as high as eer a forest tree in sherwood  why how now master quoth little john what heat is this thou dost set thy pot aboiling and mayhap no bacon to cook methinks yon fellows hair is overlight for norman locks he may be a good man and true for aught thou knowest  nay said robin my head against a leaden farthing he is what i say so lie ye both here i say till i show you how i drub this fellow so saying robin hood stepped forth from the shade of the beech tree crossed the stile and stood in the middle of the road with his hands on his hips in the strangers path  meantime the stranger who had been walking so slowly that all this talk was held before he came opposite the place where they were neither quickened his pace nor seemed to see that such a man as robin hood was in the world so robin stood in the middle of the road waiting while the other walked slowly forward smelling his rose and looking this way and that and everywhere except at robin  hold cried robin when at last the other had come close to him hold stand where thou art  wherefore should i hold good fellow said the stranger in soft and gentle voice and wherefore should i stand where i am neertheless as thou dost desire that i should stay i will abide for a short time that i may hear what thou mayst have to say to me  then quoth robin as thou dost so fairly do as i tell thee and dost give me such soft speech i will also treat thee with all due courtesy i would have thee know fair friend that i am as it were a votary at the shrine of saint wilfred who thou mayst know took willynilly all their gold from the heathen and melted it up into candlesticks wherefore upon such as come hereabouts i levy a certain toll which i use for a better purpose i hope than to make candlesticks withal therefore sweet chuck i would have thee deliver to me thy purse that i may look into it and judge to the best of my poor powers whether thou hast more wealth about thee than our law allows for as our good gaffer swanthold sayeth he who is fat from overliving must needs lose blood  all this time the youth had been sniffing at the rose that he held betwixt his thumb and finger nay said he with a gentle smile when robin hood had done i do love to hear thee talk thou pretty fellow and if haply thou art not yet done finish i beseech thee i have yet some little time to stay  i have said all quoth robin and now if thou wilt give me thy purse i will let thee go thy way without let or hindrance so soon as i shall see what it may hold i will take none from thee if thou hast but little  alas it doth grieve me much said the other that i cannot do as thou dost wish i have nothing to give thee let me go my way i prythee i have done thee no harm  nay thou goest not quoth robin till thou hast shown me thy purse  good friend said the other gently i have business elsewhere i have given thee much time and have heard thee patiently prythee let me depart in peace  i have spoken to thee friend said robin sternly and i now tell thee again that thou goest not one step forward till thou hast done as i bid thee so saying he raised his quarterstaff above his head in a threatening way  alas said the stranger sadly it doth grieve me that this thing must be i fear much that i must slay thee thou poor fellow so saying he drew his sword  put by thy weapon quoth robin i would take no vantage of thee thy sword cannot stand against an oaken staff such as mine i could snap it like a barley straw yonder is a good oaken thicket by the roadside take thee a cudgel thence and defend thyself fairly if thou hast a taste for a sound drubbing  first the stranger measured robin with his eye and then he measured the oaken staff thou art right good fellow said he presently truly my sword is no match for that cudgel of thine bide thee awhile till i get me a staff so saying he threw aside the rose that he had been holding all this time thrust his sword back into the scabbard and with a more hasty step than he had yet used stepped to the roadside where grew the little clump of ground oaks robin had spoken of choosing among them he presently found a sapling to his liking he did not cut it but rolling up his sleeves a little way he laid hold of it placed his heel against the ground and with one mighty pull plucked the young tree up by the roots from out the very earth then he came back trimming away the roots and tender stems with his sword as quietly as if he had done nought to speak of  little john and the tanner had been watching all that passed but when they saw the stranger drag the sapling up from the earth and heard the rending and snapping of its roots the tanner pursed his lips together drawing his breath between them in a long inward whistle  by the breath of my body said little john as soon as he could gather his wits from their wonder sawest thou that arthur marry i think our poor master will stand but an ill chance with yon fellow by our lady he plucked up yon green tree as it were a barley straw  whatever robin hood thought he stood his ground and now he and the stranger in scarlet stood face to face  well did robin hood hold his own that day as a midcountry yeoman this way and that they fought and back and forth robins skill against the strangers strength the dust of the highway rose up around them like a cloud so that at times little john and the tanner could see nothing but only hear the rattle of the staves against one another thrice robin hood struck the stranger once upon the arm and twice upon the ribs and yet had he warded all the others blows only one of which had it met its mark would have laid stout robin lower in the dust than he had ever gone before at last the stranger struck robins cudgel so fairly in the middle that he could hardly hold his staff in his hand again he struck and robin bent beneath the blow a third time he struck and now not only fairly beat down robins guard but gave him such a rap also that down he tumbled into the dusty road  hold cried robin hood when he saw the stranger raising his staff once more i yield me  hold cried little john bursting from his cover with the tanner at his heels hold give over i say  nay answered the stranger quietly if there be two more of you and each as stout as this good fellow i am like to have my hands full nevertheless come on and i will strive my best to serve you all  stop cried robin hood we will fight no more i take my vow this is an ill day for thee and me little john i do verily believe that my wrist and eke my arm are palsied by the jar of the blow that this stranger struck me  then little john turned to robin hood why how now good master said he alas thou art in an ill plight marry thy jerkin is all befouled with the dust of the road let me help thee to arise  a plague on thy aid cried robin angrily i can get to my feet without thy help good fellow  nay but let me at least dust thy coat for thee i fear thy poor bones are mightily sore quoth little john soberly but with a sly twinkle in his eyes  give over i say quoth robin in a fume my coat hath been dusted enough already without aid of thine then turning to the stranger he said what may be thy name good fellow  my name is gamwell answered the other  ha cried robin is it even so i have near kin of that name whence camest thou fair friend  from maxfield town i come answered the stranger there was i born and bred and thence i come to seek my mothers young brother whom men call robin hood so if perchance thou mayst direct me  ha will gamwell cried robin placing both hands upon the others shoulders and holding him off at arms length surely it can be none other i might have known thee by that pretty maiden air of thinethat dainty finicking manner of gait dost thou not know me lad look upon me well  now by the breath of my body cried the other i do believe from my heart that thou art mine own uncle robin nay certain it is so and each flung his arms around the other kissing him upon the cheek  then once more robin held his kinsman off at arms length and scanned him keenly from top to toe why how now quoth he what change is here verily some eight or ten years ago i left thee a stripling lad with great joints and illhung limbs and lo here thou art as tight a fellow as eer i set mine eyes upon dost thou not remember lad how i showed thee the proper way to nip the goose feather betwixt thy fingers and throw out thy bow arm steadily thou gayest great promise of being a keen archer and dost thou not mind how i taught thee to fend and parry with the cudgel  yea said young gamwell and i did so look up to thee and thought thee so above all other men that i make my vow had i known who thou wert i would never have dared to lift hand against thee this day i trust i did thee no great harm  no no quoth robin hastily and looking sideways at little john thou didst not harm me but say no more of that i prythee yet i will say lad that i hope i may never feel again such a blow as thou didst give me byr lady my arm doth tingle yet from fingernail to elbow truly i thought that i was palsied for life i tell thee coz that thou art the strongest man that ever i laid mine eyes upon i take my vow i felt my stomach quake when i beheld thee pluck up yon green tree as thou didst but tell me how camest thou to leave sir edward and thy mother  alas answered young gamwell it is an ill story uncle that i have to tell thee my fathers steward who came to us after old giles crookleg died was ever a saucy varlet and i know not why my father kept him saving that he did oversee with great judgment it used to gall me to hear him speak up so boldly to my father who thou knowest was ever a patient man to those about him and slow to anger and harsh words well one dayand an ill day it was for that saucy fellowhe sought to berate my father i standing by i could stand it no longer good uncle so stepping forth i gave him a box o the ear andwouldst thou believe itthe fellow straightway died ot i think they said i broke his neck or something o the like so off they packed me to seek thee and escape the law i was on my way when thou sawest me and here i am  well by the faith of my heart quoth robin hood for anyone escaping the law thou wast taking it the most easily that ever i beheld in all my life whenever did anyone in all the world see one who had slain a man and was escaping because of it tripping along the highway like a dainty court damsel sniffing at a rose the while  nay uncle answered will gamwell overhaste never churned good butter as the old saying hath it moreover i do verily believe that this overstrength of my body hath taken the nimbleness out of my heels why thou didst but just now rap me thrice and i thee never a once save by overbearing thee by my strength  nay quoth robin let us say no more on that score i am right glad to see thee will and thou wilt add great honor and credit to my band of merry fellows but thou must change thy name for warrants will be out presently against thee so because of thy gay clothes thou shalt henceforth and for aye be called will scarlet  will scarlet quoth little john stepping forward and reaching out his great palm which the other took will scarlet the name fitteth thee well right glad am i to welcome thee among us i am called little john and this is a new member who has just joined us a stout tanner named arthur a bland thou art like to achieve fame will let me tell thee for there will be many a merry ballad sung about the country and many a merry story told in sherwood of how robin hood taught little john and arthur a bland the proper way to use the quarterstaff likewise as it were how our good master bit off so large a piece of cake that he choked on it  nay good little john quoth robin gently for he liked ill to have such a jest told of him why should we speak of this little matter prythee let us keep this days doings among ourselves  with all my heart quoth little john but good master i thought that thou didst love a merry story because thou hast so often made a jest about a certain increase of fatness on my joints of flesh gathered by my abiding with the sheriff of  nay good little john said robin hastily i do bethink me i have said full enough on that score  it is well quoth little john for in truth i myself have tired of it somewhat but now i bethink me thou didst also seem minded to make a jest of the rain that threatened last night so  nay then said robin hood testily i was mistaken i remember me now it did seem to threaten rain  truly i did think so myself quoth little john therefore no doubt thou dost think it was wise of me to abide all night at the blue boar inn instead of venturing forth in such stormy weather dost thou not  a plague of thee and thy doings cried robin hood if thou wilt have it so thou wert right to abide wherever thou didst choose  once more it is well quoth little john as for myself i have been blind this day i did not see thee drubbed i did not see thee tumbled heels over head in the dust and if any man says that thou wert i can with a clear conscience rattle his lying tongue betwixt his teeth  come cried robin biting his nether lip while the others could not forbear laughing we will go no farther today but will return to sherwood and thou shalt go to ancaster another time little john  so said robin for now that his bones were sore he felt as though a long journey would be an ill thing for him so turning their backs they retraced their steps whence they came     the adventure with midge the millers son  when the four yeomen had traveled for a long time toward sherwood again high noontide being past they began to wax hungry quoth robin hood i would that i had somewhat to eat methinks a good loaf of white bread with a piece of snowwhite cheese washed down with a draught of humming ale were a feast for a king  since thou speakest of it said will scarlet methinks it would not be amiss myself there is that within me crieth out victuals good friend victuals  i know a house near by said arthur a bland and had i but the money i would bring ye that ye speak of to wit a sweet loaf of bread a fair cheese and a skin of brown ale  for the matter of that thou knowest i have money by me good master quoth little john  why so thou hast little john said robin how much money will it take good arthur to buy us meat and drink  i think that six broad pennies will buy food enow for a dozen men said the tanner  then give him six pennies little john quoth robin for methinks food for three men will about fit my need now get thee gone arthur with the money and bring the food here for there is a sweet shade in that thicket yonder beside the road and there will we eat our meal  so little john gave arthur the money and the others stepped to the thicket there to await the return of the tanner  after a time he came back bearing with him a great brown loaf of bread and a fair round cheese and a goatskin full of stout march beer slung over his shoulders then will scarlet took his sword and divided the loaf and the cheese into four fair portions and each man helped himself then robin hood took a deep pull at the beer aha said he drawing in his breath never have i tasted sweeter drink than this  after this no man spake more but each munched away at his bread and cheese lustily with ever and anon a pull at the beer  at last will scarlet looked at a small piece of bread he still held in his hand and quoth he methinks i will give this to the sparrows so throwing it from him he brushed the crumbs from his jerkin  i too quoth robin have had enough i think as for little john and the tanner they had by this time eaten every crumb of their bread and cheese  now quoth robin i do feel myself another man and would fain enjoy something pleasant before going farther upon our journey i do bethink me will that thou didst use to have a pretty voice and one that tuned sweetly upon a song prythee give us one ere we journey farther  truly i do not mind turning a tune answered will scarlet but i would not sing alone  nay others will follow strike up lad quoth robin  in that case tis well said will scarlet i do call to mind a song that a certain minstrel used to sing in my fathers hall upon occasion i know no name for it and so can give you none but thus it is then clearing his throat he sang       in the merry blossom time      when love longings food the breast      when the flower is on the lime      when the small fowl builds her nest      sweetly sings the nightingale      and the throstle cock so bold      cuckoo in the dewy dale      and the turtle in the word      but the robin i love dear      for he singeth through the year      robin robin      merry robin      so id have my true love be      not to fly      at the nigh      sign of cold adversity       when the spring brings sweet delights      when aloft the lark doth rise      lovers woo o mellow nights      and youths peep in maidens eyes      that time blooms the eglantine      daisies pied upon the hill      cowslips fair and columbine      dusky violets by the rill      but the ivy green cloth grow      when the north wind bringeth snow      ivy ivy      stanch and true      thus id have her love to be      not to die      at the nigh      breath of cold adversity  tis well sung quoth robin but cousin i tell thee plain i would rather hear a stout fellow like thee sing some lusty ballad than a finicking song of flowers and birds and what not yet thou didst sing it fair and tis none so bad a snatch of a song for the matter of that now tanner it is thy turn  i know not quoth arthur smiling with his head on one side like a budding lass that is asked to dance i know not that i can match our sweet friends song moreover i do verily think that i have caught a cold and have a certain tickling and huskiness in the windpipe  nay sing up friend quoth little john who sat next to him patting him upon the shoulder thou hast a fair round mellow voice let us have a touch of it  nay an ye will ha a poor thing said arthur i will do my best have ye ever heard of the wooing of sir keith the stout young cornish knight in good king arthurs time  methinks i have heard somewhat of it said robin but neertheless strike up thy ditty and let us hear it for as i do remember me it is a gallant song so out with it good fellow  thereupon clearing his throat the tanner without more ado began to sing   the wooing of sir keith       king arthur sat in his royal hall      and about on either hand      was many a noble lordling tall      the greatest in the land       sat  lancelot with raven locks      gawaine with golden hair      sir tristram kay who kept the locks      and many another there       and through the stained windows bright      from oer the redtiled eaves      the sunlight blazed with colored light      on golden helms and greaves       but suddenly a silence came      about the table round      for up the hall there walked a dame      bent nigh unto the ground       her nose was hooked her eyes were bleared      her locks were lank and white      upon her chin there grew a beard      she was a gruesome sight       and so with crawling step she came      and kneeled at arthurs feet      quoth kay she is the foulest dame      that eer my sight did greet       o mighty king of thee i crave      a boon on bended knee      twas thus she spoke what wouldst thou have      quoth arthur king of me       quoth she i have a foul disease      doth gnaw my very heart      and but one thing can bring me ease      or cure my bitter smart       there is no rest no ease for me      north east or west or south      till christian knight will willingly      thrice kiss me on the mouth       nor wedded may this childe have been      that giveth ease to me      nor may he be constrained i ween      but kiss me willingly       so is there here one christian knight      of such a noble strain      that he will give a tortured wight      sweet ease of mortal pain       a wedded man quoth arthur king      a wedded man i be      else would i deem it noble thing      to kiss thee willingly       now lancelot in all mens sight      thou art the head and chief      of chivalry come noble knight      and give her quick relief       but lancelot he turned aside      and looked upon the ground      for it did sting his haughty pride      to hear them laugh around       come thou sir tristram quoth the king      quoth he it cannot be      for neer can i my stomach bring      to do it willingly       wilt thou sir kay thou scornful wight      quoth kay nay by my troth      what noble dame would kiss a knight      that kissed so foul a mouth       wilt thou gawaine i cannot king      sir geraint nay not i      my kisses no relief could bring      for sooner would i die       then up and spake the youngest man      of all about the board      now such relief as christian can      ill give to her my lord       it was sir keith a youthful knight      yet strong of limb and bold      with beard upon his chin as light      as finest threads of gold       quoth kay he hath no mistress yet      that he may call his own      but here is one thats quick to get      as she herself has shown       he kissed her once he kissed her twice      he kissed her three times oer      a wondrous change came in a trice      and she was foul no more       her cheeks grew red as any rose      her brow as white as lawn      her bosom like the winter snows      her eyes like those of fawn       her breath grew sweet as summer breeze      that blows the meadows oer      her voice grew soft as rustling trees      and cracked and harsh no more       her hair grew glittering like the gold      her hands as white as milk      her filthy rags so foul and old      were changed to robes of silk       in great amaze the knights did stare      quoth kay i make my vow      if it will please thee lady fair      ill gladly kiss thee now       but young sir keith kneeled on one knee      and kissed her robes so fair      o let me be thy slave said he      for none to thee compare       she bent her down she kissed his brow      she kissed his lips and eyes      quoth she thou art my master now      my lord my love arise       and all the wealth that is mine own      my lands i give to thee      for never knight hath lady shown      such noble courtesy       bewitched was i in bitter pain      but thou hast set me free      so now i am myself again      i give myself to thee   yea truly quoth robin hood when the tanner had made an end of singing it is as i remember it a fair ditty and a ballad with a pleasing tune of a song  it hath oftentimes seemed to me said will scarlet that it hath a certain motive in it een such as this that a duty which seemeth to us sometimes ugly and harsh when we do kiss it fairly upon the mouth so to speak is no such foul thing after all  methinks thou art right quoth robin and contrariwise that when we kiss a pleasure that appeareth gay it turneth foul to us is it not so little john truly such a thing hath brought thee sore thumps this day nay man never look down in the mouth clear thy pipes and sing us a ditty  nay said little john i have none as fair as that merry arthur has trolled they are all poor things that i know moreover my voice is not in tune today and i would not spoil even a tolerable song by ill singing  upon this all pressed little john to sing so that when he had denied them a proper length of time such as is seemly in one that is asked to sing he presently yielded quoth he well an ye will ha it so i will give you what i can like to fair will i have no title to my ditty but thus it runs       o lady mine the spring is here      with a hey nonny nonny      the sweet love season of the year      with a ninny ninny nonny      now lad and lass      lie in the grass      that groweth green      with flowers between      the buck doth rest      the leaves do start      the cock doth crow      the breeze doth blow      and all things laugh in  who may yon fellow be coming along the road said robin breaking into the song  i know not quoth little john in a surly voice but this i do know that it is an ill thing to do to check the flow of a good song  nay little john said robin be not vexed i prythee but i have been watching him coming along bent beneath that great bag over his shoulder ever since thou didst begin thy song look little john i pray and see if thou knowest him  little john looked whither robin hood pointed truly quoth he after a time i think yon fellow is a certain young miller i have seen now and then around the edge of sherwood a poor wight methinks to spoil a good song about  now thou speakest of him quoth robin hood methinks i myself have seen him now and then hath he not a mill over beyond nottingham town nigh to the salisbury road  thou art right that is the man said little john  a good stout fellow quoth robin i saw him crack ned o bradfords crown about a fortnight since and never saw i hair lifted more neatly in all my life before  by this time the young miller had come so near that they could see him clearly his clothes were dusted with flour and over his back he carried a great sack of meal bending so as to bring the whole weight upon his shoulders and across the sack was a thick quarterstaff his limbs were stout and strong and he strode along the dusty road right sturdily with the heavy sack across his shoulders his cheeks were ruddy as a winter hip his hair was flaxen in color and on his chin was a downy growth of flaxen beard  a good honest fellow quoth robin hood and such an one as is a credit to english yeomanrie now let us have a merry jest with him we will forth as though we were common thieves and pretend to rob him of his honest gains then will we take him into the forest and give him a feast such as his stomach never held in all his life before we will flood his throat with good canary and send him home with crowns in his purse for every penny he hath what say ye lads  truly it is a merry thought said will scarlet  it is well planned quoth little john but all the saints preserve us from any more drubbings this day marry my poor bones ache so that i  prythee peace little john quoth robin thy foolish tongue will get us both well laughed at yet  my foolish tongue forsooth growled little john to arthur a bland i would it could keep our master from getting us into another coil this day  but now the miller plodding along the road had come opposite to where the yeomen lay hidden whereupon all four of them ran at him and surrounded him  hold friend cried robin to the miller whereupon he turned slowly with the weight of the bag upon his shoulder and looked at each in turn all bewildered for though a good stout man his wits did not skip like roasting chestnuts  who bids me stay said the miller in a voice deep and gruff like the growl of a great dog  marry that do i quoth robin and let me tell thee friend thou hadst best mind my bidding  and who art thou good friend said the miller throwing the great sack of meal from his shoulder to the ground and who are those with thee  we be four good christian men quoth robin and would fain help thee by carrying part of thy heavy load  i give you all thanks said the miller but my bag is none that heavy that i cannot carry it een by myself  nay thou dost mistake quoth robin i meant that thou mightest perhaps have some heavy farthings or pence about thee not to speak of silver and gold our good gaffer swanthold sayeth that gold is an overheavy burden for a twolegged ass to carry so we would een lift some of this load from thee  alas cried the miller what would ye do to me i have not about me so much as a clipped groat do me no harm i pray you but let me depart in peace moreover let me tell you that ye are upon robin hoods ground and should he find you seeking to rob an honest craftsman he will clip your ears to your heads and scourge you even to the walls of nottingham  in truth i fear robin hood no more than i do myself quoth jolly robin thou must this day give up to me every penny thou hast about thee nay if thou dost budge an inch i will rattle this staff about thine ears  nay smite me not cried the miller throwing up his elbow as though he feared the blow thou mayst search me if thou wilt but thou wilt find nothing upon me pouch pocket or skin  is it so quoth robin hood looking keenly upon him now i believe that what thou tellest is no true tale if i am not much mistook thou hast somewhat in the bottom of that fat sack of meal good arthur empty the bag upon the ground i warrant thou wilt find a shilling or two in the flour  alas cried the miller falling upon his knees spoil not all my good meal it can better you not and will ruin me spare it and i will give up the money in the bag  ha quoth robin nudging will scarlet is it so and have i found where thy money lies marry i have a wondrous nose for the blessed image of good king harry i thought that i smelled gold and silver beneath the barley meal bring it straight forth miller  then slowly the miller arose to his feet and slowly and unwillingly he untied the mouth of the bag and slowly thrust his hands into the meal and began fumbling about with his arms buried to the elbows in the barley flour the others gathered round him their heads together looking and wondering what he would bring forth  so they stood all with their heads close together gazing down into the sack but while he pretended to be searching for the money the miller gathered two great handfuls of meal ha quoth he here they are the beauties then as the others leaned still more forward to see what he had he suddenly cast the meal into their faces filling their eyes and noses and mouths with the flour blinding and half choking them arthur a bland was worse off than any for his mouth was open agape with wonder of what was to come so that a great cloud of flour flew down his throat setting him acoughing till he could scarcely stand  then while all four stumbled about roaring with the smart of the meal in their eyeballs and while they rubbed their eyes till the tears made great channels on their faces through the meal the miller seized another handful of flour and another and another throwing it in their faces so that even had they had a glimmering of light before they were now as blind as ever a beggar in nottinghamshire while their hair and beards and clothes were as white as snow  then catching up his great crabstaff the miller began laying about him as though he were clean gone mad this way and that skipped the four like peas on a drumhead but they could see neither to defend themselves nor to run away thwack thwack went the millers cudgel across their backs and at every blow great white clouds of flour rose in the air from their jackets and went drifting down the breeze  stop roared robin at last give over good friend i am robin hood  thou liest thou knave cried the miller giving him a rap on the ribs that sent up a great cloud of flour like a puff of smoke stout robin never robbed an honest tradesman ha thou wouldst have my money wouldst thou and he gave him another blow nay thou art not getting thy share thou longlegged knave share and share alike and he smote little john across the shoulders so that he sent him skipping half across the road nay fear not it is thy turn now black beard and he gave the tanner a crack that made him roar for all his coughing how now red coat let me brush the dust from thee cried he smiting will scarlet and so he gave them merry words and blows until they could scarcely stand and whenever he saw one like to clear his eyes he threw more flour in his face at last robin hood found his horn and clapping it to his lips blew three loud blasts upon it  now it chanced that will stutely and a party of robins men were in the glade not far from where this merry sport was going forward hearing the hubbub of voices and blows that sounded like the noise of a flail in the barn in wintertime they stopped listening and wondering what was toward quoth will stutely now if i mistake not there is some stout battle with cudgels going forward not far hence i would fain see this pretty sight so saying he and the whole party turned their steps whence the noise came when they had come near where all the tumult sounded they heard the three blasts of robins bugle horn  quick cried young david of doncaster our master is in sore need so without stopping a moment they dashed forward with might and main and burst forth from the covert into the highroad  but what a sight was that which they saw the road was all white with meal and five men stood there also white with meal from top to toe for much of the barley flour had fallen back upon the miller  what is thy need master cried will stutely and what doth all this mean  why quoth robin in a mighty passion yon traitor felt low hath come as nigh slaying me as eer a man in all the world hadst thou not come quickly good stutely thy master had been dead  hereupon while he and the three others rubbed the meal from their eyes and will stutely and his men brushed their clothes clean he told them all how that he had meant to pass a jest upon the miller which same had turned so grievously upon them  quick men seize the vile miller cried stutely who was nigh choking with laughter as were the rest whereupon several ran upon the stout fellow and seizing him bound his arms behind his back with bowstrings  ha cried robin when they brought the trembling miller to him thou wouldst murder me wouldst thou by my faithhere he stopped and stood glaring upon the miller grimly but robins anger could not hold so first his eyes twinkled and then in spite of all he broke into a laugh  now when they saw their master laugh the yeomen who stood around could contain themselves no longer and a mighty shout of laughter went up from all many could not stand but rolled upon the ground from pure merriment  what is thy name good fellow said robin at last to the miller who stood gaping and as though he were in amaze  alas sir i am midge the millers son said he in a frightened voice  i make my vow quoth merry robin smiting him upon the shoulder thou art the mightiest midge that eer mine eyes beheld now wilt thou leave thy dusty mill and come and join my band by my faith thou art too stout a man to spend thy days betwixt the hopper and the till  then truly if thou dost forgive me for the blows i struck not knowing who thou wast i will join with thee right merrily said the miller  then have i gained this day quoth robin the three stoutest yeomen in all nottinghamshire we will get us away to the greenwood tree and there hold a merry feast in honor of our new friends and mayhap a cup or two of good sack and canary may mellow the soreness of my poor joints and bones though i warrant it will be many a day before i am again the man i was so saying he turned and led the way the rest following and so they entered the forest once more and were lost to sight  so that night all was ablaze with crackling fires in the woodlands for though robin and those others spoken of only excepting midge the millers son had many a sore bump and bruise here and there on their bodies they were still not so sore in the joints that they could not enjoy a jolly feast given all in welcome to the new members of the band thus with songs and jesting and laughter that echoed through the deeper and more silent nooks of the forest the night passed quickly along as such merry times are wont to do until at last each man sought his couch and silence fell on all things and all things seemed to sleep  but little johns tongue was ever one that was not easy of guidance so that inch by inch the whole story of his fight with the tanner and robins fight with will scarlet leaked out and so i have told it that you may laugh at the merry tale along with me     robin hood and allan a dale  it has just been told how three unlucky adventures fell upon robin hood and little john all in one day bringing them sore ribs and aching bones so next we will tell how they made up for those ill happenings by a good action that came about not without some small pain to robin  two days had passed by and somewhat of the soreness had passed away from robin hoods joints yet still when he moved of a sudden and without thinking pain here and there would as it were jog him crying thou hast had a drubbing good fellow  the day was bright and jocund and the morning dew still lay upon the grass under the greenwood tree sat robin hood on one side was will scarlet lying at full length upon his back gazing up into the clear sky with hands clasped behind his head upon the other side sat little john fashioning a cudgel out of a stout crabtree limb elsewhere upon the grass sat or lay many others of the band  by the faith of my heart quoth merry robin i do bethink me that we have had no one to dine with us for this long time our money groweth low in the purse for no one hath come to pay a reckoning for many a day now busk thee good stutely and choose thee six men and get thee gone to fosse way or thereabouts and see that thou bringest someone to eat with us this evening meantime we will prepare a grand feast to do whosoever may come the greater honor and stay good stutely i would have thee take will scarlet with thee for it is meet that he should become acquaint with the ways of the forest  now do i thank thee good master quoth stutely springing to his feet that thou hast chosen me for this adventure truly my limbs do grow slack through abiding idly here as for two of my six i will choose midge the miller and arthur a bland for as well thou knowest good master they are stout fists at the quarterstaff is it not so little john  at this all laughed but little john and robin who twisted up his face i can speak for midge said he and likewise for my cousin scarlet this very blessed morn i looked at my ribs and found them as many colors as a beggars cloak  so having chosen four more stout fellows will stutely and his band set forth to fosse way to find whether they might not come across some rich guest to feast that day in sherwood with robin and his band  for all the livelong day they abided near this highway each man had brought with him a good store of cold meat and a bottle of stout march beer to stay his stomach till the homecoming so when high noontide had come they sat them down upon the soft grass beneath a green and widespreading hawthorn bush and held a hearty and jovial feast after this one kept watch while the others napped for it was a still and sultry day  thus they passed the time pleasantly enow but no guest such as they desired showed his face in all the time that they lay hidden there many passed along the dusty road in the glare of the sun now it was a bevy of chattering damsels merrily tripping along now it was a plodding tinker now a merry shepherd lad now a sturdy farmer all gazing ahead along the road unconscious of the seven stout fellows that lay hidden so near them such were the travelers along the way but fat abbot rich esquire or moneyladen usurer came there none  at last the sun began to sink low in the heavens the light grew red and the shadows long the air grew full of silence the birds twittered sleepily and from afar came faint and clear the musical song of the milkmaid calling the kine home to the milking  then stutely arose from where he was lying a plague of such ill luck quoth he here have we abided all day and no bird worth the shooting so to speak hath come within reach of our bolt had i gone forth on an innocent errand i had met a dozen stout priests or a score of pursy moneylenders but it is ever thus the dun deer are never so scarce as when one has a gray goose feather nipped betwixt the fingers come lads let us pack up and home again say i  accordingly the others arose and coming forth from out the thicket they all turned their toes back again to sherwood after they had gone some distance will stutely who headed the party suddenly stopped hist quoth he for his ears were as sharp as those of a fiveyearold fox hark lads methinks i hear a sound at this all stopped and listened with bated breath albeit for a time they could hear nothing their ears being duller than stutelys at length they heard a faint and melancholy sound like someone in lamentation  ha quoth will scarlet this must be looked into there is someone in distress nigh to us here  i know not quoth will stutely shaking his head doubtfully our master is ever rash about thrusting his finger into a boiling pot but for my part i see no use in getting ourselves into mischievous coils yon is a mans voice if i mistake not and a man should be always ready to get himself out from his own pothers  then out spake will scarlet boldly now out upon thee to talk in that manner stutely stay if thou dost list i go to see what may be the trouble of this poor creature  nay quoth stutely thou dost leap so quickly thoult tumble into the ditch who said i would not go come along say i thus saying he led the way the others following till after they had gone a short distance they came to a little opening in the woodland whence a brook after gurgling out from under the tangle of overhanging bushes spread out into a broad and glassypebbled pool by the side of this pool and beneath the branches of a willow lay a youth upon his face weeping aloud the sound of which had first caught the quick ears of stutely his golden locks were tangled his clothes were all awry and everything about him betokened sorrow and woe over his head from the branches of the osier hung a beautiful harp of polished wood inlaid with gold and silver in fantastic devices beside him lay a stout ashen bow and half a score of fair smooth arrows  halloa shouted will stutely when they had come out from the forest into the little open spot who art thou fellow that liest there killing all the green grass with salt water  hearing the voice the stranger sprang to his feet and snatching up his bow and fitting a shaft held himself in readiness for whatever ill might befall him  truly said one of the yeomen when they had seen the young strangers face i do know that lad right well he is a certain minstrel that i have seen hereabouts more than once it was only a week ago i saw him skipping across the hill like a yearling doe a fine sight he was then with a flower at his ear and a cocks plume stuck in his cap but now methinks our cockerel is shorn of his gay feathers  pah cried will stutely coming up to the stranger wipe thine eyes man i do hate to see a tall stout fellow so sniveling like a girl of fourteen over a dead tomtit put down thy bow man we mean thee no harm  but will scarlet seeing how the stranger who had a young and boyish look was stung by the words that stutely had spoken came to him and put his hand upon the youths shoulder nay thou art in trouble poor boy said he kindly mind not what these fellows have said they are rough but they mean thee well mayhap they do not understand a lad like thee thou shalt come with us and perchance we may find a certain one that can aid thee in thy perplexities whatsoever they may be  yea truly come along said will stutely gruffly i meant thee no harm and may mean thee some good take down thy singing tool from off this fair tree and away with us  the youth did as he was bidden and with bowed head and sorrowful step accompanied the others walking beside will scarlet so they wended their way through the forest the bright light faded from the sky and a glimmering gray fell over all things from the deeper recesses of the forest the strange whispering sounds of nighttime came to the ear all else was silent saving only for the rattling of their footsteps amid the crisp dry leaves of the last winter at last a ruddy glow shone before them here and there through the trees a little farther and they came to the open glade now bathed in the pale moonlight in the center of the open crackled a great fire throwing a red glow on all around at the fire were roasting juicy steaks of venison pheasants capons and fresh fish from the river all the air was filled with the sweet smell of good things cooking  the little band made its way across the glade many yeomen turning with curious looks and gazing after them but none speaking or questioning them so with will scarlet upon one side and will stutely upon the other the stranger came to where robin hood sat on a seat of moss under the greenwood tree with little john standing beside him  good even fair friend said robin hood rising as the other drew near and hast thou come to feast with me this day  alas i know not said the lad looking around him with dazed eyes for he was bewildered with all that he saw truly i know not whether i be in a dream said he to himself in a low voice  nay marry quoth robin laughing thou art awake as thou wilt presently find for a fine feast is acooking for thee thou art our honored guest this day  still the young stranger looked about him as though in a dream presently he turned to robin methinks said he i know now where i am and what hath befallen me art not thou the great robin hood  thou hast hit the bulls eye quoth robin clapping him upon the shoulder men hereabouts do call me by that name sin thou knowest me thou knowest also that he who feasteth with me must pay his reckoning i trust thou hast a full purse with thee fair stranger  alas said the stranger i have no purse nor no money either saving only the half of a sixpence the other half of which mine own dear love doth carry in her bosom hung about her neck by a strand of silken thread  at this speech a great shout of laughter went up from those around whereat the poor boy looked as he would die of shame but robin hood turned sharply to will stutely why how now quoth he is this the guest that thou hast brought us to fill our purse methinks thou hast brought but a lean cock to the market  nay good master answered will stutely grinning he is no guest of mine it was will scarlet that brought him thither  then up spoke will scarlet and told how they had found the lad in sorrow and how he had brought him to robin thinking that he might perchance aid him in his trouble then robin hood turned to the youth and placing his hand upon the others shoulder held him off at arms length scanning his face closely  a young face quoth he in a low voice half to himself a kind face a good face tis like a maidens for purity and withal the fairest that eer mine eyes did see but if i may judge fairly by thy looks grief cometh to young as well as to old at these words spoken so kindly the poor lads eyes brimmed up with tears nay nay said robin hastily cheer up lad i warrant thy case is not so bad that it cannot be mended what may be thy name  allen a dale is my name good master  allen a dale repeated robin musing allen a dale it doth seem to me that the name is not altogether strange to mine ears yea surely thou art the minstrel of whom we have been hearing lately whose voice so charmeth all men dost thou not come from the dale of rotherstream over beyond stavely  yea truly answered allan i do come thence  how old art thou allan said robin  i am but twenty years of age  methinks thou art overyoung to be perplexed with trouble quoth robin kindly then turning to the others he cried come lads busk ye and get our feast ready only thou will scarlet and thou little john stay here with me  then when the others had gone each man about his business robin turned once more to the youth now lad said he tell us thy troubles and speak freely a flow of words doth ever ease the heart of sorrows it is like opening the waste weir when the mill dam is overfull come sit thou here beside me and speak at thine ease  then straightway the youth told the three yeomen all that was in his heart at first in broken words and phrases then freely and with greater ease when he saw that all listened closely to what he said so he told them how he had come from york to the sweet vale of rother traveling the country through as a minstrel stopping now at castle now at hall and now at farmhouse how he had spent one sweet evening in a certain broad low farmhouse where he sang before a stout franklin and a maiden as pure and lovely as the first snowdrop of spring how he had played and sung to her and how sweet ellen o the dale had listened to him and had loved him then in a low sweet voice scarcely louder than a whisper he told how he had watched for her and met her now and then when she went abroad but was all too afraid in her sweet presence to speak to her until at last beside the banks of rother he had spoken of his love and she had whispered that which had made his heartstrings quiver for joy then they broke a sixpence between them and vowed to be true to one another forever  next he told how her father had discovered what was adoing and had taken her away from him so that he never saw her again and his heart was sometimes like to break how this morn only one short month and a half from the time that he had seen her last he had heard and knew it to be so that she was to marry old sir stephen of trent two days hence for ellens father thought it would be a grand thing to have his daughter marry so high albeit she wished it not nor was it wonder that a knight should wish to marry his own sweet love who was the most beautiful maiden in all the world  to all this the yeomen listened in silence the clatter of many voices jesting and laughing sounding around them and the red light of the fire shining on their faces and in their eyes so simple were the poor boys words and so deep his sorrow that even little john felt a certain knotty lump rise in his throat  i wonder not said robin after a moments silence that thy true love loved thee for thou hast surely a silver cross beneath thy tongue even like good saint francis that could charm the birds of the air by his speech  by the breath of my body burst forth little john seeking to cover his feelings with angry words i have a great part of a mind to go straightway and cudgel the nasty life out of the body of that same vile sir stephen marry come up say iwhat a plaguedoes an old weazen think that tender lasses are to be bought like pullets o a market day out upon himibut no matter only let him look to himself  then up spoke will scarlet methinks it seemeth but ill done of the lass that she should so quickly change at others bidding more especially when it cometh to the marrying of a man as old as this same sir stephen i like it not in her allan  nay said allan hotly thou dost wrong her she is as soft and gentle as a stockdove i know her better than anyone in all the world she may do her fathers bidding but if she marries sir stephen her heart will break and she will die my own sweet dear i he stopped and shook his head for he could say nothing further  while the others were speaking robin hood had been sunk in thought methinks i have a plan might fit thy case allan said he but tell me first thinkest thou lad that thy true love hath spirit enough to marry thee were ye together in church the banns published and the priest found even were her father to say her nay  ay marry would she cried allan eagerly  then if her father be the man that i take him to be i will undertake that he shall give you both his blessing as wedded man and wife in the place of old sir stephen and upon his wedding morn but stay now i bethink me there is one thing reckoned not uponthe priest truly those of the cloth do not love me overmuch and when it comes to doing as i desire in such a matter they are as like as not to prove stiffnecked as to the lesser clergy they fear to do me a favor because of abbot or bishop  nay quoth will scarlet laughing so far as that goeth i know of a certain friar that couldst thou but get on the soft side of him would do thy business even though pope joan herself stood forth to ban him he is known as the curtal friar of fountain abbey and dwelleth in fountain dale  but quoth robin fountain abbey is a good hundred miles from here an we would help this lad we have no time to go thither and back before his true love will be married nought is to be gained there coz  yea quoth will scarlet laughing again but this fountain abbey is not so far away as the one of which thou speakest uncle the fountain abbey of which i speak is no such rich and proud place as the other but a simple little cell yet withal as cosy a spot as ever stout anchorite dwelled within i know the place well and can guide thee thither for though it is a goodly distance yet methinks a stout pair of legs could carry a man there and back in one day  then give me thy hand allan cried robin and let me tell thee i swear by the bright hair of saint aelfrida that this time two days hence ellen a dale shall be thy wife i will seek this same friar of fountain abbey tomorrow day and i warrant i will get upon the soft side of him even if i have to drub one soft  at this will scarlet laughed again be not too sure of that good uncle quoth he nevertheless from what i know of him i think this curtal friar will gladly join two such fair lovers more especially if there be good eating and drinking afoot thereafter  but now one of the band came to say that the feast was spread upon the grass so robin leading the way the others followed to where the goodly feast was spread merry was the meal jest and story passed freely and all laughed till the forest rang again allan laughed with the rest for his cheeks were flushed with the hope that robin hood had given him  at last the feast was done and robin hood turned to allan who sat beside him now allan quoth he so much has been said of thy singing that we would fain have a taste of thy skill ourselves canst thou not give us something  surely answered allan readily for he was no thirdrate songster that must be asked again and again but said yes or no at the first bidding so taking up his harp he ran his fingers lightly over the sweetly sounding strings and all was hushed about the cloth then backing his voice with sweet music on his harp he sang   may ellens wedding  giving an account of how she was beloved by a fairy prince who took her to his own home       may ellen sat beneath a thorn      and in a shower around      the blossoms fell at every breeze      like snow upon the ground      and in a lime tree near was heard      the sweet song of a strange wild bird       o sweet sweet sweet o piercing sweet      o lingering sweet the strain      may ellens heart within her breast      stood still with blissful pain      and so with listening upturned face      she sat as dead in that fair place       come down from out the blossoms bird      come down from out the tree      and on my heart ill let thee lie      and love thee tenderly      thus cried may ellen soft and low      from where the hawthorn shed its snow       down dropped the bird on quivering wing      from out the blossoming tree      and nestled in her snowy breast      my love my love cried she      then straightway home mid sun and flower      she bare him to her own sweet bower       the day hath passed to mellow night      the moon floats oer the lea      and in its solemn pallid light      a youth stands silently      a youth of beauty strange and rare      within may ellens bower there       he stood where oer the pavement cold      the glimmering moonbeams lay      may ellen gazed with wide scared eyes      nor could she turn away      for as in mystic dreams we see      a spirit stood he silently       all in a low and breathless voice      whence comest thou said she      art thou the creature of a dream      or a vision that i see      then soft spake he as night winds shiver      through straining reeds beside the river       i came a bird on feathered wing      from distant faeryland      where murmuring waters softly sing      upon the golden strand      where sweet trees are forever green      and there my mother is the queen       no more may ellen leaves her bower      to grace the blossoms fair      but in the hushed and midnight hour      they hear her talking there      or when the moon is shining white      they hear her singing through the night       oh don thy silks and jewels fine      may ellens mother said      for hither comes the lord of lyne      and thou this lord must wed      may ellen said it may not be      he neer shall find his wife in me       up spoke her brother dark and grim      now by the bright blue sky      eer yet a day hath gone for him      thy wicked bird shall die      for he hath wrought thee bitter harm      by some strange art or cunning charm       then with a sad and mournful song      away the bird did fly      and oer the castle eaves and through      the gray and windy sky      come forth then cried the brother grim      why dost thou gaze so after him       it is may ellens wedding day      the sky is blue and fair      and many a lord and lady gay      in church are gathered there      the bridegroom was sir hugh the bold      all clad in silk and cloth of gold       in came the bride in samite white      with a white wreath on her head      her eyes were fixed with a glassy look      her face was as the dead      and when she stood among the throng      she sang a wild and wondrous song       then came a strange and rushing sound      like the coming wind doth bring      and in the open windows shot      nine swans on whistling wing      and high above the heads they flew      in gleaming fight the darkness through       around may ellens head they flew      in wide and windy fight      and three times round the circle drew      the guests shrank in affright      and the priest beside the altar there      did cross himself with muttered prayer       but the third time they flew around      fair ellen straight was gone      and in her place upon the ground      there stood a snowwhite swan      then with a wild and lovely song      it joined the swift and winged throng       theres ancient men at weddings been      for sixty years and more      but such a wondrous wedding day      they never saw before      but none could check and none could stay      the swans that bore the bride away  not a sound broke the stillness when allan a dale had done but all sat gazing at the handsome singer for so sweet was his voice and the music that each man sat with bated breath lest one drop more should come and he should lose it  by my faith and my troth quoth robin at last drawing a deep breath lad thou artthou must not leave our company allan wilt thou not stay with us here in the sweet green forest truly i do feel my heart go out toward thee with great love  then allan took robins hand and kissed it i will stay with thee always dear master said he for never have i known such kindness as thou hast shown me this day  then will scarlet stretched forth his hand and shook allans in token of fellowship as did little john likewise and thus the famous allan a dale became one of robin hoods band     robin hood seeks the curtal friar  the stout yeomen of sherwood forest were ever early risers of a morn more especially when the summertime had come for then in the freshness of the dawn the dew was always the brightest and the song of the small birds the sweetest  quoth robin now will i go to seek this same friar of fountain abbey of whom we spake yesternight and i will take with me four of my good men and these four shall be little john will scarlet david of doncaster and arthur a bland bide the rest of you here and will stutely shall be your chief while i am gone then straightway robin hood donned a fine steel coat of chain mail over which he put on a light jacket of lincoln green upon his head he clapped a steel cap and this he covered by one of soft white leather in which stood a nodding cocks plume by his side he hung a good broadsword of tempered steel the bluish blade marked all over with strange figures of dragons winged women and what not a gallant sight was robin so arrayed i wot the glint of steel showing here and there as the sunlight caught brightly the links of polished mail that showed beneath his green coat  so having arrayed himself he and the four yeomen set forth upon their way will scarlet taking the lead for he knew better than the others whither to go thus mile after mile they strode along now across a brawling stream now along a sunlit road now adown some sweet forest path over which the trees met in green and rustling canopy and at the end of which a herd of startled deer dashed away with rattle of leaves and crackle of branches onward they walked with song and jest and laughter till noontide was passed when at last they came to the banks of a wide glassy and lilypadded stream here a broad beaten path stretched along beside the banks on which path labored the horses that tugged at the slowmoving barges laden with barley meal or what not from the countryside to the manytowered town but now in the hot silence of the midday no horse was seen nor any man besides themselves behind them and before them stretched the river its placid bosom ruffled here and there by the purple dusk of a small breeze  now good uncle quoth will scarlet at last when they had walked for a long time beside this sweet bright river just beyond yon bend ahead of us is a shallow ford which in no place is deeper than thy midthigh and upon the other side of the stream is a certain little hermitage hidden amidst the bosky tangle of the thickets wherein dwelleth the friar of fountain dale thither will i lead thee for i know the way albeit it is not overhard to find  nay quoth jolly robin stopping suddenly had i thought that i should have had to wade water even were it so crystal a stream as this i had donned other clothes than i have upon me but no matter now for after all a wetting will not wash the skin away and what must be must but bide ye here lads for i would enjoy this merry adventure alone nevertheless listen well and if ye hear me sound upon my bugle horn come quickly so saying he turned and left them striding onward alone  robin had walked no farther than where the bend of the road hid his good men from his view when he stopped suddenly for he thought that he heard voices he stood still and listened and presently heard words passed back and forth betwixt what seemed to be two men and yet the two voices were wondrously alike the sound came from over behind the bank that here was steep and high dropping from the edge of the road a half a score of feet to the sedgy verge of the river  tis strange muttered robin to himself after a space when the voices had ceased their talking surely there be two people that spoke the one to the other and yet methinks their voices are mightily alike i make my vow that never have i heard the like in all my life before truly if this twain are to be judged by their voices no two peas were ever more alike i will look into this matter so saying he came softly to the river bank and laying him down upon the grass peered over the edge and down below  all was cool and shady beneath the bank a stout osier grew not straight upward but leaning across the water shadowing the spot with its soft foliage all around grew a mass of feathery ferns such as hide and nestle in cool places and up to robins nostrils came the tender odor of the wild thyme that loves the moist verges of running streams here with his broad back against the rugged trunk of the willow tree and half hidden by the soft ferns around him sat a stout brawny fellow but no other man was there his head was as round as a ball and covered with a mat of closeclipped curly black hair that grew low down on his forehead but his crown was shorn as smooth as the palm of ones hand which together with his loose robe cowl and string of beads showed that which his looks never would have done that he was a friar his cheeks were as red and shining as a winter crab albeit they were nearly covered over with a close curly black beard as were his chin and upper lip likewise his neck was thick like that of a north country bull and his round head closely set upon shoulders een a match for those of little john himself beneath his bushy black brows danced a pair of little gray eyes that could not stand still for very drollery of humor no man could look into his face and not feel his heartstrings tickled by the merriment of their look by his side lay a steel cap which he had laid off for the sake of the coolness to his crown his legs were stretched wide apart and betwixt his knees he held a great pasty compounded of juicy meats of divers kinds made savory with tender young onions both meat and onions being mingled with a good rich gravy in his right fist he held a great piece of brown crust at which he munched sturdily and every now and then he thrust his left hand into the pie and drew it forth full of meat anon he would take a mighty pull at a great bottle of malmsey that lay beside him  by my faith quoth robin to himself i do verily believe that this is the merriest feast the merriest wight the merriest place and the merriest sight in all merry england methought there was another here but it must have been this holy man talking to himself  so robin lay watching the friar and the friar all unknowing that he was so overlooked ate his meal placidly at last he was done and having first wiped his greasy hands upon the ferns and wild thyme and sweeter napkin neer had king in all the world he took up his flask and began talking to himself as though he were another man and answering himself as though he were somebody else  dear lad thou art the sweetest fellow in all the world i do love thee as a lover loveth his lass la thou dost make me shamed to speak so to me in this solitary place no one being by and yet if thou wilt have me say so i do love thee as thou lovest me nay then wilt thou not take a drink of good malmsey after thee lad after thee nay i beseech thee sweeten the draught with thy lips here he passed the flask from his right hand to his left an thou wilt force it on me so i must needs do thy bidding yet with the more pleasure do i so as i drink thy very great health here he took a long deep draught and now sweet lad tis thy turn next here he passed the bottle from his left hand back again to his right i take it sweet chuck and heres wishing thee as much good as thou wishest me saying this he took another draught and truly he drank enough for two  all this time merry robin lay upon the bank and listened while his stomach so quaked with laughter that he was forced to press his palm across his mouth to keep it from bursting forth for truly he would not have spoiled such a goodly jest for the half of nottinghamshire  having gotten his breath from his last draught the friar began talking again in this wise now sweet lad canst thou not sing me a song la i know not i am but in an ill voice this day prythee ask me not dost thou not hear how i croak like a frog nay nay thy voice is as sweet as any bullfinch come sing i prythee i would rather hear thee sing than eat a fair feast alas i would fain not sing before one that can pipe so well and hath heard so many goodly songs and ballads neertheless an thou wilt have it so i will do my best but now methinks that thou and i might sing some fair song together dost thou not know a certain dainty little catch called the loving youth and the scornful maid why truly methinks i have heard it ere now then dost thou not think that thou couldst take the lasss part if i take the lads i know not but i will try begin thou with the lad and i will follow with the lass  then singing first with a voice deep and gruff and anon in one high and squeaking he blithely trolled the merry catch of   the loving youth and the scornful maid       ah its wilt thou come with me my love      and its wilt thou love be mine      for i will give unto thee my love      gay knots and ribbons so fine      ill woo thee love on my bended knee      and ill pipe sweet songs to none but thee      then its hark hark hark      to the winged lark      and its hark to the cooing dove      and the bright daffodil      groweth down by the rill      so come thou and be my love       she      now get thee away young man so fine      now get thee away i say      for my true love shall never be thine      and so thou hadst better not stay      thou art not a fine enough lad for me      so ill wait till a better young man i see      for its hark hark hark      to the winged lark      and its hark to the cooing dove      and the bright daffodil      groweth down by the rill      yet never ill be thy love       he      then straight will i seek for another fair she      for many a maid can be found      and as thou wilt never have aught of me      by thee will i never be bound      for never is a blossom in the field so rare      but others are found that are just as fair      so its hark hark hark      to the joyous lark      and its hark to the cooing dove      and the bright daffodil      groweth down by the rill      and ill seek me another dear love       she      young man turn not so very quick away      another fair lass to find      methinks i have spoken in haste today      nor have i made up my mind       and if thou only wilt stay with me      ill love no other sweet lad but thee  here robin could contain himself no longer but burst forth into a mighty roar of laughter then the holy friar keeping on with the song he joined in the chorus and together they sang or as one might say bellowed       so its hark hark hark      to the joyous lark      and its hark to the cooing dove      for the bright daffodil      groweth down by the rill      and ill be thine own true love  so they sang together for the stout friar did not seem to have heard robins laughter neither did he seem to know that the yeoman had joined in with the song but with eyes half closed looking straight before him and wagging his round head from side to side in time to the music he kept on bravely to the end he and robin finishing up with a mighty roar that might have been heard a mile but no sooner had the last word been sung than the holy man seized his steel cap clapped it on his head and springing to his feet cried in a great voice what spy have we here come forth thou limb of evil and i will carve thee into as fine pudding meat as eer a wife in yorkshire cooked of a sunday hereupon he drew from beneath his robes a great broadsword full as stout as was robins  nay put up thy pinking iron friend quoth robin standing up with the tears of laughter still on his cheeks folk who have sung so sweetly together should not fight thereafter hereupon he leaped down the bank to where the other stood i tell thee friend said he my throat is as parched with that song as eer a barley stubble in october hast thou haply any malmsey left in that stout pottle  truly said the friar in a glum voice thou dost ask thyself freely where thou art not bidden yet i trust i am too good a christian to refuse any man drink that is athirst such as there is ot thou art welcome to a drink of the same and he held the pottle out to robin  robin took it without more ado and putting it to his lips tilted his head back while that which was within said glug lug glug for more than three winks i wot the stout friar watched robin anxiously the while and when he was done took the pottle quickly he shook it held it betwixt his eyes and the light looked reproachfully at the yeoman and straightway placed it at his own lips when it came away again there was nought within it  doss thou know the country hereabouts thou good and holy man asked robin laughing  yea somewhat answered the other dryly  and dost thou know of a certain spot called fountain abbey  yea somewhat  then perchance thou knowest also of a certain one who goeth by the name of the curtal friar of fountain abbey  yea somewhat  well then good fellow holy father or whatever thou art quoth robin i would know whether this same friar is to be found upon this side of the river or the other  that quoth the friar is a practical question upon which the cunning rules appertaining to logic touch not i do advise thee to find that out by the aid of thine own five senses sight feeling and what not  i do wish much quoth robin looking thoughtfully at the stout priest to cross yon ford and strive to find this same good friar  truly said the other piously it is a goodly wish on the part of one so young far be it from me to check thee in so holy a quest friend the river is free to all  yea good father said robin but thou seest that my clothes are of the finest and i fain would not get them wet methinks thy shoulders are stout and broad couldst thou not find it in thy heart to carry me across  now by the white hand of the holy lady of the fountain burst forth the friar in a mighty rage dost thou thou poor puny stripling thou kissmyladyla poppenjay thouthou what shall i call thee dost thou ask me the holy tuck to carry thee now i swear here he paused suddenly then slowly the anger passed from his face and his little eyes twinkled once more but why should i not quoth he piously  did not the holy saint christopher ever carry the stranger across the river and should i poor sinner that i am be ashamed to do likewise come with me stranger and i will do thy bidding in an humble frame of mind so saying he clambered up the bank closely followed by robin and led the way to the shallow pebbly ford chuckling to himself the while as though he were enjoying some goodly jest within himself  having come to the ford he girded up his robes about his loins tucked his good broadsword beneath his arm and stooped his back to take robin upon it suddenly he straightened up methinks quoth he thoult get thy weapon wet let me tuck it beneath mine arm along with mine own  nay good father said robin i would not burden thee with aught of mine but myself  dost thou think said the friar mildly that the good saint christopher would ha sought his own ease so nay give me thy tool as i bid thee for i would carry it as a penance to my pride  upon this without more ado robin hood unbuckled his sword from his side and handed it to the other who thrust it with his own beneath his arm then once more the friar bent his back and robin having mounted upon it he stepped sturdily into the water and so strode onward splashing in the shoal and breaking all the smooth surface into everwidening rings at last he reached the other side and robin leaped lightly from his back  many thanks good father quoth he thou art indeed a good and holy man prythee give me my sword and let me away for i am in haste  at this the stout friar looked upon robin for a long time his head on one side and with a most waggish twist to his face then he slowly winked his right eye nay good youth said he gently i doubt not that thou art in haste with thine affairs yet thou dost think nothing of mine thine are of a carnal nature mine are of a spiritual nature a holy work so to speak moreover mine affairs do lie upon the other side of this stream i see by thy quest of this same holy recluse that thou art a good young man and most reverent to the cloth i did get wet coming hither and am sadly afraid that should i wade the water again i might get certain cricks and pains i the joints that would mar my devotions for many a day to come i know that since i have so humbly done thy bidding thou wilt carry me back again thou seest how saint godrick that holy hermit whose natal day this is hath placed in my hands two swords and in thine never a one therefore be persuaded good youth and carry me back again  robin hood looked up and he looked down biting his nether lip quoth he thou cunning friar thou hast me fair and fast enow let me tell thee that not one of thy cloth hath so hoodwinked me in all my life before i might have known from thy looks that thou wert no such holy man as thou didst pretend to be  nay interrupted the friar i bid thee speak not so scurrilously neither lest thou mayst perchance feel the prick of an inch or so of blue steel  tut tut said robin speak not so friar the loser hath ever the right to use his tongue as he doth list give me my sword i do promise to carry thee back straightway nay i will not lift the weapon against thee  marry come up quoth the friar i fear thee not fellow here is thy skewer and get thyself presently ready for i would hasten back  so robin took his sword again and buckled it at his side then he bent his stout back and took the friar upon it  now i wot robin hood had a heavier load to carry in the friar than the friar had in him moreover he did not know the ford so he went stumbling among the stones now stepping into a deep hole and now nearly tripping over a boulder while the sweat ran down his face in beads from the hardness of his journey and the heaviness of his load meantime the friar kept digging his heels into robins sides and bidding him hasten calling him many ill names the while to all this robin answered never a word but having softly felt around till he found the buckle of the belt that held the friars sword he worked slyly at the fastenings seeking to loosen them thus it came about that by the time he had reached the other bank with his load the friars sword belt was loose albeit he knew it not so when robin stood on dry land and the friar leaped from his back the yeoman gripped hold of the sword so that blade sheath and strap came away from the holy man leaving him without a weapon  now then quoth merry robin panting as he spake and wiping the sweat from his brow i have thee fellow this time that same saint of whom thou didst speak but now hath delivered two swords into my hand and hath stripped thine away from thee now if thou dost not carry me back and that speedily i swear i will prick thy skin till it is as full of holes as a slashed doublet  the good friar said not a word for a while but he looked at robin with a grim look now said he at last i did think that thy wits were of the heavy sort and knew not that thou wert so cunning truly thou hast me upon the hip give me my sword and i promise not to draw it against thee save in selfdefense also i promise to do thy bidding and take thee upon my back and carry thee  so jolly robin gave him his sword again which the friar buckled to his side and this time looked to it that it was more secure in its fastenings then tucking up his robes once more he took robin hood upon his back and without a word stepped into the water and so waded on in silence while robin sat laughing upon his back at last he reached the middle of the ford where the water was deepest here he stopped for a moment and then with a sudden lift of his hand and heave of his shoulders fairly shot robin over his head as though he were a sack of grain  down went robin into the water with a mighty splash there quoth the holy man calmly turning back again to the shore let that cool thy hot spirit if it may  meantime after much splashing robin had gotten to his feet and stood gazing about him all bewildered the water running from him in pretty little rills at last he shot the water out of his ears and spat some out of his mouth and gathering his scattered wits together saw the stout friar standing on the bank and laughing then i wot was robin hood a mad man stay thou villain roared he i am after thee straight and if i do not carve thy brawn for thee this day may i never lift finger again so saying he dashed splashing to the bank  thou needst not hasten thyself unduly quoth the stout friar fear not i will abide here and if thou dost not cry alackaday ere long time is gone may i never more peep through the brake at a fallow deer  and now robin having reached the bank began without more ado to roll up his sleeves above his wrists the friar also tucked his robes more about him showing a great stout arm on which the muscles stood out like humps of an aged tree then robin saw what he had not wotted of before that the friar had also a coat of chain mail beneath his gown  look to thyself cried robin drawing his good sword  ay marry quoth the friar who held his already in his hand so without more ado they came together and thereupon began a fierce and mighty battle right and left and up and down and back and forth they fought the swords flashed in the sun and then met with a clash that sounded far and near i wot this was no playful bout at quarterstaff but a grim and serious fight of real earnest thus they strove for an hour or more pausing every now and then to rest at which times each looked at the other with wonder and thought that never had he seen so stout a fellow then once again they would go at it more fiercely than ever yet in all this time neither had harmed the other nor caused his blood to flow at last merry robin cried hold thy hand good friend whereupon both lowered their swords  now i crave a boon ere we begin again quoth robin wiping the sweat from his brow for they had striven so long that he began to think that it would be an illdone thing either to be smitten himself or to smite so stout and brave a fellow  what wouldst thou have of me asked the friar  only this quoth robin that thou wilt let me blow thrice upon my bugle horn  the friar bent his brows and looked shrewdly at robin hood now i do verily think that thou hast some cunning trick in this quoth he neertheless i fear thee not and will let thee have thy wish providing thou wilt also let me blow thrice upon this little whistle  with all my heart quoth robin so here goes for one so saying he raised his silver horn to his lips and blew thrice upon it clear and high  meantime the friar stood watching keenly for what might come to pass holding in his fingers the while a pretty silver whistle such as knights use for calling their hawks back to their wrists which whistle always hung at his girdle along with his rosary  scarcely had the echo of the last note of robins bugle come winding back from across the river when four tall men in lincoln green came running around the bend of the road each with a bow in his hand and an arrow ready nocked upon the string  ha is it thus thou traitor knave cried the friar then marry look to thyself so saying he straightway clapped the hawks whistle to his lips and blew a blast that was both loud and shrill and now there came a crackling of the bushes that lined the other side of the road and presently forth from the covert burst four great shaggy hounds at em sweet lips at em bell throat at em beauty at em fangs cried the friar pointing at robin  and now it was well for that yeoman that a tree stood nigh him beside the road else had he had an ill chance of it ere one could say gaffer downthedale the hounds were upon him and he had only time to drop his sword and leap lightly into the tree around which the hounds gathered looking up at him as though he were a cat on the eaves but the friar quickly called off his dogs at em cried he pointing down the road to where the yeomen were standing stock still with wonder of what they saw as the hawk darts down upon its quarry so sped the four dogs at the yeomen but when the four men saw the hounds so coming all with one accord saving only will scarlet drew each man his goose feather to his ear and let fly his shaft  and now the old ballad telleth of a wondrous thing that happened for thus it says that each dog so shot at leaped lightly aside and as the arrow passed him whistling caught it in his mouth and bit it in twain now it would have been an ill day for these four good fellows had not will scarlet stepped before the others and met the hounds as they came rushing why how now fangs cried he sternly down beauty down sirrah what means this  at the sound of his voice each dog shrank back quickly and then straightway came to him and licked his hands and fawned upon him as is the wont of dogs that meet one they know then the four yeomen came forward the hounds leaping around will scarlet joyously why how now cried the stout friar what means this art thou wizard to turn those wolves into lambs ha cried he when they had come still nearer can i trust mine eyes what means it that i see young master william gamwell in such company  nay tuck said the young man as the four came forward to where robin was now clambering down from the tree in which he had been roosting he having seen that all danger was over for the time nay tuck my name is no longer will gamwell but will scarlet and this is my good uncle robin hood with whom i am abiding just now  truly good master said the friar looking somewhat abashed and reaching out his great palm to robin i ha oft heard thy name both sung and spoken of but i never thought to meet thee in battle i crave thy forgiveness and do wonder not that i found so stout a man against me  truly most holy father said little john i am more thankful than eer i was in all my life before that our good friend scarlet knew thee and thy dogs i tell thee seriously that i felt my heart crumble away from me when i saw my shaft so miss its aim and those great beasts of thine coming straight at me  thou mayst indeed be thankful friend said the friar gravely but master will how cometh it that thou dost now abide in sherwood  why tuck dost thou not know of my ill happening with my fathers steward answered scarlet  yea truly yet i knew not that thou wert in hiding because of it marry the times are all awry when a gentleman must lie hidden for so small a thing  but we are losing time quoth robin and i have yet to find that same curtal friar  why uncle thou hast not far to go said will scarlet pointing to the friar for there he stands beside thee  how quoth robin art thou the man that i have been at such pains to seek all day and have got such a ducking for  why truly said the friar demurely some do call me the curtal friar of fountain dale others again call me in jest the abbot of fountain abbey others still again call me simple friar tuck  i like the last name best quoth robin for it doth slip more glibly off the tongue but why didst thou not tell me thou wert he i sought instead of sending me searching for black moonbeams  why truly thou didst not ask me good master quoth stout tuck but what didst thou desire of me  nay quoth robin the day groweth late and we cannot stand longer talking here come back with us to sherwood and i will unfold all to thee as we travel along  so without tarrying longer they all departed with the stout dogs at their heels and wended their way back to sherwood again but it was long past nightfall ere they reached the greenwood tree  now listen for next i will tell how robin hood compassed the happiness of two young lovers aided by the merry friar tuck of fountain dale     robin hood compasses a marriage  and now had come the morning when fair ellen was to be married and on which merry robin had sworn that allan a dale should as it were eat out of the platter that had been filled for sir stephen of trent up rose robin hood blithe and gay up rose his merry men one and all and up rose last of all stout friar tuck winking the smart of sleep from out his eyes then while the air seemed to brim over with the song of many birds all blended together and all joying in the misty morn each man raved face and hands in the leaping brook and so the day began  now quoth robin when they had broken their fast and each man had eaten his fill it is time for us to set forth upon the undertaking that we have in hand for today i will choose me one score of my good men to go with me for i may need aid and thou will scarlet wilt abide here and be the chief while i am gone then searching through all the band each man of whom crowded forward eager to be chosen robin called such as he wished by name until he had a score of stout fellows the very flower of his yeomanrie besides little john and will stutely were nigh all those famous lads of whom i have already told you then while those so chosen ran leaping full of joy to arm themselves with bow and shaft and broadsword robin hood stepped aside into the covert and there donned a gay beribboned coat such as might have been worn by some strolling minstrel and slung a harp across his shoulder the better to carry out that part  all the band stared and many laughed for never had they seen their master in such a fantastic guise before  truly quoth robin holding up his arms and looking down at himself i do think it be somewhat of a gay gaudy grasshopper dress but it is a pretty thing for all that and doth not ill befit the turn of my looks albeit i wear it but for the nonce but stay little john here are two bags that i would have thee carry in thy pouch for the sake of safekeeping i can ill care for them myself beneath this motley  why master quoth little john taking the bags and weighing them in his hand here is the chink of gold  well what an there be said robin it is mine own coin and the band is none the worse for what is there come busk ye lads and he turned quickly away get ye ready straightway then gathering the score together in a close rank in the midst of which were allan a dale and friar tuck he led them forth upon their way from the forest shades  so they walked on for a long time till they had come out of sherwood and to the vale of rotherstream here were different sights from what one saw in the forest hedgerows broad fields of barley corn pasture lands rolling upward till they met the sky and all dotted over with flocks of white sheep hayfields whence came the odor of newmown hay that lay in smooth swathes over which skimmed the swifts in rapid flight such they saw and different was it i wot from the tangled depths of the sweet woodlands but full as fair thus robin led his band walking blithely with chest thrown out and head thrown back snuffing the odors of the gentle breeze that came drifting from over the hayfields  truly quoth he the dear world is as fair here as in the woodland shades who calls it a vale of tears methinks it is but the darkness in our minds that bringeth gloom to the world for what sayeth that merry song thou singest little john is it not thus       for when my loves eyes do thine do thine      and when her lips smile so rare      the day it is jocund and fine so fine      though let it be wet or be fair      and when the stout ale is all flowing so fast      our sorrows and troubles are things of the past  nay said friar tuck piously ye do think of profane things and of nought else yet truly there be better safeguards against care and woe than ale drinking and bright eyes to wit fasting and meditation look upon me have i the likeness of a sorrowful man  at this a great shout of laughter went up from all around for the night before the stout friar had emptied twice as many canakins of ale as any one of all the merry men  truly quoth robin when he could speak for laughter i should say that thy sorrows were about equal to thy goodliness  so they stepped along talking singing jesting and laughing until they had come to a certain little church that belonged to the great estates owned by the rich priory of emmet here it was that fair ellen was to be married on that morn and here was the spot toward which the yeomen had pointed their toes on the other side of the road from where the church stood with waving fields of barley around ran a stone wall along the roadside over the wall from the highway was a fringe of young trees and bushes and here and there the wall itself was covered by a mass of blossoming woodbine that filled all the warm air far and near with its sweet summer odor then straightway the yeomen leaped over the wall alighting on the tall soft grass upon the other side frightening a flock of sheep that lay there in the shade so that they scampered away in all directions here was a sweet cool shadow both from the wall and from the fair young trees and bushes and here sat the yeomen down and glad enough they were to rest after their long tramp of the morning  now quoth robin i would have one of you watch and tell me when he sees anyone coming to the church and the one i choose shall be young david of doncaster so get thee upon the wall david and hide beneath the woodbine so as to keep watch  accordingly young david did as he was bidden the others stretching themselves at length upon the grass some talking together and others sleeping then all was quiet save only for the low voices of those that talked together and for allans restless footsteps pacing up and down for his soul was so full of disturbance that he could not stand still and saving also for the mellow snoring of friar tuck who enjoyed his sleep with a noise as of one sawing soft wood very slowly robin lay upon his back and gazed aloft into the leaves of the trees his thought leagues away and so a long time passed  then up spoke robin now tell us young david of doncaster what dost thou see  then david answered i see the white clouds floating and i feel the wind ablowing and three black crows are flying over the wold but nought else do i see good master  so silence fell again and another time passed broken only as i have said till robin growing impatient spake again now tell me young david what dost thou see by this  and david answered i see the windmills swinging and three tall poplar trees swaying against the sky and a flock of fieldfares are flying over the hill but nought else do i see good master  so another time passed till at last robin asked young david once more what he saw and david said i hear the cuckoo singing and i see how the wind makes waves in the barley field and now over the hill to the church cometh an old friar and in his hands he carries a great bunch of keys and lo now he cometh to the church door  then up rose robin hood and shook friar tuck by the shoulder come rouse thee holy man cried he whereupon with much grunting the stout tuck got to his feet marry bestir thyself quoth robin for yonder in the church door is one of thy cloth go thou and talk to him and so get thyself into the church that thou mayst be there when thou art wanted meantime little john will stutely and i will follow thee anon  so friar tuck clambered over the wall crossed the road and came to the church where the old friar was still laboring with the great key the lock being somewhat rusty and he somewhat old and feeble  hilloa brother quoth tuck let me aid thee so saying he took the key from the others hand and quickly opened the door with a turn of it  who art thou good brother asked the old friar in a high wheezing voice whence comest thou and whither art thou going and he winked and blinked at stout friar tuck like an owl at the sun  thus do i answer thy questions brother said the other my name is tuck and i go no farther than this spot if thou wilt haply but let me stay while this same wedding is going forward i come from fountain dale and in truth am a certain poor hermit as one may say for i live in a cell beside the fountain blessed by that holy saint ethelrada but if i understand aught there is to be a gay wedding here today so if thou mindest not i would fain rest me in the cool shade within for i would like to see this fine sight  truly thou art welcome brother said the old man leading the way within meantime robin hood in his guise of harper together with little john and will stutely had come to the church robin sat him down on a bench beside the door but little john carrying the two bags of gold went within as did will stutely  so robin sat by the door looking up the road and down the road to see who might come till after a time he saw six horsemen come riding sedately and slowly as became them for they were churchmen in high orders then when they had come nearer robin saw who they were and knew them the first was the bishop of hereford and a fine figure he cut i wot his vestments were of the richest silk and around his neck was a fair chain of beaten gold the cap that hid his tonsure was of black velvet and around the edges of it were rows of jewels that flashed in the sunlight each stone being set in gold his hose were of flamecolored silk and his shoes of black velvet the long pointed toes being turned up and fastened to his knees and on either instep was embroidered a cross in gold thread beside the bishop rode the prior of emmet upon a mincing palfrey rich were his clothes also but not so gay as the stout bishops behind these were two of the higher brethren of emmet and behind these again two retainers belonging to the bishop for the lord bishop of hereford strove to be as like the great barons as was in the power of one in holy orders  when robin saw this train drawing near with flash of jewels and silk and jingle of silver bells on the trappings of the nags he looked sourly upon them quoth he to himself yon bishop is overgaudy for a holy man i do wonder whether his patron who methinks was saint thomas was given to wearing golden chains about his neck silk clothing upon his body and pointed shoes upon his feet the money for all of which god wot hath been wrung from the sweat of poor tenants bishop bishop thy pride may have a fall ere thou wottest of it  so the holy men came to the church the bishop and the prior jesting and laughing between themselves about certain fair dames their words more befitting the lips of laymen methinks than holy clerks then they dismounted and the bishop looking around presently caught sight of robin standing in the doorway hilloa good fellow quoth he in a jovial voice who art thou that struttest in such gay feathers  a harper am i from the north country quoth robin and i can touch the strings i wot as never another man in all merry england can do truly good lord bishop many a knight and burgher clerk and layman have danced to my music willynilly and most times greatly against their will such is the magic of my harping now this day my lord bishop if i may play at this wedding i do promise that i will cause the fair bride to love the man she marries with a love that shall last as long as that twain shall live together  ha is it so cried the bishop meanest thou this in sooth and he looked keenly at robin who gazed boldly back again into his eyes now if thou wilt cause this maiden who hath verily bewitched my poor cousin stephen thus to love the man she is to marry as thou sayst thou canst i will give thee whatsoever thou wilt ask me in due measure let me have a taste of thy skill fellow  nay quoth robin my music cometh not without i choose even at a lord bishops bidding in sooth i will not play until the bride and bridegroom come  now thou art a saucy varlet to speak so to my crest quoth the bishop frowning on robin yet i must needs bear with thee look prior hither cometh our cousin sir stephen and his ladylove  and now around the bend of the highroad came others riding upon horses the first of all was a tall thin man of knightly bearing dressed all in black silk with a black velvet cap upon his head turned up with scarlet robin looked and had no doubt that this was sir stephen both because of his knightly carriage and of his gray hairs beside him rode a stout saxon franklin ellens father edward of deirwold behind those two came a litter borne by two horses and therein was a maiden whom robin knew must be ellen behind this litter rode six menatarms the sunlight flashing on their steel caps as they came jingling up the dusty road  so these also came to the church and there sir stephen leaped from his horse and coming to the litter handed fair ellen out therefrom then robin hood looked at her and could wonder no longer how it came about that so proud a knight as sir stephen of trent wished to marry a common franklins daughter nor did he wonder that no ado was made about the matter for she was the fairest maiden that ever he had beheld now however she was all pale and drooping like a fair white lily snapped at the stem and so with bent head and sorrowful look she went within the church sir stephen leading her by the hand  why dost thou not play fellow quoth the bishop looking sternly at robin  marry said robin calmly i will play in greater wise than your lordship thinks but not till the right time hath come  said the bishop to himself while he looked grimly at robin when this wedding is gone by i will have this fellow well whipped for his saucy tongue and bold speech  and now fair ellen and sir stephen stood before the altar and the bishop himself came in his robes and opened his book whereat fair ellen looked up and about her in bitter despair like the fawn that finds the hounds on her haunch then in all his fluttering tags and ribbons of red and yellow robin hood strode forward three steps he took from the pillar whereby he leaned and stood between the bride and bridegroom  let me look upon this lass he said in a loud voice why how now what have we here here be lilies in the cheeks and not roses such as befit a bonny bride this is no fit wedding thou sir knight so old and she so young and thou thinkest to make her thy wife i tell thee it may not be for thou art not her own true love  at this all stood amazed and knew not where to look nor what to think or say for they were all bewildered with the happening so while everyone looked at robin as though they had been changed to stone he clapped his bugle horn to his lips and blew three blasts so loud and clear they echoed from floor to rafter as though they were sounded by the trump of doom then straightway little john and will stutely came leaping and stood upon either side of robin hood and quickly drew their broadswords the while a mighty voice rolled over the heads of all here be i good master when thou wantest me for it was friar tuck that so called from the organ loft  and now all was hubbub and noise stout edward strode forward raging and would have seized his daughter to drag her away but little john stepped between and thrust him back stand back old man said he thou art a hobbled horse this day  down with the villains cried sir stephen and felt for his sword but it hung not beside him on his wedding day  then the menatarms drew their swords and it seemed like that blood would wet the stones but suddenly came a bustle at the door and loud voices steel flashed in the light and the crash of blows sounded the menatarms fell back and up the aisle came leaping eighteen stout yeomen all clad in lincoln green with allan a dale at their head in his hand he bore robin hoods good stout trusty bow of yew and this he gave to him kneeling the while upon one knee  then up spake edward of deirwold in a deep voice of anger is it thou allan a dale that hath bred all this coil in a church  nay quoth merry robin that have i done and i care not who knoweth it for my name is robin hood  at this name a sudden silence fell the prior of emmet and those that belonged to him gathered together like a flock of frightened sheep when the scent of the wolf is nigh while the bishop of hereford laying aside his book crossed himself devoutly now heaven keep us this day said he from that evil man  nay quoth robin i mean you no harm but here is fair ellens betrothed husband and she shall marry him or pain will be bred to some of you  then up spake stout edward in a loud and angry voice now i say nay i am her father and she shall marry sir stephen and none other  now all this time while everything was in turmoil about him sir stephen had been standing in proud and scornful silence nay fellow said he coldly thou mayst take thy daughter back again i would not marry her after this days doings could i gain all merry england thereby i tell thee plainly i loved thy daughter old as i am and would have taken her up like a jewel from the sty yet truly i knew not that she did love this fellow and was beloved by him maiden if thou dost rather choose a beggarly minstrel than a highborn knight take thy choice i do feel it shame that i should thus stand talking amid this herd and so i will leave you thus saying he turned and gathering his men about him walked proudly down the aisle then all the yeomen were silenced by the scorn of his words only friar tuck leaned over the edge of the choir loft and called out to him ere he had gone good den sir knight thou wottest old bones must alway make room for young blood sir stephen neither answered nor looked up but passed out from the church as though he had heard nought his men following him  then the bishop of hereford spoke hastily i too have no business here and so will depart and he made as though he would go but robin hood laid hold of his clothes and held him stay my lord bishop said he i have yet somewhat to say to thee the bishops face fell but he stayed as robin bade him for he saw he could not go  then robin hood turned to stout edward of deirwold and said he give thy blessing on thy daughters marriage to this yeoman and all will be well little john give me the bags of gold look farmer here are two hundred bright golden angels give thy blessing as i say and i will count them out to thee as thy daughters dower give not thy blessing and she shall be married all the same but not so much as a cracked farthing shall cross thy palm choose  then edward looked upon the ground with bent brows turning the matter over and over in his mind but he was a shrewd man and one withal that made the best use of a cracked pipkin so at last he looked up and said but in no joyous tone if the wench will go her own gait let her go i had thought to make a lady of her yet if she chooses to be what she is like to be i have nought to do with her henceforth neertheless i will give her my blessing when she is duly wedded  it may not be spake up one of those of emmet the banns have not been duly published neither is there any priest here to marry them  how sayst thou roared tuck from the choir loft no priest marry here stands as holy a man as thou art any day of the week a clerk in orders i would have thee know as for the question of banns stumble not over that straw brother for i will publish them so saying he called the banns and says the old ballad lest three times should not be enough he published them nine times oer then straightway he came down from the loft and forthwith performed the marriage service and so allan and ellen were duly wedded  and now robin counted out two hundred golden angels to edward of deirwold and he upon his part gave his blessing yet not i wot as though he meant it with overmuch good will then the stout yeomen crowded around and grasped allans palm and he holding ellens hand within his own looked about him all dizzy with his happiness  then at last jolly robin turned to the bishop of hereford who had been looking on at all that passed with a grim look my lord bishop quoth he thou mayst bring to thy mind that thou didst promise me that did i play in such wise as to cause this fair lass to love her husband thou wouldst give me whatsoever i asked in reason i have played my play and she loveth her husband which she would not have done but for me so now fulfill thy promise thou hast upon thee that which methinks thou wouldst be the better without therefore i prythee give me that golden chain that hangeth about thy neck as a wedding present for this fair bride  then the bishops cheeks grew red with rage and his eyes flashed he looked at robin with a fell look but saw that in the yeomans face which bade him pause then slowly he took the chain from about his neck and handed it to robin who flung it over ellens head so that it hung glittering about her shoulders then said merry robin i thank thee on the brides part for thy handsome gift and truly thou thyself art more seemly without it now shouldst thou ever come nigh to sherwood i much hope that i shall give thee there such a feast as thou hast neer had in all thy life before  may heaven forfend cried the bishop earnestly for he knew right well what manner of feast it was that robin hood gave his guests in sherwood forest  but now robin hood gathered his men together and with allan and his young bride in their midst they all turned their footsteps toward the woodlands on the way thither friar tuck came close to robin and plucked him by the sleeve thou dost lead a merry life good master quoth he but dost thou not think that it would be for the welfare of all your souls to have a good stout chaplain such as i to oversee holy matters truly i do love this life mightily at this merry robin hood laughed amain and bade him stay and become one of their band if he wished  that night there was such a feast held in the greenwood as nottinghamshire never saw before to that feast you and i were not bidden and pity it is that we were not so lest we should both feel the matter the more keenly i will say no more about it     robin hood aids a sorrowful knight  so passed the gentle springtime away in budding beauty its silver showers and sunshine its green meadows and its flowers so likewise passed the summer with its yellow sunlight its quivering heat and deep bosky foliage its long twilights and its mellow nights through which the frogs croaked and fairy folk were said to be out on the hillsides all this had passed and the time of fall had come bringing with it its own pleasures and joyousness for now when the harvest was gathered home merry bands of gleaners roamed the country about singing along the roads in the daytime and sleeping beneath the hedgerows and the hayricks at night now the hips burned red in the tangled thickets and the hews waxed black in the hedgerows the stubble lay all crisp and naked to the sky and the green leaves were fast turning russet and brown also at this merry season good things of the year are gathered in in great store brown ale lies ripening in the cellar hams and bacon hang in the smokeshed and crabs are stowed away in the straw for roasting in the wintertime when the north wind piles the snow in drifts around the gables and the fire crackles warm upon the hearth  so passed the seasons then so they pass now and so they will pass in time to come while we come and go like leaves of the tree that fall and are soon forgotten   quoth robin hood snuffing the air here is a fair day little john and one that we can ill waste in idleness choose such men as thou dost need and go thou east while i will wend to the west and see that each of us bringeth back some goodly guest to dine this day beneath the greenwood tree  marry cried little john clapping his palms together for joy thy bidding fitteth my liking like heft to blade ill bring thee back a guest this day or come not back mine own self  then they each chose such of the band as they wished and so went forth by different paths from the forest  now you and i cannot go two ways at the same time while we join in these merry doings so we will een let little john follow his own path while we tuck up our skirts and trudge after robin hood and here is good company too robin hood will scarlet allan a dale will scathelock midge the millers son and others a score or more of stout fellows had abided in the forest with friar tuck to make ready for the homecoming but all the rest were gone either with robin hood or little john  they traveled onward robin following his fancy and the others following robin now they wended their way through an open dale with cottage and farm lying therein and now again they entered woodlands once more passing by fair mansfield town with its towers and battlements and spires all smiling in the sun they came at last out of the forest lands onward they journeyed through highway and byway through villages where goodwives and merry lasses peeped through the casements at the fine show of young men until at last they came over beyond alverton in derbyshire by this time high noontide had come yet they had met no guest such as was worth their while to take back to sherwood so coming at last to a certain spot where a shrine stood at the crossing of two roads robin called upon them to stop for here on either side was shelter of high hedgerows behind which was good hiding whence they could watch the roads at their ease while they ate their midday meal quoth merry robin here methinks is good lodging where peaceful folk such as we be can eat in quietness therefore we will rest here and see what may perchance fall into our luckpot so they crossed a stile and came behind a hedgerow where the mellow sunlight was bright and warm and where the grass was soft and there sat them down then each man drew from the pouch that hung beside him that which he had brought to eat for a merry walk such as this had been sharpens the appetite till it is as keen as a march wind so no more words were spoken but each man saved his teeth for better usemunching at brown crust and cold meat right lustily  in front of them one of the highroads crawled up the steep hill and then dipped suddenly over its crest sharpcut with hedgerow and shaggy grass against the sky over the top of the windy hill peeped the eaves of a few houses of the village that fell back into the valley behind there also showed the top of a windmill the sails slowly rising and dipping from behind the hill against the clear blue sky as the light wind moved them with creaking and labored swing  so the yeomen lay behind the hedge and finished their midday meal but still the time slipped along and no one came at last a man came slowly riding over the hill and down the stony road toward the spot where robin and his band lay hidden he was a good stout knight but sorrowful of face and downcast of mien his clothes were plain and rich but no chain of gold such as folk of his stand in life wore at most times hung around his neck and no jewel was about him yet no one could mistake him for aught but one of proud and noble blood his head was bowed upon his breast and his hands drooped limp on either side and so he came slowly riding as though sunk in sad thoughts while even his good horse the reins loose upon his neck walked with hanging head as though he shared his masters grief  quoth robin hood yon is verily a sorrylooking gallant and doth seem to have donned illcontent with his jerkin this morning nevertheless i will out and talk with him for there may be some pickings here for a hungry daw methinks his dress is rich though he himself is so downcast bide ye here till i look into this matter so saying he arose and left them crossed the road to the shrine and there stood waiting for the sorrowful knight to come near him so presently when the knight came riding slowly along jolly robin stepped forward and laid his hand upon the bridle rein hold sir knight quoth he i prythee tarry for a short time for i have a few words to say to thee  what art thou friend who dost stop a traveler in this manner upon his most gracious majestys highway said the knight  marry quoth robin that is a question hard to answer one man calleth me kind another calleth me cruel this one calleth me good honest fellow and that one vile thief truly the world hath as many eyes to look upon a man withal as there are spots on a toad so with what pair of eyes thou regardest me lieth entirely with thine own self my name is robin hood  truly good robin said the knight a smile twitching at the corners of his mouth thou hast a quaint conceit as for the pair of eyes with which i regard thee i would say that they are as favorable as may be for i hear much good of thee and little ill what is thy will of me  now i make my vow sir knight quoth robin thou hast surely learned thy wisdom of good gaffer swanthold for he sayeth fair words are as easy spoke as foul and bring good will in the stead of blows now i will show thee the truth of this saying for if thou wilt go with me this day to sherwood forest i will give thee as merry a feast as ever thou hadst in all thy life  thou art indeed kind said the knight but methinks thou wilt find me but an illseeming and sorrowful guest thou hadst best let me pass on my way in peace  nay quoth robin thou mightst go thine own way but for one thing and that i will tell thee we keep an inn as it were in the very depths of sherwood but so far from highroads and beaten paths that guests do not often come nigh us so i and my friends set off merrily and seek them when we grow dull of ourselves thus the matter stands sir knight yet i will furthermore tell thee that we count upon our guests paying a reckoning  i take thy meaning friend said the knight gravely but i am not thy man for i have no money by me  is it sooth said robin looking at the knight keenly i can scarce choose but believe thee yet sir knight there be those of thy order whose word is not to be trusted as much as they would have others believe thou wilt think no ill if i look for myself in this matter then still holding the horse by the bridle rein he put his fingers to his lips and blew a shrill whistle whereupon fourscore yeomen came leaping over the stile and ran to where the knight and robin stood these said robin looking upon them proudly are some of my merry men they share and share alike with me all joys and troubles gains and losses sir knight i prythee tell me what money thou hast about thee  for a time the knight said not a word but a slow red arose into his cheeks at last he looked robin in the face and said i know not why i should be ashamed for it should be no shame to me but friend i tell thee the truth when i say that in my purse are ten shillings and that that is every groat that sir richard of the lea hath in all the wide world  when sir richard ended a silence fell until at last robin said and dost thou pledge me thy knightly word that this is all thou hast with thee  yea answered sir richard i do pledge thee my most solemn word as a true knight that it is all the money i have in the world nay here is my purse ye may find for yourselves the truth of what i say and he held his purse out to robin  put up thy purse sir richard quoth robin far be it from me to doubt the word of so gentle a knight the proud i strive to bring low but those that walk in sorrow i would aid if i could come sir richard cheer up thy heart and go with us into the greenwood even i may perchance aid thee for thou surely knowest how the good athelstane was saved by the little blind mole that digged a trench over which he that sought the kings life stumbled  truly friend said sir richard methinks thou meanest kindness in thine own way nevertheless my troubles are such that it is not likely that thou canst cure them but i will go with thee this day into sherwood hereupon he turned his horses head and they all wended their way to the woodlands robin walking on one side of the knight and will scarlet on the other while the rest of the band trudged behind  after they had traveled thus for a time robin hood spake sir knight said he i would not trouble thee with idle questions but dost thou find it in thy heart to tell me thy sorrows  truly robin quoth the knight i see no reason why i should not do so thus it is my castle and my lands are in pawn for a debt that i owe three days hence the money must be paid or else all mine estate is lost forever for then it falls into the hands of the priory of emmet and what they swallow they never give forth again  quoth robin i understand not why those of thy kind live in such a manner that all their wealth passeth from them like snow beneath the springtide sun  thou wrongest me robin said the knight for listen i have a son but twenty winters old nevertheless he has won his spurs as knight last year on a certain evil day the jousts were held at chester and thither my son went as did i and my lady wife i wot it was a proud time for us for he unhorsed each knight that he tilted against at last he ran a course with a certain great knight sir walter of lancaster yet though my son was so youthful he kept his seat albeit both spears were shivered to the heft but it happened that a splinter of my boys lance ran through the visor of sir walters helmet and pierced through his eye into his brain so that he died ere his esquire could unlace his helm now robin sir walter had great friends at court therefore his kinsmen stirred up things against my son so that to save him from prison i had to pay a ransom of six hundred pounds in gold all might have gone well even yet only that by ins and outs and crookedness of laws i was shorn like a sheep that is clipped to the quick so it came that i had to pawn my lands to the priory of emmet for more money and a hard bargain they drove with me in my hour of need yet i would have thee understand i grieve so for my lands only because of my dear lady wife  but where is thy son now asked robin who had listened closely to all the knight had said  in palestine said sir richard battling like a brave christian soldier for the cross and the holy sepulcher truly england was an ill place for him because of sir walters death and the hate of the lancastrians kinsmen  truly said robin much moved thine is a hard lot but tell me what is owing to emmet for thine estates  only four hundred pounds said sir richard  at this robin smote his thigh in anger o the bloodsuckers cried he a noble estate to be forfeit for four hundred pounds but what will befall thee if thou dost lose thy lands sir richard  it is not mine own lot that doth trouble me in that case said the knight but my dear ladys for should i lose my land she will have to betake herself to some kinsman and there abide in charity which methinks would break her proud heart as for me i will over the salt sea and so to palestine to join my son in fight for the holy sepulcher  then up spake will scarlet but hast thou no friend that will help thee in thy dire need  never a man said sir richard while i was rich enow at home and had friends they blew great boasts of how they loved me but when the oak falls in the forest the swine run from beneath it lest they should be smitten down also so my friends have left me for not only am i poor but i have great enemies  then robin said thou sayst thou hast no friends sir richard i make no boast but many have found robin hood a friend in their troubles cheer up sir knight i may help thee yet  the knight shook his head with a faint smile but for all that robins words made him more blithe of heart for in truth hope be it never so faint bringeth a gleam into darkness like a little rushlight that costeth but a groat  the day was wellnigh gone when they came near to the greenwood tree even at a distance they saw by the number of men that little john had come back with some guest but when they came near enough whom should they find but the lord bishop of hereford the good bishop was in a fine stew i wot up and down he walked beneath the tree like a fox caught in a hencoop behind him were three black friars standing close together in a frightened group like three black sheep in a tempest hitched to the branches of the trees close at hand were six horses one of them a barb with gay trappings upon which the bishop was wont to ride and the others laden with packs of divers shapes and kinds one of which made robins eyes glisten for it was a box not overlarge but heavily bound with bands and ribs of iron  when the bishop saw robin and those with him come into the open he made as though he would have run toward the yeoman but the fellow that guarded the bishop and the three friars thrust his quarterstaff in front so that his lordship was fain to stand back though with frowning brow and angry speech  stay my lord bishop cried jolly robin in a loud voice when he saw what had passed i will come to thee with all speed for i would rather see thee than any man in merry england so saying he quickened his steps and soon came to where the bishop stood fuming  how now quoth the bishop in a loud and angry voice when robin had so come to him is this the way that thou and thy band treat one so high in the church as i am i and these brethren were passing peacefully along the highroad with our pack horses and a half score of men to guard them when up comes a great strapping fellow full seven feet high with fourscore or more men back of him and calls upon me to stopme the lord bishop of hereford mark thou whereupon my armed guardsbeshrew them for cowardsstraight ran away but look ye not only did this fellow stop me but he threatened me saying that robin hood would strip me as bare as a winter hedge then besides all this he called me such vile names as fat priest maneating bishop moneygorging usurer and what not as though i were no more than a strolling beggar or tinker  at this the bishop glared like an angry cat while even sir richard laughed only robin kept a grave face alas my lord said he that thou hast been so illtreated by my band i tell thee truly that we greatly reverence thy cloth little john stand forth straightway  at these words little john came forward twisting his face into a whimsical look as though he would say ha mercy upon me good master then robin turned to the bishop of hereford and said was this the man who spake so boldly to your lordship  ay truly it was the same said the bishop a naughty fellow i wot  and didst thou little john said robin in a sad voice call his lordship a fat priest  ay said little john sorrowfully  and a maneating bishop  ay said little john more sorrowfully than before  and a moneygorging usurer  ay said little john in so sorrowful a voice that it might have drawn tears from the dragon of wentley  alas that these things should be said jolly robin turning to the bishop for i have ever found little john a truthful man  at this a roar of laughter went up whereat the blood rushed into the bishops face till it was cherry red from crown to chin but he said nothing and only swallowed his words though they wellnigh choked him  nay my lord bishop said robin we are rough fellows but i trust not such ill men as thou thinkest after all there is not a man here that would harm a hair of thy reverences head i know thou art galled by our jesting but we are all equal here in the greenwood for there are no bishops nor barons nor earls among us but only men so thou must share our life with us while thou dost abide here come busk ye my merry men and get the feast ready meantime we will show our guests our woodland sports  so while some went to kindle the fires for roasting meats others ran leaping to get their cudgels and longbows then robin brought forward sir richard of the lea my lord bishop said he here is another guest that we have with us this day i wish that thou mightest know him better for i and all my men will strive to honor you both at this merrymaking  sir richard said the bishop in a reproachful tone methinks thou and i are companions and fellow sufferers in this den of he was about to say thieves but he stopped suddenly and looked askance at robin hood  speak out bishop quoth robin laughing we of sherwood check not an easy flow of words den of thieves thou west about to say  quoth the bishop mayhap that was what i meant to say sir richard but this i will say that i saw thee just now laugh at the scurrilous jests of these fellows it would have been more becoming of thee methinks to have checked them with frowns instead of spurring them on by laughter  i meant no harm to thee said sir richard but a merry jest is a merry jest and i may truly say i would have laughed at it had it been against mine own self  but now robin hood called upon certain ones of his band who spread soft moss upon the ground and laid deerskins thereon then robin bade his guests be seated and so they all three sat down some of the chief men such as little john will scarlet allan a dale and others stretching themselves upon the ground near by then a garland was set up at the far end of the glade and thereat the bowmen shot and such shooting was done that day as it would have made ones heart leap to see and all the while robin talked so quaintly to the bishop and the knight that the one forgetting his vexation and the other his troubles they both laughed aloud again and again  then allan a dale came forth and tuned his harp and all was hushed around and he sang in his wondrous voice songs of love of war of glory and of sadness and all listened without a movement or a sound so allan sang till the great round silver moon gleamed with its clear white light amid the upper tangle of the mazy branches of the trees at last two fellows came to say that the feast was ready spread so robin leading his guests with either hand brought them to where great smoking dishes that sent savory smells far and near stood along the white linen cloth spread on the grass all around was a glare of torches that lit everything up with a red light then straightway sitting down all fell to with noise and hubbub the rattling of platters blending with the sound of loud talking and laughter a long time the feast lasted but at last all was over and the bright wine and humming ale passed briskly then robin hood called aloud for silence and all was hushed till he spoke  i have a story to tell you all so listen to what i have to say quoth he whereupon without more ado he told them all about sir richard and how his lands were in pawn but as he went on the bishops face that had erst been smiling and ruddy with merriment waxed serious and he put aside the horn of wine he held in his hand for he knew the story of sir richard and his heart sank within him with grim forebodings then when robin hood had done he turned to the bishop of hereford now my lord bishop said he dost thou not think this is ill done of anyone much more of a churchman who should live in humbleness and charity  to this the bishop answered not a word but looked upon the ground with moody eyes  quoth robin now thou art the richest bishop in all england canst thou not help this needy brother but still the bishop answered not a word  then robin turned to little john and quoth he go thou and will stutely and bring forth those five pack horses yonder whereupon the two yeomen did as they were bidden those about the cloth making room on the green where the light was brightest for the five horses which little john and will stutely presently led forward  who hath the score of the goods asked robin hood looking at the black friars  then up spake the smallest of all in a trembling voicean old man he was with a gentle wrinkled face that have i but i pray thee harm me not  nay quoth robin i have never harmed harmless man yet but give it to me good father so the old man did as he was bidden and handed robin the tablet on which was marked down the account of the various packages upon the horses this robin handed to will scarlet bidding him to read the same so will scarlet lifting his voice that all might hear began  three bales of silk to quentin the mercer at ancaster  that we touch not quoth robin for this quentin is an honest fellow who hath risen by his own thrift so the bales of silk were laid aside unopened  one bale of silk velvet for the abbey of beaumont  what do these priests want of silk velvet quoth robin nevertheless though they need it not i will not take all from them measure it off into three lots one to be sold for charity one for us and one for the abbey so this too was done as robin hood bade  twoscore of great wax candles for the chapel of saint thomas  that belongeth fairly to the chapel quoth robin so lay it to one side far be it from us to take from the blessed saint thomas that which belongeth to him so this also was done according to robins bidding and the candles were laid to one side along with honest quentins unopened bales of silk so the list was gone through with and the goods adjudged according to what robin thought most fit some things were laid aside untouched and many were opened and divided into three equal parts for charity for themselves and for the owners and now all the ground in the torchlight was covered over with silks and velvets and cloths of gold and cases of rich wines and so they came to the last line upon the tableta box belonging to the lord bishop of hereford  at these words the bishop shook as with a chill and the box was set upon the ground  my lord bishop hast thou the key of this box asked robin  the bishop shook his head  go will scarlet said robin thou art the strongest man herebring a sword straightway and cut this box open if thou canst then up rose will scarlet and left them coming back in a short time bearing a great twohanded sword thrice he smote that strong ironbound box and at the third blow it burst open and a great heap of gold came rolling forth gleaming red in the light of the torches at this sight a murmur went all around among the band like the sound of the wind in distant trees but no man came forward nor touched the money  quoth robin thou will scarlet thou allan a dale and thou little john count it over  a long time it took to count all the money and when it had been duly scored up will scarlet called out that there were fifteen hundred golden pounds in all but in among the gold they found a paper and this will scarlet read in a loud voice and all heard that this money was the rental and fines and forfeits from certain estates belonging to the bishopric of hereford  my lord bishop said robin hood i will not strip thee as little john said like a winter hedge for thou shalt take back one third of thy money one third of it thou canst well spare to us for thy entertainment and that of thy train for thou art very rich one third of it thou canst better spare for charity for bishop i hear that thou art a hard master to those beneath thee and a close hoarder of gains that thou couldst better and with more credit to thyself give to charity than spend upon thy own likings  at this the bishop looked up but he could say never a word yet he was thankful to keep some of his wealth  then robin turned to sir richard of the lea and quoth he now sir richard the church seemed like to despoil thee therefore some of the overplus of church gains may well be used in aiding thee thou shalt take that five hundred pounds laid aside for people more in need than the bishop is and shalt pay thy debts to emmet therewith  sir richard looked at robin until something arose in his eyes that made all the lights and the faces blur together at last he said i thank thee friend from my heart for what thou doest for me yet think not ill if i cannot take thy gift freely but this i will do i will take the money and pay my debts and in a year and a day hence will return it safe either to thee or to the lord bishop of hereford for this i pledge my most solemn knightly word i feel free to borrow for i know no man that should be more bound to aid me than one so high in that church that hath driven such a hard bargain truly sir knight quoth robin i do not understand those fine scruples that weigh with those of thy kind but nevertheless it shall all be as thou dost wish but thou hadst best bring the money to me at the end of the year for mayhap i may make better use of it than the bishop thereupon turning to those near him he gave his orders and five hundred pounds were counted out and tied up in a leathern bag for sir richard the rest of the treasure was divided and part taken to the treasurehouse of the band and part put by with the other things for the bishop  then sir richard arose i cannot stay later good friends said he for my lady will wax anxious if i come not home so i crave leave to depart  then robin hood and all his merry men arose and robin said we cannot let thee go hence unattended sir richard  then up spake little john good master let me choose a score of stout fellows from the band and let us arm ourselves in a seemly manner and so serve as retainers to sir richard till he can get others in our stead  thou hast spoken well little john and it shall be done said robin  then up spake will scarlet let us give him a golden chain to hang about his neck such as befits one of his blood and also golden spurs to wear at his heels  then robin hood said thou hast spoken well will scarlet and it shall be done  then up spake will stutely let us give him yon bale of rich velvet and yon roll of cloth of gold to take home to his noble lady wife as a present from robin hood and his merry men all  at this all clapped their hands for joy and robin said thou hast well spoken will stutely and it shall be done  then sir richard of the lea looked all around and strove to speak but could scarcely do so for the feelings that choked him at last he said in a husky trembling voice ye shall all see good friends that sir richard o the lea will ever remember your kindness this day and if ye be at any time in dire need or trouble come to me and my lady and the walls of castle lea shall be battered down ere harm shall befall you i he could say nothing further but turned hastily away  but now little john and nineteen stout fellows whom he had chosen for his band came forth all ready for the journey each man wore upon his breast a coat of linked mail and on his head a cap of steel and at his side a good stout sword a gallant show they made as they stood all in a row then robin came and threw a chain of gold about sir richards neck and will scarlet knelt and buckled the golden spurs upon his heel and now little john led forward sir richards horse and the knight mounted he looked down at robin for a little time then of a sudden stooped and kissed his cheek all the forest glades rang with the shout that went up as the knight and the yeomen marched off through the woodland with glare of torches and gleam of steel and so were gone  then up spake the bishop of hereford in a mournful voice i too must be jogging good fellow for the night waxes late  but robin laid his hand upon the bishops arm and stayed him be not so hasty lord bishop said he three days hence sir richard must pay his debts to emmet until that time thou must be content to abide with me lest thou breed trouble for the knight i promise thee that thou shalt have great sport for i know that thou art fond of hunting the dun deer lay by thy mantle of melancholy and strive to lead a joyous yeoman life for three stout days i promise thee thou shalt be sorry to go when the time has come  so the bishop and his train abided with robin for three days and much sport his lordship had in that time so that as robin had said when the time had come for him to go he was sorry to leave the greenwood at the end of three days robin set him free and sent him forth from the forest with a guard of yeomen to keep freebooters from taking what was left of the packs and bundles  but as the bishop rode away he vowed within himself that he would sometime make robin rue the day that he stopped him in sherwood  but now we shall follow sir richard so listen and you shall hear what befell him and how he paid his debts at emmet priory and likewise in due season to robin hood     how sir richard of the lea paid his debts  the long highway stretched straight on gray and dusty in the sun on either side were dikes full of water bordered by osiers and far away in the distance stood the towers of emmet priory with tall poplar trees around  along the causeway rode a knight with a score of stout menatarms behind him the knight was clad in a plain long robe of gray serge gathered in at the waist with a broad leathern belt from which hung a long dagger and a stout sword but though he was so plainly dressed himself the horse he rode was a noble barb and its trappings were rich with silk and silver bells  so thus the band journeyed along the causeway between the dikes till at last they reached the great gate of emmet priory there the knight called to one of his men and bade him knock at the porters lodge with the heft of his sword  the porter was drowsing on his bench within the lodge but at the knock he roused himself and opening the wicket came hobbling forth and greeted the knight while a tame starling that hung in a wicker cage within piped out in coelo quies in coelo quies such being the words that the poor old lame porter had taught him to speak  where is thy prior asked the knight of the old porter  he is at meat good knight and he looketh for thy coming quoth the porter for if i mistake not thou art sir richard of the lea  i am sir richard of the lea then i will go seek him forthwith said the knight  but shall i not send thy horse to stable said the porter by our lady it is the noblest nag and the best harnessed that eer i saw in all my life before and he stroked the horses flank with his palm  nay quoth sir richard the stables of this place are not for me so make way i prythee so saying he pushed forward and the gates being opened he entered the stony courtyard of the priory his men behind him in they came with rattle of steel and clashing of swords and ring of horses feet on cobblestones whereat a flock of pigeons that strutted in the sun flew with flapping wings to the high eaves of the round towers   while the knight was riding along the causeway to emmet a merry feast was toward in the refectory there the afternoon sun streamed in through the great arched windows and lay in broad squares of light upon the stone floor and across the board covered with a snowy linen cloth whereon was spread a princely feast at the head of the table sat prior vincent of emmet all clad in soft robes of fine cloth and silk on his head was a black velvet cap picked out with gold and around his neck hung a heavy chain of gold with a great locket pendant therefrom beside him on the arm of his great chair roosted his favorite falcon for the prior was fond of the gentle craft of hawking on his right hand sat the sheriff of nottingham in rich robes of purple all trimmed about with fur and on his left a famous doctor of law in dark and sober garb below these sat the high cellarer of emmet and others chief among the brethren  jest and laughter passed around and all was as merry as merry could be the wizened face of the man of law was twisted into a wrinkled smile for in his pouch were fourscore golden angels that the prior had paid him in fee for the case betwixt him and sir richard of the lea the learned doctor had been paid beforehand for he had not overmuch trust in the holy vincent of emmet  quoth the sheriff of nottingham but art thou sure sir prior that thou hast the lands so safe  ay marry said prior vincent smacking his lips after a deep draught of wine i have kept a close watch upon him albeit he was unawares of the same and i know right well that he hath no money to pay me withal  ay true said the man of law in a dry husky voice his land is surely forfeit if he cometh not to pay but sir prior thou must get a release beneath his sign manual or else thou canst not hope to hold the land without trouble from him  yea said the prior so thou hast told me ere now but i know that this knight is so poor that he will gladly sign away his lands for two hundred pounds of hard money  then up spake the high cellarer methinks it is a shame to so drive a misfortunate knight to the ditch i think it sorrow that the noblest estate in derbyshire should so pass away from him for a paltry five hundred pounds truly i  how now broke in the prior in a quivering voice his eyes glistening and his cheeks red with anger dost thou prate to my very beard sirrah by saint hubert thou hadst best save thy breath to cool thy pottage else it may scald thy mouth  nay said the man of law smoothly i dare swear this same knight will never come to settlement this day but will prove recreant nevertheless we will seek some means to gain his lands from him so never fear  but even as the doctor spoke there came a sudden clatter of horses hoofs and a jingle of iron mail in the courtyard below then up spake the prior and called upon one of the brethren that sat below the salt and bade him look out of the window and see who was below albeit he knew right well it could be none but sir richard  so the brother arose and went and looked and he said i see below a score of stout menatarms and a knight just dismounting from his horse he is dressed in long robes of gray which methinks are of poor seeming but the horse he rideth upon hath the richest coursing that ever i saw the knight dismounts and they come this way and are even now below in the great hall  lo see ye there now quoth prior vincent here ye have a knight with so lean a purse as scarce to buy him a crust of bread to munch yet he keeps a band of retainers and puts rich trappings upon his horses hide while his own back goeth bare is it not well that such men should be brought low  but art thou sure said the little doctor tremulously that this knight will do us no harm such as he are fierce when crossed and he hath a band of naughty men at his heels mayhap thou hadst better give an extension of his debt thus he spake for he was afraid sir richard might do him a harm  thou needst not fear said the prior looking down at the little man beside him this knight is gentle and would as soon think of harming an old woman as thee  as the prior finished a door at the lower end of the refectory swung open and in came sir richard with folded hands and head bowed upon his breast thus humbly he walked slowly up the hall while his menatarms stood about the door when he had come to where the prior sat he knelt upon one knee save and keep thee sir prior said he i am come to keep my day  then the first word that the prior said to him was hast thou brought my money  alas i have not so much as one penny upon my body said the knight whereat the priors eyes sparkled  now thou art a shrewd debtor i wot said he then sir sheriff i drink to thee  but still the knight kneeled upon the hard stones so the prior turned to him again what wouldst thou have quoth he sharply  at these words a slow red mounted into the knights cheeks but still he knelt i would crave thy mercy said he as thou hopest for heavens mercy show mercy to me strip me not of my lands and so reduce a true knight to poverty  thy day is broken and thy lands forfeit said the man of law plucking up his spirits at the knights humble speech  quoth sir richard thou man of law wilt thou not befriend me in mine hour of need  nay said the other i hold with this holy prior who hath paid me my fees in hard gold so that i am bounder to him  wilt thou not be my friend sir sheriff said sir richard  nay fore heaven quoth the sheriff of nottingham this is no business of mine yet i will do what i may and he nudged the prior beneath the cloth with his knee wilt thou not ease him of some of his debts sir prior  at this the prior smiled grimly pay me three hundred pounds sir richard said he and i will give thee quittance of thy debt  thou knowest sir prior that it is as easy for me to pay four hundred pounds as three hundred said sir richard but wilt thou not give me another twelvemonth to pay my debt  not another day said the prior sternly  and is this all thou wilt do for me asked the knight  now out upon thee false knight cried the prior bursting forth in anger either pay thy debt as i have said or release thy land and get thee gone from out my hall  then sir richard arose to his feet thou false lying priest said he in so stern a voice that the man of law shrunk affrighted i am no false knight as thou knowest full well but have even held my place in the press and the tourney hast thou so little courtesy that thou wouldst see a true knight kneel for all this time or see him come into thy hall and never offer him meat or drink  then quoth the man of law in a trembling voice this is surely an ill way to talk of matters appertaining to business let us be mild in speech what wilt thou pay this knight sir prior to give thee release of his land  i would have given him two hundred pounds quoth the prior but since he hath spoken so vilely to my teeth not one groat over one hundred pounds will he get  hadst thou offered me a thousand pounds false prior said the knight thou wouldst not have got an inch of my land then turning to where his menatarms stood near the door he called come hither and beckoned with his finger whereupon the tallest of them all came forward and handed him a long leathern bag sir richard took the bag and shot from it upon the table a glittering stream of golden money bear in mind sir prior said he that thou hast promised me quittance for three hundred pounds not one farthing above that shalt thou get so saying he counted out three hundred pounds and pushed it toward the prior  but now the priors hands dropped at his sides and the priors head hung upon his shoulder for not only had he lost all hopes of the land but he had forgiven the knight one hundred pounds of his debt and had needlessly paid the man of law fourscore angels to him he turned and quoth he give me back my money that thou hast  nay cried the other shrilly it is but my fee that thou didst pay me and thou gettest it not back again and he hugged his gown about him  now sir prior quoth sir richard i have held my day and paid all the dues demanded of me so as there is no more betwixt us i leave this vile place straightway so saying he turned upon his heel and strode away  all this time the sheriff had been staring with wideopen eyes and mouth agape at the tall manatarms who stood as though carved out of stone at last he gasped out reynold greenleaf  at this the tall manatarms who was no other than little john turned grinning to the sheriff i give thee good den fair gossip quoth he i would say sweet sheriff that i have heard all thy pretty talk this day and it shall be duly told unto robin hood so farewell for the nonce till we meet again in sherwood forest then he also turned and followed sir richard down the hall leaving the sheriff all pale and amazed shrunk together upon his chair  a merry feast it was to which sir richard came but a sorry lot he left behind him and little hunger had they for the princely food spread before them only the learned doctor was happy for he had his fee   now a twelvemonth and a day passed since prior vincent of emmet sat at feast and once more the mellow fall of another year had come but the year had brought great change i wot to the lands of sir richard of the lea for where before shaggy wild grasses grew upon the meadow lands now all stretch away in golden stubble betokening that a rich and plentiful crop had been gathered therefrom a year had made a great change in the castle also for where were empty moats and the crumbling of neglect all was now orderly and well kept  bright shone the sun on battlement and tower and in the blue air overhead a hock of clattering jackdaws flew around the gilded weather vane and spire then in the brightness of the morning the drawbridge fell across the moat with a rattle and clank of chains the gate of the castle swung slowly open and a goodly array of steelclad menatarms with a knight all clothed in chain mail as white as frost on brier and thorn of a winter morning came flashing out from the castle courtyard in his hand the knight held a great spear from the point of which fluttered a bloodred pennant as broad as the palm of ones hand so this troop came forth from the castle and in the midst of them walked three pack horses laden with parcels of divers shapes and kinds  thus rode forth good sir richard of the lea to pay his debt to robin hood this bright and merry morn along the highway they wended their way with measured tramp of feet and rattle and jingle of sword and harness onward they marched till they came nigh to denby where from the top of a hill they saw over beyond the town many gay flags and streamers floating in the bright air then sir richard turned to the manatarms nearest to him what is toward yonder at denby today quoth he  please your worship answered the manatarms a merry fair is held there today and a great wrestling match to which many folk have come for a prize hath been offered of a pipe of red wine a fair golden ring and a pair of gloves all of which go to the best wrestler  now by my faith quoth sir richard who loved good manly sports right well this will be a goodly thing to see methinks we have to stay a little while on our journey and see this merry sport so he turned his horses head aside toward denby and the fair and thither he and his men made their way  there they found a great hubbub of merriment flags and streamers were floating tumblers were tumbling on the green bagpipes were playing and lads and lasses were dancing to the music but the crowd were gathered most of all around a ring where the wrestling was going forward and thither sir richard and his men turned their steps  now when the judges of the wrestling saw sir richard coming and knew who he was the chief of them came down from the bench where he and the others sat and went to the knight and took him by the hand beseeching him to come and sit with them and judge the sport so sir richard got down from his horse and went with the others to the bench raised beside the ring  now there had been great doings that morning for a certain yeoman named egbert who came from stoke over in staffordshire had thrown with ease all those that came against him but a man of denby well known through all the countryside as william of the scar had been biding his time with the stoke man so when egbert had thrown everyone else stout william leaped into the ring then a tough bout followed and at last he threw egbert heavily whereat there was a great shouting and shaking of hands for all the denby men were proud of their wrestler  when sir richard came he found stout william puffed up by the shouts of his friends walking up and down the ring daring anyone to come and try a throw with him come one come all quoth he here stand i william of the scar against any man if there is none in derbyshire to come against me come all who will from nottingham stafford or york and if i do not make them one and all root the ground with their noses like swine in the forests call me no more brave william the wrestler  at this all laughed but above all the laughter a loud voice was heard to cry out sin thou talkest so big here cometh one from nottinghamshire to try a fall with thee fellow and straightway a tall youth with a tough quarterstaff in his hand came pushing his way through the crowd and at last leaped lightly over the rope into the ring he was not as heavy as stout william but he was taller and broader in the shoulders and all his joints were well knit sir richard looked upon him keenly then turning to one of the judges he said knowest thou who this youth is methinks i have seen him before  nay said the judge he is a stranger to me  meantime without a word the young man laying aside his quarterstaff began to take off his jerkin and body clothing until he presently stood with naked arms and body and a comely sight he was when so bared to the view for his muscles were cut round and smooth and sharp like swiftrunning water  and now each man spat upon his hands and clapping them upon his knees squatted down watching the other keenly so as to take the vantage of him in the grip then like a flash they leaped together and a great shout went up for william had gotten the better hold of the two for a short time they strained and struggled and writhed and then stout william gave his most cunning trip and throw but the stranger met it with greater skill than his and so the trip came to nought then of a sudden with a twist and a wrench the stranger loosed himself and he of the scar found himself locked in a pair of arms that fairly made his ribs crack so with heavy hot breathing they stood for a while straining their bodies all glistening with sweat and great drops of sweat trickling down their faces but the strangers hug was so close that at last stout williams muscles softened under his grip and he gave a sob then the youth put forth all his strength and gave a sudden trip with his heel and a cast over his right hip and down stout william went with a sickening thud and lay as though he would never move hand nor foot again  but now no shout went up for the stranger but an angry murmur was heard among the crowd so easily had he won the match then one of the judges a kinsman to william of the scar rose with trembling lip and baleful look quoth he if thou hath slain that man it will go ill with thee let me tell thee fellow but the stranger answered boldly he took his chance with me as i took mine with him no law can touch me to harm me even if i slew him so that it was fairly done in the wrestling ring  that we shall see said the judge scowling upon the youth while once more an angry murmur ran around the crowd for as i have said the men of denby were proud of stout william of the scar  then up spoke sir richard gently nay said he the youth is right if the other dieth he dieth in the wrestling ring where he took his chance and was cast fairly enow  but in the meantime three men had come forward and lifted stout william from the ground and found that he was not dead though badly shaken by his heavy fall then the chief judge rose and said young man the prize is duly thine here is the redgold ring and here the gloves and yonder stands the pipe of wine to do with whatsoever thou dost list  at this the youth who had donned his clothes and taken up his staff again bowed without a word then taking the gloves and the ring and thrusting the one into his girdle and slipping the other upon his thumb he turned and leaping lightly over the ropes again made his way through the crowd and was gone  now i wonder who yon youth may be said the judge turning to sir richard he seemeth like a stout saxon from his red cheeks and fair hair this william of ours is a stout man too and never have i seen him cast in the ring before albeit he hath not yet striven with such great wrestlers as thomas of cornwall diccon of york and young david of doncaster hath he not a firm foot in the ring thinkest thou sir richard  ay truly and yet this youth threw him fairly and with wondrous ease i much wonder who he can be thus said sir richard in a thoughtful voice  for a time the knight stood talking to those about him but at last he arose and made ready to depart so he called his men about him and tightening the girths of his saddle he mounted his horse once more  meanwhile the young stranger had made his way through the crowd but as he passed he heard all around him such words muttered as look at the cockerel behold how he plumeth himself i dare swear he cast good william unfairly yea truly saw ye not birdlime upon his hands it would be well to cut his cocks comb to all this the stranger paid no heed but strode proudly about as though he heard it not so he walked slowly across the green to where the booth stood wherein was dancing and standing at the door he looked in on the sport as he stood thus a stone struck his arm of a sudden with a sharp jar and turning he saw that an angry crowd of men had followed him from the wrestling ring then when they saw him turn so a great hooting and yelling arose from all so that the folk came running out from the dancing booth to see what was to do at last a tall broadshouldered burly blacksmith strode forward from the crowd swinging a mighty blackthorn club in his hand  wouldst thou come here to our fair town of denby thou jack in the box to overcome a good honest lad with vile juggling tricks growled he in a deep voice like the bellow of an angry bull take that then and of a sudden he struck a blow at the youth that might have felled an ox but the other turned the blow deftly aside and gave back another so terrible that the denby man went down with a groan as though he had been smitten by lightning when they saw their leader fall the crowd gave another angry shout but the stranger placed his back against the tent near which he stood swinging his terrible staff and so fell had been the blow that he struck the stout smith that none dared to come within the measure of his cudgel so the press crowded back like a pack of dogs from a bear at bay but now some coward hand from behind threw a sharp jagged stone that smote the stranger on the crown so that he staggered back and the red blood gushed from the cut and ran down his face and over his jerkin then seeing him dazed with this vile blow the crowd rushed upon him so that they overbore him and he fell beneath their feet  now it might have gone ill with the youth even to the losing of his young life had not sir richard come to this fair for of a sudden shouts were heard and steel flashed in the air and blows were given with the flat of swords while through the midst of the crowd sir richard of the lea came spurring on his white horse then the crowd seeing the steelclad knight and the armed men melted away like snow on the warm hearth leaving the young man all bloody and dusty upon the ground  finding himself free the youth arose and wiping the blood from his face looked up quoth he sir richard of the lea mayhap thou hast saved my life this day  who art thou that knowest sir richard of the lea so well quoth the knight methinks i have seen thy face before young man  yea thou hast said the youth for men call me david of doncaster  ha said sir richard i wonder that i knew thee not david but thy beard hath grown longer and thou thyself art more set in manhood since this day twelvemonth come hither into the tent david and wash the blood from thy face and thou ralph bring him straightway a clean jerkin now i am sorry for thee yet i am right glad that i have had a chance to pay a part of my debt of kindness to thy good master robin hood for it might have gone ill with thee had i not come young man  so saying the knight led david into the tent and there the youth washed the blood from his face and put on the clean jerkin  in the meantime a whisper had gone around from those that stood nearest that this was none other than the great david of doncaster the best wrestler in all the midcountry who only last spring had cast stout adam o lincoln in the ring at selby in yorkshire and now held the midcountry champion belt thus it happened that when young david came forth from the tent along with sir richard the blood all washed from his face and his soiled jerkin changed for a clean one no sounds of anger were heard but all pressed forward to see the young man feeling proud that one of the great wrestlers of england should have entered the ring at denby fair for thus fickle is a mass of men  then sir richard called aloud friends this is david of doncaster so think it no shame that your denby man was cast by such a wrestler he beareth you no ill will for what hath passed but let it be a warning to you how ye treat strangers henceforth had ye slain him it would have been an ill day for you for robin hood would have harried your town as the kestrel harries the dovecote i have bought the pipe of wine from him and now i give it freely to you to drink as ye list but never hereafterward fall upon a man for being a stout yeoman  at this all shouted amain but in truth they thought more of the wine than of the knights words then sir richard with david beside him and his menatarms around turned about and left the fair  but in after days when the men that saw that wrestling bout were bent with age they would shake their heads when they heard of any stalwart game and say ay ay but thou shouldst have seen the great david of doncaster cast stout william of the scar at denby fair  robin hood stood in the merry greenwood with little john and most of his stout yeomen around him awaiting sir richards coming at last a glint of steel was seen through the brown forest leaves and forth from the covert into the open rode sir richard at the head of his men he came straight forward to robin hood and leaping from off his horse clasped the yeoman in his arms  why how now said robin after a time holding sir richard off and looking at him from top to toe methinks thou art a gayer bird than when i saw thee last  yes thanks to thee robin said the knight laying his hand upon the yeomans shoulder but for thee i would have been wandering in misery in a far country by this time but i have kept my word robin and have brought back the money that thou didst lend me and which i have doubled four times over again and so become rich once more along with this money i have brought a little gift to thee and thy brave men from my dear lady and myself then turning to his men he called aloud bring forth the pack horses  but robin stopped him nay sir richard said he think it not bold of me to cross thy bidding but we of sherwood do no business till after we have eaten and drunk whereupon taking sir richard by the hand he led him to the seat beneath the greenwood tree while others of the chief men of the band came and seated themselves around then quoth robin how cometh it that i saw young david of doncaster with thee and thy men sir knight  then straightway the knight told all about his stay at denby and of the happening at the fair and how it was like to go hard with young david so he told his tale and quoth he it was this good robin that kept me so late on the way otherwise i would have been here an hour agone  then when he had done speaking robin stretched out his hand and grasped the knights palm quoth he in a trembling voice i owe thee a debt i can never hope to repay sir richard for let me tell thee i would rather lose my right hand than have such ill befall young david of doncaster as seemed like to come upon him at denby  so they talked until after a while one came forward to say that the feast was spread whereupon all arose and went thereto when at last it was done the knight called upon his men to bring the pack horses forward which they did according to his bidding then one of the men brought the knight a strongbox which he opened and took from it a bag and counted out five hundred pounds the sum he had gotten from robin  sir richard quoth robin thou wilt pleasure us all if thou wilt keep that money as a gift from us of sherwood is it not so my lads  then all shouted ay with a mighty voice  i thank you all deeply said the knight earnestly but think it not ill of me if i cannot take it gladly have i borrowed it from you but it may not be that i can take it as a gift  then robin hood said no more but gave the money to little john to put away in the treasury for he had shrewdness enough to know that nought breeds ill will and heart bitterness like gifts forced upon one that cannot choose but take them  then sir richard had the packs laid upon the ground and opened whereupon a great shout went up that made the forest ring again for lo there were tenscore bows of finest spanish yew all burnished till they shone again and each bow inlaid with fanciful figures in silver yet not inlaid so as to mar their strength beside these were tenscore quivers of leather embroidered with golden thread and in each quiver were a score of shafts with burnished heads that shone like silver each shaft was feathered with peacocks plumes innocked with silver  sir richard gave to each yeoman a bow and a quiver of arrows but to robin he gave a stout bow inlaid with the cunningest workmanship in gold while each arrow in his quiver was innocked with gold  then all shouted again for joy of the fair gift and all swore among themselves that they would die if need be for sir richard and his lady  at last the time came when sir richard must go whereupon robin hood called his band around him and each man of the yeomen took a torch in his hand to light the way through the woodlands so they came to the edge of sherwood and there the knight kissed robin upon the cheeks and left him and was gone  thus robin hood helped a noble knight out of his dire misfortunes that else would have smothered the happiness from his life     little john turns barefoot friar  cold winter had passed and spring had come no leafy thickness had yet clad the woodlands but the budding leaves hung like a tender mist about the trees in the open country the meadow lands lay a sheeny green the cornfields a dark velvety color for they were thick and soft with the growing blades the plowboy shouted in the sun and in the purple newturned furrows flocks of birds hunted for fat worms all the broad moist earth smiled in the warm light and each little green hill clapped its hand for joy  on a deers hide stretched on the ground in the open in front of the greenwood tree sat robin hood basking in the sun like an old dog fox leaning back with his hands clasped about his knees he lazily watched little john rolling a stout bowstring from long strands of hempen thread wetting the palms of his hands ever and anon and rolling the cord upon his thigh near by sat allan a dale fitting a new string to his harp  quoth robin at last methinks i would rather roam this forest in the gentle springtime than be king of all merry england what palace in the broad world is as fair as this sweet woodland just now and what king in all the world hath such appetite for plovers eggs and lampreys as i for juicy venison and sparkling ale gaffer swanthold speaks truly when he saith better a crust with content than honey with a sour heart  yea quoth little john as he rubbed his newmade bowstring with yellow beeswax the life we lead is the life for me thou speakest of the springtime but methinks even the winter hath its own joys thou and i good master have had more than one merry day this winter past at the blue boar dost thou not remember that night thou and will stutely and friar tuck and i passed at that same hostelry with the two beggars and the strolling friar  yea quoth merry robin laughing that was the night that will stutely must needs snatch a kiss from the stout hostess and got a canakin of ale emptied over his head for his pains  truly it was the same said little john laughing also methinks that was a goodly song that the strolling friar sang friar tuck thou hast a quick ear for a tune dost thou not remember it  i did have the catch of it one time said tuck let me see and he touched his forefinger to his forehead in thought humming to himself and stopping ever and anon to fit what he had got to what he searched for in his mind at last he found it all and clearing his throat sang merrily       in the blossoming hedge the robin cock sings      for the sun it is merry and bright      and he joyfully hops and he flutters his wings      for his heart is all full of delight      for the may bloometh fair      and theres little of care      and plenty to eat in the maytime rare      when the flowers all die      then off he will fly      to keep himself warm      in some jolly old barn      where the snow and the wind neither chill him nor harm       and such is the life of the strolling friar      with aplenty to eat and to drink      for the goodwife will keep him a seat by the fire      and the pretty girls smile at his wink      then he lustily trolls      as he onward strolls      a rollicking song for the saving of souls      when the wind doth blow      with the coming of snow      theres a place by the fire      for the fatherly friar      and a crab in the bowl for his hearts desire  thus friar tuck sang in a rich and mellow voice rolling his head from side to side in time with the music and when he had done all clapped their hands and shouted with laughter for the song fitted him well  in very sooth quoth little john it is a goodly song and were i not a yeoman of sherwood forest i had rather be a strolling friar than aught else in the world  yea it is a goodly song said robin hood but methought those two burly beggars told the merrier tales and led the merrier life dost thou not remember what that great blackbearded fellow told of his begging at the fair in york  yea said little john but what told the friar of the harvest home in kentshire i hold that he led a merrier life than the other two  truly for the honor of the cloth quoth friar tuck i hold with my good gossip little john  now quoth robin i hold to mine own mind but what sayst thou little john to a merry adventure this fair day take thou a friars gown from our chest of strange garments and don the same and i will stop the first beggar i meet and change clothes with him then let us wander the country about this sweet day and see what befalls each of us  that fitteth my mind quoth little john so let us forth say i  thereupon little john and friar tuck went to the storehouse of the band and there chose for the yeoman the robe of a gray friar then they came forth again and a mighty roar of laughter went up for not only had the band never seen little john in such guise before but the robe was too short for him by a good palmsbreadth but little johns hands were folded in his loose sleeves and little johns eyes were cast upon the ground and at his girdle hung a great long string of beads  and now little john took up his stout staff at the end of which hung a chubby little leathern pottle such as palmers carry at the tips of their staves but in it was something i wot more like good malmsey than cold spring water such as godly pilgrims carry then up rose robin and took his stout staff in his hand likewise and slipped ten golden angels into his pouch for no beggars garb was among the stores of the band so he was fain to run his chance of meeting a beggar and buying his clothes of him  so all being made ready the two yeomen set forth on their way striding lustily along all in the misty morning thus they walked down the forest path until they came to the highway and then along the highway till it split in twain leading on one hand to blyth and on the other to gainsborough here the yeomen stopped  quoth jolly robin take thou the road to gainsborough and i will take that to blyth so fare thee well holy father and mayst thou not ha cause to count thy beads in earnest ere we meet again  good den good beggar that is to be quoth little john and mayst thou have no cause to beg for mercy ere i see thee next  so each stepped sturdily upon his way until a green hill rose between them and the one was hid from the sight of the other  little john walked along whistling for no one was nigh upon all the road in the budding hedges the little birds twittered merrily and on either hand the green hills swept up to the sky the great white clouds of springtime sailing slowly over their crowns in lazy flight up hill and down dale walked little john the fresh wind blowing in his face and his robes fluttering behind him and so at last he came to a crossroad that led to tuxford here he met three pretty lasses each bearing a basket of eggs to market quoth he whither away fair maids and he stood in their path holding his staff in front of them to stop them  then they huddled together and nudged one another and one presently spake up and said we are going to the tuxford market holy friar to sell our eggs  now out upon it quoth little john looking upon them with his head on one side surely it is a pity that such fair lasses should be forced to carry eggs to market let me tell you an i had the shaping of things in this world ye should all three have been clothed in the finest silks and ride upon milkwhite horses with pages at your side and feed upon nothing but whipped cream and strawberries for such a life would surely befit your looks  at this speech all three of the pretty maids looked down blushing and simpering one said la another marry a maketh sport of us and the third listen now to the holy man but at the same time they looked at little john from out the corners of their eyes  now look you said little john i cannot see such dainty damsels as ye are carrying baskets along a highroad let me take them mine own self and one of you if ye will may carry my staff for me  nay said one of the lasses but thou canst not carry three baskets all at one time  yea but i can said little john and that i will show you presently i thank the good saint wilfred that he hath given me a pretty wit look ye now here i take this great basket so here i tie my rosary around the handle thus and here i slip the rosary over my head and sling the basket upon my back in this wise and little john did according to his words the basket hanging down behind him like a peddlers pack then giving his staff to one of the maids and taking a basket upon either arm he turned his face toward tuxford town and stepped forth merrily a laughing maid on either side and one walking ahead carrying the staff in this wise they journeyed along and everyone they met stopped and looked after them laughing for never had anybody seen such a merry sight as this tall strapping gray friar with robes all too short for him laden with eggs and tramping the road with three pretty lasses for this little john cared not a whit but when such folks gave jesting words to him he answered back as merrily speech for speech  so they stepped along toward tuxford chatting and laughing until they came nigh to the town here little john stopped and set down the baskets for he did not care to go into the town lest he should perchance meet some of the sheriffs men alas sweet chucks quoth he here i must leave you i had not thought to come this way but i am glad that i did so now ere we part we must drink sweet friendship so saying he unslung the leathern pottle from the end of his staff and drawing the stopper therefrom he handed it to the lass who had carried his staff first wiping the mouth of the pottle upon his sleeve then each lass took a fair drink of what was within and when it had passed all around little john finished what was left so that not another drop could be squeezed from it then kissing each lass sweetly he wished them all good den and left them but the maids stood looking after him as he walked away whistling what a pity quoth one that such a stout lusty lad should be in holy orders  marry quoth little john to himself as he strode along yon was no such ill happening saint dunstan send me more of the like  after he had trudged along for a time he began to wax thirsty again in the warmth of the day he shook his leathern pottle beside his ear but not a sound came therefrom then he placed it to his lips and tilted it high aloft but not a drop was there little john little john said he sadly to himself shaking his head the while woman will be thy ruin yet if thou dost not take better care of thyself  but at last he reached the crest of a certain hill and saw below a sweet little thatched inn lying snugly in the dale beneath him toward which the road dipped sharply at the sight of this a voice within him cried aloud i give thee joy good friend for yonder is thy hearts delight to wit a sweet rest and a cup of brown beer so he quickened his pace down the hill and so came to the little inn from which hung a sign with a stags head painted upon it in front of the door a clucking hen was scratching in the dust with a brood of chickens about her heels the sparrows were chattering of household affairs under the eaves and all was so sweet and peaceful that little johns heart laughed within him beside the door stood two stout cobs with broad softpadded saddles well fitted for easy traveling and speaking of rich guests in the parlor in front of the door three merry fellows a tinker a peddler and a beggar were seated on a bench in the sun quaffing stout ale  i give you good den sweet friends quoth little john striding up to where they sat  give thee good den holy father quoth the merry beggar with a grin but look thee thy gown is too short thou hadst best cut a piece off the top and tack it to the bottom so that it may be long enough but come sit beside us here and take a taste of ale if thy vows forbid thee not  nay quoth little john also grinning the blessed saint dunstan hath given me a free dispensation for all indulgence in that line and he thrust his hand into his pouch for money to pay his score  truly quoth the tinker without thy looks belie thee holy friar the good saint dunstan was wise for without such dispensation his votary is like to ha many a penance to make nay take thy hand from out thy pouch brother for thou shalt not pay this shot ho landlord a pot of ale  so the ale was brought and given to little john then blowing the froth a little way to make room for his lips he tilted the bottom of the pot higher and higher till it pointed to the sky and he had to shut his eyes to keep the dazzle of the sunshine out of them then he took the pot away for there was nothing in it and heaved a full deep sigh looking at the others with moist eyes and shaking his head solemnly  ho landlord cried the peddler bring this good fellow another pot of ale for truly it is a credit to us all to have one among us who can empty a canakin so lustily  so they talked among themselves merrily until after a while quoth little john who rideth those two nags yonder  two holy men like thee brother quoth the beggar they are now having a goodly feast within for i smelled the steam of a boiled pullet just now the landlady sayeth they come from fountain abbey in yorkshire and go to lincoln on matters of business  they are a merry couple said the tinker for one is as lean as an old wifes spindle and the other as fat as a suet pudding  talking of fatness said the peddler thou thyself lookest none too illfed holy friar  nay truly said little john thou seest in me what the holy saint dunstan can do for them that serve him upon a handful of parched peas and a trickle of cold water  at this a great shout of laughter went up truly it is a wondrous thing quoth the beggar i would have made my vow to see the masterly manner in which thou didst tuck away yon pot of ale that thou hadst not tasted clear water for a brace of months has not this same holy saint dunstan taught thee a goodly song or two  why as for that quoth little john grinning mayhap he hath lent me aid to learn a ditty or so  then prythee let us hear how he hath taught thee quoth the tinker  at this little john cleared his throat and after a word or two about a certain hoarseness that troubled him sang thus       ah pretty pretty maid whither dost thou go      i prythee prythee wait for thy lover also      and well gather the rose      as it sweetly blows      for the merry merry winds are blooowing  now it seemed as though little johns songs were never to get sung for he had got no farther than this when the door of the inn opened and out came the two brothers of fountain abbey the landlord following them and as the saying is washing his hands with humble soap but when the brothers of fountain abbey saw who it was that sang and how he was clad in the robes of a gray friar they stopped suddenly the fat little brother drawing his heavy eyebrows together in a mighty frown and the thin brother twisting up his face as though he had sour beer in his mouth then as little john gathered his breath for a new verse how now roared forth the fat brother his voice coming from him like loud thunder from a little cloud thou naughty fellow is this a fit place for one in thy garb to tipple and sing profane songs  nay quoth little john sin i cannot tipple and sing like your worships reverence in such a goodly place as fountain abbey i must een tipple and sing where i can  now out upon thee cried the tall lean brother in a harsh voice now out upon thee that thou shouldst so disgrace thy cloth by this talk and bearing  marry come up quoth little john disgrace sayest thou methinks it is more disgrace for one of our garb to wring hardearned farthings out of the gripe of poor lean peasants it is not so brother  at this the tinker and the peddler and the beggar nudged one another and all grinned and the friars scowled blackly at little john but they could think of nothing further to say so they turned to their horses then little john arose of a sudden from the bench where he sat and ran to where the brothers of fountain abbey were mounting quoth he let me hold your horses bridles for you truly your words have smitten my sinful heart so that i will abide no longer in this den of evil but will go forward with you no vile temptation i wot will fall upon me in such holy company  nay fellow said the lean brother harshly for he saw that little john made sport of them we want none of thy company so get thee gone  alas quoth little john i am truly sorry that ye like me not nor my company but as for leaving you it may not be for my heart is so moved that willynilly i must go with you for the sake of your holy company  now at this talk all the good fellows on the bench grinned till their teeth glistened and even the landlord could not forbear to smile as for the friars they looked at one another with a puzzled look and knew not what to do in the matter they were so proud that it made them feel sick with shame to think of riding along the highroad with a strolling friar in robes all too short for him running beside them but yet they could not make little john stay against his will for they knew he could crack the bones of both of them in a twinkling were he so minded then up spake the fat brother more mildly than he had done before nay good brother said he we will ride fast and thou wilt tire to death at the pace  truly i am grateful to thee for the thought of me quoth little john but have no fear brother my limbs are stout and i could run like a hare from here to gainsborough  at these words a sound of laughing came from the bench whereat the lean brothers wrath boiled over like water into the fire with great fuss and noise now out upon thee thou naughty fellow he cried art thou not ashamed to bring disgrace so upon our cloth bide thee here thou sot with these porkers thou art no fit company for us  la ye there now quoth little john thou hearest landlord thou art not fit company for these holy men go back to thine alehouse nay if these most holy brothers of mine do but give me the word ill beat thy head with this stout staff till it is as soft as whipped eggs  at these words a great shout of laughter went up from those on the bench and the landlords face grew red as a cherry from smothering his laugh in his stomach but he kept his merriment down for he wished not to bring the illwill of the brothers of fountain abbey upon him by unseemly mirth so the two brethren as they could do nought else having mounted their nags turned their noses toward lincoln and rode away  i cannot stay longer sweet friends quoth little john as he pushed in betwixt the two cobs therefore i wish you good den off we go we three so saying he swung his stout staff over his shoulder and trudged off measuring his pace with that of the two nags  the two brothers glowered at little john when he so pushed himself betwixt them then they drew as far away from him as they could so that the yeoman walked in the middle of the road while they rode on the footpath on either side of the way as they so went away the tinker the peddler and the beggar ran skipping out into the middle of the highway each with a pot in his hand and looked after them laughing  while they were in sight of those at the inn the brothers walked their horses soberly not caring to make ill matters worse by seeming to run away from little john for they could not but think how it would sound in folks ears when they heard how the brethren of fountain abbey scampered away from a strolling friar like the ugly one when the blessed saint dunstan loosed his nose from the redhot tongs where he had held it fast but when they had crossed the crest of the hill and the inn was lost to sight quoth the fat brother to the thin brother brother ambrose had we not better mend our pace  why truly gossip spoke up little john methinks it would be well to boil our pot a little faster for the day is passing on so it will not jolt thy fat too much onward say i  at this the two friars said nothing but they glared again on little john with baleful looks then without another word they clucked to their horses and both broke into a canter so they galloped for a mile and more and little john ran betwixt them as lightly as a stag and never turned a hair with the running at last the fat brother drew his horses rein with a groan for he could stand the shaking no longer alas said little john with not so much as a catch in his breath i did sadly fear that the roughness of this pace would shake thy poor old fat paunch  to this the fat friar said never a word but he stared straight before him and he gnawed his nether lip and now they traveled forward more quietly little john in the middle of the road whistling merrily to himself and the two friars in the footpath on either side saying never a word  then presently they met three merry minstrels all clad in red who stared amain to see a gray friar with such short robes walking in the middle of the road and two brothers with heads bowed with shame riding upon richly caparisoned cobs on the footpaths when they had come near to the minstrels little john waved his staff like an usher clearing the way make way he cried in a loud voice make way make way for here we go we three then how the minstrels stared and how they laughed but the fat friar shook as with an ague and the lean friar bowed his head over his horses neck  then next they met two noble knights in rich array with hawk on wrist and likewise two fair ladies clad in silks and velvets all ariding on noble steeds these all made room staring as little john and the two friars came along the road to them little john bowed humbly give you greetings lords and ladies said he but here we go we three  then all laughed and one of the fair ladies cried out what three meanest thou merry friend  little john looked over his shoulder for they had now passed each other and he called back big jack lean jack and fat jackpudding  at this the fat friar gave a groan and seemed as if he were like to fall from his saddle for shame the other brother said nothing but he looked before him with a grim and stony look  just ahead of them the road took a sudden turn around a high hedge and some twoscore paces beyond the bend another road crossed the one they were riding upon when they had come to the crossroad and were well away from those they had left the lean friar drew rein suddenly look ye fellow quoth he in a voice quivering with rage we have had enough of thy vile company and care no longer to be made sport of go thy way and let us go ours in peace  la there now quoth little john methought we were such a merry company and here thou dost blaze up like fat in the pan but truly i ha had enow of you today though i can ill spare your company i know ye will miss me but gin ye want me again whisper to goodman wind and he will bring news thereof to me but ye see i am a poor man and ye are rich i pray you give me a penny or two to buy me bread and cheese at the next inn  we have no money fellow said the lean friar harshly come brother thomas let us forward  but little john caught the horses by the bridle reins one in either hand ha ye in truth no money about you whatsoever said he now i pray you brothers for charitys sake give me somewhat to buy a crust of bread een though it be only a penny  i tell thee fellow we have no money thundered the fat little friar with the great voice  ha ye in holy truth no money asked little john  not a farthing said the lean friar sourly  not a groat said the fat friar loudly  nay quoth little john this must not be far be it from me to see such holy men as ye are depart from me with no money get both of you down straightway from off your horses and we will kneel here in the middle of the crossroads and pray the blessed saint dunstan to send us some money to carry us on our journey  what sayest thou thou limb of evil cried the lean friar fairly gnashing his teeth with rage doss thou bid me the high cellarer of fountain abbey to get down from my horse and kneel in the dirty road to pray to some beggarly saxon saint  now quoth little john i ha a great part of a mind to crack thy head for thee for speaking thus of the good saint dunstan but get down straightway for my patience will not last much longer and i may forget that ye are both in holy orders so saying he twirled his stout staff till it whistled again  at this speech both friars grew as pale as dough down slipped the fat brother from off his horse on one side and down slipped the lean brother on the other  now brothers down on your knees and pray said little john thereupon putting his heavy hands upon the shoulder of each he forced them to their knees he kneeling also then little john began to beseech saint dunstan for money which he did in a great loud voice after he had so besought the saint for a time he bade the friars feel in their pouches and see if the saint had sent them anything so each put his hand slowly in the pouch that hung beside him but brought nothing thence  ha quoth little john have your prayers so little virtue then let us at it again then straightway he began calling on saint dunstan again somewhat in this wise o gracious saint dunstan send some money straightway to these poor folk lest the fat one waste away and grow as lean as the lean one and the lean one waste away to nothing at all ere they get to lincoln town but send them only ten shillings apiece lest they grow puffed up with pride any more than that that thou sendest send to me  now quoth he rising let us see what each man hath then he thrust his hand into his pouch and drew thence four golden angels what have ye brothers said he  then once again each friar slowly thrust his hand into his pouch and once again brought it out with nothing in it  have ye nothing quoth little john nay i warrant there is somewhat that hath crept into the seams of your pouches and so ye ha missed it let me look  so he went first to the lean friar and thrusting his hand into the pouch he drew forth a leathern bag and counted therefrom one hundred and ten pounds of golden money i thought quoth little john that thou hadst missed in some odd corner of thy pouch the money that the blessed saint had sent thee and now let me see whether thou hast not some also brother thereupon he thrust his hand into the pouch of the fat friar and drew thence a bag like the other and counted out from it threescore and ten pounds look ye now quoth he i knew the good saint had sent thee some pittance that thou also hadst missed  then giving them one pound between them he slipped the rest of the money into his own pouch saying ye pledged me your holy word that ye had no money being holy men i trust that ye would not belie your word so pledged therefore i know the good saint dunstan hath sent this in answer to my prayers but as i only prayed for ten shillings to be sent to each of you all over and above that belongeth by rights to me and so i take it i give you good den brothers and may ye have a pleasant journey henceforth so saying he turned and left them striding away the friars looked at one another with a woeful look and slowly and sadly they mounted their horses again and rode away with never a word  but little john turned his footsteps back again to sherwood forest and merrily he whistled as he strode along  and now we will see what befell robin hood in his venture as beggar     robin hood turns beggar  after jolly robin had left little john at the forking of the roads he walked merrily onward in the mellow sunshine that shone about him ever and anon he would skip and leap or sing a snatch of song for pure joyousness of the day for because of the sweetness of the springtide his heart was as lusty within him as that of a colt newly turned out to grass sometimes he would walk a long distance gazing aloft at the great white swelling clouds that moved slowly across the deep blue sky anon he would stop and drink in the fullness of life of all things for the hedgerows were budding tenderly and the grass of the meadows was waxing long and green again he would stand still and listen to the pretty song of the little birds in the thickets or hearken to the clear crow of the cock daring the sky to rain whereat he would laugh for it took but little to tickle robins heart into merriment so he trudged manfully along ever willing to stop for this reason or for that and ever ready to chat with such merry lasses as he met now and then so the morning slipped along but yet he met no beggar with whom he could change clothes quoth he if i do not change my luck in haste i am like to have an empty day of it for it is well nigh half gone already and although i have had a merry walk through the countryside i know nought of a beggars life  then after a while he began to grow hungry whereupon his mind turned from thoughts of springtime and flowers and birds and dwelled upon boiled capons malmsey white bread and the like with great tenderness quoth he to himself i would i had willie wynkins wishing coat i know right well what i should wish for and this it should be here he marked upon the fingers of his left hand with the forefinger of his right hand those things which he wished for firstly i would have a sweet brown pie of tender larks mark ye not dry cooked but with a good sop of gravy to moisten it withal next i would have a pretty pullet fairly boiled with tender pigeons eggs cunningly sliced garnishing the platter around with these i would have a long slim loaf of wheaten bread that hath been baked upon the hearth it should be warm from the fire with glossy brown crust the color of the hair of mine own maid marian and this same crust should be as crisp and brittle as the thin white ice that lies across the furrows in the early winters morning these will do for the more solid things but with these i must have three potties fat and round one full of malmsey one of canary and one brimming full of mine own dear lusty sack thus spoke robin to himself his mouth growing moist at the corners with the thoughts of the good things he had raised in his own mind  so talking to himself he came to where the dusty road turned sharply around the hedge all tender with the green of the coming leaf and there he saw before him a stout fellow sitting upon a stile swinging his legs in idleness all about this lusty rogue dangled divers pouches and bags of different sizes and kinds a dozen or more with great wide gaping mouths like a brood of hungry daws his coat was gathered in at his waist and was patched with as many colors as there are stripes upon a maypole in the springtide on his head he wore a great tall leathern cap and across his knees rested a stout quarterstaff of blackthorn full as long and heavy as robins as jolly a beggar was he as ever trod the lanes and byways of nottinghamshire for his eyes were as gray as slate and snapped and twinkled and danced with merriment and his black hair curled close all over his head in little rings of kinkiness  halloa good fellow quoth robin when he had come nigh to the other what art thou doing here this merry day when the flowers are peeping and the buds are swelling  then the other winked one eye and straightway trolled forth in a merry voice       i sit upon the stile      and i sing a little while      as i wait for my own true dear o      for the sun is shining bright      and the leaves are dancing light      and the little fowl sings she is near o  and so it is with me bully boy saving that my doxy cometh not  now that is a right sweet song quoth robin and were i in the right mind to listen to thee i could bear well to hear more but i have two things of seriousness to ask of thee so listen i prythee  at this the jolly beggar cocked his head on one side like a rogue of a magpie quoth he i am an ill jug to pour heavy things into good friend and if i mistake not thou hast few serious words to spare at any time  nay quoth jolly robin what i would say first is the most serious of all thoughts to me to wit where shall i get somewhat to eat and drink  sayst thou so quoth the beggar marry i make no such serious thoughts upon the matter i eat when i can get it and munch my crust when i can get no crumb likewise when there is no ale to be had i wash the dust from out my throat with a trickle of cold water i was sitting here as thou camest upon me bethinking myself whether i should break my fast or no i do love to let my hunger grow mightily keen ere i eat for then a dry crust is as good to me as a venison pasty with suet and raisins is to stout king harry i have a sharp hunger upon me now but methinks in a short while it will ripen to a right mellow appetite  now in good sooth quoth merry robin laughing thou hast a quaint tongue betwixt thy teeth but hast thou truly nought but a dry crust about thee methinks thy bags and pouches are fat and lusty for such thin fare  why mayhap there is some other cold fare therein said the beggar slyly  and hast thou nought to drink but cold water said robin  never so much as a drop quoth the beggar over beyond yon clump of trees is as sweet a little inn as ever thou hast lifted eyelid upon but i go not thither for they have a nasty way with me once when the good prior of emmet was dining there the landlady set a dear little tart of stewed crabs and barley sugar upon the window sill to cool and seeing it there and fearing it might be lost i took it with me till that i could find the owner thereof ever since then they have acted very ill toward me yet truth bids me say that they have the best ale there that ever rolled over my tongue  at this robin laughed aloud marry quoth he they did ill toward thee for thy kindness but tell me truly what hast thou in thy pouches  why quoth the beggar peeping into the mouths of his bags i find here a goodly piece of pigeon pie wrapped in a cabbage leaf to hold the gravy here i behold a dainty streaked piece of brawn and here a fair lump of white bread here i find four oaten cakes and a cold knuckle of ham ha in sooth tis strange but here i behold six eggs that must have come by accident from some poultry yard hereabouts they are raw but roasted upon the coals and spread with a piece of butter that i see  peace good friend cried robin holding up his hand thou makest my poor stomach quake with joy for what thou tellest me so sweetly if thou wilt give me to eat i will straightway hie me to that little inn thou didst tell of but now and will bring a skin of ale for thy drinking and mine  friend thou hast said enough said the beggar getting down from the stile i will feast thee with the best that i have and bless saint cedric for thy company but sweet chuck i prythee bring three quarts of ale at least one for thy drinking and two for mine for my thirst is such that methinks i can drink ale as the sands of the river dee drink salt water  so robin straightway left the beggar who upon his part went to a budding lime bush back of the hedge and there spread his feast upon the grass and roasted his eggs upon a little fagot fire with a deftness gained by long labor in that line after a while back came robin bearing a goodly skin of ale upon his shoulder which he laid upon the grass then looking upon the feast spread upon the groundand a fair sight it was to look uponhe slowly rubbed his hand over his stomach for to his hungry eyes it seemed the fairest sight that he had beheld in all his life  friend said the beggar let me feel the weight of that skin  yea truly quoth robin help thyself sweet chuck and meantime let me see whether thy pigeon pie is fresh or no  so the one seized upon the ale and the other upon the pigeon pie and nothing was heard for a while but the munching of food and the gurgle of ale as it left the skin  at last after a long time had passed thus robin pushed the food from him and heaved a great sigh of deep content for he felt as though he had been made all over anew  and now good friend quoth he leaning upon one elbow i would have at thee about that other matter of seriousness of which i spoke not long since  how said the beggar reproachfully thou wouldst surely not talk of things appertaining to serious affairs upon such ale as this  nay quoth robin laughing i would not check thy thirst sweet friend drink while i talk to thee thus it is i would have thee know that i have taken a liking to thy craft and would fain have a taste of a beggars life mine own self  said the beggar i marvel not that thou hast taken a liking to my manner of life good fellow but to like and to do are two matters of different sorts i tell thee friend one must serve a long apprenticeship ere one can learn to be even so much as a clapperdudgeon much less a crank or an abrahamman3 i tell thee lad thou art too old to enter upon that which it may take thee years to catch the hang of       3 classes of traveling mendicants that infested england as      late as the middle of the seventeenth century vide dakkars      english villainies etc  mayhap that may be so quoth robin for i bring to mind that gaffer swanthold sayeth jack shoemaker maketh ill bread tom baker maketh ill shoon nevertheless i have a mind to taste a beggars life and need but the clothing to be as good as any  i tell thee fellow said the beggar if thou wert clad as sweetly as good saint wynten the patron of our craft thou wouldst never make a beggar marry the first jolly traveler that thou wouldst meet would beat thee to a pudding for thrusting thy nose into a craft that belongeth not to thee  nevertheless quoth robin i would have a try at it and methinks i shall change clothes with thee for thy garb seemeth to be pretty not to say gay so not only will i change clothes but i will give thee two golden angels to boot i have brought my stout staff with me thinking that i might have to rap some one of the brethren of thy cloth over the head by way of argument in this matter but i love thee so much for the feast thou hast given me that i would not lift even my little finger against thee so thou needst not have a crumb of fear  to this the beggar listened with his knuckles resting against his hips and when robin had ended he cocked his head on one side and thrust his tongue into his cheek  marry come up quoth he at last lift thy finger against me forsooth art thou out of thy wits man my name is riccon hazel and i come from holywell in flintshire over by the river dee i tell thee knave i have cracked the head of many a better man than thou art and even now i would scald thy crown for thee but for the ale thou hast given me now thou shalt not have so much as one tagrag of my coat even could it save thee from hanging  now fellow said robin it would ill suit me to spoil thy pretty head for thee but i tell thee plainly that but for this feast i would do that to thee would stop thy traveling the country for many a day to come keep thy lips shut lad or thy luck will tumble out of thy mouth with thy speech  now out and alas for thee man for thou hast bred thyself ill this day cried the beggar rising and taking up his staff take up thy club and defend thyself fellow for i will not only beat thee but i will take from thee thy money and leave thee not so much as a clipped groat to buy thyself a lump of goose grease to rub thy cracked crown withal so defend thyself i say  then up leaped merry robin and snatched up his staff also take my money if thou canst quoth he i promise freely to give thee every farthing if thou dost touch me and he twirled his staff in his fingers till it whistled again  then the beggar swung his staff also and struck a mighty blow at robin which the yeoman turned three blows the beggar struck yet never one touched so much as a hair of robins head then stout robin saw his chance and ere you could count three riccons staff was over the hedge and riccon himself lay upon the green grass with no more motion than you could find in an empty pudding bag  how now quoth merry robin laughing wilt thou have my hide or my money sweet chuck but to this the other answered never a word then robin seeing his plight and that he was stunned with the blow ran still laughing and brought the skin of ale and poured some of it on the beggars head and some down his throat so that presently he opened his eyes and looked around as though wondering why he lay upon his back  then robin seeing that he had somewhat gathered the wits that had just been rapped out of his head said now good fellow wilt thou change clothes with me or shall i have to tap thee again here are two golden angels if thou wilt give me freely all thy rags and bags and thy cap and things if thou givest them not freely i much fear me i shall have to and he looked up and down his staff  then riccon sat up and rubbed the bump on his crown now out upon it quoth he i did think to drub thee sweetly fellow i know not how it is but i seem as it were to have bought more beer than i can drink if i must give up my clothes i must but first promise me by thy word as a true yeoman that thou wilt take nought from me but my clothes  i promise on the word of a true yeoman quoth robin thinking that the fellow had a few pennies that he would save  thereupon the beggar drew a little knife that hung at his side and ripping up the lining of his coat drew thence ten bright golden pounds which he laid upon the ground beside him with a cunning wink at robin now thou mayst have my clothes and welcome said he and thou mightest have had them in exchange for thine without the cost of a single farthing far less two golden angels  marry quoth robin laughing thou art a sly fellow and i tell thee truly had i known thou hadst so much money by thee maybe thou mightst not have carried it away for i warrant thou didst not come honestly by it  then each stripped off his clothes and put on those of the other and as lusty a beggar was robin hood as eer you could find of a summers day but stout riccon of holywell skipped and leaped and danced for joy of the fair suit of lincoln green that he had so gotten quoth he i am a gayfeathered bird now truly my dear moll peascod would never know me in this dress thou mayst keep the cold pieces of the feast friend for i mean to live well and lustily while my money lasts and my clothes are gay  so he turned and left robin and crossing the stile was gone but robin heard him singing from beyond the hedge as he strode away       for polly is smiling and molly is glad      when the beggar comes in at the door      and jack and dick call him a fine lusty lad      and the hostess runs up a great score       then hey willy waddykin      stay billy waddykin      and let the brown ale flow free flow free      the beggars the man for me  robin listened till the song ended in the distance then he also crossed the stile into the road but turned his toes away from where the beggar had gone the road led up a gentle hill and up the hill robin walked a half score or more of bags dangling about his legs onward he strolled for a long time but other adventure he found not the road was bare of all else but himself as he went kicking up little clouds of dust at each footstep for it was noontide the most peaceful time of all the day next to twilight all the earth was silent in the restfulness of eating time the plowhorses stood in the furrow munching with great bags over their noses holding sweet food the plowman sat under the hedge and the plowboy also and they too were munching each one holding a great piece of bread in one fist and a great piece of cheese in the other  so robin with all the empty road to himself strode along whistling merrily his bags and pouches bobbing and dangling at his thighs at last he came to where a little grassgrown path left the road and passing through a stile and down a hill led into a little dell and on across a rill in the valley and up the hill on the other side till it reached a windmill that stood on the cap of the rise where the wind bent the trees in swaying motion robin looked at the spot and liked it and for no reason but that his fancy led him he took the little path and walked down the grassy sunny slope of the open meadow and so came to the little dingle and ere he knew it upon four lusty fellows that sat with legs outstretched around a goodly feast spread upon the ground  four merry beggars were they and each had slung about his neck a little board that rested upon his breast one board had written upon it i am blind another i am deaf another i am dumb and the fourth pity the lame one but although all these troubles written upon the boards seemed so grievous the four stout fellows sat around feasting as merrily as though cains wife had never opened the pottle that held misfortunes and let them forth like a cloud of flies to pester us  the deaf man was the first to hear robin for he said hark brothers i hear someone coming and the blind man was the first to see him for he said he is an honest man brothers and one of like craft to ourselves then the dumb man called to him in a great voice and said welcome brother come and sit while there is still some of the feast left and a little malmsey in the pottle at this the lame man who had taken off his wooden leg and unstrapped his own leg and was sitting with it stretched out upon the grass so as to rest it made room for robin among them we are glad to see thee brother said he holding out the flask of malmsey  marry quoth robin laughing and weighing the flask in his hands ere he drank methinks it is no more than seemly of you all to be glad to see me seeing that i bring sight to the blind speech to the dumb hearing to the deaf and such a lusty leg to a lame man i drink to your happiness brothers as i may not drink to your health seeing ye are already hale wind and limb  at this all grinned and the blind beggar who was the chief man among them and was the broadest shouldered and most lusty rascal of all smote robin upon the shoulder swearing he was a right merry wag  whence comest thou lad asked the dumb man  why quoth robin i came this morning from sleeping overnight in sherwood  is it even so said the deaf man i would not for all the money we four are carrying to lincoln town sleep one night in sherwood if robin hood caught one of our trade in his woodlands he would methinks clip his ears  methinks he would too quoth robin laughing but what money is this that ye speak of  then up spake the lame man our king peter of york said he hath sent us to lincoln with those moneys that  stay brother hodge quoth the blind man breaking into the talk i would not doubt our brother here but bear in mind we know him not what art thou brother uprightman jurkman clapperdudgeon dommerer or abrahamman  at these words robin looked from one man to the other with mouth agape truly quoth he i trust i am an upright man at least i strive to be but i know not what thou meanest by such jargon brother it were much more seemly methinks if yon dumb man who hath a sweet voice would give us a song  at these words a silence fell on all and after a while the blind man spoke again quoth he thou dost surely jest when thou sayest that thou dost not understand such words answer me this hast thou ever fibbed a chouse quarrons in the rome pad for the loure in his bung4       4 ie in old beggars cant beaten a man or gallant      upon the highway for the money in his purse  dakkars      english villainies  now out upon it quoth robin hood testily an ye make sport of me by pattering such gibberish it will be ill for you all i tell you i have the best part of a mind to crack the heads of all four of you and would do so too but for the sweet malmsey ye have given me brother pass the pottle lest it grow cold  but all the four beggars leaped to their feet when robin had done speaking and the blind man snatched up a heavy knotted cudgel that lay beside him on the grass as did the others likewise then robin seeing that things were like to go ill with him albeit he knew not what all the coil was about leaped to his feet also and catching up his trusty staff clapped his back against the tree and stood upon his guard against them how now cried he twirling his staff betwixt his fingers would you four stout fellows set upon one man stand back ye rascals or i will score your pates till they have as many marks upon them as a pothouse door are ye mad i have done you no harm  thou liest quoth the one who pretended to be blind and who being the lustiest villain was the leader of the others thou liest for thou hast come among us as a vile spy but thine ears have heard too much for thy bodys good and thou goest not forth from this place unless thou goest feet foremost for this day thou shalt die come brothers all together down with him then whirling up his cudgel he rushed upon robin as an angry bull rushes upon a red rag but robin was ready for any happening crick crack he struck two blows as quick as a wink and down went the blind man rolling over and over upon the grass  at this the others bore back and stood at a little distance scowling upon robin come on ye scum cried he merrily here be cakes and ale for all now who will be next served  to this speech the beggars answered never a word but they looked at robin as great blunderbore looked upon stout jack the slayer of giants as though they would fain eat him body and bones nevertheless they did not care to come nigher to him and his terrible staff then seeing them so hesitate robin of a sudden leaped upon them striking even as he leaped down went the dumb man and away flew his cudgel from his hand as he fell at this the others ducked to avoid another blow then taking to their heels scampered the one one way and the other the other as though they had the west winds boots upon their feet robin looked after them laughing and thought that never had he seen so fleet a runner as the lame man but neither of the beggars stopped nor turned around for each felt in his mind the wind of robins cudgel about his ears  then robin turned to the two stout knaves lying upon the ground quoth he these fellows spake somewhat about certain moneys they were taking to lincoln methinks i may find it upon this stout blind fellow who hath as keen sight as eer a trained woodsman in nottingham or yorkshire it were a pity to let sound money stay in the pockets of such thieving knaves so saying he stooped over the burly rascal and searched among his rags and tatters till presently his fingers felt a leathern pouch slung around his body beneath his patched and tattered coat this he stripped away and weighing it in his hands bethought himself that it was mighty heavy it were a sweet thing said he to himself if this were filled with gold instead of copper pence then sitting down upon the grass he opened the pocket and looked into it there he found four round rolls wrapped up in dressed sheepskin one of these rolls he opened then his mouth gaped and his eyes stared i wot as though they would never close again for what did he see but fifty pounds of bright golden money he opened the other pockets and found in each one the same fifty bright newstamped golden pounds quoth robin i have oft heard that the beggars guild was overrich but never did i think that they sent such sums as this to their treasury i shall take it with me for it will be better used for charity and the good of my merry band than in the enriching of such knaves as these so saying he rolled up the money in the sheepskin again and putting it back in the purse he thrust the pouch into his own bosom then taking up the flask of malmsey he held it toward the two fellows lying on the grass and quoth he sweet friends i drink your health and thank you dearly for what ye have so kindly given me this day and so i wish you good den then taking up his staff he left the spot and went merrily on his way  but when the two stout beggars that had been rapped upon the head roused themselves and sat up and when the others had gotten over their fright and come back they were as sad and woebegone as four frogs in dry weather for two of them had cracked crowns their malmsey was all gone and they had not so much as a farthing to cross their palms withal  but after robin left the little dell he strode along merrily singing as he went and so blithe was he and such a stout beggar and withal so fresh and clean that every merry lass he met had a sweet word for him and felt no fear while the very dogs that most times hate the sight of a beggar snuffed at his legs in friendly wise and wagged their tails pleasantly for dogs know an honest man by his smell and an honest man robin wasin his own way  thus he went along till at last he had come to the wayside cross nigh ollerton and being somewhat tired he sat him down to rest upon the grassy bank in front of it it groweth nigh time quoth he to himself that i were getting back again to sherwood yet it would please me well to have one more merry adventure ere i go back again to my jolly band  so he looked up the road and down the road to see who might come until at last he saw someone drawing near riding upon a horse when the traveler came nigh enough for him to see him well robin laughed for a strange enough figure he cut he was a thin wizened man and to look upon him you could not tell whether he was thirty years old or sixty so dried up was he even to skin and bone as for the nag it was as thin as the rider and both looked as though they had been baked in mother huddles oven where folk are dried up so that they live forever  but although robin laughed at the droll sight he knew the wayfarer to be a certain rich corn engrosser of worksop who more than once had bought all the grain in the countryside and held it till it reached even famine prices thus making much money from the needs of poor people and for this he was hated far and near by everyone that knew aught of him  so after a while the corn engrosser came riding up to where robin sat whereupon merry robin stepped straightway forth in all his rags and tatters his bags and pouches dangling about him and laid his hand upon the horses bridle rein calling upon the other to stop  who art thou fellow that doth dare to stop me thus upon the kings highway said the lean man in a dry sour voice  pity a poor beggar quoth robin give me but a farthing to buy me a piece of bread  now out upon thee snarled the other such sturdy rogues as thou art are better safe in the prisons or dancing upon nothing with a hempen collar about the neck than strolling the highways so freely  tut quoth robin how thou talkest thou and i are brothers man do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare do we not make our livings by doing nought of any good do we not both live without touching palm to honest work have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings go to we are brothers i say only thou art rich and i am poor wherefore i prythee once more give me a penny  doss thou prate so to me sirrah cried the corn engrosser in a rage now i will have thee soundly whipped if ever i catch thee in any town where the law can lay hold of thee as for giving thee a penny i swear to thee that i have not so much as a single groat in my purse were robin hood himself to take me he might search me from crown to heel without finding the smallest piece of money upon me i trust i am too sly to travel so nigh to sherwood with money in my pouch and that thief at large in the woods  then merry robin looked up and down as if to see that there was no one nigh and then coming close to the corn engrosser he stood on tiptoe and spake in his ear thinkest thou in sooth that i am a beggar as i seem to be look upon me there is not a grain of dirt upon my hands or my face or my body didst thou ever see a beggar so i tell thee i am as honest a man as thou art look friend here he took the purse of money from his breast and showed to the dazzled eyes of the corn engrosser the bright golden pieces friend these rags serve but to hide an honest rich man from the eyes of robin hood  put up thy money lad cried the other quickly art thou a fool to trust to beggars rags to shield thee from robin hood if he caught thee he would strip thee to the skin for he hates a lusty beggar as he doth a fat priest or those of my kind  is it indeed so quoth robin had i known this mayhap i had not come hereabouts in this garb but i must go forward now as much depends upon my journeying where goest thou friend  i go to grantham said the corn engrosser but i shall lodge tonight at newark if i can get so far upon my way  why i myself am on the way to newark quoth merry robin so that as two honest men are better than one in roads beset by such a fellow as this robin hood i will jog along with thee if thou hast no dislike to my company  why as thou art an honest fellow and a rich fellow said the corn engrosser i mind not thy company but in sooth i have no great fondness for beggars  then forward quoth robin for the day wanes and it will be dark ere we reach newark so off they went the lean horse hobbling along as before and robin running beside albeit he was so quaking with laughter within him that he could hardly stand yet he dared not laugh aloud lest the corn engrosser should suspect something so they traveled along till they reached a hill just on the outskirts of sherwood here the lean man checked his lean horse into a walk for the road was steep and he wished to save his nags strength having far to go ere he reached newark then he turned in his saddle and spake to robin again for the first time since they had left the cross here is thy greatest danger friend said he for here we are nighest to that vile thief robin hood and the place where he dwells beyond this we come again to the open honest country and so are more safe in our journeying  alas quoth robin i would that i had as little money by me as thou hast for this day i fear that robin hood will get every groat of my wealth  then the other looked at robin and winked cunningly quoth he i tell thee friend that i have nigh as much by me as thou hast but it is hidden so that never a knave in sherwood could find it  thou dost surely jest quoth robin how could one hide so much as two hundred pounds upon his person  now as thou art so honest a fellow and withal so much younger than i am i will tell thee that which i have told to no man in all the world before and thus thou mayst learn never again to do such a foolish thing as to trust to beggars garb to guard thee against robin hood seest thou these clogs upon my feet  yea quoth robin laughing truly they are large enough for any man to see even were his sight as foggy as that of peter patter who never could see when it was time to go to work  peace friend said the corn engrosser for this is no matter for jesting the soles of these clogs are not what they seem to be for each one is a sweet little box and by twisting the second nail from the toe the upper of the shoe and part of the sole lifts up like a lid and in the spaces within are fourscore and ten bright golden pounds in each shoe all wrapped in hair to keep them from clinking and so telling tales of themselves  when the corn engrosser had told this robin broke into a roar of laughter and laying his hands upon the bridle rein stopped the sadlooking nag stay good friend quoth he between bursts of merriment thou art the slyest old fox that eer i saw in all my lifein the soles of his shoon quothaif ever i trust a poorseeming man again shave my head and paint it blue a corn factor a horse jockey an estate agent and a jackdaw for cunningness say i and he laughed again till he shook in his shoes with mirth  all this time the corn engrosser had been staring at robin his mouth agape with wonder art thou mad quoth he to talk in this way so loud and in such a place let us forward and save thy mirth till we are safe and sound at newark  nay quoth robin the tears of merriment wet on his cheeks on second thoughts i go no farther than here for i have good friends hereabouts thou mayst go forward if thou dost list thou sweet pretty fellow but thou must go forward barefoot for i am afraid that thy shoon must be left behind off with them friend for i tell thee i have taken a great fancy to them  at these words the corn factor grew pale as a linen napkin who art thou that talkest so said he  then merry robin laughed again and quoth he men hereabouts call me robin hood so sweet friend thou hadst best do my bidding and give me thy shoes wherefore hasten i prythee or else thou wilt not get to fair newark town till after dark  at the sound of the name of robin hood the corn factor quaked with fear so that he had to seize his horse by the mane to save himself from falling off its back then straightway and without more words he stripped off his clogs and let them fall upon the road robin still holding the bridle rein stooped and picked them up then he said sweet friend i am used to ask those that i have dealings with to come and feast at sherwood with me i will not ask thee because of our pleasant journey together for i tell thee there be those in sherwood that would not be so gentle with thee as i have been the name of corn engrosser leaves a nasty taste upon the tongue of all honest men take a fools advice of me and come no more so nigh to sherwood or mayhap some day thou mayst of a sudden find a clothyard shaft betwixt thy ribs so with this i give thee good den hereupon he clapped his hand to the horses flank and off went nag and rider but the mans face was all bedewed with the sweat of fright and never again i wot was he found so close to sherwood forest as he had been this day  robin stood and looked after him and when he was fairly gone turned laughing and entered the forest carrying the shoes in his hand  that night in sweet sherwood the red fires glowed brightly in wavering light on tree and bush and all around sat or lay the stout fellows of the band to hear robin hood and little john tell their adventures all listened closely and again and again the woods rang with shouts of laughter  when all was told friar tuck spoke up good master said he thou hast had a pretty time but still i hold to my saying that the life of the barefoot friar is the merrier of the two  nay quoth will stutely i hold with our master that he hath had the pleasanter doings of the two for he hath had two stout bouts at quarterstaff this day  so some of the band held with robin hood and some with little john as for me i thinkbut i leave it with you to say for yourselves which you hold with     robin hood shoots before queen eleanor  the highroad stretched white and dusty in the hot summer afternoon sun and the trees stood motionless along the roadside all across the meadow lands the hot air danced and quivered and in the limpid waters of the lowland brook spanned by a little stone bridge the fish hung motionless above the yellow gravel and the dragonfly sat quite still perched upon the sharp tip of a spike of the rushes with its wings glistening in the sun  along the road a youth came riding upon a fair milkwhite barb and the folk that he passed stopped and turned and looked after him for never had so lovely a lad or one so gaily clad been seen in nottingham before he could not have been more than sixteen years of age and was as fair as any maiden his long yellow hair flowed behind him as he rode along all clad in silk and velvet with jewels flashing and dagger jingling against the pommel of the saddle thus came the queens page young richard partington from famous london town down into nottinghamshire upon her majestys bidding to seek robin hood in sherwood forest  the road was hot and dusty and his journey had been long for that day he had come all the way from leicester town a good twenty miles and more wherefore young partington was right glad when he saw before him a sweet little inn all shady and cool beneath the trees in front of the door of which a sign hung pendant bearing the picture of a blue boar here he drew rein and called loudly for a pottle of rhenish wine to be brought him for stout country ale was too coarse a drink for this young gentleman five lusty fellows sat upon the bench beneath the pleasant shade of the widespreading oak in front of the inn door drinking ale and beer and all stared amain at this fair and gallant lad two of the stoutest of them were clothed in lincoln green and a great heavy oaken staff leaned against the gnarled oak tree trunk beside each fellow  the landlord came and brought a pottle of wine and a long narrow glass upon a salver which he held up to the page as he sat upon his horse young partington poured forth the bright yellow wine and holding the glass aloft cried here is to the health and long happiness of my royal mistress the noble queen eleanor and may my journey and her desirings soon have end and i find a certain stout yeoman men call robin hood  at these words all stared but presently the two stout yeomen in lincoln green began whispering together then one of the two whom partington thought to be the tallest and stoutest fellow he had ever beheld spoke up and said what seekest thou of robin hood sir page and what does our good queen eleanor wish of him i ask this of thee not foolishly but with reason for i know somewhat of this stout yeoman  an thou knowest aught of him good fellow said young partington thou wilt do great service to him and great pleasure to our royal queen by aiding me to find him  then up spake the other yeoman who was a handsome fellow with sunburned face and nutbrown curling hair thou hast an honest look sir page and our queen is kind and true to all stout yeomen methinks i and my friend here might safely guide thee to robin hood for we know where he may be found yet i tell thee plainly we would not for all merry england have aught of harm befall him  set thy mind at ease i bring nought of ill with me quoth richard partington i bring a kind message to him from our queen therefore an ye know where he is to be found i pray you to guide me thither  then the two yeomen looked at one another again and the tall man said surely it were safe to do this thing will whereat the other nodded thereupon both arose and the tall yeoman said we think thou art true sir page and meanest no harm therefore we will guide thee to robin hood as thou dost wish  then partington paid his score and the yeomen coming forward they all straightway departed upon their way   under the greenwood tree in the cool shade that spread all around upon the sward with flickering lights here and there robin hood and many of his band lay upon the soft green grass while allan a dale sang and played upon his sweetly sounding harp all listened in silence for young allans singing was one of the greatest joys in all the world to them but as they so listened there came of a sudden the sound of a horses feet and presently little john and will stutely came forth from the forest path into the open glade young richard partington riding between them upon his milkwhite horse the three came toward where robin hood sat all the band staring with might and main for never had they seen so gay a sight as this young page nor one so richly clad in silks and velvets and gold and jewels then robin arose and stepped forth to meet him and partington leaped from his horse and doffing his cap of crimson velvet met robin as he came now welcome cried robin now welcome fair youth and tell me i prythee what bringeth one of so fair a presence and clad in such noble garb to our poor forest of sherwood  then young partington said if i err not thou art the famous robin hood and these thy stout band of outlawed yeomen to thee i bring greetings from our noble queen eleanor oft hath she heard thee spoken of and thy merry doings hereabouts and fain would she behold thy face therefore she bids me tell thee that if thou wilt presently come to london town she will do all in her power to guard thee against harm and will send thee back safe to sherwood forest again four days hence in finsbury fields our good king henry of great renown holdeth a grand shooting match and all the most famous archers of merry england will be thereat our queen would fain see thee strive with these knowing that if thou wilt come thou wilt with little doubt carry off the prize therefore she hath sent me with this greeting and furthermore sends thee as a sign of great good will this golden ring from off her own fair thumb which i give herewith into thy hands  then robin hood bowed his head and taking the ring kissed it right loyally and then slipped it upon his little finger quoth he sooner would i lose my life than this ring and ere it departs from me my hand shall be cold in death or stricken off at the wrist fair sir page i will do our queens bidding and will presently hie with thee to london but ere we go i will feast thee here in the woodlands with the very best we have  it may not be said the page we have no time to tarry therefore get thyself ready straightway and if there be any of thy band that thou wouldst take with thee our queen bids me say that she will make them right welcome likewise  truly thou art right quoth robin and we have but short time to stay therefore i will get me ready presently i will choose three of my men only to go with me and these three shall be little john mine own true righthand man will scarlet my cousin and allan a dale my minstrel go lads and get ye ready straightway and we will presently off with all speed that we may thou will stutely shall be the chief of the band while i am gone  then little john and will scarlet and allan a dale ran leaping full of joy to make themselves ready while robin also prepared himself for the journey after a while they all four came forth and a right fair sight they made for robin was clad in blue from head to foot and little john and will scarlet in good lincoln green and as for allan a dale he was dressed in scarlet from the crown of his head to the toes of his pointed shoes each man wore beneath his cap a little head covering of burnished steel set with rivets of gold and underneath his jerkin a coat of linked mail as fine as carded wool yet so tough that no arrow could pierce it then seeing all were ready young partington mounted his horse again and the yeomen having shaken hands all around the five departed upon their way  that night they took up their inn in melton mowbray in leicestershire and the next night they lodged at kettering in northamptonshire and the next at bedford town and the next at st albans in hertfordshire this place they left not long after the middle of the night and traveling fast through the tender dawning of the summer day when the dews lay shining on the meadows and faint mists hung in the dales when the birds sang their sweetest and the cobwebs beneath the hedges glimmered like fairy cloth of silver they came at last to the towers and walls of famous london town while the morn was still young and all golden toward the east  queen eleanor sat in her royal bower through the open casements of which poured the sweet yellow sunshine in great floods of golden light all about her stood her ladiesinwaiting chatting in low voices while she herself sat dreamily where the mild air came softly drifting into the room laden with the fresh perfumes of the sweet red roses that bloomed in the great garden beneath the wall to her came one who said that her page richard partington and four stout yeomen waited her pleasure in the court below then queen eleanor arose joyously and bade them be straightway shown into her presence  thus robin hood and little john and will scarlet and allan a dale came before the queen into her own royal bower then robin kneeled before the queen with his hands folded upon his breast saying in simple phrase here am i robin hood thou didst bid me come and lo i do thy bidding i give myself to thee as thy true servant and will do thy commanding even if it be to the shedding of the last drop of my lifes blood  but good queen eleanor smiled pleasantly upon him bidding him to arise then she made them all be seated to rest themselves after their long journey rich food was brought them and noble wines and she had her own pages to wait upon the wants of the yeomen at last after they had eaten all they could she began questioning them of their merry adventures then they told her all of the lusty doings herein spoken of and among others that concerning the bishop of hereford and sir richard of the lea and how the bishop had abided three days in sherwood forest at this the queen and the ladies about her laughed again and again for they pictured to themselves the stout bishop abiding in the forest and ranging the woods in lusty sport with robin and his band then when they had told all that they could bring to mind the queen asked allan to sing to her for his fame as a minstrel had reached even to the court at london town so straightway allan took up his harp in his hand and without more asking touched the strings lightly till they all rang sweetly then he sang thus       gentle river gentle river      bright thy crystal waters flow      sliding where the aspens shiver      gliding where the lilies blow       singing over pebbled shallows      kissing blossoms bending low      breaking neath the dipping swallows      purpling where the breezes blow       floating on thy breast forever      down thy current i could glide      grief and pain should reach me never      on thy bright and gentle tide       so my aching heart seeks thine love      there to find its rest and peace      for through loving bliss is mine love      and my many troubles cease  thus allan sang and as he sang all eyes dwelled upon him and not a sound broke the stillness and even after he had done the silence hung for a short space so the time passed till the hour drew nigh for the holding of the great archery match in finsbury fields  a gay sight were famous finsbury fields on that bright and sunny morning of lusty summertime along the end of the meadow stood the booths for the different bands of archers for the kings yeomen were divided into companies of fourscore men and each company had a captain over it so on the bright greensward stood ten booths of striped canvas a booth for each band of the royal archers and at the peak of each fluttered a flag in the mellow air and the flag was the color that belonged to the captain of each band from the center booth hung the yellow flag of tepus the famous bow bearer of the king next to it on one hand was the blue flag of gilbert of the white hand and on the other the bloodred pennant of stout young clifton of buckinghamshire the seven other archer captains were also men of great renown among them were egbert of kent and william of southampton but those first named were most famous of all the noise of many voices in talk and laughter came from within the booths and in and out ran the attendants like ants about an anthill some bore ale and beer and some bundles of bowstrings or sheaves of arrows on each side of the archery range were rows upon rows of seats reaching high aloft and in the center of the north side was a raised dais for the king and queen shaded by canvas of gay colors and hung about with streaming silken pennants of red and blue and green and white as yet the king and queen had not come but all the other benches were full of people rising head above head high aloft till it made the eye dizzy to look upon them eightscore yards distant from the mark from which the archers were to shoot stood ten fair targets each target marked by a flag of the color belonging to the band that was to shoot thereat so all was ready for the coming of the king and queen  at last a great blast of bugles sounded and into the meadow came riding six trumpeters with silver trumpets from which hung velvet banners heavy with rich workings of silver and gold thread behind these came stout king henry upon a dapplegray stallion with his queen beside him upon a milkwhite palfrey on either side of them walked the yeomen of the guard the bright sunlight flashing from the polished blades of the steel halberds they carried behind these came the court in a great crowd so that presently all the lawn was alive with bright colors with silk and velvet with waving plumes and gleaming gold with flashing jewels and sword hilts a gallant sight on that bright summer day  then all the people arose and shouted so that their voices sounded like the storm upon the cornish coast when the dark waves run upon the shore and leap and break surging amid the rocks so amid the roaring and the surging of the people and the waving of scarfs and kerchiefs the king and queen came to their place and getting down from their horses mounted the broad stairs that led to the raised platform and there took their seats on two thrones bedecked with purple silks and cloths of silver and of gold  when all was quiet a bugle sounded and straightway the archers came marching in order from their tents fortyscore they were in all as stalwart a band of yeomen as could be found in all the wide world so they came in orderly fashion and stood in front of the dais where king henry and his queen sat king henry looked up and down their ranks right proudly for his heart warmed within him at the sight of such a gallant band of yeomen then he bade his herald sir hugh de mowbray stand forth and proclaim the rules governing the game so sir hugh stepped to the edge of the platform and spoke in a loud clear voice and thus he said  that each man should shoot seven arrows at the target that belonged to his band and of the fourscore yeomen of each band the three that shot the best should be chosen these three should shoot three arrows apiece and the one that shot the best should again be chosen then each of these should again shoot three arrows apiece and the one that shot the best should have the first prize the one that shot the next best should have the second and the one that shot the next best should have the third prize each of the others should have fourscore silver pennies for his shooting the first prize was to be twoscore and ten golden pounds a silver bugle horn inlaid with gold and a quiver with ten white arrows tipped with gold and feathered with the white swanswing therein the second prize was to be fivescore of the fattest bucks that run on dallen lea to be shot when the yeoman that won them chose the third prize was to be two tuns of good rhenish wine  so sir hugh spoke and when he had done all the archers waved their bows aloft and shouted then each band turned and marched in order back to its place  and now the shooting began the captains first taking stand and speeding their shafts and then making room for the men who shot each in turn after them two hundred and eighty score shafts were shot in all and so deftly were they sped that when the shooting was done each target looked like the back of a hedgehog when the farm dog snuffs at it a long time was taken in this shooting and when it was over the judges came forward looked carefully at the targets and proclaimed in a loud voice which three had shot the best from the separate bands then a great hubbub of voices arose each man among the crowd that looked on calling for his favorite archer then ten fresh targets were brought forward and every sound was hushed as the archers took their places once more  this time the shooting was more speedily done for only nine shafts were shot by each band not an arrow missed the targets but in that of gilbert of the white hand five arrows were in the small white spot that marked the center of these five three were sped by gilbert then the judges came forward again and looking at the targets called aloud the names of the archer chosen as the best bowman of each band of these gilbert of the white hand led for six of the ten arrows he had shot had lodged in the center but stout tepus and young clifton trod close upon his heels yet the others stood a fair chance for the second or third place  and now amid the roaring of the crowd those ten stout fellows that were left went back to their tents to rest for a while and change their bowstrings for nought must fail at this next round and no hand must tremble or eye grow dim because of weariness  then while the deep buzz and hum of talking sounded all around like the noise of the wind in the leafy forest queen eleanor turned to the king and quoth she thinkest thou that these yeomen so chosen are the very best archers in all merry england  yea truly said the king smiling for he was well pleased with the sport that he had seen and i tell thee that not only are they the best archers in all merry england but in all the wide world beside  but what wouldst thou say quoth queen eleanor if i were to find three archers to match the best three yeomen of all thy guard  i would say thou hast done what i could not do said the king laughing for i tell thee there lives not in all the world three archers to match tepus and gilbert and clifton of buckinghamshire  now said the queen i know of three yeomen and in truth i have seen them not long since that i would not fear to match against any three that thou canst choose from among all thy fortyscore archers and moreover i will match them here this very day but i will only match them with thy archers providing that thou wilt grant a free pardon to all that may come in my behalf  at this the king laughed loud and long truly said he thou art taking up with strange matters for a queen if thou wilt bring those three fellows that thou speakest of i will promise faithfully to give them free pardon for forty days to come or to go wheresoever they please nor will i harm a hair of their heads in all that time moreover if these that thou bringest shoot better than my yeomen man for man they shall have the prizes for themselves according to their shooting but as thou hast so taken up of a sudden with sports of this kind hast thou a mind for a wager  why in sooth said queen eleanor laughing i know nought of such matters but if thou hast a mind to do somewhat in that way i will strive to pleasure thee what wilt thou wager upon thy men  then the merry king laughed again for he dearly loved goodly jest so he said amidst his laughter i will wager thee ten tuns of rhenish wine ten tuns of the stoutest ale and tenscore bows of tempered spanish yew with quivers and arrows to match  all that stood around smiled at this for it seemed a merry wager for a king to give to a queen but queen eleanor bowed her head quietly i will take thy wager said she for i know right well where to place those things that thou hast spoken of now who will be on my side in this matter and she looked around upon them that stood about but no one spake or cared to wager upon the queens side against such archers as tepus and gilbert and clifton then the queen spoke again now who will back me in this wager wilt thou my lord bishop of hereford  nay quoth the bishop hastily it ill befits one of my cloth to deal in such matters moreover there are no such archers as his majestys in all the world therefore i would but lose my money  methinks the thought of thy gold weigheth more heavily with thee than the wrong to thy cloth said the queen smiling and at this a ripple of laughter went around for everyone knew how fond the bishop was of his money then the queen turned to a knight who stood near whose name was sir robert lee wilt thou back me in this manner said she thou art surely rich enough to risk so much for the sake of a lady  to pleasure my queen i will do it said sir robert lee but for the sake of no other in all the world would i wager a groat for no man can stand against tepus and gilbert and clifton  then turning to the king queen eleanor said i want no such aid as sir robert giveth me but against thy wine and beer and stout bows of yew i wager this girdle all set with jewels from around my waist and surely that is worth more than thine  now i take thy wager quoth the king send for thy archers straightway but here come forth the others let them shoot and then i will match those that win against all the world  so be it said the queen thereupon beckoning to young richard partington she whispered something in his ear and straightway the page bowed and left the place crossing the meadow to the other side of the range where he was presently lost in the crowd at this all that stood around whispered to one another wondering what it all meant and what three men the queen was about to set against those famous archers of the kings guard  and now the ten archers of the kings guard took their stand again and all the great crowd was hushed to the stillness of death slowly and carefully each man shot his shafts and so deep was the silence that you could hear every arrow rap against the target as it struck it then when the last shaft had sped a great roar went up and the shooting i wot was well worthy of the sound once again gilbert had lodged three arrows in the white tepus came second with two in the white and one in the black ring next to it but stout clifton had gone down and hubert of suffolk had taken the third place for while both those two good yeomen had lodged two in the white clifton had lost one shot upon the fourth ring and hubert came in with one in the third  all the archers around gilberts booth shouted for joy till their throats were hoarse tossing their caps aloft and shaking hands with one another  in the midst of all the noise and hubbub five men came walking across the lawn toward the kings pavilion the first was richard partington and was known to most folk there but the others were strange to everybody beside young partington walked a yeoman clad in blue and behind came three others two in lincoln green and one in scarlet this last yeoman carried three stout bows of yew tree two fancifully inlaid with silver and one with gold while these five men came walking across the meadow a messenger came running from the kings booth and summoned gilbert and tepus and hubert to go with him and now the shouting quickly ceased for all saw that something unwonted was toward so the folk stood up in their places and leaned forward to see what was the ado  when partington and the others came before the spot where the king and queen sat the four yeomen bent their knees and doffed their caps unto her king henry leaned far forward and stared at them closely but the bishop of hereford when he saw their faces started as though stung by a wasp he opened his mouth as though about to speak but looking up he saw the queen gazing at him with a smile upon her lips so he said nothing but bit his nether lip while his face was as red as a cherry  then the queen leaned forward and spake in a clear voice locksley said she i have made a wager with the king that thou and two of thy men can outshoot any three that he can send against you wilt thou do thy best for my sake  yea quoth robin hood to whom she spake i will do my best for thy sake and if i fail i make my vow never to finger bowstring more  now although little john had been somewhat abashed in the queens bower he felt himself the sturdy fellow he was when the soles of his feet pressed green grass again so he said boldly now blessings on thy sweet face say i an there lived a man that would not do his best for theei will say nought only i would like to have the cracking of his knaves pate  peace little john said robin hood hastily in a low voice but good queen eleanor laughed aloud and a ripple of merriment sounded all over the booth  the bishop of hereford did not laugh neither did the king but he turned to the queen and quoth he who are these men that thou hast brought before us  then up spoke the bishop hastily for he could hold his peace no longer your majesty quoth he yon fellow in blue is a certain outlawed thief of the midcountry named robin hood yon tall strapping villain goeth by the name of little john the other fellow in green is a certain backsliding gentleman known as will scarlet the man in red is a rogue of a northern minstrel named allan a dale  at this speech the kings brows drew together blackly and he turned to the queen is this true said he sternly  yea said the queen smiling the bishop hath told the truth and truly he should know them well for he and two of his friars spent three days in merry sport with robin hood in sherwood forest i did little think that the good bishop would so betray his friends but bear in mind that thou hast pledged thy promise for the safety of these good yeomen for forty days  i will keep my promise said the king in a deep voice that showed the anger in his heart but when these forty days are gone let this outlaw look to himself for mayhap things will not go so smoothly with him as he would like then he turned to his archers who stood near the sherwood yeomen listening and wondering at all that passed quoth he gilbert and thou tepus and thou hubert i have pledged myself that ye shall shoot against these three fellows if ye outshoot the knaves i will fill your caps with silver pennies if ye fail ye shall lose your prizes that ye have won so fairly and they go to them that shoot against you man to man do your best lads and if ye win this bout ye shall be glad of it to the last days of your life go now and get you gone to the butts  then the three archers of the king turned and went back to their booths and robin and his men went to their places at the mark from which they were to shoot then they strung their bows and made themselves ready looking over their quivers of arrows and picking out the roundest and the best feathered  but when the kings archers went to their tents they told their friends all that had passed and how that these four men were the famous robin hood and three of his band to wit little john will scarlet and allan a dale the news of this buzzed around among the archers in the booths for there was not a man there that had not heard of these great midcountry yeomen from the archers the news was taken up by the crowd that looked on at the shooting so that at last everybody stood up craning their necks to catch sight of the famous outlaws  six fresh targets were now set up one for each man that was to shoot whereupon gilbert and tepus and hubert came straightway forth from the booths then robin hood and gilbert of the white hand tossed a farthing aloft to see who should lead in the shooting and the lot fell to gilberts side thereupon he called upon hubert of suffolk to lead  hubert took his place planted his foot firmly and fitted a fair smooth arrow then breathing upon his fingertips he drew the string slowly and carefully the arrow sped true and lodged in the white again he shot and again he hit the clout a third shaft he sped but this time failed of the center and but struck the black yet not more than a fingersbreadth from the white at this a shout went up for it was the best shooting that hubert had yet done that day  merry robin laughed and quoth he thou wilt have an ill time bettering that round will for it is thy turn next brace thy thews lad and bring not shame upon sherwood  then will scarlet took his place but because of overcaution he spoiled his target with the very first arrow that he sped for he hit the next ring to the black the second from the center at this robin bit his lips lad lad quoth he hold not the string so long have i not often told thee what gaffer swanthold sayeth that overcaution spilleth the milk to this will scarlet took heed so the next arrow he shot lodged fairly in the center ring again he shot and again he smote the center but for all that stout hubert had outshot him and showed the better target then all those that looked on clapped their hands for joy because that hubert had overcome the stranger  quoth the king grimly to the queen if thy archers shoot no better than that thou art like to lose thy wager lady but queen eleanor smiled for she looked for better things from robin hood and little john  and now tepus took his place to shoot he also took overheed to what he was about and so he fell into will scarlets error the first arrow he struck into the center ring but the second missed its mark and smote the black the last arrow was tipped with luck for it smote the very center of the clout upon the black spot that marked it quoth robin hood that is the sweetest shot that hath been sped this day but nevertheless friend tepus thy cake is burned methinks little john it is thy turn next  so little john took his place as bidden and shot his three arrows quickly he never lowered his bow arm in all the shooting but fitted each shaft with his longbow raised yet all three of his arrows smote the center within easy distance of the black at this no sound of shouting was heard for although it was the best shooting that had been done that day the folk of london town did not like to see the stout tepus overcome by a fellow from the countryside even were he as famous as little john  and now stout gilbert of the white hand took his place and shot with the greatest care and again for the third time in one day he struck all three shafts into the clout  well done gilbert quoth robin hood smiting him upon the shoulder i make my vow thou art one of the best archers that ever mine eyes beheld thou shouldst be a free and merry ranger like us lad for thou art better fitted for the greenwood than for the cobblestones and gray walls of london town so saying he took his place and drew a fair round arrow from his quiver which he turned over and over ere he fitted it to his bowstring  then the king muttered in his beard now blessed saint hubert if thou wilt but jog that rogues elbow so as to make him smite even the second ring i will give eightscore waxen candles three fingersbreadth in thickness to thy chapel nigh matching but it may be saint huberts ears were stuffed with tow for he seemed not to hear the kings prayer this day  having gotten three shafts to his liking merry robin looked carefully to his bowstring ere he shot yea quoth he to gilbert who stood nigh him to watch his shooting thou shouldst pay us a visit at merry sherwood here he drew the bowstring to his ear in londonhere he loosed his shaftthou canst find nought to shoot at but rooks and daws there one can tickle the ribs of the noblest stags in england so he shot even while he talked yet the shaft lodged not more than half an inch from the very center  by my soul cried gilbert art thou the devil in blue to shoot in that wise  nay quoth robin laughing not quite so ill as that i trust and he took up another shaft and fitted it to the string again he shot and again he smote his arrow close beside the center a third time he loosed his bowstring and dropped his arrow just betwixt the other two and into the very center so that the feathers of all three were ruffled together seeming from a distance to be one thick shaft  and now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd for never before had london seen such shooting as this and never again would it see it after robin hoods day had gone all saw that the kings archers were fairly beaten and stout gilbert clapped his palm to robins owning that he could never hope to draw such a bowstring as robin hood or little john but the king full of wrath would not have it so though he knew in his mind that his men could not stand against those fellows nay cried he clenching his hands upon the arms of his seat gilbert is not yet beaten did he not strike the clout thrice although i have lost my wager he hath not yet lost the first prize they shall shoot again and still again till either he or that knave robin hood cometh off the best go thou sir hugh and bid them shoot another round and another until one or the other is overcome then sir hugh seeing how wroth the king was said never a word but went straightway to do his bidding so he came to where robin hood and the other stood and told them what the king had said  with all my heart quoth merry robin i will shoot from this time till tomorrow day if it can pleasure my most gracious lord and king take thy place gilbert lad and shoot  so gilbert took his place once more but this time he failed for a sudden little wind arising his shaft missed the center ring but by not more than the breadth of a barley straw  thy eggs are cracked gilbert quoth robin laughing and straightway he loosed a shaft and once more smote the white circle of the center  then the king arose from his place and not a word said he but he looked around with a baleful look and it would have been an ill day for anyone that he saw with a joyous or a merry look upon his face then he and his queen and all the court left the place but the kings heart was brimming full of wrath  after the king had gone all the yeomen of the archer guard came crowding around robin and little john and will and allan to snatch a look at these famous fellows from the midcountry and with them came many that had been onlookers at the sport for the same purpose thus it happened presently that the yeomen to whom gilbert stood talking were all surrounded by a crowd of people that formed a ring about them  after a while the three judges that had the giving away of the prizes came forward and the chief of them all spake to robin and said according to agreement the first prize belongeth rightly to thee so here i give thee the silver bugle here the quiver of ten golden arrows and here a purse of twoscore and ten golden pounds and as he spake he handed those things to robin and then turned to little john to thee he said belongeth the second prize to wit fivescore of the finest harts that run on dallen lea thou mayest shoot them whensoever thou dost list last of all he turned to stout hubert thou said he hast held thine own against the yeomen with whom thou didst shoot and so thou hast kept the prize duly thine to wit two tuns of good rhenish wine these shall be delivered to thee whensoever thou dost list then he called upon the other seven of the kings archers who had last shot and gave each fourscore silver pennies  then up spake robin and quoth he this silver bugle i keep in honor of this shooting match but thou gilbert art the best archer of all the kings guard and to thee i freely give this purse of gold take it man and would it were ten times as much for thou art a right yeoman good and true furthermore to each of the ten that last shot i give one of these golden shafts apiece keep them always by you so that ye may tell your grandchildren an ye are ever blessed with them that ye are the very stoutest yeomen in all the wide world  at this all shouted aloud for it pleased them to hear robin speak so of them  then up spake little john good friend tepus said he i want not those harts of dallen lea that yon stout judge spoke of but now for in truth we have enow and more than enow in our own country twoscore and ten i give to thee for thine own shooting and five i give to each band for their pleasure  at this another great shout went up and many tossed their caps aloft and swore among themselves that no better fellows ever walked the sod than robin hood and his stout yeomen  while they so shouted with loud voices a tall burly yeoman of the kings guard came forward and plucked robin by the sleeve good master quoth he i have somewhat to tell thee in thine ear a silly thing god wot for one stout yeoman to tell another but a young peacock of a page one richard partington was seeking thee without avail in the crowd and not being able to find thee told me that he bore a message to thee from a certain lady that thou wottest of this message he bade me tell thee privily word for word and thus it was let me seei trust i have forgot it notyea thus it was the lion growls beware thy head  is it so quoth robin starting for he knew right well that it was the queen sent the message and that she spake of the kings wrath now i thank thee good fellow for thou hast done me greater service than thou knowest of this day then he called his three yeomen together and told them privately that they had best be jogging as it was like to be ill for them so nigh merry london town so without tarrying longer they made their way through the crowd until they had come out from the press then without stopping they left london town and started away northward     the chase of robin hood  so robin hood and the others left the archery range at finsbury fields and tarrying not set forth straightway upon their homeward journey it was well for them that they did so for they had not gone more than three or four miles upon their way when six of the yeomen of the kings guard came bustling among the crowd that still lingered seeking for robin and his men to seize upon them and make them prisoners truly it was an illdone thing in the king to break his promise but it all came about through the bishop of herefords doing for thus it happened  after the king left the archery ground he went straightway to his cabinet and with him went the bishop of hereford and sir robert lee but the king said never a word to these two but sat gnawing his nether lip for his heart was galled within him by what had happened at last the bishop of hereford spoke in a low sorrowful voice it is a sad thing your majesty that this knavish outlaw should be let to escape in this wise for let him but get back to sherwood forest safe and sound and he may snap his fingers at king and kings men  at these words the king raised his eyes and looked grimly upon the bishop sayst thou so quoth he now i will show thee in good time how much thou dost err for when the forty days are past and gone i will seize upon this thieving outlaw if i have to tear down all of sherwood to find him thinkest thou that the laws of the king of england are to be so evaded by one poor knave without friends or money  then the bishop spoke again in his soft smooth voice  forgive my boldness your majesty and believe that i have nought but the good of england and your majestys desirings at heart but what would it boot though my gracious lord did root up every tree of sherwood are there not other places for robin hoods hiding cannock chase is not far from sherwood and the great forest of arden is not far from cannock chase beside these are many other woodlands in nottingham and derby lincoln and york amid any of which your majesty might as well think to seize upon robin hood as to lay finger upon a rat among the dust and broken things of a garret nay my gracious lord if he doth once plant foot in the woodland he is lost to the law forever  at these words the king tapped his fingertips upon the table beside him with vexation what wouldst thou have me do bishop quoth he didst thou not hear me pledge my word to the queen thy talk is as barren as the wind from the bellows upon dead coals  far be it from me said the cunning bishop to point the way to one so clearsighted as your majesty but were i the king of england i should look upon the matter in this wise i have promised my queen let us say that for forty days the cunningest rogue in all england shall have freedom to come and go but lo i find this outlaw in my grasp shall i then foolishly cling to a promise so hastily given suppose that i had promised to do her majestys bidding whereupon she bade me to slay myself should i then shut mine eyes and run blindly upon my sword thus would i argue within myself moreover i would say unto myself a woman knoweth nought of the great things appertaining to state government and likewise i know a woman is ever prone to take up a fancy even as she would pluck a daisy from the roadside and then throw it away when the savor is gone therefore though she hath taken a fancy to this outlaw it will soon wane away and be forgotten as for me i have the greatest villain in all england in my grasp shall i then open my hand and let him slip betwixt my fingers thus your majesty would i say to myself were i the king of england so the bishop talked and the king lent his ear to his evil counsel until after a while he turned to sir robert lee and bade him send six of the yeomen of the guard to take robin hood and his three men prisoners  now sir robert lee was a gentle and noble knight and he felt grieved to the heart to see the king so break his promise nevertheless he said nothing for he saw how bitterly the king was set against robin hood but he did not send the yeomen of the guard at once but went first to the queen and told her all that had passed and bade her send word to robin of his danger this he did not for the wellbeing of robin hood but because he would save his lords honor if he could thus it came about that when after a while the yeomen of the guard went to the archery field they found not robin and the others and so got no cakes at that fair  the afternoon was already wellnigh gone when robin hood little john will and allan set forth upon their homeward way trudging along merrily through the yellow slanting light which speedily changed to rosy red as the sun sank low in the heavens the shadows grew long and finally merged into the grayness of the mellow twilight the dusty highway lay all white betwixt the dark hedgerows and along it walked four fellows like four shadows the pat of their feet sounding loud and their voices as they talked ringing clear upon the silence of the air the great round moon was floating breathlessly up in the eastern sky when they saw before them the twinkling lights of barnet town some ten or twelve miles from london down they walked through the stony streets and past the cosy houses with overhanging gables before the doors of which sat the burghers and craftsmen in the mellow moonlight with their families about them and so came at last on the other side of the hamlet to a little inn all shaded with roses and woodbines before this inn robin hood stopped for the spot pleased him well quoth he here will we take up our inn and rest for the night for we are well away from london town and our kings wrath moreover if i mistake not we will find sweet faring within what say ye lads  in sooth good master quoth little john thy bidding and my doing ever fit together like cakes and ale let us in i say also  then up spake will scarlet i am ever ready to do what thou sayest uncle yet i could wish that we were farther upon our way ere we rest for the night nevertheless if thou thinkest best let us in for the night say i also  so in they went and called for the best that the place afforded then a right good feast was set before them with two stout bottles of old sack to wash it down withal these things were served by as plump and buxom a lass as you could find in all the land so that little john who always had an eye for a fair lass even when meat and drink were by stuck his arms akimbo and fixed his eyes upon her winking sweetly whenever he saw her looking toward him then you should have seen how the lass twittered with laughter and how she looked at little john out of the corners of her eyes a dimple coming in either cheek for the fellow had always a taking way with the womenfolk  so the feast passed merrily and never had that inn seen such lusty feeders as these four stout fellows but at last they were done their eating though it seemed as though they never would have ended and sat loitering over the sack as they so sat the landlord came in of a sudden and said that there was one at the door a certain young esquire richard partington of the queens household who wished to see the lad in blue and speak with him without loss of time so robin arose quickly and bidding the landlord not to follow him left the others gazing at one another and wondering what was about to happen  when robin came out of the inn he found young richard partington sitting upon his horse in the white moonlight awaiting his coming  what news bearest thou sir page said robin i trust that it is not of an ill nature  why said young partington for the matter of that it is ill enow the king hath been bitterly stirred up against thee by that vile bishop of hereford he sent to arrest thee at the archery butts at finsbury fields but not finding thee there he hath gathered together his armed men fiftyscore and more and is sending them in haste along this very road to sherwood either to take thee on the way or to prevent thy getting back to the woodlands again he hath given the bishop of hereford command over all these men and thou knowest what thou hast to expect of the bishop of herefordshort shrift and a long rope two bands of horsemen are already upon the road not far behind me so thou hadst best get thee gone from this place straightway for if thou tarriest longer thou art like to sleep this night in a cold dungeon this word the queen hath bidden me bring to thee  now richard partington quoth robin this is the second time that thou hast saved my life and if the proper time ever cometh i will show thee that robin hood never forgets these things as for that bishop of hereford if i ever catch him nigh to sherwood again things will be like to go ill with him thou mayst tell the good queen that i will leave this place without delay and will let the landlord think that we are going to saint albans but when we are upon the highroad again i will go one way through the country and will send my men the other so that if one falleth into the kings hands the others may haply escape we will go by devious ways and so i hope will reach sherwood in safety and now sir page i wish thee farewell  farewell thou bold yeoman said young partington and mayst thou reach thy hiding in safety so each shook the others hand and the lad turning his horses head rode back toward london while robin entered the inn once more  there he found his yeomen sitting in silence waiting his coming likewise the landlord was there for he was curious to know what master partington had to do with the fellow in blue up my merry men quoth robin this is no place for us for those are after us with whom we will stand but an ill chance an we fall into their hands so we will go forward once more nor will we stop this night till we reach saint albans hereupon taking out his purse he paid the landlord his score and so they left the inn  when they had come to the highroad without the town robin stopped and told them all that had passed between young partington and himself and how that the kings men were after them with hot heels then he told them that here they should part company they three going to the eastward and he to the westward and so skirting the main highroads would come by devious paths to sherwood so be ye wily said robin hood and keep well away from the northward roads till ye have gotten well to the eastward and thou will scarlet take the lead of the others for thou hast a cunning turn to thy wits then robin kissed the three upon the cheeks and they kissed him and so they parted company  not long after this a score or more of the kings men came clattering up to the door of the inn at barnet town here they leaped from their horses and quickly surrounded the place the leader of the band and four others entering the room where the yeomen had been but they found that their birds had flown again and that the king had been balked a second time  methought that they were naughty fellows said the host when he heard whom the menatarms sought but i heard that blueclad knave say that they would go straight forward to saint albans so an ye hurry forward ye may perchance catch them on the highroad betwixt here and there for this news the leader of the band thanked mine host right heartily and calling his men together mounted and set forth again galloping forward to saint albans upon a wild goose chase  after little john and will scarlet and allan a dale had left the highway near garnet they traveled toward the eastward without stopping as long as their legs could carry them until they came to chelmsford in essex thence they turned northward and came through cambridge and lincolnshire to the good town of gainsborough then striking to the westward and the south they came at last to the northern borders of sherwood forest without in all that time having met so much as a single band of the kings men eight days they journeyed thus ere they reached the woodlands in safety but when they got to the greenwood glade they found that robin had not yet returned  for robin was not as lucky in getting back as his men had been as you shall presently hear  after having left the great northern road he turned his face to the westward and so came past aylesbury to fair woodstock in oxfordshire thence he turned his footsteps northward traveling for a great distance by way of warwick town till he came to dudley in staffordshire seven days it took him to journey thus far and then he thought he had gotten far enough to the north so turning toward the eastward shunning the main roads and choosing byways and grassy lanes he went by way of litchfield and ashby de la zouch toward sherwood until he came to a place called stanton and now robins heart began to laugh aloud for he thought that his danger had gone by and that his nostrils would soon snuff the spicy air of the woodlands once again but there is many a slip betwixt the cup and the lip and this robin was to find for thus it was  when the kings men found themselves foiled at saint albans and that robin and his men were not to be found high nor low they knew not what to do presently another band of horsemen came and another until all the moonlit streets were full of armed men betwixt midnight and dawn another band came to the town and with them came the bishop of hereford when he heard that robin hood had once more slipped out of the trap he stayed not a minute but gathering his bands together he pushed forward to the northward with speed leaving orders for all the troops that came to saint albans to follow after him without tarrying on the evening of the fourth day he reached nottingham town and there straightway divided his men into bands of six or seven and sent them all through the countryside blocking every highway and byway to the eastward and the southward and the westward of sherwood the sheriff of nottingham called forth all his men likewise and joined with the bishop for he saw that this was the best chance that had ever befallen of paying back his score in full to robin hood will scarlet and little john and allan a dale had just missed the kings men to the eastward for the very next day after they had passed the line and entered sherwood the roads through which they had traveled were blocked so that had they tarried in their journeying they would surely have fallen into the bishops hands  but of all this robin knew not a whit so he whistled merrily as he trudged along the road beyond stanton with his heart as free from care as the yolk of an egg is from cobwebs at last he came to where a little stream spread across the road in a shallow sheet tinkling and sparkling as it fretted over its bed of golden gravel here robin stopped being athirst and kneeling down he made a cup of the palms of his hands and began to drink on either side of the road for a long distance stood tangled thickets of bushes and young trees and it pleased robins heart to hear the little birds singing therein for it made him think of sherwood and it seemed as though it had been a lifetime since he had breathed the air of the woodlands but of a sudden as he thus stooped drinking something hissed past his ear and struck with a splash into the gravel and water beside him quick as a wink robin sprang to his feet and at one bound crossed the stream and the roadside and plunged headlong into the thicket without looking around for he knew right well that that which had hissed so venomously beside his ear was a gray goose shaft and that to tarry so much as a moment meant death even as he leaped into the thicket six more arrows rattled among the branches after him one of which pierced his doublet and would have struck deeply into his side but for the tough coat of steel that he wore then up the road came riding some of the kings men at headlong speed they leaped from their horses and plunged straightway into the thicket after robin but robin knew the ground better than they did so crawling here stooping there and anon running across some little open he soon left them far behind coming out at last upon another road about eight hundred paces distant from the one he had left here he stood for a moment listening to the distant shouts of the seven men as they beat up and down in the thickets like hounds that had lost the scent of the quarry then buckling his belt more tightly around his waist he ran fleetly down the road toward the eastward and sherwood  but robin had not gone more than three furlongs in that direction when he came suddenly to the brow of a hill and saw beneath him another band of the kings men seated in the shade along the roadside in the valley beneath then he paused not a moment but seeing that they had not caught sight of him he turned and ran back whence he had come knowing that it was better to run the chance of escaping those fellows that were yet in the thickets than to rush into the arms of those in the valley so back he ran with all speed and had gotten safely past the thickets when the seven men came forth into the open road they raised a great shout when they saw him such as the hunter gives when the deer breaks cover but robin was then a quarter of a mile and more away from them coursing over the ground like a greyhound he never slackened his pace but ran along mile after mile till he had come nigh to mackworth over beyond the derwent river nigh to derby town here seeing that he was out of present danger he slackened in his running and at last sat him down beneath a hedge where the grass was the longest and the shade the coolest there to rest and catch his wind by my soul robin quoth he to himself that was the narrowest miss that eer thou hadst in all thy life i do say most solemnly that the feather of that wicked shaft tickled mine ear as it whizzed past this same running hath given me a most craving appetite for victuals and drink now i pray saint dunstan that he send me speedily some meat and beer  it seemed as though saint dunstan was like to answer his prayer for along the road came plodding a certain cobbler one quince of derby who had been to take a pair of shoes to a farmer nigh kirk langly and was now coming back home again with a fair boiled capon in his pouch and a stout pottle of beer by his side which same the farmer had given him for joy of such a stout pair of shoon good quince was an honest fellow but his wits were somewhat of the heavy sort like unbaked dough so that the only thing that was in his mind was three shillings sixpence hapenny for thy shoon good quincethree shillings sixpence hapenny for thy shoon and this traveled round and round inside of his head without another thought getting into his noddle as a pea rolls round and round inside an empty quart pot  halloa good friend quoth robin from beneath the hedge when the other had gotten nigh enough whither away so merrily this bright day  hearing himself so called upon the cobbler stopped and seeing a wellclad stranger in blue he spoke to him in seemly wise give ye good den fair sir and i would say that i come from kirk langly where i ha sold my shoon and got three shillings sixpence hapenny for them in as sweet money as ever thou sawest and honestly earned too i would ha thee know but an i may be so bold thou pretty fellow what dost thou there beneath the hedge  marry quoth merry robin i sit beneath the hedge here to drop salt on the tails of golden birds but in sooth thou art the first chick of any worth i ha seen this blessed day  at these words the cobblers eyes opened big and wide and his mouth grew round with wonder like a knothole in a board fence slackaday quoth he look ye now i ha never seen those same golden birds and dost thou in sooth find them in these hedges good fellow prythee tell me are there many of them i would fain find them mine own self  ay truly quoth robin they are as thick here as fresh herring in cannock chase  look ye now said the cobbler all drowned in wonder and dost thou in sooth catch them by dropping salt on their pretty tails  yea quoth robin but this salt is of an odd kind let me tell thee for it can only be gotten by boiling down a quart of moonbeams in a wooden platter and then one hath but a pinch but tell me now thou witty man what hast thou gotten there in that pouch by thy side and in that pottle  at these words the cobbler looked down at those things of which merry robin spoke for the thoughts of the golden bird had driven them from his mind and it took him some time to scrape the memory of them back again why said he at last in the one is good march beer and in the other is a fat capon truly quince the cobbler will ha a fine feast this day an i mistake not  but tell me good quince said robin hast thou a mind to sell those things to me for the hearing of them sounds sweet in mine ears i will give thee these gay clothes of blue that i have upon my body and ten shillings to boot for thy clothes and thy leather apron and thy beer and thy capon what sayst thou bully boy  nay thou dost jest with me said the cobbler for my clothes are coarse and patched and thine are of fine stuff and very pretty  never a jest do i speak quoth robin come strip thy jacket off and i will show thee for i tell thee i like thy clothes well moreover i will be kind to thee for i will feast straightway upon the good things thou hast with thee and thou shalt be bidden to the eating at these words he began slipping off his doublet and the cobbler seeing him so in earnest began pulling off his clothes also for robin hoods garb tickled his eye so each put on the other fellows clothes and robin gave the honest cobbler ten bright new shillings quoth merry robin i ha been a many things in my life before but never have i been an honest cobbler come friend let us fall to and eat for something within me cackles aloud for that good fat capon so both sat down and began to feast right lustily so that when they were done the bones of the capon were picked as bare as charity  then robin stretched his legs out with a sweet feeling of comfort within him quoth he by the turn of thy voice good quince i know that thou hast a fair song or two running loose in thy head like colts in a meadow i prythee turn one of them out for me  a song or two i ha quoth the cobbler poor things poor things but such as they are thou art welcome to one of them so moistening his throat with a swallow of beer he sang       of all the joys the best i love      sing hey my frisking nan o      and that which most my soul doth move      it is the clinking can o       all other bliss id throw away      sing hey my frisking nan o      but this  the stout cobbler got no further in his song for of a sudden six horsemen burst upon them where they sat and seized roughly upon the honest craftsman hauling him to his feet and nearly plucking the clothes from him as they did so ha roared the leader of the band in a great big voice of joy have we then caught thee at last thou blueclad knave now blessed be the name of saint hubert for we are fourscore pounds richer this minute than we were before for the good bishop of hereford hath promised that much to the band that shall bring thee to him oho thou cunning rascal thou wouldst look so innocent forsooth we know thee thou old fox but off thou goest with us to have thy brush clipped forthwith at these words the poor cobbler gazed all around him with his great blue eyes as round as those of a dead fish while his mouth gaped as though he had swallowed all his words and so lost his speech  robin also gaped and stared in a wondering way just as the cobbler would have done in his place alackadaisy me quoth he i know not whether i be sitting here or in nomansland what meaneth all this stir i th pot dear good gentlemen surely this is a sweet honest fellow  honest fellow sayst thou clown quoth one of the men why i tell thee that this is that same rogue that men call robin hood  at this speech the cobbler stared and gaped more than ever for there was such a threshing of thoughts going on within his poor head that his wits were all befogged with the dust and chaff thereof moreover as he looked at robin hood and saw the yeoman look so like what he knew himself to be he began to doubt and to think that mayhap he was the great outlaw in real sooth said he in a slow wondering voice am i in very truth that fellownow i had thoughtbut nay quince thou art mistookyetam inay i must indeed be robin hood yet truly i had never thought to pass from an honest craftsman to such a great yeoman  alas quoth robin hood look ye there now see how your illtreatment hath curdled the wits of this poor lad and turned them all sour i myself am quince the cobbler of derby town  is it so said quince then indeed i am somebody else and can be none other than robin hood take me fellows but let me tell you that ye ha laid hand upon the stoutest yeoman that ever trod the woodlands  thou wilt play madman wilt thou said the leader of the band here giles fetch a cord and bind this knaves hands behind him i warrant we will bring his wits back to him again when we get him safe before our good bishop at tutbury town thereupon they tied the cobblers hands behind him and led him off with a rope as the farmer leads off the calf he hath brought from the fair robin stood looking after them and when they were gone he laughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks for he knew that no harm would befall the honest fellow and he pictured to himself the bishops face when good quince was brought before him as robin hood then turning his steps once more to the eastward he stepped out right foot foremost toward nottinghamshire and sherwood forest  but robin hood had gone through more than he wotted of his journey from london had been hard and long and in a seennight he had traveled sevenscore and more of miles he thought now to travel on without stopping until he had come to sherwood but ere he had gone a half a score of miles he felt his strength giving way beneath him like a river bank which the waters have undermined he sat him down and rested but he knew within himself that he could go no farther that day for his feet felt like lumps of lead so heavy were they with weariness once more he arose and went forward but after traveling a couple of miles he was fain to give the matter up so coming to an inn just then he entered and calling the landlord bade him show him to a room although the sun was only then just sinking in the western sky there were but three bedrooms in the place and to the meanest of these the landlord showed robin hood but little robin cared for the looks of the place for he could have slept that night upon a bed of broken stones so stripping off his clothes without more ado he rolled into the bed and was asleep almost ere his head touched the pillow  not long after robin had so gone to his rest a great cloud peeped blackly over the hills to the westward higher and higher it arose until it piled up into the night like a mountain of darkness all around beneath it came ever and anon a dull red flash and presently a short grim mutter of the coming thunder was heard then up rode four stout burghers of nottingham town for this was the only inn within five miles distance and they did not care to be caught in such a thunderstorm as this that was coming upon them leaving their nags to the stableman they entered the best room of the inn where fresh green rushes lay all spread upon the floor and there called for the goodliest fare that the place afforded after having eaten heartily they bade the landlord show them to their rooms for they were aweary having ridden all the way from dronfield that day so off they went grumbling at having to sleep two in a bed but their troubles on this score as well as all others were soon lost in the quietness of sleep  and now came the first gust of wind rushing past the place clapping and banging the doors and shutters smelling of the coming rain and all wrapped in a cloud of dust and leaves as though the wind had brought a guest along with it the door opened of a sudden and in came a friar of emmet priory and one in high degree as was shown by the softness and sleekness of his robes and the richness of his rosary he called to the landlord and bade him first have his mule well fed and bedded in the stable and then to bring him the very best there was in the house so presently a savory stew of tripe and onions with sweet little fat dumplings was set before him likewise a good stout pottle of malmsey and straightway the holy friar fell to with great courage and heartiness so that in a short time nought was left but a little pool of gravy in the center of the platter not large enow to keep the life in a starving mouse  in the meantime the storm broke another gust of wind went rushing by and with it fell a few heavy drops of rain which presently came rattling down in showers beating against the casements like a hundred little hands bright flashes of lightning lit up every raindrop and with them came cracks of thunder that went away rumbling and bumping as though saint swithin were busy rolling great casks of water across rough ground overhead the womenfolks screamed and the merry wags in the taproom put their arms around their waists to soothe them into quietness  at last the holy friar bade the landlord show him to his room but when he heard that he was to bed with a cobbler he was as ill contented a fellow as you could find in all england nevertheless there was nothing for it and he must sleep there or nowhere so taking up his candle he went off grumbling like the now distant thunder when he came to the room where he was to sleep he held the light over robin and looked at him from top to toe then he felt better pleased for instead of a rough dirtybearded fellow he beheld as fresh and clean a lad as one could find in a week of sundays so slipping off his clothes he also huddled into the bed where robin grunting and grumbling in his sleep made room for him robin was more sound asleep i wot than he had been for many a day else he would never have rested so quietly with one of the friars sort so close beside him as for the friar had he known who robin hood was you may well believe he would almost as soon have slept with an adder as with the man he had for a bedfellow  so the night passed comfortably enough but at the first dawn of day robin opened his eyes and turned his head upon the pillow then how he gaped and how he stared for there beside him lay one all shaven and shorn so that he knew that it must be a fellow in holy orders he pinched himself sharply but finding he was awake sat up in bed while the other slumbered as peacefully as though he were safe and sound at home in emmet priory now quoth robin to himself i wonder how this thing hath dropped into my bed during the night so saying he arose softly so as not to waken the other and looking about the room he espied the friars clothes lying upon a bench near the wall first he looked at the clothes with his head on one side and then he looked at the friar and slowly winked one eye quoth he good brother whateerthynamemaybe as thou hast borrowed my bed so freely ill een borrow thy clothes in return so saying he straightway donned the holy mans garb but kindly left the cobblers clothes in the place of it then he went forth into the freshness of the morning and the stableman that was up and about the stables opened his eyes as though he saw a green mouse before him for such men as the friars of emmet were not wont to be early risers but the man bottled his thoughts and only asked robin whether he wanted his mule brought from the stable  yea my son quoth robinalbeit he knew nought of the muleand bring it forth quickly i prythee for i am late and must be jogging so presently the stableman brought forth the mule and robin mounted it and went on his way rejoicing  as for the holy friar when he arose he was in as pretty a stew as any man in all the world for his rich soft robes were gone likewise his purse with ten golden pounds in it and nought was left but patched clothes and a leathern apron he raged and swore like any layman but as his swearing mended nothing and the landlord could not aid him and as moreover he was forced to be at emmet priory that very morning upon matters of business he was fain either to don the cobblers clothes or travel the road in nakedness so he put on the clothes and still raging and swearing vengeance against all the cobblers in derbyshire he set forth upon his way afoot but his ills had not yet done with him for he had not gone far ere he fell into the hands of the kings men who marched him off willynilly to tutbury town and the bishop of hereford in vain he swore he was a holy man and showed his shaven crown off he must go for nothing would do but that he was robin hood  meanwhile merry robin rode along contentedly passing safely by two bands of the kings men until his heart began to dance within him because of the nearness of sherwood so he traveled ever on to the eastward till of a sudden he met a noble knight in a shady lane then robin checked his mule quickly and leaped from off its back now well met sir richard of the lea cried he for rather than any other man in england would i see thy good face this day then he told sir richard all the happenings that had befallen him and that now at last he felt himself safe being so nigh to sherwood again but when robin had done sir richard shook his head sadly thou art in greater danger now robin than thou hast yet been said he for before thee lie bands of the sheriffs men blocking every road and letting none pass through the lines without examining them closely i myself know this having passed them but now before thee lie the sheriffs men and behind thee the kings men and thou canst not hope to pass either way for by this time they will know of thy disguise and will be in waiting to seize upon thee my castle and everything within it are thine but nought could be gained there for i could not hope to hold it against such a force as is now in nottingham of the kings and the sheriffs men having so spoken sir richard bent his head in thought and robin felt his heart sink within him like that of the fox that hears the hounds at his heels and finds his den blocked with earth so that there is no hiding for him but presently sir richard spoke again saying one thing thou canst do robin and one only go back to london and throw thyself upon the mercy of our good queen eleanor come with me straightway to my castle doff these clothes and put on such as my retainers wear then i will hie me to london town with a troop of men behind me and thou shalt mingle with them and thus will i bring thee to where thou mayst see and speak with the queen thy only hope is to get to sherwood for there none can reach thee and thou wilt never get to sherwood but in this way  so robin went with sir richard of the lea and did as he said for he saw the wisdom of that which the knight advised and that this was his only chance of safety   queen eleanor walked in her royal garden amid the roses that bloomed sweetly and with her walked six of her ladiesinwaiting chattering blithely together of a sudden a man leaped up to the top of the wall from the other side and then hanging for a moment dropped lightly upon the grass within all the ladiesinwaiting shrieked at the suddenness of his coming but the man ran to the queen and kneeled at her feet and she saw that it was robin hood  why how now robin cried she dost thou dare to come into the very jaws of the raging lion alas poor fellow thou art lost indeed if the king finds thee here dost thou not know that he is seeking thee through all the land  yea quoth robin i do know right well that the king seeks me and therefore i have come for surely no ill can befall me when he hath pledged his royal word to your majesty for my safety moreover i know your majestys kindness and gentleness of heart and so i lay my life freely in your gracious hands  i take thy meaning robin hood said the queen and that thou dost convey reproach to me as well thou mayst for i know that i have not done by thee as i ought to have done i know right well that thou must have been hard pressed by peril to leap so boldly into one danger to escape another once more i promise thee mine aid and will do all i can to send thee back in safety to sherwood forest bide thou here till i return so saying she left robin in the garden of roses and was gone a long time  when she came back sir robert lee was with her and the queens cheeks were hot and the queens eyes were bright as though she had been talking with high words then sir robert came straight forward to where robin hood stood and he spoke to the yeoman in a cold stern voice quoth he our gracious sovereign the king hath mitigated his wrath toward thee fellow and hath once more promised that thou shalt depart in peace and safety not only hath he promised this but in three days he will send one of his pages to go with thee and see that none arrest thy journey back again thou mayst thank thy patron saint that thou hast such a good friend in our noble queen for but for her persuasion and arguments thou hadst been a dead man i can tell thee let this peril that thou hast passed through teach thee two lessons first be more honest second be not so bold in thy comings and goings a man that walketh in the darkness as thou dost may escape for a time but in the end he will surely fall into the pit thou hast put thy head in the angry lions mouth and yet thou hast escaped by a miracle try it not again so saying he turned and left robin and was gone  for three days robin abided in london in the queens household and at the end of that time the kings head page edward cunningham came and taking robin with him departed northward upon his way to sherwood now and then they passed bands of the kings men coming back again to london but none of those bands stopped them and so at last they reached the sweet leafy woodlands     robin hood and guy of gisbourne  a long time passed after the great shooting match and during that time robin followed one part of the advice of sir robert lee to wit that of being less bold in his comings and his goings for though mayhap he may not have been more honest as most folks regard honesty he took good care not to travel so far from sherwood that he could not reach it both easily and quickly  great changes had fallen in this time for king henry had died and king richard had come to the crown that fitted him so well through many hard trials and through adventures as stirring as any that ever befell robin hood but though great changes came they did not reach to sherwoods shades for there robin hood and his men dwelled as merrily as they had ever done with hunting and feasting and singing and blithe woodland sports for it was little the outside striving of the world troubled them  the dawning of a summers day was fresh and bright and the birds sang sweetly in a great tumult of sound so loud was their singing that it awakened robin hood where he lay sleeping so that he stirred and turned and arose up rose little john also and all the merry men then after they had broken their fast they set forth hither and thither upon the doings of the day  robin hood and little john walked down a forest path where all around the leaves danced and twinkled as the breeze trembled through them and the sunlight came flickering down quoth robin hood i make my vow little john my blood tickles my veins as it flows through them this gay morn what sayst thou to our seeking adventures each one upon his own account  with all my heart said little john we have had more than one pleasant doing in that way good master here are two paths take thou the one to the right hand and i will take the one to the left and then let us each walk straight ahead till he tumble into some merry doing or other  i like thy plan quoth robin therefore we will part here but look thee little john keep thyself out of mischief for i would not have ill befall thee for all the world  marry come up quoth little john how thou talkest methinks thou art wont to get thyself into tighter coils than i am like to do  at this robin hood laughed why in sooth little john said he thou hast a blundering hardheaded way that seemeth to bring thee right side uppermost in all thy troubles but let us see who cometh out best this day so saying he clapped his palm to little johns and each departed upon his way the trees quickly shutting the one from the others sight  robin hood strolled onward till he came to where a broad woodland road stretched before him overhead the branches of the trees laced together in flickering foliage all golden where it grew thin to the sunlight beneath his feet the ground was soft and moist from the sheltering shade here in this pleasant spot the sharpest adventure that ever befell robin hood came upon him for as he walked down the woodland path thinking of nought but the songs of the birds he came of a sudden to where a man was seated upon the mossy roots beneath the shade of a broadspreading oak tree robin hood saw that the stranger had not caught sight of him so he stopped and stood quite still looking at the other a long time before he came forward and the stranger i wot was well worth looking at for never had robin seen a figure like that sitting beneath the tree from his head to his feet he was clad in a horses hide dressed with the hair upon it upon his head was a cowl that hid his face from sight and which was made of the horses skin the ears whereof stuck up like those of a rabbit his body was clad in a jacket made of the hide and his legs were covered with the hairy skin likewise by his side was a heavy broadsword and a sharp doubleedged dagger a quiver of smooth round arrows hung across his shoulders and his stout bow of yew leaned against the tree beside him  halloa friend cried robin coming forward at last who art thou that sittest there and what is that that thou hast upon thy body i make my vow i ha never seen such a sight in all my life before had i done an evil thing or did my conscience trouble me i would be afraid of thee thinking that thou wast someone from down below bringing a message bidding me come straightway to king nicholas  to this speech the other answered not a word but he pushed the cowl back from his head and showed a knit brow a hooked nose and a pair of fierce restless black eyes which altogether made robin think of a hawk as he looked on his face but beside this there was something about the lines on the strangers face and his thin cruel mouth and the hard glare of his eyes that made ones flesh creep to look upon  who art thou rascal said he at last in a loud harsh voice  tut tut quoth merry robin speak not so sourly brother hast thou fed upon vinegar and nettles this morning that thy speech is so stinging  an thou likest not my words said the other fiercely thou hadst best be jogging for i tell thee plainly my deeds match them  nay but i do like thy words thou sweet pretty thing quoth robin squatting down upon the grass in front of the other moreover i tell thee thy speech is witty and gamesome as any i ever heard in all my life  the other said not a word but he glared upon robin with a wicked and baleful look such as a fierce dog bestows upon a man ere it springs at his throat robin returned the gaze with one of wideeyed innocence not a shadow of a smile twinkling in his eyes or twitching at the corners of his mouth so they sat staring at one another for a long time until the stranger broke the silence suddenly what is thy name fellow said he  now quoth robin i am right glad to hear thee speak for i began to fear the sight of me had stricken thee dumb as for my name it may be this or it may be that but methinks it is more meet for thee to tell me thine seeing that thou art the greater stranger in these parts prythee tell me sweet chuck why wearest thou that dainty garb upon thy pretty body at these words the other broke into a short harsh roar of laughter by the bones of the daemon odin said he thou art the boldestspoken man that ever i have seen in all my life i know not why i do not smite thee down where thou sittest for only two days ago i skewered a man over back of nottingham town for saying not half so much to me as thou hast done i wear this garb thou fool to keep my body warm likewise it is near as good as a coat of steel against a common swordthrust as for my name i care not who knoweth it it is guy of gisbourne and thou mayst have heard it before i come from the woodlands over in herefordshire upon the lands of the bishop of that ilk i am an outlaw and get my living by hook and by crook in a manner it boots not now to tell of not long since the bishop sent for me and said that if i would do a certain thing that the sheriff of nottingham would ask of me he would get me a free pardon and give me tenscore pounds to boot so straightway i came to nottingham town and found my sweet sheriff and what thinkest thou he wanted of me why forsooth to come here to sherwood to hunt up one robin hood also an outlaw and to take him alive or dead it seemeth that they have no one here to face that bold fellow and so sent all the way to herefordshire and to me for thou knowest the old saying set a thief to catch a thief as for the slaying of this fellow it galleth me not a whit for i would shed the blood of my own brother for the half of two hundred pounds  to all this robin listened and as he listened his gorge rose well he knew of this guy of gisbourne and of all the bloody and murderous deeds that he had done in herefordshire for his doings were famous throughout all the land yet although he loathed the very presence of the man he held his peace for he had an end to serve truly quoth he i have heard of thy gentle doings methinks there is no one in all the world that robin hood would rather meet than thee  at this guy of gisbourne gave another harsh laugh why quoth he it is a merry thing to think of one stout outlaw like robin hood meeting another stout outlaw like guy of gisbourne only in this case it will be an ill happening for robin hood for the day he meets guy of gisbourne he shall die  but thou gentle merry spirit quoth robin dost thou not think that mayhap this same robin hood may be the better man of the two i know him right well and many think that he is one of the stoutest men hereabouts  he may be the stoutest of men hereabouts quoth guy of gisbourne yet i tell thee fellow this sty of yours is not the wide world i lay my life upon it i am the better man of the two he an outlaw forsooth why i hear that he hath never let blood in all his life saving when he first came to the forest some call him a great archer marry i would not be afraid to stand against him all the days of the year with a bow in my hand  why truly some folk do call him a great archer said robin hood but we of nottinghamshire are famous hands with the longbow even i though but a simple hand at the craft would not fear to try a bout with thee  at these words guy of gisbourne looked upon robin with wondering eyes and then gave another roar of laughter till the woods rang now quoth he thou art a bold fellow to talk to me in this way i like thy spirit in so speaking up to me for few men have dared to do so put up a garland lad and i will try a bout with thee  tut tut quoth robin only babes shoot at garlands hereabouts i will put up a good nottingham mark for thee so saying he arose and going to a hazel thicket not far off he cut a wand about twice the thickness of a mans thumb from this he peeled the bark and sharpening the point stuck it up in the ground in front of a great oak tree thence he measured off fourscore paces which brought him beside the tree where the other sat there quoth he is the kind of mark that nottingham yeomen shoot at now let me see thee split that wand if thou art an archer  then guy of gisbourne arose now out upon it cried he the devil himself could not hit such a mark as that  mayhap he could and mayhap he could not quoth merry robin but that we shall never know till thou hast shot thereat  at these words guy of gisbourne looked upon robin with knit brows but as the yeoman still looked innocent of any ill meaning he bottled his words and strung his bow in silence twice he shot but neither time did he hit the wand missing it the first time by a span and the second time by a good palmsbreadth robin laughed and laughed i see now quoth he that the devil himself could not hit that mark good fellow if thou art no better with the broadsword than thou art with the bow and arrow thou wilt never overcome robin hood  at these words guy of gisbourne glared savagely upon robin quoth he thou hast a merry tongue thou villain but take care that thou makest not too free with it or i may cut it out from thy throat for thee  robin hood strung his bow and took his place with never a word albeit his heartstrings quivered with anger and loathing twice he shot the first time hitting within an inch of the wand the second time splitting it fairly in the middle then without giving the other a chance for speech he flung his bow upon the ground there thou bloody villain cried he fiercely let that show thee how little thou knowest of manly sports and now look thy last upon the daylight for the good earth hath been befouled long enough by thee thou vile beast this day our lady willing thou diesti am robin hood so saying he flashed forth his bright sword in the sunlight  for a time guy of gisbourne stared upon robin as though bereft of wits but his wonder quickly passed to a wild rage art thou indeed robin hood cried he now i am glad to meet thee thou poor wretch shrive thyself for thou wilt have no time for shriving when i am done with thee so saying he also drew his sword  and now came the fiercest fight that ever sherwood saw for each man knew that either he or the other must die and that no mercy was to be had in this battle up and down they fought till all the sweet green grass was crushed and ground beneath the trampling of their heels more than once the point of robin hoods sword felt the softness of flesh and presently the ground began to be sprinkled with bright red drops albeit not one of them came from robins veins at last guy of gisbourne made a fierce and deadly thrust at robin hood from which he leaped back lightly but in so leaping he caught his heel in a root and fell heavily upon his back now holy mary aid me muttered he as the other leaped at him with a grin of rage upon his face fiercely guy of gisbourne stabbed at the other with his great sword but robin caught the blade in his naked hand and though it cut his palm he turned the point away so that it plunged deep into the ground close beside him then ere a blow could be struck again he leaped to his feet with his good sword in his hand and now despair fell upon guy of gisbournes heart in a black cloud and he looked around him wildly like a wounded hawk seeing that his strength was going from him robin leaped forward and quick as a flash struck a backhanded blow beneath the sword arm down fell the sword from guy of gisbournes grasp and back he staggered at the stroke and ere he could regain himself robins sword passed through and through his body round he spun upon his heel and flinging his hands aloft with a shrill wild cry fell prone upon his face upon the green sod  then robin hood wiped his sword and thrust it back into the scabbard and coming to where guy of gisbourne lay he stood over him with folded arms talking to himself the while this is the first man i have slain since i shot the kings forester in the hot days of my youth i ofttimes think bitterly even yet of that first life i took but of this i am as glad as though i had slain a wild boar that laid waste a fair country since the sheriff of nottingham hath sent such a one as this against me i will put on the fellows garb and go forth to see whether i may not find his worship and perchance pay him back some of the debt i owe him upon this score  so saying robin hood stripped the hairy garments from off the dead man and put them on himself all bloody as they were then strapping the others sword and dagger around his body and carrying his own in his hand together with the two bows of yew he drew the cowl of horses hide over his face so that none could tell who he was and set forth from the forest turning his steps toward the eastward and nottingham town as he strode along the country roads men women and children hid away from him for the terror of guy of gisbournes name and of his doings had spread far and near  and now let us see what befell little john while these things were happening  little john walked on his way through the forest paths until he had come to the outskirts of the woodlands where here and there fields of barley corn or green meadow lands lay smiling in the sun so he came to the highroad and to where a little thatched cottage stood back of a cluster of twisted crab trees with flowers in front of it here he stopped of a sudden for he thought that he heard the sound of someone in sorrow he listened and found that it came from the cottage so turning his footsteps thither he pushed open the wicket and entered the place there he saw a grayhaired dame sitting beside a cold hearthstone rocking herself to and fro and weeping bitterly  now little john had a tender heart for the sorrows of other folk so coming to the old woman and patting her kindly upon the shoulder he spoke comforting words to her bidding her cheer up and tell him her troubles for that mayhap he might do something to ease them at all this the good dame shook her head but all the same his kind words did soothe her somewhat so after a while she told him all that bore upon her mind that that morning she had three as fair tall sons beside her as one could find in all nottinghamshire but that they were now taken from her and were like to be hanged straightway that want having come upon them her eldest boy had gone out the night before into the forest and had slain a hind in the moonlight that the kings rangers had followed the blood upon the grass until they had come to her cottage and had there found the deers meat in the cupboard that as neither of the younger sons would betray their brother the foresters had taken all three away in spite of the oldest saying that he alone had slain the deer that as they went she had heard the rangers talking among themselves saying that the sheriff had sworn that he would put a check upon the great slaughter of deer that had been going on of late by hanging the very first rogue caught thereat upon the nearest tree and that they would take the three youths to the kings head inn near nottingham town where the sheriff was abiding that day there to await the return of a certain fellow he had sent into sherwood to seek for robin hood  to all this little john listened shaking his head sadly now and then alas quoth he when the good dame had finished her speech this is indeed an ill case but who is this that goeth into sherwood after robin hood and why doth he go to seek him but no matter for that now only that i would that robin hood were here to advise us nevertheless no time may be lost in sending for him at this hour if we would save the lives of thy three sons tell me hast thou any clothes hereabouts that i may put on in place of these of lincoln green marry if our stout sheriff catcheth me without disguise i am like to be run up more quickly than thy sons let me tell thee dame  then the old woman told him that she had in the house some of the clothes of her good husband who had died only two years before these she brought to little john who doffing his garb of lincoln green put them on in its stead then making a wig and false beard of uncarded wool he covered his own brown hair and beard and putting on a great tall hat that had belonged to the old peasant he took his staff in one hand and his bow in the other and set forth with all speed to where the sheriff had taken up his inn  a mile or more from nottingham town and not far from the southern borders of sherwood forest stood the cosy inn bearing the sign of the kings head here was a great bustle and stir on this bright morning for the sheriff and a score of his men had come to stop there and await guy of gisbournes return from the forest great hiss and fuss of cooking was going on in the kitchen and great rapping and tapping of wine kegs and beer barrels was going on in the cellar the sheriff sat within feasting merrily of the best the place afforded and the sheriffs men sat upon the bench before the door quaffing ale or lay beneath the shade of the broadspreading oak trees talking and jesting and laughing all around stood the horses of the band with a great noise of stamping feet and a great switching of tails to this inn came the kings rangers driving the widows three sons before them the hands of the three youths were tied tightly behind their backs and a cord from neck to neck fastened them all together so they were marched to the room where the sheriff sat at meat and stood trembling before him as he scowled sternly upon them  so quoth he in a great loud angry voice ye have been poaching upon the kings deer have you now i will make short work of you this day for i will hang up all three of you as a farmer would hang up three crows to scare others of the kind from the field our fair county of nottingham hath been too long a breeding place for such naughty knaves as ye are i have put up with these things for many years but now i will stamp them out once for all and with you i will begin  then one of the poor fellows opened his mouth to speak but the sheriff roared at him in a loud voice to be silent and bade the rangers to take them away till he had done his eating and could attend to the matters concerning them so the three poor youths were marched outside where they stood with bowed heads and despairing hearts till after a while the sheriff came forth then he called his men about him and quoth he these three villains shall be hanged straightway but not here lest they breed ill luck to this goodly inn we will take them over yonder to that belt of woodlands for i would fain hang them upon the very trees of sherwood itself to show those vile outlaws therein what they may expect of me if i ever have the good luck to lay hands upon them so saying he mounted his horse as did his menatarms likewise and all together they set forth for the belt of woodlands he had spoken of the poor youths walking in their midst guarded by the rangers so they came at last to the spot and here nooses were fastened around the necks of the three and the ends of the cords flung over the branch of a great oak tree that stood there then the three youths fell upon their knees and loudly besought mercy of the sheriff but the sheriff of nottingham laughed scornfully now quoth he i would that i had a priest here to shrive you but as none is nigh you must een travel your road with all your sins packed upon your backs and trust to saint peter to let you in through the gates of paradise like three peddlers into the town  in the meantime while all this had been going forward an old man had drawn near and stood leaning on his staff looking on his hair and beard were all curly and white and across his back was a bow of yew that looked much too strong for him to draw as the sheriff looked around ere he ordered his men to string the three youths up to the oak tree his eyes fell upon this strange old man then his worship beckoned to him saying come hither father i have a few words to say to thee so little john for it was none other than he came forward and the sheriff looked upon him thinking that there was something strangely familiar in the face before him how now said he methinks i have seen thee before what may thy name be father  please your worship said little john in a cracked voice like that of an old man my name is giles hobble at your worships service  giles hobble giles hobble muttered the sheriff to himself turning over the names that he had in his mind to try to find one to fit to this i remember not thy name said he at last but it matters not hast thou a mind to earn sixpence this bright morn  ay marry quoth little john for money is not so plenty with me that i should cast sixpence away an i could earn it by an honest turn what is it your worship would have me do  why this said the sheriff here are three men that need hanging as badly as any eer i saw if thou wilt string them up i will pay thee twopence apiece for them i like not that my menatarms should turn hangmen wilt thou try thy hand  in sooth said little john still in the old mans voice i ha never done such a thing before but an a sixpence is to be earned so easily i might as well ha it as anybody but your worship are these naughty fellows shrived  nay said the sheriff laughing never a whit but thou mayst turn thy hand to that also if thou art so minded but hasten i prythee for i would get back to mine inn betimes  so little john came to where the three youths stood trembling and putting his face to the first fellows cheek as though he were listening to him he whispered softly into his ear stand still brother when thou feelest thy bonds cut but when thou seest me throw my woolen wig and beard from my head and face cast the noose from thy neck and run for the woodlands then he slyly cut the cord that bound the youths hands who upon his part stood still as though he were yet bound then he went to the second fellow and spoke to him in the same way and also cut his bonds this he did to the third likewise but all so slyly that the sheriff who sat upon his horse laughing wotted not what was being done nor his men either  then little john turned to the sheriff please your worship said he will you give me leave to string my bow for i would fain help these fellows along the way when they are swinging with an arrow beneath the ribs  with all my heart said the sheriff only as i said before make thou haste in thy doings  little john put the tip of his bow to his instep and strung the weapon so deftly that all wondered to see an old man so strong next he drew a good smooth arrow from his quiver and fitted it to the string then looking all around to see that the way was clear behind him he suddenly cast away the wool from his head and face shouting in a mighty voice run quick as a flash the three youths flung the nooses from their necks and sped across the open to the woodlands as the arrow speeds from the bow little john also flew toward the covert like a greyhound while the sheriff and his men gazed after him all bewildered with the sudden doing but ere the yeoman had gone far the sheriff roused himself after him he roared in a mighty voice for he knew now who it was with whom he had been talking and wondered that he had not known him before  little john heard the sheriffs words and seeing that he could not hope to reach the woodlands before they would be upon him he stopped and turned suddenly holding his bow as though he were about to shoot stand back cried he fiercely the first man that cometh a foot forward or toucheth finger to bowstring dieth  at these words the sheriffs men stood as still as stocks for they knew right well that little john would be as good as his word and that to disobey him meant death in vain the sheriff roared at them calling them cowards and urging them forward in a body they would not budge an inch but stood and watched little john as he moved slowly away toward the forest keeping his gaze fixed upon them but when the sheriff saw his enemy thus slipping betwixt his fingers he grew mad with his rage so that his head swam and he knew not what he did then of a sudden he turned his horses head and plunging his spurs into its sides he gave a great shout and rising in his stirrups came down upon little john like the wind then little john raised his deadly bow and drew the gray goose feather to his cheek but alas for him for ere he could loose the shaft the good bow that had served him so long split in his hands and the arrow fell harmless at his feet seeing what had happened the sheriffs men raised a shout and following their master came rushing down upon little john but the sheriff was ahead of the others and so caught up with the yeoman before he reached the shelter of the woodlands then leaning forward he struck a mighty blow little john ducked and the sheriffs sword turned in his hand but the flat of the blade struck the other upon the head and smote him down stunned and senseless  now i am right glad said the sheriff when the men came up and found that little john was not dead that i have not slain this man in my haste i would rather lose five hundred pounds than have him die thus instead of hanging as such a vile thief should do go get some water from yonder fountain william and pour it over his head  the man did as he was bidden and presently little john opened his eyes and looked around him all dazed and bewildered with the stun of the blow then they tied his hands behind him and lifting him up set him upon the back of one of the horses with his face to its tail and his feet strapped beneath its belly so they took him back to the kings head inn laughing and rejoicing as they went along but in the meantime the widows three sons had gotten safely away and were hidden in the woodlands  once more the sheriff of nottingham sat within the kings head inn his heart rejoiced within him for he had at last done that which he had sought to do for years taken little john prisoner quoth he to himself this time tomorrow the rogue shall hang upon the gallows tree in front of the great gate of nottingham town and thus shall i make my long score with him even so saying he took a deep draught of canary but it seemed as if the sheriff had swallowed a thought with his wine for he shook his head and put the cup down hastily now he muttered to himself i would not for a thousand pounds have this fellow slip through my fingers yet should his master escape that foul guy of gisbourne there is no knowing what he may do for he is the cunningest knave in all the worldthis same robin hood belike i had better not wait until tomorrow to hang the fellow so saying he pushed his chair back hastily and going forth from the inn called his men together quoth he i will wait no longer for the hanging of this rogue but it shall be done forthwith and that from the very tree whence he saved those three young villains by stepping betwixt them and the law so get ye ready straightway  then once more they sat little john upon the horse with his face to the tail and so one leading the horse whereon he sat and the others riding around him they went forward to that tree from the branches of which they had thought to hang the poachers on they went rattling and jingling along the road till they came to the tree here one of the men spake to the sheriff of a sudden your worship cried he is not yon fellow coming along toward us that same guy of gisbourne whom thou didst send into the forest to seek robin hood at these words the sheriff shaded his eyes and looked eagerly why certes quoth he yon fellow is the same now heaven send that he hath slain the master thief as we will presently slay the man  when little john heard this speech he looked up and straightway his heart crumbled away within him for not only were the mans garments all covered with blood but he wore robin hoods bugle horn and carried his bow and broadsword  how now cried the sheriff when robin hood in guy of gisbournes clothes had come nigh to them what luck hath befallen thee in the forest why man thy clothes are all over blood  an thou likest not my clothes said robin in a harsh voice like that of guy of gisbourne thou mayst shut thine eyes marry the blood upon me is that of the vilest outlaw that ever trod the woodlands and one whom i have slain this day albeit not without wound to myself  then out spake little john for the first time since he had fallen into the sheriffs hands o thou vile bloody wretch i know thee guy of gisbourne for who is there that hath not heard of thee and cursed thee for thy vile deeds of blood and rapine is it by such a hand as thine that the gentlest heart that ever beat is stilled in death truly thou art a fit tool for this coward sheriff of nottingham now i die joyfully nor do i care how i die for life is nought to me so spake little john the salt tears rolling down his brown cheeks  but the sheriff of nottingham clapped his hands for joy now guy of gisbourne cried he if what thou tellest me is true it will be the best days doings for thee that ever thou hast done in all thy life  what i have told thee is sooth and i lie not said robin still in guy of gisbournes voice look is not this robin hoods sword and is not this his good bow of yew and is not this his bugle horn thinkest thou he would have given them to guy of gisbourne of his own free will  then the sheriff laughed aloud for joy this is a good day cried he the great outlaw dead and his righthand man in my hands ask what thou wilt of me guy of gisbourne and it is thine  then this i ask of thee said robin as i have slain the master i would now kill the man give this fellows life into my hands sir sheriff  now thou art a fool cried the sheriff thou mightst have had money enough for a knights ransom if thou hadst asked for it i like ill to let this fellow pass from my hands but as i have promised thou shalt have him  i thank thee right heartily for thy gift cried robin take the rogue down from the horse men and lean him against yonder tree while i show you how we stick a porker whence i come  at these words some of the sheriffs men shook their heads for though they cared not a whit whether little john were hanged or not they hated to see him butchered in cold blood but the sheriff called to them in a loud voice ordering them to take the yeoman down from the horse and lean him against the tree as the other bade  while they were doing this robin hood strung both his bow and that of guy of gisbourne albeit none of them took notice of his doing so then when little john stood against the tree he drew guy of gisbournes sharp doubleedged dagger fall back fall back cried he would ye crowd so on my pleasure ye unmannerly knaves back i say farther yet so they crowded back as he ordered many of them turning their faces away that they might not see what was about to happen  come cried little john here is my breast it is meet that the same hand that slew my dear master should butcher me also i know thee guy of gisbourne  peace little john said robin in a low voice twice thou hast said thou knowest me and yet thou knowest me not at all couldst thou not tell me beneath this wild beasts hide yonder just in front of thee lie my bow and arrows likewise my broadsword take them when i cut thy bonds now get them quickly so saying he cut the bonds and little john quick as a wink leaped forward and caught up the bow and arrows and the broadsword at the same time robin hood threw back the cowl of horses hide from his face and bent guy of gisbournes bow with a keen barbed arrow fitted to the string stand back cried he sternly the first man that toucheth finger to bowstring dieth i have slain thy man sheriff take heed that it is not thy turn next then seeing that little john had armed himself he clapped his bugle horn to his lips and blew three blasts both loud and shrill  now when the sheriff of nottingham saw whose face it was beneath guy of gisbournes hood and when he heard those bugle notes ring in his ear he felt as if his hour had come robin hood roared he and without another word he wheeled his horse in the road and went off in a cloud of dust the sheriffs men seeing their master thus fleeing for his life thought that it was not their business to tarry longer so clapping spurs to their horses they also dashed away after him but though the sheriff of nottingham went fast he could not outstrip a clothyard arrow little john twanged his bowstring with a shout and when the sheriff dashed in through the gates of nottingham town at full speed a gray goose shaft stuck out behind him like a moulting sparrow with one feather in its tail for a month afterward the poor sheriff could sit upon nought but the softest cushions that could be gotten for him  thus the sheriff and a score of men ran away from robin hood and little john so that when will stutely and a dozen or more of stout yeomen burst from out the covert they saw nought of their masters enemies for the sheriff and his men were scurrying away in the distance hidden within a cloud of dust like a little thunderstorm  then they all went back into the forest once more where they found the widows three sons who ran to little john and kissed his hands but it would not do for them to roam the forest at large any more so they promised that after they had gone and told their mother of their escape they would come that night to the greenwood tree and thenceforth become men of the band     king richard comes to sherwood forest  not more than two months had passed and gone since these stirring adventures befell robin hood and little john when all nottinghamshire was a mighty stir and tumult for king richard of the lions heart was making a royal progress through merry england and everyone expected him to come to nottingham town in his journeying messengers went riding back and forth between the sheriff and the king until at last the time was fixed upon when his majesty was to stop in nottingham as the guest of his worship  and now came more bustle than ever a great running hither and thither a rapping of hammers and a babble of voices sounded everywhere through the place for the folk were building great arches across the streets beneath which the king was to pass and were draping these arches with silken banners and streamers of many colors great hubbub was going on in the guild hall of the town also for here a grand banquet was to be given to the king and the nobles of his train and the best master carpenters were busy building a throne where the king and the sheriff were to sit at the head of the table side by side  it seemed to many of the good folk of the place as if the day that should bring the king into the town would never come but all the same it did come in its own season and bright shone the sun down into the stony streets which were all alive with a restless sea of people on either side of the way great crowds of town and country folk stood packed as close together as dried herring in a box so that the sheriffs men halberds in hands could hardly press them back to leave space for the kings riding  take care whom thou pushest against cried a great burly friar to one of these men wouldst thou dig thine elbows into me sirrah byr lady of the fountain an thou dost not treat me with more deference i will crack thy knaves pate for thee even though thou be one of the mighty sheriffs men  at this a great shout of laughter arose from a number of tall yeomen in lincoln green that were scattered through the crowd thereabouts but one that seemed of more authority than the others nudged the holy man with his elbow peace tuck said he didst thou not promise me ere thou camest here that thou wouldst put a check upon thy tongue  ay marry grumbled the other but a did not think to have a hardfooted knave trample all over my poor toes as though they were no more than so many acorns in the forest  but of a sudden all this bickering ceased for a clear sound of many bugle horns came winding down the street then all the people craned their necks and gazed in the direction whence the sound came and the crowding and the pushing and the swaying grew greater than ever and now a gallant array of men came gleaming into sight and the cheering of the people ran down the crowd as the fire runs in dry grass  eight and twenty heralds in velvet and cloth of gold came riding forward over their heads fluttered a cloud of snowwhite feathers and each herald bore in his hand a long silver trumpet which he blew musically from each trumpet hung a heavy banner of velvet and cloth of gold with the royal arms of england emblazoned thereon after these came riding fivescore noble knights two by two all fully armed saving that their heads were uncovered in their hands they bore tall lances from the tops of which fluttered pennons of many colors and devices by the side of each knight walked a page clad in rich clothes of silk and velvet and each page bore in his hands his masters helmet from which waved long floating plumes of feathers never had nottingham seen a fairer sight than those fivescore noble knights from whose armor the sun blazed in dazzling light as they came riding on their great war horses with clashing of arms and jingling of chains behind the knights came the barons and the nobles of the midcountry in robes of silk and cloth of gold with golden chains about their necks and jewels at their girdles behind these again came a great array of menatarms with spears and halberds in their hands and in the midst of these two riders side by side one of the horsemen was the sheriff of nottingham in his robes of office the other who was a head taller than the sheriff was clad in a rich but simple garb with a broad heavy chain about his neck his hair and beard were like threads of gold and his eyes were as blue as the summer sky as he rode along he bowed to the right hand and the left and a mighty roar of voices followed him as he passed for this was king richard  then above all the tumult and the shouting a great voice was heard roaring heaven its saints bless thee our gracious king richard and likewise our lady of the fountain bless thee then king richard looking toward the spot whence the sound came saw a tall burly strapping priest standing in front of all the crowd with his legs wide apart as he backed against those behind  by my soul sheriff said the king laughing ye have the tallest priests in nottinghamshire that eer i saw in all my life if heaven never answered prayers because of deafness methinks i would nevertheless have blessings bestowed upon me for that man yonder would make the great stone image of saint peter rub its ears and hearken unto him i would that i had an army of such as he  to this the sheriff answered never a word but all the blood left his cheeks and he caught at the pommel of his saddle to keep himself from falling for he also saw the fellow that so shouted and knew him to be friar tuck and moreover behind friar tuck he saw the faces of robin hood and little john and will scarlet and will stutely and allan a dale and others of the band  how now said the king hastily art thou ill sheriff that thou growest so white  nay your majesty said the sheriff it was nought but a sudden pain that will soon pass by thus he spake for he was ashamed that the king should know that robin hood feared him so little that he thus dared to come within the very gates of nottingham town  thus rode the king into nottingham town on that bright afternoon in the early fall season and none rejoiced more than robin hood and his merry men to see him come so royally unto his own   eventide had come the great feast in the guild hall at nottingham town was done and the wine passed freely a thousand waxen lights gleamed along the board at which sat lord and noble and knight and squire in goodly array at the head of the table upon a throne all hung with cloth of gold sat king richard with the sheriff of nottingham beside him  quoth the king to the sheriff laughing as he spoke i have heard much spoken concerning the doings of certain fellows hereabouts one robin hood and his band who are outlaws and abide in sherwood forest canst thou not tell me somewhat of them sir sheriff for i hear that thou hast had dealings with them more than once  at these words the sheriff of nottingham looked down gloomily and the bishop of hereford who was present gnawed his nether lip quoth the sheriff i can tell your majesty but little concerning the doings of those naughty fellows saving that they are the boldest lawbreakers in all the land  then up spake young sir henry of the lea a great favorite with the king under whom he had fought in palestine may it please your majesty said he when i was away in palestine i heard ofttimes from my father and in most cases i heard of this very fellow robin hood if your majesty would like i will tell you a certain adventure of this outlaw  then the king laughingly bade him tell his tale whereupon he told how robin hood had aided sir richard of the lea with money that he had borrowed from the bishop of hereford again and again the king and those present roared with laughter while the poor bishop waxed cherry red in the face with vexation for the matter was a sore thing with him when sir henry of the lea was done others of those present seeing how the king enjoyed this merry tale told other tales concerning robin and his merry men  by the hilt of my sword said stout king richard this is as bold and merry a knave as ever i heard tell of marry i must take this matter in hand and do what thou couldst not do sheriff to wit clear the forest of him and his band  that night the king sat in the place that was set apart for his lodging while in nottingham town with him were young sir henry of the lea and two other knights and three barons of nottinghamshire but the kings mind still dwelled upon robin hood now quoth he i would freely give a hundred pounds to meet this roguish fellow robin hood and to see somewhat of his doings in sherwood forest  then up spake sir hubert of gingham laughing if your majesty hath such a desire upon you it is not so hard to satisfy if your majesty is willing to lose one hundred pounds i will engage to cause you not only to meet this fellow but to feast with him in sherwood  marry sir hubert quoth the king this pleaseth me well but how wilt thou cause me to meet robin hood  why thus said sir hubert let your majesty and us here present put on the robes of seven of the order of black friars and let your majesty hang a purse of one hundred pounds beneath your gown then let us undertake to ride from here to mansfield town tomorrow and without i am much mistaken we will both meet with robin hood and dine with him before the day be passed  i like thy plan sir hubert quoth the king merrily and tomorrow we will try it and see whether there be virtue in it  so it happened that when early the next morning the sheriff came to where his liege lord was abiding to pay his duty to him the king told him what they had talked of the night before and what merry adventure they were set upon undertaking that morning but when the sheriff heard this he smote his forehead with his fist alas said he what evil counsel is this that hath been given thee o my gracious lord and king you know not what you do this villain that you thus go to seek hath no reverence either for king or kings laws  but did i not hear aright when i was told that this robin hood hath shed no blood since he was outlawed saving only that of that vile guy of gisbourne for whose death all honest men should thank him  yea your majesty said the sheriff you have heard aright nevertheless  then quoth the king breaking in on the sheriffs speech what have i to fear in meeting him having done him no harm truly there is no danger in this but mayhap thou wilt go with us sir sheriff  nay quoth the sheriff hastily heaven forbid  but now seven habits such as black friars wear were brought and the king and those about him having clad themselves therein and his majesty having hung a purse with a hundred golden pounds in it beneath his robes they all went forth and mounted the mules that had been brought to the door for them then the king bade the sheriff be silent as to their doings and so they set forth upon their way onward they traveled laughing and jesting until they passed through the open country between bare harvest fields whence the harvest had been gathered home through scattered glades that began to thicken as they went farther along till they came within the heavy shade of the forest itself they traveled in the forest for several miles without meeting anyone such as they sought until they had come to that part of the road that lay nearest to newstead abbey  by the holy saint martin quoth the king i would that i had a better head for remembering things of great need here have we come away and brought never so much as a drop of anything to drink with us now i would give half a hundred pounds for somewhat to quench my thirst withal  no sooner had the king so spoken than out from the covert at the roadside stepped a tall fellow with yellow beard and hair and a pair of merry blue eyes truly holy brother said he laying his hand upon the kings bridle rein it were an unchristian thing to not give fitting answer to so fair a bargain we keep an inn hereabouts and for fifty pounds we will not only give thee a good draught of wine but will give thee as noble a feast as ever thou didst tickle thy gullet withal so saying he put his fingers to his lips and blew a shrill whistle then straightway the bushes and branches on either side of the road swayed and crackled and threescore broadshouldered yeomen in lincoln green burst out of the covert  how now fellow quoth the king who art thou thou naughty rogue hast thou no regard for such holy men as we are  not a whit quoth merry robin hood for the fellow was he for in sooth all the holiness belonging to rich friars such as ye are one could drop into a thimble and the goodwife would never feel it with the tip of her finger as for my name it is robin hood and thou mayst have heard it before  now out upon thee quoth king richard thou art a bold and naughty fellow and a lawless one withal as i have often heard tell now prythee let me and these brethren of mine travel forward in peace and quietness  it may not be said robin for it would look but ill of us to let such holy men travel onward with empty stomachs but i doubt not that thou hast a fat purse to pay thy score at our inn since thou offerest freely so much for a poor draught of wine show me thy purse reverend brother or i may perchance have to strip thy robes from thee to search for it myself  nay use no force said the king sternly here is my purse but lay not thy lawless hands upon our person  hut tut quoth merry robin what proud words are these art thou the king of england to talk so to me here will take this purse and see what there is within  will scarlet took the purse and counted out the money then robin bade him keep fifty pounds for themselves and put fifty back into the purse this he handed to the king here brother quoth he take this half of thy money and thank saint martin on whom thou didst call before that thou hast fallen into the hands of such gentle rogues that they will not strip thee bare as they might do but wilt thou not put back thy cowl for i would fain see thy face  nay said the king drawing back i may not put back my cowl for we seven have vowed that we will not show our faces for four and twenty hours  then keep them covered in peace said robin and far be it from me to make you break your vows  so he called seven of his yeomen and bade them each one take a mule by the bridle then turning their faces toward the depths of the woodlands they journeyed onward until they came to the open glade and the greenwood tree  little john with threescore yeomen at his heels had also gone forth that morning to wait along the roads and bring a rich guest to sherwood glade if such might be his luck for many with fat purses must travel the roads at this time when such great doings were going on in nottinghamshire but though little john and so many others were gone friar tuck and twoscore or more stout yeomen were seated or lying around beneath the great tree and when robin and the others came they leaped to their feet to meet him  by my soul quoth merry king richard when he had gotten down from his mule and stood looking about him thou hast in very truth a fine lot of young men about thee robin methinks king richard himself would be glad of such a bodyguard  these are not all of my fellows said robin proudly for threescore more of them are away on business with my good righthand man little john but as for king richard i tell thee brother there is not a man of us all but would pour out our blood like water for him ye churchmen cannot rightly understand our king but we yeomen love him right loyally for the sake of his brave doings which are so like our own  but now friar tuck came bustling up gi ye good den brothers said he i am right glad to welcome some of my cloth in this naughty place truly methinks these rogues of outlaws would stand but an ill chance were it not for the prayers of holy tuck who laboreth so hard for their wellbeing here he winked one eye slyly and stuck his tongue into his cheek  who art thou mad priest said the king in a serious voice albeit he smiled beneath his cowl  at this friar tuck looked all around with a slow gaze look you now quoth he never let me hear you say again that i am no patient man here is a knave of a friar calleth me a mad priest and yet i smite him not my name is friar tuck fellowthe holy friar tuck  there tuck said robin thou hast said enow prythee cease thy talk and bring some wine these reverend men are athirst and sin they have paid so richly for their score they must een have the best  friar tuck bridled at being so checked in his speech nevertheless he went straightway to do robins bidding so presently a great crock was brought and wine was poured out for all the guests and for robin hood then robin held his cup aloft stay cried he tarry in your drinking till i give you a pledge here is to good king richard of great renown and may all enemies to him be confounded  then all drank the kings health even the king himself methinks good fellow said he thou hast drunk to thine own confusion  never a whit quoth merry robin for i tell thee that we of sherwood are more loyal to our lord the king than those of thine order we would give up our lives for his benefiting while ye are content to lie snug in your abbeys and priories let reign who will  at this the king laughed quoth he perhaps king richards welfare is more to me than thou wottest of fellow but enough of that matter we have paid well for our fare so canst thou not show us some merry entertainment i have oft heard that ye are wondrous archers wilt thou not show us somewhat of your skill  with all my heart said robin we are always pleased to show our guests all the sport that is to be seen as gaffer swanthold sayeth tis a hard heart that will not give a caged starling of the best and caged starlings ye are with us ho lads set up a garland at the end of the glade  then as the yeomen ran to do their masters bidding tuck turned to one of the mock friars hearest thou our master quoth he with a sly wink whenever he cometh across some poor piece of wit he straightway layeth it on the shoulders of this gaffer swantholdwhoever he may beso that the poor goodman goeth traveling about with all the odds and ends and tags and rags of our masters brain packed on his back thus spake friar tuck but in a low voice so that robin could not hear him for he felt somewhat nettled at robins cutting his talk so short  in the meantime the mark at which they were to shoot was set up at sixscore paces distance it was a garland of leaves and flowers two spans in width which same was hung upon a stake in front of a broad tree trunk there quoth robin yon is a fair mark lads each of you shoot three arrows thereat and if any fellow misseth by so much as one arrow he shall have a buffet of will scarlets fist  hearken to him quoth friar tuck why master thou dost bestow buffets from thy strapping nephew as though they were love taps from some bouncing lass i warrant thou art safe to hit the garland thyself or thou wouldst not be so free of his cuffing  first david of doncaster shot and lodged all three of his arrows within the garland well done david cried robin thou hast saved thine ears from a warming this day next midge the miller shot and he also lodged his arrows in the garland then followed wat the tinker but alas for him for one of his shafts missed the mark by the breadth of two fingers  come hither fellow said will scarlet in his soft gentle voice i owe thee somewhat that i would pay forthwith then wat the tinker came forward and stood in front of will scarlet screwing up his face and shutting his eyes tightly as though he already felt his ears ringing with the buffet will scarlet rolled up his sleeve and standing on tiptoe to give the greater swing to his arm he struck with might and main whoof came his palm against the tinkers head and down went stout wat to the grass heels over head as the wooden image at the fair goes down when the skillful player throws a cudgel at it then as the tinker sat up upon the grass rubbing his ear and winking and blinking at the bright stars that danced before his eyes the yeomen roared with mirth till the forest rang as for king richard he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks thus the band shot each in turn some getting off scot free and some winning a buffet that always sent them to the grass and now last of all robin took his place and all was hushed as he shot the first shaft he shot split a piece from the stake on which the garland was hung the second lodged within an inch of the other by my halidom said king richard to himself i would give a thousand pounds for this fellow to be one of my guard and now for the third time robin shot but alas for him the arrow was illfeathered and wavering to one side it smote an inch outside the garland  at this a great roar went up those of the yeomen who sat upon the grass rolling over and over and shouting with laughter for never before had they seen their master so miss his mark but robin flung his bow upon the ground with vexation now out upon it cried he that shaft had an ill feather to it for i felt it as it left my fingers give me a clean arrow and i will engage to split the wand with it  at these words the yeomen laughed louder than ever nay good uncle said will scarlet in his soft sweet voice thou hast had thy fair chance and hast missed thine aim out and out i swear the arrow was as good as any that hath been loosed this day come hither i owe thee somewhat and would fain pay it  go good master roared friar tuck and may my blessing go with thee thou hast bestowed these love taps of will scarlets with great freedom it were pity an thou gottest not thine own share  it may not be said merry robin i am king here and no subject may raise hand against the king but even our great king richard may yield to the holy pope without shame and even take a tap from him by way of penance therefore i will yield myself to this holy friar who seemeth to be one in authority and will take my punishment from him thus saying he turned to the king i prythee brother wilt thou take my punishing into thy holy hands  with all my heart quoth merry king richard rising from where he was sitting i owe thee somewhat for having lifted a heavy weight of fifty pounds from my purse so make room for him on the green lads  an thou makest me tumble quoth robin i will freely give thee back thy fifty pounds but i tell thee brother if thou makest me not feel grass all along my back i will take every farthing thou hast for thy boastful speech  so be it said the king i am willing to venture it thereupon he rolled up his sleeve and showed an arm that made the yeomen stare but robin with his feet wide apart stood firmly planted waiting the other smiling then the king swung back his arm and balancing himself a moment he delivered a buffet at robin that fell like a thunderbolt down went robin headlong upon the grass for the stroke would have felled a stone wall then how the yeomen shouted with laughter till their sides ached for never had they seen such a buffet given in all their lives as for robin he presently sat up and looked all around him as though he had dropped from a cloud and had lit in a place he had never seen before after a while still gazing about him at his laughing yeomen he put his fingertips softly to his ear and felt all around it tenderly will scarlet said he count this fellow out his fifty pounds i want nothing more either of his money or of him a murrain seize him and his buffeting i would that i had taken my dues from thee for i verily believe he hath deafened mine ear from ever hearing again  then while gusts of laughter still broke from the band will scarlet counted out the fifty pounds and the king dropped it back into his purse again i give thee thanks fellow said he and if ever thou shouldst wish for another box of the ear to match the one thou hast come to me and i will fit thee with it for nought  so spake the merry king but even as he ended there came suddenly the sound of many voices and out from the covert burst little john and threescore men with sir richard of the lea in the midst across the glade they came running and as they came sir richard shouted to robin make haste dear friend gather thy band together and come with me king richard left nottingham town this very morning and cometh to seek thee in the woodlands i know not how he cometh for it was but a rumor of this that reached me nevertheless i know that it is the truth therefore hasten with all thy men and come to castle lea for there thou mayst lie hidden till thy present danger passeth who are these strangers that thou hast with thee  why quoth merry robin rising from the grass these are certain gentle guests that came with us from the highroad over by newstead abbey i know not their names but i have become right well acquaint with this lusty rogues palm this morning marry the pleasure of this acquaintance hath dost me a deaf ear and fifty pounds to boot  sir richard looked keenly at the tall friar who drawing himself up to his full height looked fixedly back at the knight then of a sudden sir richards cheeks grew pale for he knew who it was that he looked upon quickly he leaped from off his horses back and flung himself upon his knees before the other at this the king seeing that sir richard knew him threw back his cowl and all the yeomen saw his face and knew him also for there was not one of them but had been in the crowd in the good town of nottingham and had seen him riding side by side with the sheriff down they fell upon their knees nor could they say a word then the king looked all around right grimly and last of all his glance came back and rested again upon sir richard of the lea  how is this sir richard said he sternly how darest thou step between me and these fellows and how darest thou offer thy knightly castle of the lea for a refuge to them wilt thou make it a hiding place for the most renowned outlaws in england  then sir richard of the lea raised his eyes to the kings face far be it from me said he to do aught that could bring your majestys anger upon me yet sooner would i face your majestys wrath than suffer aught of harm that i could stay to fall upon robin hood and his band for to them i owe life honor everything should i then desert him in his hour of need  ere the knight had done speaking one of the mock friars that stood near the king came forward and knelt beside sir richard and throwing back his cowl showed the face of young sir henry of the lea then sir henry grasped his fathers hand and said here kneels one who hath served thee well king richard and as thou knowest hath stepped between thee and death in palestine yet do i abide by my dear father and here i say also that i would freely give shelter to this noble outlaw robin hood even though it brought thy wrath upon me for my fathers honor and my fathers welfare are as dear to me as mine own  king richard looked from one to the other of the kneeling knights and at last the frown faded from his brow and a smile twitched at the corners of his lips marry sir richard quoth the king thou art a boldspoken knight and thy freedom of speech weigheth not heavily against thee with me this young son of thine taketh after his sire both in boldness of speech and of deed for as he sayeth he stepped one time betwixt me and death wherefore i would pardon thee for his sake even if thou hadst done more than thou hast rise all of you for ye shall suffer no harm through me this day for it were pity that a merry time should end in a manner as to mar its joyousness  then all arose and the king beckoned robin hood to come to him how now quoth he is thine ear still too deaf to hear me speak  mine ears would be deafened in death ere they would cease to hear your majestys voice said robin as for the blow that your majesty struck me i would say that though my sins are haply many methinks they have been paid up in full thereby  thinkest thou so said the king with somewhat of sternness in his voice now i tell thee that but for three things to wit my mercifulness my love for a stout woodsman and the loyalty thou hast avowed for me thine ears mayhap might have been more tightly closed than ever a buffet from me could have shut them talk not lightly of thy sins good robin but come look up thy danger is past for hereby i give thee and all thy band free pardon but in sooth i cannot let you roam the forest as ye have done in the past therefore i will take thee at thy word when thou didst say thou wouldst give thy service to me and thou shalt go back to london with me we will take that bold knave little john also and likewise thy cousin will scarlet and thy minstrel allan a dale as for the rest of thy band we will take their names and have them duly recorded as royal rangers for methinks it were wiser to have them changed to lawabiding caretakers of our deer in sherwood than to leave them to run at large as outlawed slayers thereof but now get a feast ready i would see how ye live in the woodlands  so robin bade his men make ready a grand feast straightway great fires were kindled and burned brightly at which savory things roasted sweetly while this was going forward the king bade robin call allan a dale for he would hear him sing so word was passed for allan and presently he came bringing his harp  marry said king richard if thy singing match thy looks it is fair enough prythee strike up a ditty and let us have a taste of thy skill  then allan touched his harp lightly and all words were hushed while he sang thus       oh where has thou been my daughter      oh where hast thou been this day      daughter my daughter      oh i have been to the rivers side      where the waters lie all gray and wide      and the gray sky broods oer the leaden tide      and the shrill wind sighs a straining       what sawest thou there my daughter      what sawest thou there this day      daughter my daughter      oh i saw a boat come drifting nigh      where the quivering rushes hiss and sigh      and the water soughs as it gurgles by      and the shrill wind sighs a straining       what sailed in the boat my daughter      what sailed in the boat this day      daughter my daughter      oh there was one all clad in white      and about his face hung a pallid light      and his eyes gleamed sharp like the stars at night      and the shrill wind sighed a straining       and what said he my daughter      what said he to thee this day      daughter my daughter      oh said he nought but did he this      thrice on my lips did he press a kiss      and my heartstrings shrunk with an awful bliss      and the shrill wind sighed a straining       why growest thou so cold my daughter      why growest thou so cold and white      daughter my daughter      oh never a word the daughter said      but she sat all straight with a drooping head      for her heart was stilled and her face was dead      and the shrill wind sighed a straining  all listened in silence and when allan a dale had done king richard heaved a sigh by the breath of my body allan quoth he thou hast such a wondrous sweet voice that it strangely moves my heart but what doleful ditty is this for the lips of a stout yeoman i would rather hear thee sing a song of love and battle than a sad thing like that moreover i understand it not what meanest thou by the words  i know not your majesty said allan shaking his head for ofttimes i sing that which i do not clearly understand mine own self  well well quoth the king let it pass only i tell thee this allan thou shouldst turn thy songs to such matters as i spoke of to wit love or war for in sooth thou hast a sweeter voice than blondell and methought he was the best minstrel that ever i heard  but now one came forward and said that the feast was ready so robin hood brought king richard and those with him to where it lay all spread out on fair white linen cloths which lay upon the soft green grass then king richard sat him down and feasted and drank and when he was done he swore roundly that he had never sat at such a lusty repast in all his life before  that night he lay in sherwood forest upon a bed of sweet green leaves and early the next morning he set forth from the woodlands for nottingham town robin hood and all of his band going with him you may guess what a stir there was in the good town when all these famous outlaws came marching into the streets as for the sheriff he knew not what to say nor where to look when he saw robin hood in such high favor with the king while all his heart was filled with gall because of the vexation that lay upon him  the next day the king took leave of nottingham town so robin hood and little john and will scarlet and allan a dale shook hands with all the rest of the band kissing the cheeks of each man and swearing that they would often come to sherwood and see them then each mounted his horse and rode away in the train of the king     epilogue  thus end the merry adventures of robin hood for in spite of his promise it was many a year ere he saw sherwood again  after a year or two at court little john came back to nottinghamshire where he lived in an orderly way though within sight of sherwood and where he achieved great fame as the champion of all england with the quarterstaff will scarlet after a time came back to his own home whence he had been driven by his unlucky killing of his fathers steward the rest of the band did their duty as royal rangers right well but robin hood and allan a dale did not come again to sherwood so quickly for thus it was  robin through his great fame as an archer became a favorite with the king so that he speedily rose in rank to be the chief of all the yeomen at last the king seeing how faithful and how loyal he was created him earl of huntingdon so robin followed the king to the wars and found his time so full that he had no chance to come back to sherwood for even so much as a day as for allan a dale and his wife the fair ellen they followed robin hood and shared in all his ups and downs of life  and now dear friend you who have journeyed with me in all these merry doings i will not bid you follow me further but will drop your hand here with a good den if you wish it for that which cometh hereafter speaks of the breaking up of things and shows how joys and pleasures that are dead and gone can never be set upon their feet to walk again i will not dwell upon the matter overlong but will tell as speedily as may be of how that stout fellow robin hood died as he had lived not at court as earl of huntingdon but with bow in hand his heart in the greenwood and he himself a right yeoman  king richard died upon the battlefield in such a way as properly became a lionhearted king as you yourself no doubt know so after a time the earl of huntingdonor robin hood as we still call him as of oldfinding nothing for his doing abroad came back to merry england again with him came allan a dale and his wife the fair ellen for these two had been chief of robins household ever since he had left sherwood forest  it was in the springtime when they landed once more on the shores of england the leaves were green and the small birds sang blithely just as they used to do in fair sherwood when robin hood roamed the woodland shades with a free heart and a light heel all the sweetness of the time and the joyousness of everything brought back to robins mind his forest life so that a great longing came upon him to behold the woodlands once more so he went straightway to king john and besought leave of him to visit nottingham for a short season the king gave him leave to come and to go but bade him not stay longer than three days at sherwood so robin hood and allan a dale set forth without delay to nottinghamshire and sherwood forest  the first night they took up their inn at nottingham town yet they did not go to pay their duty to the sheriff for his worship bore many a bitter grudge against robin hood which grudges had not been lessened by robins rise in the world the next day at an early hour they mounted their horses and set forth for the woodlands as they passed along the road it seemed to robin that he knew every stick and stone that his eyes looked upon yonder was a path that he had ofttimes trod of a mellow evening with little john beside him here was one now nigh choked with brambles along which he and a little band had walked when they went forth to seek a certain curtal friar  thus they rode slowly onward talking about these old familiar things old and yet new for they found more in them than they had ever thought of before thus at last they came to the open glade and the broad widespreading greenwood tree which was their home for so many years neither of the two spoke when they stood beneath that tree robin looked all about him at the wellknown things so like what they used to be and yet so different for where once was the bustle of many busy fellows was now the quietness of solitude and as he looked the woodlands the greensward and the sky all blurred together in his sight through salt tears for such a great yearning came upon him as he looked on these things as well known to him as the fingers of his right hand that he could not keep back the water from his eyes  that morning he had slung his good old bugle horn over his shoulder and now with the yearning came a great longing to sound his bugle once more he raised it to his lips he blew a blast tirila lirila the sweet clear notes went winding down the forest paths coming back again from the more distant bosky shades in faint echoes of sound tirila lirila tirila lirila until it faded away and was lost  now it chanced that on that very morn little john was walking through a spur of the forest upon certain matters of business and as he paced along sunk in meditation the faint clear notes of a distant bugle horn came to his ear as leaps the stag when it feels the arrow at its heart so leaped little john when that distant sound met his ear all the blood in his body seemed to rush like a flame into his cheeks as he bent his head and listened again came the bugle note thin and clear and yet again it sounded then little john gave a great wild cry of yearning of joy and yet of grief and putting down his head he dashed into the thicket onward he plunged crackling and rending as the wild boar rushes through the underbrush little recked he of thorns and briers that scratched his flesh and tore his clothing for all he thought of was to get by the shortest way to the greenwood glade whence he knew the sound of the bugle horn came out he burst from the covert at last a shower of little broken twigs falling about him and without pausing a moment rushed forward and flung himself at robins feet then he clasped his arms around the masters knees and all his body was shaken with great sobs neither could robin nor allan a dale speak but stood looking down at little john the tears rolling down their cheeks  while they thus stood seven royal rangers rushed into the open glade and raised a great shout of joy at the sight of robin and at their head was will stutely then after a while came four more panting with their running and two of these four were will scathelock and midge the miller for all of these had heard the sound of robin hoods horn all these ran to robin and kissed his hands and his clothing with great sound of weeping  after a while robin looked around him with teardimmed eyes and said in a husky voice now i swear that never again will i leave these dear woodlands i have been away from them and from you too long now do i lay by the name of robert earl of huntingdon and take upon me once again that nobler title robin hood the yeoman at this a great shout went up and all the yeomen shook one anothers hands for joy  the news that robin hood had come back again to dwell in sherwood as of old spread like wildfire all over the countryside so that ere a seennight had passed nearly all of his old yeomen had gathered about him again but when the news of all this reached the ears of king john he swore both loud and deep and took a solemn vow that he would not rest until he had robin hood in his power dead or alive now there was present at court a certain knight sir william dale as gallant a soldier as ever donned harness sir william dale was well acquainted with sherwood forest for he was head keeper over that part of it that lay nigh to good mansfield town so to him the king turned and bade him take an army of men and go straightway to seek robin hood likewise the king gave sir william his signet ring to show to the sheriff that he might raise all his armed men to aid the others in their chase of robin so sir william and the sheriff set forth to do the kings bidding and to search for robin hood and for seven days they hunted up and down yet found him not  now had robin hood been as peaceful as of old everything might have ended in smoke as other such ventures had always done before but he had fought for years under king richard and was changed from what he used to be it galled his pride to thus flee away before those sent against him as a chased fox flees from the hounds so thus it came about at last that robin hood and his yeomen met sir william and the sheriff and their men in the forest and a bloody fight followed the first man slain in that fight was the sheriff of nottingham for he fell from his horse with an arrow in his brain ere half a score of shafts had been sped many a better man than the sheriff kissed the sod that day but at last sir william dale being wounded and most of his men slain he withdrew beaten and left the forest but scores of good fellows were left behind him stretched out all stiff beneath the sweet green boughs  but though robin hood had beaten off his enemies in fair fight all this lay heavily upon his mind so that he brooded over it until a fever seized upon him for three days it held him and though he strove to fight it off he was forced to yield at last thus it came that on the morning of the fourth day he called little john to him and told him that he could not shake the fever from him and that he would go to his cousin the prioress of the nunnery near kirklees in yorkshire who was a skillful leech and he would have her open a vein in his arm and take a little blood from him for the bettering of his health then he bade little john make ready to go also for he might perchance need aid in his journeying so little john and he took their leave of the others and robin hood bade will stutely be the captain of the band until they should come back thus they came by easy stages and slow journeying until they reached the nunnery of kirklees  now robin had done much to aid this cousin of his for it was through king richards love of him that she had been made prioress of the place but there is nought in the world so easily forgot as gratitude so when the prioress of kirklees had heard how her cousin the earl of huntingdon had thrown away his earldom and gone back again to sherwood she was vexed to the soul and feared lest her cousinship with him should bring the kings wrath upon her also thus it happened that when robin came to her and told her how he wished her services as leech she began plotting ill against him in her mind thinking that by doing evil to him she might find favor with his enemies nevertheless she kept this well to herself and received robin with seeming kindness she led him up the winding stone stair to a room which was just beneath the eaves of a high round tower but she would not let little john come with him  so the poor yeoman turned his feet away from the door of the nunnery and left his master in the hands of the women but though he did not come in neither did he go far away for he laid him down in a little glade near by where he could watch the place that robin abided like some great faithful dog turned away from the door where his master has entered  after the women had gotten robin hood to the room beneath the eaves the prioress sent all of the others away then taking a little cord she tied it tightly about robins arm as though she were about to bleed him and so she did bleed him but the vein she opened was not one of those that lie close and blue beneath the skin deeper she cut than that for she opened one of those veins through which the bright red blood runs leaping from the heart of this robin knew not for though he saw the blood flow it did not come fast enough to make him think that there was anything ill in it  having done this vile deed the prioress turned and left her cousin locking the door behind her all that livelong day the blood ran from robin hoods arm nor could he check it though he strove in every way to do so again and again he called for help but no help came for his cousin had betrayed him and little john was too far away to hear his voice so he bled and bled until he felt his strength slipping away from him then he arose tottering and bearing himself up by the palms of his hands against the wall he reached his bugle horn at last thrice he sounded it but weakly and faintly for his breath was fluttering through sickness and loss of strength nevertheless little john heard it where he lay in the glade and with a heart all sick with dread he came running and leaping toward the nunnery loudly he knocked at the door and in a loud voice shouted for them to let him in but the door was of massive oak strongly barred and studded with spikes so they felt safe and bade little john begone  then little johns heart was mad with grief and fear for his masters life wildly he looked about him and his sight fell upon a heavy stone mortar such as three men could not lift nowadays little john took three steps forward and bending his back heaved the stone mortar up from where it stood deeply rooted staggering under its weight he came forward and hurled it crashing against the door in burst the door and away fled the frightened nuns shrieking at his coming then little john strode in and never a word said he but up the winding stone steps he ran till he reached the room wherein his master was here he found the door locked also but putting his shoulder against it he burst the locks as though they were made of brittle ice  there he saw his own dear master leaning against the gray stone wall his face all white and drawn and his head swaying to and fro with weakness then with a great wild cry of love and grief and pity little john leaped forward and caught robin hood in his arms up he lifted him as a mother lifts her child and carrying him to the bed laid him tenderly thereon  and now the prioress came in hastily for she was frightened at what she had done and dreaded the vengeance of little john and the others of the band then she stanched the blood by cunning bandages so that it flowed no more all the while little john stood grimly by and after she had done he sternly bade her to begone and she obeyed pale and trembling then after she had departed little john spake cheering words laughing loudly and saying that all this was a childs fright and that no stout yeoman would die at the loss of a few drops of blood why quoth he give thee a seennight and thou wilt be roaming the woodlands as boldly as ever  but robin shook his head and smiled faintly where he lay mine own dear little john whispered he heaven bless thy kind rough heart but dear friend we will never roam the woodlands together again  ay but we will quoth little john loudly i say again ayout upon itwho dares say that any more harm shall come upon thee am i not by let me see who dares touch here he stopped of a sudden for his words choked him at last he said in a deep husky voice now if aught of harm befalls thee because of this days doings i swear by saint george that the red cock shall crow over the rooftree of this house for the hot flames shall lick every crack and cranny thereof as for these womenhere he ground his teethit will be an ill day for them  but robin hood took little johns rough brown fist in his white hands and chid him softly in his low weak voice asking him since what time little john had thought of doing harm to women even in vengeance thus he talked till at last the other promised in a choking voice that no ill should fall upon the place no matter what happened then a silence fell and little john sat with robin hoods hand in his gazing out of the open window ever and anon swallowing a great lump that came in his throat meantime the sun dropped slowly to the west till all the sky was ablaze with a red glory then robin hood in a weak faltering voice bade little john raise him that he might look out once more upon the woodlands so the yeoman lifted him in his arms as he bade and robin hoods head lay on his friends shoulder long he gazed with a wide lingering look while the other sat with bowed head the hot tears rolling one after another from his eyes and dripping upon his bosom for he felt that the time of parting was near at hand then presently robin hood bade him string his stout bow for him and choose a smooth fair arrow from his quiver this little john did though without disturbing his master or rising from where he sat robin hoods fingers wrapped lovingly around his good bow and he smiled faintly when he felt it in his grasp then he nocked the arrow on that part of the string that the tips of his fingers knew so well little john said he little john mine own dear friend and him i love better than all others in the world mark i prythee where this arrow lodges and there let my grave be digged lay me with my face toward the east little john and see that my resting place be kept green and that my weary bones be not disturbed  as he finished speaking he raised himself of a sudden and sat upright his old strength seemed to come back to him and drawing the bowstring to his ear he sped the arrow out of the open casement as the shaft flew his hand sank slowly with the bow till it lay across his knees and his body likewise sank back again into little johns loving arms but something had sped from that body even as the winged arrow sped from the bow  for some minutes little john sat motionless but presently he laid that which he held gently down then folding the hands upon the breast and covering up the face he turned upon his heel and left the room without a word or a sound  upon the steep stairway he met the prioress and some of the chief among the sisters to them he spoke in a deep quivering voice and said he an ye go within a score of feet of yonder room i will tear down your rookery over your heads so that not one stone shall be left upon another bear my words well in mind for i mean them so saying he turned and left them and they presently saw him running rapidly across the open through the falling of the dusk until he was swallowed up by the forest  the early gray of the coming morn was just beginning to lighten the black sky toward the eastward when little john and six more of the band came rapidly across the open toward the nunnery they saw no one for the sisters were all hidden away from sight having been frightened by little johns words up the stone stair they ran and a great sound of weeping was presently heard after a while this ceased and then came the scuffling and shuffling of mens feet as they carried a heavy weight down the steep and winding stairs so they went forth from the nunnery and as they passed through the doors thereof a great loud sound of wailing arose from the glade that lay all dark in the dawning as though many men hidden in the shadows had lifted up their voices in sorrow  thus died robin hood at kirklees nunnery in fair yorkshire with mercy in his heart toward those that had been his undoing for thus he showed mercy for the erring and pity for the weak through all the time of his living  his yeomen were scattered henceforth but no great ill befell them thereafter for a more merciful sheriff and one who knew them not so well succeeding the one that had gone and they being separated here and there throughout the countryside they abided in peace and quietness so that many lived to hand down these tales to their children and their childrens children  a certain one sayeth that upon a stone at kirklees is an old inscription this i give in the ancient english in which it was written and thus it runs  hear undernead dis laitl

we also must part for our merry journeyings have ended and here at the grave of robin hood we turn each going his own way
