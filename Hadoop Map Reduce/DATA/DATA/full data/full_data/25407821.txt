25407821	the house of heine brothers in munich  by anthony trollope     the house of heine brothers in munich was of good repute at the time of which i am about to tella time not long ago and is so still i trust  it was of good repute in its own way seeing that no man doubted the word or solvency of heine brothers but they did not possess as bankers what would in england be considered a large or profitable business  the operations of english bankers are bewildering in their magnitude  legions of clerks are employed the senior bookkeepers though only salaried servants are themselves great men while the real partners are inscrutable mysterious opulent beyond measure and altogether unknown to their customers  take any firm at randombrown jones and cox let us saythe probability is that jones has been dead these fifty years that brown is a cabinet minister and that cox is master of a pack of hounds in leicestershire  but it was by no means so with the house of heine brothers of munich  there they were the two elderly men daily to be seen at their dingy office in the schrannen platz and if any business was to be transacted requiring the interchange of more than a word or two it was the younger brother with whom the customer was as a matter of course brought into contact  there were three clerks in the establishment an old man namely who sat with the elder brother and had no personal dealings with the public a young englishman of whom we shall anon hear more and a boy who ran messages put the wood on to the stoves and swept out the bank  truly he house of heine brothers was of no great importance but nevertheless it was of good repute  the office i have said was in the schrannen platz or old market place  munich as every one knows is chiefly to be noted as a new townso new that many of the streets and most of the palaces look as though they had been sent home last night from the builders and had only just been taken out of their bandboxes it is angular methodical unfinished and palatial  but there is an old town and though the old town be not of surpassing interest it is as dingy crooked intricate and dark as other old towns in germany here in the old marketplace up one long broad staircase were situated the two rooms in which was held the bank of heine brothers  of the elder member of the firm we shall have something to say before this story be completed  he was an old bachelor and was possessed of a bachelors dwelling somewhere out in the suburbs of the city  the junior brother was a married man with a wife some twenty years younger than himself with two daughters the elder of whom was now oneandtwenty and one son  his name was ernest heine whereas the senior brother was known as uncle hatto  ernest heine and his wife inhabited a portion of one of those new palatial residences at the further end of the ludwigs strasse but not because they thus lived must it be considered that they were palatial people  by no means let it be so thought as such an idea would altogether militate against whatever truth of character painting there may be in this tale  they were not palatial people but the very reverse living in homely guise pursuing homely duties and satisfied with homely pleasures  up two pairs of stairs however in that street of palaces they lived having there a commodious suite of large rooms furnished after the manner of the germans somewhat gaudily as regarded their best salon and with somewhat meagre comfort as regarded their other rooms  but whether in respect of that which was meagre or whether in respect of that which was gaudy they were as well off as their neighbours and this as i take it is the point of excellence which is desirable  ernest heine was at this time over sixty his wife was past forty and his eldest daughter as i have said was twentyone years of age  his second child also a girl was six years younger and their third child a boy had not been born till another similar interval had elapsed  he was named hatto after his uncle and the two girls had been christened isa and agnes  such in number and mode of life was the family of the heines  we english folk are apt to imagine that we are nearer akin to germans than to our other continental neighbours  this may be so in blood but nevertheless the difference in manners is so striking that it could hardly be enhanced  an englishman moving himself off to a city in the middle of central america will find the customs to which he must adapt himself less strange to him there than he would in many a german town  but in no degree of life is the difference more remarkable than among unmarried but marriageable young women it is not my purpose at the present moment to attribute a superiority in this matter to either nationality  each has its own charm its own excellence its own heavengiven grace whereby men are led up to purer thoughts and sweet desires and each may possibly have its own defect  i will not here describe the excellence or defect of either but will if it be in my power say a word as to this difference  the german girl of oneandtwenty our isas ageis more sedate more womanly more meditative than her english sister  the worlds work is more in her thoughts and the worlds amusements less so  she probably knows less of those things which women learn than the english girl but that which she does know is nearer to her hand for use  she is not so much accustomed to society but nevertheless she is more mistress of her own manner  she is not taught to think so much of those things which flurry and disturb the mind and therefore she is seldom flurried and disturbed  to both of them lovethe idea of love must be the thought of all the most absorbing for is it not fated for them that the joys and sorrows of their future life must depend upon it  but the idea of the german girl is the more realistic and the less romantic  poetry and fiction she may have read though of the latter sparingly but they will not have imbued her with that hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so often fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home  she is moderate in her aspirations requiring less excitement than an english girl and never forgetting the solid necessities of life as they are so often forgotten here in england  in associating with young men an english girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find an admirer whom she may possibly love or an admirer whom she may probably be called on to repel  she is ever conscious of the fact of this position and a romance is thus engendered which if it may at times be dangerous is at any rate always charming  but the german girl in her simplicity has no such consciousness  as you and i my reader might probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other so may the german girl learn to love the fairhaired youth with whom chance has for a time associated her but to her mind there occurs no suggestive reason why it should be sono probability that the youth may regard her in such light because that chance has come to pass  she can therefore give him her hand without trepidation and talk with him for half an hour when called on to do so as calmly as she might do with his sister  such a one was isa heine at the time of which i am writing  we english in our passion for daily excitement might call her phlegmatic but we should call her so unjustly  life to her was a serious matter of which the daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts  she was her mothers companion the instructress of both her brother and her sister and the charm of her fathers vacant hours  with such calls upon her time and so many realities around her her imagination did not teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home  when love and marriage should come to her as come they probably might she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties  in the meantime she was contented to keep her mothers accounts and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the ludwigs strasse  but change would certainly come we may prophesy for isa heine was a beautiful girl tall and graceful comely to the eye and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a mans home  i have said that an english clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy bankingoffice in the schrannen platz and i must say a word or two of herbert onslow  in his early career he had not been fortunate  his father with means sufficiently moderate and with a family more than sufficiently large had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle and then to one of the universities at which he had run into debt and had therefore left without a degree  when this occurred a family council of war had been held among the onslows and it was decided that herbert should be sent off to the bankinghouse of heines at munich there being a cousinship between the families and some existing connections of business  it was therefore so settled and herbert willing enough to see the worldas he considered he should do by going to munich started for his german home with injunctions very tender from his mother and very solemn from his aggrieved father  but there was nothing bad at the heart about young onslow and if the solemn father had well considered it he might perhaps have felt that those debts at cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son when herbert arrived at munich his cousins the heinesfaraway cousins though they werebehaved kindly to him  they established him at first in lodgings where he was boarded with many others having heard somewhat of his early youth  but when madame heine at the end of twelve months perceived that he was punctual at the bank and that his allowances which though moderate in england were handsome in munich carried him on without debt she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself that he should live with them  in this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the ludwigs strasse  but all this happened long ago  isa heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to munich and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman  and when as she ripened into womanhood this young man came more closely among them it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others  her uncle and father she knew had approved of herbert at the bank and herbert had shown that he could be steady therefore he was to be taken into their family paying his annual subsidy instead of being left with strangers at the boardinghouse  all this was very simple to her she assisted in mending his linen as she did her fathers she visited his room daily as she visited all the others she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangementbut by no means such notice as she did of her fathers and without any flutter inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world she made him one of the family  so things went on for a yearnay so things went on for two years with her after herbert onslow had come to the ludwigs strasse  but the matter had been regarded in a very different light by herbert himself  when the proposition had been made to him his first idea had been that so close a connection with a girl so very pretty would be delightful  he had blushed as he had given in his adhesion but madame heine when she saw the blush had attributed it to anything but the true cause  when isa had asked him as to his wants and wishes he had blushed again but she had been as ignorant as her mother  the father had merely stipulated that as the young englishman paid for his board he should have the full value of his money so that isa and agnes gave up their pretty front room going into one that was inferior and hatto was put to sleep in the little closet that had been papas own peculiar property  but nobody complained of this for it was understood that the money was of service  for the first year herbert found that nothing especial happened  he always fancied that he was in love with isa and wrote some poetry about her  but the poetry was in english and isa could not read it even had he dared to show it to her  during the second year he went home to england for three months and by confessing a passion to one of his sisters really brought himself to feel one  he returned to munich resolved to tell isa that the possibility of his remaining there depended upon her acceptance of his heart but for months he did not find himself able to put his resolution in force she was so sedate so womanly so attentive as regarded cousinly friendship and so cold as regarded everything else that he did not know how to speak to her  with an english girl whom he had met three times at a ball he might have been much more able to make progress  he was alone with isa frequently for neither father mother nor isa herself objected to such communion but yet things so went between them that he could not take her by the hand and tell her that he loved her  and thus the third year of his life in munich and the second of his residence in the ludwigs strasse went by him  so the years went by and isa was now past twenty  to herbert in his reveries it seemed as though life and the joys of life were slipping away from him  but no such feeling disturbed any of the heines  life of course was slipping away but then is it not the destiny of man that life should slip away  their wants were all satisfied and for them that together with their close family affection was happiness enough  at last however herbert so spoke or so looked that both isa and her mother that his heart was touched  he still declared to himself that he had made no sign and that he was an oaf an ass a coward in that he had not done so  but he had made some sign and the sign had been read  there was no secretno necessity for a secret on the subject between the mother and daughter but yet it was not spoken of all at once  there was some little increase of caution between them as herberts name was mentioned so that gradually each knew what the other thought but for weeks that was all  then at last the mother spoke out  isa she said i think that herbert onslow is becoming attached to you  he has never said so mamma  no i am sure he has not  had he done so you would have told me nevertheless is it not true  well mamma i cannot say  it may be so  such an idea has occurred to me but i have abandoned it as needless  if he has anything to say he will say it  and if he were to speak how should you answer him  i should take time to think  i do not at all know what means he has for a separate establishment  then the subject was dropped between them for that time and isa in her communications with her cousin was somewhat more reserved than she had been  isa are you in love with herbert agnes asked her as they were together in their room one night  in love with him  no why should i be in love with him  i think he is in love with you said agnes  that is quite another thing said isa laughing  but if so he has not taken me into his confidence  perhaps he has you  oh no  he would not do that i think  not but what we are great friends and i love him dearly  would it not be nice for you and him to be betrothed  that depends on many things my dear  oh yes i know  perhaps he has not got money enough  but you could live here you know and he has got some money because he so often rides on horseback  and then the matter was dropped between the two sisters  herbert had given english lessons to the two girls but the lessons had been found tedious and had dwindled away  isa nevertheless had kept up her exercises duly translating german into english and english into german and occasionally she had shown them to her cousin  now however she altogether gave over such showing of them but nevertheless worked at the task with more energy than before  isa he said to her one dayhaving with some difficulty found her alone in the parlour isa why should not we go on with our english  because it is troublesometo you i mean  troublesome  well yes it is troublesome  nothing good is to be had without trouble  but i should like it if you would not mind  you know how sick you were of it beforebesides i shall never be able to speak it  i shall not get sick of it now isa  oh yes you wouldin two days  and i want you to speak it  i desire it especially  why especially asked isa  and even she with all her tranquillity of demeanour could hardly preserve her even tone and quiet look as she asked the necessary question  i will tell you why said herbert and as he spoke he got up from his seat and took a step or two over towards her where she was sitting near the window  isa as she saw him still continued her work and strove hard to give to the stitches all that attention which they required  i will tell you why i would wish you to talk my language  because i love you isa and would have you for my wifeif that be possible  she still continued her work and the stitches if not quite as perfect as usual sufficed for their purpose  that is why i wish it  now will you consent to learn from me again  if i did herbert that consent would include another  yes certainly it would  that is what i intend  and now will you learn from me again  that isyou mean to ask will i marry you  will you love me  can you learn to love me  oh isa i have thought of this so long  but you have seemed so cold that i have not dared to speak  isa can you love me  and he sat himself close beside her  now that the ice was broken he was quite prepared to become an ardent loverif she would allow of such ardour  but as he sat down she rose  i cannot answer such a question on the sudden she said  give me till tomorrow herbert and then i will make you a reply whereupon she left him and he stood alone in the room having done the deed on which he had been meditating for the last two years about half an hour afterwards he met her on the stairs as he was going to his chamber  may i speak to your father about this he said hardly stopping her as he asked the question  oh yes surely she answered and then again they parted  to him this lastaccorded permission sounded as though it carried with it more weight than it in truth possessed  in his own country a reference to the ladys father is taken as indicating a full consent on the ladys part should the stern paterfamilias raise no objection  but isa had no such meaning  she had told him that she could not give her answer till the morrow  if however he chose to consult her father on the subject she had no objection  it would probably be necessary that she should discuss the whole matter in family conclave before she could bring herself to give any reply  on that night before he went to bed he did speak to her father and isa also before she went to rest spoke to her mother  it was singular to him that there should appear to be so little privacy on the subject that there should be held to be so little necessity for a secret  had he made a suggestion that an extra room should be allotted to him at so much per annum the proposition could not have been discussed with simpler ease  at last after a three days debate the matter ended thuswith by no means a sufficiency of romance for his taste  isa had agreed to become his betrothed if certain pecuniary conditions should or could be fulfilled  it appeared now that herberts father had promised that some small modicum of capital should be forthcoming after a term of years and that heine brothers had agreed that the englishman should have a proportionate share in the bank when that promise should be brought to bear  let it not be supposed that herbert would thus become a millionaire  if all went well the best would be that some three hundred a year would accrue to him from the bank instead of the quarter of that income which he at present received  but three hundred a year goes a long way at munich and isas parents were willing that she should be herberts wife if such an income should be forthcoming  but even of this there was much doubt  application to herberts father could not be judiciously made for some months  the earliest period at which in accordance with old hatto heines agreement young onslow might be admitted to the bank was still distant by four years and the present moment was thought to be inopportune for applying to him for any act of grace  let them wait said papa and mamma heineat any rate till new years day then ten months distant  isa quietly said that she would wait till new years day herbert fretted fumed and declared that he was illtreated  but in the end he also agreed to wait  what else could he do  but we shall see each other daily and be close to each other he said to isa looking tenderly into her eyes  yes she replied we shall see each other dailyof course  but herbert  herbert looked up at her and paused for her to go on  i have promised mamma that there shall be no change between usin our manner to each other i mean  we are not betrothed as yet you know and perhaps we may never be so  isa  it may not be possible you know  and therefore we will go on as before  of course we shall see each other and of course we shall be friends  herbert onslow again fretted and again fumed but he did not have his way  he had looked forward to the ecstasies of a lovers life but very few of those ecstasies were awarded to him  he rarely found himself alone with isa and when he did do so her coldness overawed him  he could dare to scold her and sometimes did do so but he could not dare to take the slightest liberty  once on that night when the qualified consent of papa and mamma heine had first been given he had been allowed to touch her lips with his own but since that day there had been for him no such delight as that  she would not even allow her hand to remain in his  when they all passed their evenings together in the beergarden she would studiously manage that his chair should not be close to her own occasionally she would walk with him but not more frequently now than of yore  very few indeed of a lovers privileges did he enjoy  and in this way the long year wore itself out and isa heine was oneandtwenty  all those family details which had made it inexpedient to apply either to old hatto or to herberts father before the end of the year need not be specially explained  old hatto who had by far the greater share in the business was a tyrant somewhat feared both by his brother and sisterinlaw and the elder onslow as was known to them all was a man straitened in circumstances  but soon after new years day the proposition was made in the schrannen platz and the letter was written  on this occasion madame heine went down to the bank and together with her husband was closeted for an hour with old hatto  uncle hattos verdict was not favourable  as to the young peoples marriage that was his brothers affair not his but as to the partnership that was a serious matter  who ever heard of a partnership being given away merely because a man wanted to marry  he would keep to his promise and if the stipulated moneys were forthcoming herbert onslow should become a partnerin four years  nor was the reply from england more favourable  the alliance was regarded by all the onslows very favourably  nothing could be nicer than such a marriage  they already knew dear isa so well by description  but as for the moneythat could not in any way be forthcoming till the end of the stipulated period  and what shall we do said herbert to papa heine  you must wait said he  for four years asked herbert  you must waitas i did said papa heine  i was forty before i could marry  papa heine however should not have forgotten to say that his bride was only twenty and that if he had waited she had not  isa herbert said to her when all this had been fully explained to her what do you say now  of course it is all over said she very calmly  oh isa is that your love  no herbert that is not my love that is my discretion and she even laughed with her mild low laughter as she answered him  you know you are too impatient to wait four years and what else therefore can i say  i wonder whether you love me said herbert with a grand look of injured sentiment  well in your sense of the word i do not think i do  i do not love you so that i need make every one around us unhappy because circumstances forbid me to marry you  that sort of love would be baneful  ah no you do not know what love means  not your boisterous heartbreaking english love herbert  and herbert sometimes i think you had better go home and look for a bride there  though you fancy that you love me in your heart you hardly approve of me  fancy that i love you  do you think isa that a man can carry his heart round to one customer after another as the huckster carries his wares  yes i think he can  i know that men do  what did your hero waverley do with his heart in that grand english novel which you gave me to read  i am not flora mac ivor but you may find a rose bradwardine  and you really wish me to do so  look here herbert  it is bad to boast but i will make this boast  i am so little selfish that i desire above all that you should do that which may make you most happy and contented  i will be quite frank with you  i love you well enough to wait these four years with the hope of becoming your wife when they are over  but you will think but little of my love when i tell you that this waiting would not make me unhappy  i should go on as i do now and be contented  oh heavens sighed herbert  but as i know that this would not suit youas i feel sure that such delay would gall you every day as i doubt whether it would not make you sick of me long before the four years be overmy advice is that we should let this matter drop  he now walked up to her and took her hand and as he did so there was something in his gait and look and tone of voice that stirred her heart more sharply than it had yet been stirred  and even that would not make you unhappy he said  she paused before she replied leaving her hand in his for he was contented to hold it without peculiar pressure  i will not say so she replied  but herbert i think that you press me too hard  is it not enough that i leave you to be the arbiter of my destiny  i would learn the very truth of your heart he replied  i cannot tell you that truth more plainly  methinks i have told it too plainly already  if you wish it i will hold myself as engaged to youto be married to you when those four years are past  but remember i do not advise it  if you wish it you shall have back your troth  and that i think will be the wiser course  but neither alternative contented herbert onslow and at the time he did not resolve on either  he had some little present income from home some fifty pounds a year or so and he would be satisfied to marry on that and on his salary as a clerk but to this papa and mamma heine would not consentneither would isa  you are not a saving close man she said to him when he boasted of his economies  no englishmen are  you could not live comfortably in two small rooms and with bad dinners  i do not care a straw about my dinners  not now that you are a lover but you would do when you were a husband  and you change your linen almost every day  bah  yes bah if you please  but i know what these things cost  you had better go to england and fetch a rich wife  then you will become a partner at once and uncle hatto wont snub you  and you will be a grand man and have a horse to ride on  whereupon herbert went away in disgust  nothing in all this made him so unhappy as the feeling that isa under all their joint privations would not be unhappy herself  as far as he could see all this made no difference in isa  but in truth he had not yet read isas character very thoroughly she had spoken truly in saying that she knew nothing of that boisterous love which was now tormenting him and making him gloomy but nevertheless she loved him  she in her short life had learnt many lessons of selfdenial and now with reference to this half promised husband she would again have practised such a lesson  had he agreed at once to go from her she would have balanced her own account within her own breast and have kept to herself all her sufferings  there would have been no outward show of baffled love none even in the colour of her cheeks for such was the nature of her temperament  but she did suffer for him  day by day she began to think that his love though boisterous as she had at first called it was more deepseated than she had believed  he made no slightest sign that he would accept any of those proffers which she had made him of release  though he said so loudly that this waiting for four years was an impossibility he spoke of no course that would be more possibleexcept that evidently impossible course of an early marriage  and thus while he with redoubled vehemence charged her with coolness and want of love her love waxed warmer and warmer and his happiness became the chief object of her thoughts  what could she do that he might no longer suffer  and then he took a step which was very strange to them all  he banished himself altogether from the house going away again into lodgings  no he said on the morning of his departure i do not release you  i will never release you  you are mine and i have a right so to call you  if you choose to release yourself i cannot help it but in doing so you will be forsworn  nay but herbert i have sworn to nothing said she meaning that she had not been formally betrothed to him  you can do as you please it is a matter of conscience but i tell you what are my feelings  here i cannot stay for i should go mad but i shall see you occasionallyperhaps on sundays  oh herbert  well what would you have  if you really cared to see me it would not be thus  all i ask of you now is this that if you decide absolutely decide on throwing me over you will tell me at once then i shall leave munich  herbert i will never throw you over  so they parted and onslow went forth to his new lodgings  her promise that she would never throw him over was the warmest word of love that she had ever spoken but even that was said in her own quiet unimpassioned way  there was in it but very little show of love though there might be an assurance of constancy  but her constancy he did not in truth much doubt  four yearsfourteen or twentyfour would be the same to her he said as he seated himself in the dull cold room which he had chosen  while living in the ludwigs strasse he did not know how much had been daily done for his comfort by that hand which he had been so seldom allowed to press but he knew that he was now cold and comfortless and he wished himself back in the ludwigs strasse  mamma said isa when they were alone  is not uncle hatto rather hard on us  papa said that he would ask this as a favour from his brother  so he did my dear and offered to give up more of his own time but your uncle hatto is hard  he is rich is he not  well your father says not  your father says that he spends all his income  though he is hard and obstinate he is not selfish  he is very good to the poor but i believe he thinks that early marriages are very foolish  mamma said isa again when they had sat for some minutes in silence over their work  well my love  have you spoken to uncle hatto about this  no dear not since that day when your papa and i first went to him  to tell the truth i am almost afraid to speak to him but if you wish it i will do so  i do wish it mamma  but you must not think that i am discontented or impatient  i do not know that i have any right to ask my uncle for his moneyfor it comes to that  i suppose it does my dear  and as for myself i am happy here with you and papa  i do not think so much of these four years  you would still be young isaquite young enough  and what if i were not young  what does it matter  but mamma there has been that between herbert and me which makes me feel myself bound to think of him  as you and papa have sanctioned it you are bound to think of him also  i know that he is unhappy living there all alone  but why did he go dear  i think he was right to go  i could understand his doing that  he is not like us and would have been fretful here wanting that which i could not give him  he became worse from day to day and was silent and morose  i am glad he went  but mamma for his sake i wish that this could be shortened  madame heine told her daughter that she would if isa wished it herself go to the schrannen platz and see what could be done by talking to uncle hatto  but she added i fear that no good will come of it  can harm come mamma  no i do not think harm can come  ill tell you what mamma i will go to uncle hatto myself if you will let me  he is cross i know but i shall not be afraid of him i feel that i ought to do something  and so the matter was settled madame heine being by no means averse to escape a further personal visit to the head of the banking establishment  madame heine well understood what her daughter meant when she said she ought to do something though isa feared that she had imperfectly expressed her meaning  when he herbert was willing to do so much to prove his lovewhen he was ready to sacrifice all the little comforts of comparative wealth to which he had been accustomed in order that she might be his companion and wifedid it not behove her to give some proof of her love also  she could not be demonstrative as he was  such exhibition of feeling would be quite contrary to her ideas of female delicacy and to her very nature  but if called on to work for him that she could do as long as strength remained to her  but there was no sacrifice which would be of service nor any work which would avail  therefore she was driven to think what she might do on his behalf and at last she resolved to make her personal appeal to uncle hatto  shall i tell papa isa asked of her mother  i will do so said madame heine  and then the younger member of the firm was informed as to the step which was to be taken and he though he said nothing to forbid the attempt held out no hope that it would be successful  uncle hatto was a little snuffy man now full seventy years of age who passed seven hours of every weekday of his life in the dark back chamber behind the bankingroom of the firm and he had so passed every weekday of his life for more years than any of the family could now remember  he had made the house what it was and had taken his brother into partnership when that brother married all the family were somewhat afraid of him including even his partner  he rarely came to the apartments in the ludwigs strasse as he himself lived in one of the older and shabbier suburbs on the other side of the town  thither he always walked starting punctually from the bank at four oclock and from thence he always walked in the morning reaching the bank punctually at nine  his two nieces knew him well for on certain stated days they were wont to attend on him at his lodgings where they would be regaled with cakes and afterwards go with him to some oldfashioned beergarden in his neighbourhood  but these festivities were of a sombre kind and if on any occasion circumstances prevented the fulfilment of the ceremony neither of the girls would be loud in their lamentations  in london a visit paid by a niece to her uncle would in all probability be made at the uncles private residence but at munich private and public matters were not so effectually divided  isa therefore having put on her hat and shawl walked off by herself to the schrannen platz  is uncle hatto inside she asked and the answer was given to her by her own lover  yes he was within but the old clerk was with him  isa however signified her wish to see her uncle alone and in a few minutes the ancient greyhaired servant of the house came out into the larger room  you can go in now miss isa he said  and isa found herself in the presence of her uncle before she had been two minutes under the roof  in the mean time ernest heine her father had said not a word and herbert knew that something very special must be about to occur  well my bonny bird said uncle hatto and what do you want at the bank  cheery words such as these were by no means uncommon with uncle hatto but isa knew very well that no presage could be drawn from them of any special good nature or temporary weakness on his part  uncle hatto she began rushing at once into the middle of her affair you know i believe that i am engaged to marry herbert onslow  i know no such thing said he  i thought i understood your father specially to say that there had been no betrothal  no uncle hatto there has been no betrothal that certainly is true but nevertheless we are engaged to each other  well said uncle hatto very sourly and now there was no longer any cheery tone or any calling of pretty names  perhaps you may think all this very foolish said isa who spite of her resolves to do so was hardly able to look up gallantly into her uncles face as she thus talked of her own love affairs  yes i do said uncle hatto  i do think it foolish for young people to hold themselves betrothed before they have got anything to live on and so i have told your father  he answered me by saying that you were not betrothed  nor are we  papa is quite right in that  then my dear i would advise you to tell the young man that as neither of you have means of your own the thing must be at an end it is the only step for you to take  if you agreed to wait one of you might die or his money might never be forth coming or you might see somebody else that you liked better  i dont think i shall do that  you cant tell  and if you dont the chances are ten to one that he will  this little blow which was intended to be severe did not hit isa at all hard  that plan of a rose bradwardine she herself had proposed in good faith thinking that she could endure such a termination to the affair without flinching  she was probably wrong in this estimate of her power but nevertheless her present object was his release from unhappiness and doubt not her own  it might be so she said  take my word for it it would  look all around  there was adelaide schropnerbut that was before your time and you would not remember  considering that adelaide schropner had been for many years a grandmother it was probable that isa would not remember  but uncle hatto you have not heard me  i want to say something to you if it will not take too much of your time  in answer to which uncle hatto muttered something which was unheeded to signify that isa might speak  i also think that a long engagement is a foolish thing and so does herbert  but he wants to marry at once  yes he wants to marryperhaps not at once but soon  and i suppose you have come to say that you want the same thing  isa blushed ever so faintly as she commenced her answer  yes uncle i do wish the same thing  what he wishes i wish  very likelyvery likely  dont be scornful to me uncle  when two people love each other it is natural that each should wish that which the other earnestly desires  oh very natural my dear that you should wish to get married  uncle hatto i did not think that you would be unkind to me though i knew that you would be stern  well go on  what have you to say  i am not stern but i have no doubt you will think me unkind  people are always unkind who do not do what they are asked  papa says that herbert onslow is some day to become a partner in the bank  that depends on certain circumstances  neither i nor your papa can say whether he will or no  but isa went on as though she had not heard the last reply  i have come to ask you to admit him as a partner at once  ah i supposed sojust as you might ask me to give you a new ribbon  but uncle i never did ask you to give me a new ribbon  i never asked you to give me anything for myself nor do i ask this for myself  do you think that if i could do itwhich of course i canti would not sooner do it for you who are my own flesh and blood than for him who is a stranger  nay he is no stranger  he has sat at your desk and obeyed your orders for nearly four years  papa says that he has done well in the bank  humph  if every clerk that does wellpretty well that is wanted a partnership where should we be my dear  no my dear go home and tell him when you see him in the evening that all this must be at an end  mens places in the world are not given away so easily as that  they must either be earned or purchased  herbert onslow has as yet done neither and therefore he is not entitled to take a wife  i should have been glad to have had a wife at his ageat least i suppose i should but at any rate i could not afford it  but isa had by no means as yet done  so far the interview had progressed exactly as she had anticipated  she had never supposed it possible that her uncle would grant her so important a request as soon as she opened her mouth to ask it  she had not for a moment expected that things would go so easily with her  indeed she had never expected that any success would attend her efforts but if any success were possible the work which must achieve that success must now commence  it was necessary that she should first state her request plainly before she began to urge it with such eloquence as she had at her command  i can understand what you say uncle hatto  i am glad of that at any rate  and i know that i have no right to ask you for anything  i do not say that  anything in reason that a girl like you should ask of her old uncle i would give you  i have no such reasonable request to make uncle  i have never wanted new ribbons from you or gay toys  even from my own mother i have not wanted themnot wanted them faster than they seemed to come without any asking  no no you have been a good girl  i have been a happy girl and quite happy with those i loved and with what providence had given me  i had nothing to ask for  but now i am no longer happy nor can i be unless you do for me this which i ask of you  i have wanted nothing till now and now in my need i come to you  and now you want a husband with a fortune  no and that single word she spoke not loudly for her voice was low and soft but with an accent which carried it sharply to his ear and to his brain  and then she rose from her seat as she went on your scorn uncle is unjustunjust and untrue  i have ever acted maidenly as has become my mothers daughter  yes yes yesi believe that  and i can say more than that for myself  my thoughts have been the same nor have my wishes even ever gone beyond them  and when this young man came to me telling me of his feelings i gave him no answer till i had consulted my mother  she should have bade you not to think of him  ah you are not a mother and cannot know  why should i not think of him when he was good and kind honest and hardworking  and then he had thought of me first  why should i not think of him  did not mamma listen to my father when he came to her  but your father was forty years old and had a business  you gave it him uncle hatto  i have heard him say  and therefore i am to do as much for you  and then next year agnes will come to me and so before i die i shall see you all in want with large families  no isa i will not scorn you but this thing i cannot do  but i have not told you all yet  you say that i want a husband  well well i did not mean to say it harshly  i do wantto be married  and here her courage failed her a little and for a moment her eye fell to the ground  it is true uncle  he has asked me whether i could love him and i have told him i could  he has asked me whether i would be his wife and i have given him a promise  after that must not his happiness be my happiness and his misery my misery  am i not his wife already before god  no no said uncle hatto loudly  ah but i am  none feel the strength of the bonds but those who are themselves bound  i know my duty to my father and mother and with gods help i will do it but i am not the less bound to him without their approval i will not stand with him at the altar but not the less is my lot joined to his for this world  nothing could release me from that but his wish  and he will wish it in a month or two  excuse me uncle hatto but in that i can only judge for myself as best i may  he has loved me now for two years  psha  and whether it be wise or foolish i have sanctioned it  i cannot now go back with honour even if my own heart would let me  his welfare must be my welfare and his sorrow my sorrow  therefore i am bound to do for him anything that a girl may do for the man she loves and as i knew of no other resource i come to you to help me  and he sitting out there knows what you are saying  most certainly not  he knows no more than that he has seen me enter this room  i am glad of that because i would not wish that he should be disappointed  in this matter my dear i cannot do anything for you  and that is your last answer uncle  yes indeed  when you come to think over this some twenty years hence you will know then that i am right and that your request was unreasonable  it may be so she replied but i do not think it  it will be so  such favours as you now ask are not granted in this world for light reasons  light reasons  well uncle i have had my say and will not take up your time longer  goodbye my dear  i am sorry that i cannot oblige youthat it is quite out of my power to oblige you  then she went giving him her hand as she parted from him and he as she left the room looked anxiously at her watching her countenance and her gait and listening to the very fall of her footstep  ah he said to himself when he was alone the young people have the best of it  the sun shines for them but why should they have all  poor as he is he is a happy doga happy dog  but she is twice too good for him  why did she not take to one of her own country  isa as she passed through the bank smiled sweetly on her father and then smiled sweetly at her lover nodding to him with a pleasant kindly nod  if he could have heard all that had passed at that interview how much more he would have known of her than he now knew and how proud he would have been of her love  no word was spoken as she went out and then she walked home with even step as she had walked thither  it can hardly be said that she was disappointed as she had expected nothing  but people hope who do not expect and though her step was even and her face calm yet her heart was sad  mamma she said there is no hope from uncle hatto  so i feared my dear  but i thought it right to tryfor herberts sake  i hope it will not do him an injury in the bank  oh mamma do not put that into my head  if that were added to it all i should indeed be wretched  no he is too just for that  poor young man  sometimes i almost think it would be better that he should go back to england  mamma if he did i shouldbreak my heart  isa  well mamma  but do not suppose that i mean to complain whatever happens  but i had been so sure that you had constrained your feelings  so i hadtill i knew myself  mamma i could wait for years if he were contented to wait by my side  if i could see him happy i could watch him and love him and be happy also  i do not want to have him kneeling to me and making sweet speeches but it has gone too far nowand i could not bear to lose him  and thus to her mother she confessed the truth  there was nothing more said between isa and her mother on the subject and for two days the matter remained as it then stood madame heine had been deeply grieved at hearing those last words which her daughter had spoken  to her also that state of quiescence which isa had so long affected seemed to be the proper state at which a maidens heart should stand till after her marriage vows had been pronounced  she had watched her isa and had approved of everythingof everything till this last avowal had been made  but now though she could not approve she expressed no disapproval in words  she pressed her daughters hand and sighed and then the two said no more upon the matter  in this way for two days there was silence in the apartments in the ludwigs strasse for even when the father returned from his work the whole circle felt that their old family mirth was for the present necessarily laid aside  on the morning of the third day about noon madame heine returned home from the market with isa and as they reached the landing agnes met them with a packet  fritz brought it from the bank said agnes  now fritz was the boy who ran messages and swept out the office and madame heine put out her hand for the parcel thinking not unnaturally that it was for her  but agnes would not give it to her mother it is for you isa she said  then isa looking at the address recognised the handwriting of her uncle mamma she said i will come to you directly and then she passed quickly away into her own room  the parcel was soon opened and contained a note from her uncle and a stiff large document looking as though it had come from the hands of a lawyer  isa glanced at the document and read some few of the words on the outer fold but they did not carry home to her mind any clear perception of their meaning  she was flurried at the moment and the words perhaps were not very plain  then she took up her note and that was plain enough  it was very short and ran as follows   my dear niece  you told me on monday that i was stern and harsh and unjust perhaps i was  if so i hope the enclosed will make amends and that you will not think me such an old fool as i think myself  your affectionate uncle hatto heine  i have told nobody yet and the enclosed will require my brothers signature but i suppose he will not object      but he does not know it mamma said isa  who is to tell him oh mamma you must tell him  nay my dear but it must be your own present to him  i could not give it him  it is uncle hattos present mamma when i left him i thought that his eye was kind to me  his heart at any rate has been very kind  and then again they looked over the document and talked of the wedding which must now be near at hand  but still they had not as yet decided how herbert should be informed  at last isa resolved that she herself would write to him  she did write and this was her letter   dear herbert  mamma and i wish to see you and beg that you will come up to us this evening  we have tidings for you which i hope you will receive with joy  i may as well tell you at once as i do not wish to flurry you  uncle hatto has sent to us a document which admits you as a partner into the bank  if therefore you wish to go on with our engagement i suppose there is nothing now to cause any very great delay  isa   the letter was very simple and isa when she had written it subsided into all her customary quiescence  indeed when herbert came to the ludwigs strasse not in the evening as he was bidden to do but instantly leaving his own dinner uneaten and coming upon the heines in the midst of their dinner she was more than usually tranquil  but his love was as she had told him boisterous  he could not contain himself and embraced them all and then scolded isa because she was so calm  why should i not be calm said she now that i know you are happy  the house in the schrannen platz still goes by the name of heine brothers but the mercantile world in bavaria and in some cities out of bavaria is well aware that the real pith and marrow of the business is derived from the energy of the young english partner
