notepaper which he held in his hand and gazed through the open french windows before which he was standing it was a very pleasant and very peaceful prospect there was his croquet lawn smoothshaven the hoops neatly arranged the chalk mark firm and distinct upon the boundary beyond the tennis court the flower gardens and to the left the walled fruit garden a little farther away was the paddock and orchard and a little farther still the farm which for the last four years had been the joy of his life his meadows were yellow with buttercups a thin line of willows showed where the brook wound its lazy way through the bottom fields it was a home this in which a man could well lead a peaceful life could dream away his days to the music of the west wind the gurgling stream the song of birds and the low murmuring of insects peter ruff stood like a man turned to stone for even as he looked these things passed away from before his eyes the roar of the world beat in his earsthe world of intrigue of crime the world where the strong man hewed his way to power and the weaklings fell like corn before the sickle                                       it is the desire of madame  peter ruff clenched his fists as he read the words once more it was a message from a world every memory of which had been deliberately crusheda world indeed in which he had seemed no longer to hold any place he was peter ruff esquire of aynesford manor in the county of somerset it could not be for him this strange summons  the rustle of a womans soft draperies broke in upon his reverie he turned round with his usual morning greeting upon his lips she was without doubt a most beautiful woman petite and well moulded with the glow of health in her eyes and on her cheeks she came smiling to hima dream of muslin and pink ribbons  another forage bill my dear peter she demanded passing her arm through his put it away and admire my new morning gown it came straight from paris and you will have to pay a great deal of money for it  he pulled himself togetherhe had no secrets from his wife  listen he said and read aloud       rue de st quintaine paris       dear mr ruffit is a long time since we had the      pleasure of a visit from you it is the desire of madame that you      should join our circle here on thursday evening next at ten      oclocksogrange  violet was a little perplexed she failed somehow to recognise the sinister note underlying those few sentences  it sounds friendly enough she remarked you are not obliged to go of course  peter ruff smiled grimly  yes it sounds all right he admitted  they wont expect you to take any notice of it surely she continued when you bought this place peter you gave them definitely to understand that you had retired into private life that all these things were finished with you  there are some things peter ruff said slowly which are never finished  but you resigned she reminded him i remember your letter distinctly  from the double four he answered no resignation is recognised save death i did what i could and they accepted my explanations gracefully and without comment now that the time has come however when they need or think they need my help you see they do not hesitate to claim it  you will not go peter you will not think of going she begged  he twisted the letter between his fingers and sat down to his breakfast  no he said i shall not go                                       that morning peter ruff spent upon his farm looking over his stock examining some new machinery and talking crops with his bailiff in the afternoon he played his customary round of golf it was the sort of day which as a rule he found completely satisfactory yet somehow or other a certain sense of weariness crept in upon him towards its close the agricultural details in which he was accustomed to take so much interest had fallen a little flat he even found himself wondering after one of his best drives whether it was well for the mind of a man to be so utterly engrossed by the flight of that small white ball towards its destination more than once lately despite his halfangry rejection of them certain memories halfwistful halftantalising from the world of which he now saw so little had forced their way in upon his attention this morning the lines of that brief note seemed to stand out before him all the time with a curious vividness in a way he played the hypocrite to himself he professed to have found that summons disturbing and unwelcome yet his thoughts were continually occupied with it he knew well that what would follow was inevitable but he made no sign  two days later he received another letter this time it was couched in different terms on a square card at the top of which was stamped a small coronet he read as follows       madame de maupassim at home saturday evening may 2nd at ten      oclock  in small letters at the bottom lefthand corner were added the words       to meet friends  peter ruff put the card upon the fire and went out for a mornings rabbit shooting with his keeper when he returned luncheon was ready but violet was absent he rang the bell  where is your mistress jane he asked the parlourmaid  the girl had no idea mrs ruff had left for the village several hours ago since then she had not been seen  peter ruff ate his luncheon alone and understood the afternoon wore on and at night he travelled up to london he knew better than to waste time by purposeless inquiries instead he took the nine oclock train the next morning to paris                                       it was a chamber of death into which he was ushereddismal yet of its sort unique marvellous the room itself might have been the sleeping apartment of an empresslofty with white panelled walls adorned simply with gilded lines with high windows closely curtained now so that neither sound nor the light of day might penetrate into the room in the middle of the apartment upon a canopy bedstead which had once adorned a kings palace lay madame de maupassim her face was already touched with the finger of death yet her eyes were undimmed and her lips unquivering her hands covered with rings lay out before her upon the lace coverlid supported by many pillows she was issuing her last instructions with the cold precision of the man of affairs who makes the necessary arrangements for a few days absence from his business  peter ruff who had not even been allowed sufficient time to change his travelling clothes was brought without hesitation to her bedside she looked at him in silence for a moment with a cold glitter in her eyes  you are four days late monsieur peter ruff she remarked why did you not obey your first summons  madame he answered i thought that there must be a misunderstanding four years ago i gave notice to the council that i had married and retired into private life a country farmer is of no further use to the world  the womans thin lip curled  from death and the double four she said there is no resignation which counts you are as much our creature today as i am the creature of the disease which is carrying me across the threshold of death  peter ruff remained silent the womans words seemed full of dread significance besides how was it possible to contradict the dying  it is upon the unwilling of the world she continued speaking slowly yet with extraordinary distinctness that its greatest honours are often conferred the name of my successor has been balloted for secretly it is you peter ruff who have been chosen  this time he was silent because he was literally bereft of words this woman was dying and fancying strange things he looked from one to the other of the stern pale faces of those who were gathered around her bedside seven of them there werethe same seven at that moment their eyes were all focused upon him peter ruff shrank back  madame he murmured this cannot be  her lips twitched as though she would have smiled  what we have decided she said we have decided nothing can alter thatnot even the will of mr peter ruff  i have been out of the world for four years peter ruff protested i have no longer ambitions no longer any desire  you lie the woman interrupted you lie or you do yourself an injustice we gave you four years and looking into your face i think that it has been enough i think that the weariness is there already in any case the charge which i lay upon you in these my last moments is one which you can escape by death only  a low murmur of voices from those others repeated her words  by death only  peter ruff opened his lips but closed them again without speech a wave of emotion seemed passing through the room something strange was happening it was death itself which had come amongst them                                       a morning journalist wrote of the death of madame eloquently and with feeling she had been a broadminded aristocrat a woman of brilliant intellect and great friendships a woman of whose inner life during the last ten or fifteen years little was known yet who in happier times might well have played a great part in the history of her country                                       peter ruff drove back from the cemetery with the marquis de sogrange and for the first time since the death of madame serious subjects were spoken of  i have waited patiently he declared but there are limits i want my wife  sogrange took him by the arm and led him into the library of the house in the rue de st quintaine the six men who were already there waiting rose to their feet  gentlemen the marquis said is it your will that i should be spokesman  there was a murmur of assent then sogrange turned towards his companion and something new seemed to have crept into his mannera solemn almost threatening note  peter ruff he continued you have trifled with the one organisation in this world which has never allowed itself to have liberties taken with it or to be defied men who have done greater service than you have died for the disobedience of a day you have been treated leniently accordingly to the will of madame according to her will and in deference to the position which you must now take up amongst us we still treat you as no other has ever been treated by us the double four admits your leadership and claims you for its own  i am not prepared to discuss anything of the sort peter ruff declared doggedly until my wife is restored to me  the marquis smiled  the traditions of your race mr ruff he said are easily manifest in you now hear our decision your wife shall be restored to you on the day when you take up this position to which you have become entitled sit down and listen  peter ruff was a rebel at heart but he felt the grip of iron  during these four years when you my friend have been growing turnips and shooting your game events in the world have marched new powers have come into being a new page of history has been opened as everything which has good at the heart evolves toward the good so we of the double four have lifted our great enterprise on to a higher plane the world of criminals is still at our beck and call we still claim the right to draw the line between moral theft and immoral honesty but today the double four is concerned with greater things within the four walls of this room within the hearing of these my brothers whose fidelity is as sure as the stones of paris i tell you a splendid secret the government of our country has craved for our aid and the aid of our organisation it is no longer the wealth of the world alone which we may control but the actual destinies of nations  what i suppose you mean to say is peter ruff remarked that youve been going in for politics  you put it crudely my english bulldog sogrange answered but you are right we are occupied now by affairs of international importance more than once during the last few months ours has been the hand which has changed the policy of an empire  most interesting peter ruff declared but so far as i personally am concerned  listen the marquis interrupted not a hundred yards from the french embassy in london there is waiting for you a house and servants no less magnificent than the embassy itself you will become the ambassador in london of the double four titular head of our association a personage whose power is second to none in your marvellous city i do not address words of caution to you my friend because we have satisfied ourselves as to your character and capacity before we consented that you should occupy your present position but i ask you to remember this the will of madame lives even beyond the grave the spirit which animated her when alive breathes still in all of us in london you will wield a great power use it for the common good and remember this the double four has never failed the double four can never fail  i am glad to hear you are so confident peter ruff said of course if i have to take this thing on i shall do my best but if i might venture to allude for a moment to anything so trifling as my own domestic affairs i am very anxious to know about my wife  sogrange smiled  you will find mrs ruff awaiting you in london he announced your address is merton house berkeley square  when do i go there peter ruff asked  tonight was the answer  and what do i do when i get there he persisted  for three days the marquis told him you will remain indoors and give audience to whomever may come to you at the end of that time you will understand a little more of our purpose and our objectsperhaps even of our power  i see difficulties peter ruff remarked my name you see is uncommon  sogrange drew a document from the breast pocket of his coat  when you leave this house tonight he proclaimed we bid goodbye for ever to mr peter ruff you will find in this envelope the titledeeds of a small property which is our gift to you henceforth you will be known by the name and the title of your estates  title peter ruff gasped  you will reappear in london sogrange continued as the baron de grost  peter ruff shook his head  it wont do he declared people will find me out  there is nothing to be found out the marquis went on a little wearily your country life has dulled your wits baron the title and the name are justly yoursthey go with the property for the rest the history of your family and of your career up to the moment when you enter merton house tonight will be inside this packet you can peruse it upon the journey and remember that we can at all times bring a hundred witnesses if necessary to prove that you are whom you declare yourself to be when you get to charing cross do not forget that it will be the carriage and servants of the baron de grost which await you  peter shrugged his shoulders  well he said thoughtfully i suppose i shall get used to it  naturally sogrange answered for the moment we are passing through a quiet time necessitated by the mortal illness of madame you will be able to spend the next few weeks in getting used to your new position you will have a great many callers inspired by us who will see that you make the right acquaintances and that you join the right clubs at the same time let me warn you always to be ready there is trouble brooding just now all over europe in one way or another we may become involved at any moment the whole machinery of our society will be explained to you by your secretary you will find him already installed at merton house a glass of wine baron before you leave  peter ruff glanced at the clock  there are my things to pack he began  sogrange smiled  your valet is already on the front seat of the automobile which is waiting he remarked you will find him attentive and trustworthy the clothes which you brought with you we have taken the liberty of dispensing with you will find others in your trunk and at merton house you can send for any tailor you choose one toast baron we drink to the double fourto the great cause  there was a murmur of voices sogrange lifted once more his glass  may peter ruff rest in peace he said we drink to his ashes we drink long life and prosperity to the baron de grost                                       the marquis alone attended his guest to the station they walked up and down the long platform of the gare du nord sogrange talking most of the time in an undertone for there were many things which he yet had to explain there came a time however when his grip upon his companions arm suddenly tightened they were passing a somewhat noticeable little groupa tall fair man with closeshaven hair and military moustache dressed in an english travelling suit and homburg hat and by his side a very brilliant young woman whose dark eyes powdered face and marvellous toilette rendered her a trifle conspicuous in the background were a couple of servants  the count von hernbernadine the marquis whispered  peter glanced at him for a moment as they passed  bernadine without a doubt he exclaimed and his companion  mademoiselle delucie from the comédie française the marquis replied it is just like bernadine to bring her here he likes to parade the ostensible cause for his visit to paris it is all bluff he cares little for the ladies of the theatre or any other woman except when he can make tools of them he is here just now  the marquis paused peter looked at him interrogatively  why he asked  because you are here the marquis affirmed baron i meant to speak to you about that man before we parted there is no great work done without difficulties the greatest difficulty you will have to face in your new life is that man it is very possible that you may find within the course of a few months that your whole career your very life has developed into a duel à outrance with him  they had turned again and were once more in sight of the little group bernadine had thrown a loose overcoat over his tweed travelling clothes and with a cigarette between his fingers was engaged in deferential conversation with the woman by his side his servant stood discreetly in the background talking to the other domestica sombrely clad young person carrying a flat jewelcase obviously the maid of the young frenchwoman  he is taking her across the marquis remarked it is not often that he travels like this perhaps he has heard that you are susceptible my friend  peter shrugged his shoulders  the game is too young yet he declared  it is never too young for bernadine to take a hand the marquis replied grimly listen de grost bernadine will probably try to make friends with you you may think it wise to accept his advances you may believe that you can guard your own secrets in his company perhaps even that you may learn his do not try it my friend you have received the best proof possible that we do not underrate your abilities but there is no other man like bernadine i would not trust myself alone with him  you are taking it for granted peter interposed that our interests must be at all times inimical  the marquis laid his hand upon the others arm  my friend he said there are interests which are sometimes elastic rapprochements which may vary between chilly friendliness and a certain intimacy but between the interests of the double four and the interests represented by that young man there yawns the deepest gulf which you or any other man could conceive bernadine represents the teutonmuscle and bone and sinew he is german to the last drop of his hearts blood never undervalue him i beseech you he is not only a wonderful politician he is a man of action grim unbending unswerving as a man may be whose eyes are steadfastly fixed upon one goal the friendships of france may sometimes change but her one great enmity never bernadine represents that enmity according to the measure of your success so you will find him placid or venomous think of yourself as a monk dear baron and bernadine as the devil incarnate from him there is safety only in absence  peter smiled as he shook hands with his companion and climbed into the train  at any rate he said i have been warned                                       during the journey to boulogne at least the repeated warnings of the marquis seemed quite unnecessary bernadine and his companion remained in their engaged carriage and de grost who dined in the restaurant car and sauntered once or twice along the corridors saw nothing of them at boulogne they stayed in their carriage until the rush on to the boat was over and it was not until they were halfway across the channel that peter felt suddenly an arm thrust through his as he leaned over the rail on the upper deck he moved instinctively away from the vessels side a proceeding which seemed to afford some amusement to the man who had accosted him  monsieur le baron said bernadine let me be the first to congratulate you upon your new dignity  very kind of you i am sure count von hern peter answered  bernadine to you my friend the other protested so you have come once more into the great game  peter remained silent his features had assumed an expression of gentle inquiry  once more i congratulate you bernadine continued in the old days you were shrewd and successful in your small undertakings but you were after all little more than a policeman today you stand for other things  monsieur le comte talks in enigmas peter murmured  bernadine smiled  cautious as ever he exclaimed ah my dear baron you amuse me you and the elegant sograngesogrange who will pull the strings to which you must dance do you think that i did not see you both upon the platform gazing suspiciously at me do you think that i did not hear the words of warning you received as clearly as though i had been standing by your side it is bernadine sogrange whispers bernadine and mademoiselle deluciea dangerous couple have a care monsieur le baron oh that is what passed without a doubt so when you take your place in the train you wrap yourself in an armour of isolation you are ready all the time to repel some deeplaid scheme you are relieved to discover that so far at any rate this terrible bernadine and his beautiful travelling companion have not forced themselves upon you is it not so  peter shrugged his shoulders  it is the south wind he remarked which carries us across so quickly tonight  the south wind without a doubt bernadine assented politely dear baron my congratulations are sincere no one can come into the battlefield the real battlefield of life without finding enemies there waiting for him you and i represent different causes when our interests clash i shall not try to throw you off a channel boat or to buy you with a cheque or to hand you over to the tender mercies of the beautiful mademoiselle delucie until then have no fear my british friend i shall not even ask you to drink with me for i know that you would look suspiciously into the tumbler au revoir and good fortune  bernadine passed into the shadows and sank into a steamer chair by the side of his travelling companion peter continued his lonely walk his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his overcoat his eyes fixed upon the folkestone lights becoming every moment clearer and clearer                                       at charing cross all was as sogrange had indicated his servant remained to look after the luggage a tall footman conducted him towards a magnificent automobile then indeed he forgot bernadine and all this new stir of lifeforgot everything in a sudden rush of joy it was violet who leaned forward to greet himviolet looking her best and altogether at her ease amongst this new splendour  welcome monsieur le baron she whispered as he took his place by her side  he took her hands and held them tightly closely  i always knew he murmured that you hankered after a title  such a snob arent i she exclaimed never mind you wait  they were moving rapidly westward now a full moon was shining down upon the city the streets were thronged with pedestrians and a block of vehicles the carlton was all ablaze in the softening light pall mall had become a stately thoroughfare the haymarket and regent street picturesque with moving throngs a stream of open cabs women in cool evening dresses men without hats or overcoats on their way from the theatres it was a vivid almost a fascinating little picture peter caught a glimpse of his wifes face as she looked upon it  i believe he whispered that you are glad  she turned upon him with a wonderful smile the light flashing in her eyes  glad oh peter of course i am glad i hated the country i pined and longed for life couldnt you see it dear now we are back in it againback amongst the big things peter dear you were never meant to shoot rabbits and play golf to grow into the likeness of those awful people who think of nothing but sport and rural politics and their neighbours weaknesses the man who throws life away before he has done with it dear is a wastrel be thankful that its back again in your handsbe thankful as i am  he sighed and with that sigh went all his regrets for the life which had once seemed to him so greatly to be desired he recognised in those few seconds the ignominy of peace  there is not the slightest doubt about it he admitted i do make mistakes  the automobile came to a standstill before the portico of an imposing mansion at the corner of berkeley square  we are home violet whispered try to look as though you were used to it all  a gravefaced majordomo was already upon the steps in the hall was a vision of more footmen in quiet but impressive livery violet entered with an air of familiarity peter with one last sigh followed her there was something significant to him in that formal entrance into his new and magnificent home outside peter ruff seemed somewhere to have vanished into thin air it was the baron de grost who had entered into his bodythe baron de grost with a readymade present a fictitious past a momentous future     chapter ii  the ambassadors wife   alone in his study with fastlocked door baron de grost sat reading word by word with zealous care the dispatch from paris which had just been delivered into his hands from the splendid suite of receptionrooms which occupied the whole of the lefthand side of the hall came the faint sound of music the street outside was filled with automobiles and carriages setting down their guests madame was receiving tonight a gathering of very distinguished men and women and it was only on very urgent business indeed that her husband had dared to leave her side  the room in which he sat was in darkness except for the single heavily shaded electric lamp which stood by his elbow peter was wearing court dress with immaculate black silk stockings and diamond buckles upon his shoes a red ribbon was in his buttonhole and a french order hung from his neck his passion for clothes was certainly amply ministered to by the exigencies of his new position once more he read those last few words of this unexpectedly received dispatchread them with a frown upon his forehead and the light of trouble in his eyes for three months he had done nothing but live the life of an ordinary man of fashion and wealth his first taskfor which to tell the truth he had been anxiously waitingwas here before him and he found it little to his liking again he read slowly to himself the last paragraph of sogranges letter       as ever dear friend one of the greatest sayings which the men      of my race have ever perpetrated once more justifies itself      cherchez la femme of monsieur we have no manner of doubt we      have tested him in every way and to all appearance madame should      also be above suspicion yet those things of which i have spoken      have happened for two hours this morning i was closeted with picon      here very reluctantly he has placed the matter in my hands i pass      it on to you it is your first undertaking cher baron and i wish      you bon fortune a man of gallantry as i know you are you may      regret that it should be a womanand a beautiful woman      tooagainst whom the finger must be pointed yet after all the      fates are strong and the task is yourssogrange  the music from the receptionrooms grew louder and more insistent peter rose to his feet and moving to the fireplace struck a match and carefully destroyed the letter which he had been reading then he straightened himself glanced for a moment at the mirror and left the room to join his guests                                       monsieur le baron jests the lady murmured peter shook his head  indeed no madame he answered earnestly france has offered us nothing more delightful in the whole history of our entente than the loan of yourself and your brilliant husband monsieur de lamborne makes history amongst us politically whilst madame  peter sighed and his companion leaned a little towards him her dark eyes were full of sentimental regard  yes she whispered continue it is my wish  i am the good friend of monsieur de lamborne peter said and in his tone there seemed to lurk some faraway touch of regret yet madame knows that her conquests here have been many  the ambassadors wife fanned herself and remained silent for a moment a faint smile playing at the corners of her full curving lips she was indeed a very beautiful womanelegant a parisian to the fingertips with pale cheeks but eyes dark and soft eyes trained to her service whose flash was an inspiration whose very droop had set beating the hearts of men less susceptible than the baron de grost her gown was magnificent of amber satina colour daring but splendid the outline of her figure as she leaned slightly back in her seat might indeed have been traced by the inspired finger of some great sculptor peter whose reputation as a man of gallantry was well established felt the whole charm of her presencefelt too the subtle indications of preference which she seemed inclined to accord to him there was nothing which eyes could say which hers were not saying during those few minutes peter indeed glanced around a little nervously his wife had still her moments of unreasonableness it was just as well that she was engaged with a party of her guests at the farther end of the apartments  you are trying to turn my head his beautiful companion whispered you flatter me  it is not possible he answered  again the fan fluttered  ah monsieur she continued dropping her voice until it scarcely rose above a whisper there are not many men like you you speak of my husband and his political gifts yet what after all do they amount to what is his position indeed if one glanced behind the scenes compared with yours  the face of the baron de grost became like a mask it was as though suddenly he had felt the thrill of danger close at handdanger even in that scented atmosphere wherein he sat  alas madame he answered it is you now who are pleased to jest your husband is a great and powerful ambassador i unfortunately have no career no place in life save the place which the possession of a few millions gives to a successful financier  she laughed very softly and again her eyes spoke to him  monsieur she murmured you and i together could make a great alliance is it not so  madame he faltered doubtfully if one dared hope  once more the fire of her eyes this time not only voluptuous was the man stupid or only cautious  if that alliance were once concluded she said softly one might hope for everything  if it rests only with me he began seriously oh madame  he seemed overcome madame was gracious but was he really stupid or only very much in earnest  to be one of the worlds money kings she whispered it is wonderful that it is powersupreme absolute power there is nothing beyondthere is nothing greater  then peter who was watching her closely caught another gleam in her eyes and he began to understand he had seen it before amongst a certain type of her countrywomenthe greed of money he looked at her jewels and he remembered that for an ambassador her husband was reputed to be a poor man the cloud of misgiving passed away from him he settled down to the game  if money could only buy the desire of ones heart he murmured alas  his eyes seemed to seek out monsieur de lamborne amongst the moving throngs she laughed softly and her hand brushed his  money and one other thing monsieur le baron she whispered in his ear can buy the jewels from a crowncan buy even the heart of a woman  a movement of approaching guests caught them up and parted them for a time the baroness de grost was at home from ten till one and her rooms were crowded peter found himself drawn on one side a few minutes later by monsieur de lamborne himself  i have been looking for you de grost the latter declared where can we talk for a moment  his host took the ambassador by the arm and led him into a retired corner monsieur de lamborne was a tall slight man somewhat cadaverouslooking with large features hollow eyes thin but carefully arranged grey hair and a pointed grey beard he wore a frilled shirt and an eyeglass suspended by a broad black ribbon hung down upon his chest his face as a rule was imperturbable enough but he had the air just now of a man greatly disturbed  we cannot be overheard here peter remarked it must be an affair of a few words only though  monsieur de lamborne wasted no time in preliminaries  this afternoon he said i received from my government papers of immense importance which i am to hand over to your foreign minister at eleven oclock tomorrow morning  peter nodded  well  de lambornes thin fingers trembled as they played nervously with the ribbon of his eyeglass  listen he continued dropping his voice a little bernadine has undertaken to send a copy of their contents to berlin by tomorrow nights mail  how do you know that  the ambassador hesitated  we too have spies at work he remarked grimly bernadine wrote and sent a messenger with the letter to berlin the mans body is drifting down the channel but the letter is in my pocket  the letter from bernadine  yes  what does he say  simply that a verbatim copy of the document in question will be dispatched to berlin tomorrow evening without fail replied the ambassador  there are no secrets between us peter declared smoothly what is the special importance of this document  de lamborne shrugged his shoulders  since you ask he said i tell you you know of the slight coolness which there has been between our respective governments our people have felt that the policy of your ministers in expending all their energies and resources in the building of a great fleet to the utter neglect of your army is a wholly onesided arrangement so far as we are concerned in the event of a simultaneous attack by germany upon france and england you would be utterly powerless to render us any measure of assistance if germany should attack england alone it is the wish of your government that we should be pledged to occupy alsacelorraine you on the other hand could do nothing for us if germanys first move were made against france  peter was deeply interested although the matter was no new one to him  go on he directed i am waiting for you to tell me the specific contents of this document  the english government has asked us two questions first how many complete army corps we consider she ought to place at our disposal in this eventuality and secondly at what point should we expect them to be concentrated the dispatch which i received tonight contains the reply to these questions  which bernadine has promised to forward to berlin tomorrow night peter remarked softly  de lamborne nodded  you perceive he said the immense importance of the affair the very existence of that document is almost a casus belli  at what time did the dispatch arrive peter asked and what has been its history since  it arrived at six oclock the ambassador declared it went straight into the inner pocket of my coat it has not been out of my possession for a single second even whilst i talk to you i can feel it  and your plans how are you intending to dispose of it tonight  on my return to the embassy i shall place it in the safe lock it up and remain watching it until morning  there doesnt seem to be much chance for bernadine peter remarked  but there must be no chanceno chance at all monsieur de lamborne asserted with a note of passion in his thin voice it is incredible preposterous that he should even make the attempt i want you to come home with me and share my vigil you shall be my witness in case anything happens we will watch together  peter reflected for a moment  bernadine makes few mistakes he said thoughtfully  monsieur de lamborne passed his hand across his forehead  do i not know it he muttered in this instance though it seems impossible for him to succeed the time is so short and the conditions so difficult i may count upon your assistance baron  peter drew from his pocket a crumpled piece of paper  i received a telegram from headquarters this evening he said with instructions to place myself entirely at your disposal  you will return with me then to the embassy monsieur de lamborne asked eagerly  peter did not at once reply he was standing in one of his characteristic attitudes his hands clasped behind him his head a little thrust forward watching with every appearance of courteous interest the roomful of guests stationary just now listening to the performance of a famous violinist it was perhaps by accident that his eyes met those of madame de lamborne but she smiled at him subtlymore perhaps with her wonderful eyes than with her lips themselves she was the centre of a very brilliant group a most beautiful woman holding court as was only right and proper amongst her admirers peter sighed  no he said i shall not return with you de lamborne i want you to follow my suggestions if you will  but assuredly  leave here early and go to your club remain there until one then come to the embassy i shall be there awaiting your arrival  you mean that you will go there alone i do not understand the ambassador protested why should i go to my club i do not at all understand  nevertheless do as i say peter insisted for the present excuse me i must look after my guests  the music had ceased there was a movement towards the supper room peter offered his arm to madame de lamborne who welcomed him with a brilliant smile her husband although for a frenchman he was by no means of a jealous disposition was conscious of a vague feeling of uneasiness as he watched them pass out of the room together a few minutes later he made his excuses to his wife and with a reluctance for which he could scarcely account left the house there was something in the air he felt which he did not understand he would not have admitted it to himself but he more than half divined the truth the vacant seat in his wifes carriage was filled that night by the baron de grost                                       at one oclock precisely monsieur de lamborne returned to his house and found de grost gazing with obvious respect at the ponderous safe let into the wall  a very fine affairthis he remarked motioning with his head towards it  the best of its kind monsieur de lamborne admitted no burglar yet has ever succeeded in opening one of its type here is the packet he added drawing the document from his pocket you shall see me place it in safety  peter stretched out his hand and examined the sealed envelope for a moment closely then he moved to the writingtable and placing it upon the letter scales made a note of its exact weight finally he watched it deposited in the ponderous safe suggested the word to which the lock was set and closed the door monsieur de lamborne heaved a sigh of relief  i fancy this time he said that our friends at berlin will be disappointed couch or easychair baron  the couch if you please peter replied a strong cigar and a long whisky and soda so now for our vigil  the hours crawled away once peter sat up and listened  any rats about he inquired  the ambassador was indignant  i have never heard one in my life he answered this is quite a modern house  peter dropped his matchbox and stooped to pick it up  any lights on anywhere except in this room he asked  certainly not monsieur de lamborne answered it is past three oclock and every one has gone to bed  peter rose and softly unbolted the door the passage outside was in darkness he listened intently for a moment and returned yawning  one fancies things he murmured apologetically  for example de lamborne demanded  peter shook his head  one mistakes he said the nerves become oversensitive  the dawn broke and the awakening hum of the city grew louder and louder peter rose and stretched himself  your servants are moving about in the house he remarked i think that we might consider our vigil at an end  monsieur de lamborne rose with alacrity  my friend he said i feel that i have made false pretences to you with the day i have no fear a thousand pardons for your sleepless night  my sleepless night counts for nothing peter assured him but before i go would it not be as well that we glance together inside the safe  de lamborne shook out his keys  i was about to suggest it he replied  the ambassador arranged the combination and pressed the lever slowly the great door swung back the two men peered in  untouched de lamborne exclaimed a little note of triumph in his tone  peter said nothing but held out his hand  permit me he interposed  de lamborne was conscious of a faint sense of uneasiness his companion walked across the room and carefully weighed the packet  well de lamborne cried why do you do that what is wrong  peter turned and faced him  my friend he said this is not the same packet  the ambassador stared at him incredulously  this packet can scarcely have gained two ounces in the night peter went on besides the seal is fuller i have an eye for these details  de lamborne leaned against the back of the table his eyes were a little wild but he laughed hoarsely  we fight then against the creatures of another world he declared no human being could have opened that safe last night  peter hesitated  monsieur de lamborne he said the room adjoining is your wifes  it is the salon of madame the ambassador admitted  what are the electrical appliances doing there peter demanded dont look at me like that de lamborne remember that i was here before you arrived  my wife takes an electric massage every day monsieur de lamborne answered in a hard unnatural voice in what way is monsieur le baron concerned in my wifes doings  i think that there need be no answer to that question peter said quietly it is a greater tragedy which we have to face i maintain that your safe was entered from that room a search will prove it  there will be no search there de lamborne declared fiercely i am the ambassador of france and my power under this roof is absolute i say that you shall not cross that threshold  peters expression did not change only his hands were suddenly outstretched with a curious gesturethe four fingers were raised the thumbs depressed monsieur de lamborne collapsed  i submit he muttered it is you who are the master search where you will                                       monsieur has arrived the woman demanded breathlessly  the proprietor of the restaurant himself bowed a reply his client was evidently well known to him  monsieur has ascended some few minutes ago  the woman drew a little sigh of relief a vague misgiving had troubled her during the last few hours she raised her veil as she mounted the narrow staircase which led to the one private room at the hôtel de lorraine here she was safe one more exploit accomplished one more roll of notes for the hungry fingers of her dressmaker  she entered without tapping the room at the head of the stairs pushing open the illvarnished door with its whitecurtained top at first she thought that the little apartment was empty  are you there she exclaimed advancing a few steps  the figure of a man glided from behind the worn screen close by her side and stood between her and the door  madame peter said bowing low  even then she scarcely realised that she was trapped  you she cried you baron but i do not understand you have followed me here  on the contrary madame he answered i have preceded you  her colossal vanity triumphed over her natural astuteness the man had employed spies to watch her he had lost his head it was an awkward matter this but it was to be arranged she held out her hands  monsieur she said let me beg you now to go away if you care to come and see me this evening i will explain everything it is a little family affair which brings me here  a family affair madame with bernadine the enemy of france peter declared gravely  she collapsed miserably her fingers grasping at the air the cry which broke from her lips harsh and unnatural before he could tell what was happening she was on her knees before him  spare me she begged trying to seize his hands  madame peter answered i am not your judge you will kindly hand over to me the document which you are carrying  she took it from the bosom of her dress peter glanced at it and placed it in his breastpocket  and now she faltered  peter sighedshe was a very beautiful woman  madame he said the career of a spy is as you have doubtless sometimes realised a dangerous one  it is finished she assured him breathlessly monsieur le baron you will keep my secret never again i swear it will i sin like this you will not tell my husband  your husband already knows madame was the quiet reply only a few hours ago i proved to him whence had come the leakage of so many of our secrets lately  she swayed upon her feet  he will never forgive me she cried  there are others peter declared who forgive more rarely even than husbands  a sudden illuminating flash of horror told her the truth she closed her eyes and tried to run from the room  i will not be told she screamed i will not hear i do not know who you are i will live a little longer  madame peter said the double four wages no war with women save with spies only the spy has no sex for the sake of your family permit me to send you back to your husbands house                                       that night two receptions and a dinner party were postponed all london was sympathising with monsieur de lamborne and a great many women swore never again to take a sleeping draught madame de lamborne lay dead behind the shelter of those drawn blinds and by her side an empty phial     chapter iii  the man from the old testament   bernadine sometimes called the count von hern was lunching at the savoy with the pretty wife of a cabinet minister who was just sufficiently conscious of the impropriety of her action to render the situation interesting  i wish you would tell me count von hern she said soon after they had settled down in their places why my husband seems to object to you so much i simply dared not tell him that we were going to lunch together and as a rule he doesnt mind what i do in that way  bernadine smiled slowly  ah well he remarked your husband is a politician and a very cautious man i dare say he is like some of those others who believe that because i am a foreigner and live in london that therefore i am a spy  you a spy she laughed what nonsense  why nonsense  she shrugged her shoulders she was certainly a very pretty woman and her black gown set off to its fullest advantage her deep red hair and fair complexion  i suppose because i cant imagine you anything of the sort she declared you see you hunt and play polo and do everything which the ordinary englishmen do then one meets you everywhere i think count von hern that you are much too spoilt for one thing to take life seriously  you do me an injustice he murmured  of course she chattered on i dont really know what spies do one reads about them in these silly stories but i have never felt sure that as live people they exist at all tell me count von hern what could a foreign spy do in england  bernadine twirled his fair moustache and shrugged his shoulders  indeed my dear lady he admitted i scarcely know what a spy could do nowadays a few years ago you english people were all so trusting your fortifications your battleships not to speak of your country itself were wholly at the disposal of the enterprising foreigner who desired to acquire information the party who governed great britain then seemed to have some strange idea that these things made for peace today however all that is changed  you seem to know something about it she remarked  i am afraid that mine is really only the superficial point of view he answered but i do know that there is a good deal of information which seems absolutely insignificant in itself for which some foreign countries are willing to pay for instance there was a cabinet council yesterday i believe and someone was going to suggest that a secret but official visit be paid to your new harbour works up at rosyth an announcement will probably be made in the papers during the next few days as to whether the visit is to be undertaken or not yet there are countries who are willing to pay for knowing even such an insignificant item of news as that a few hours before the rest of the world  lady maxwell laughed  well i could earn that little sum of money she declared gaily for my husband has just made me cancel a dinnerparty for next thursday because he has to go up to the stupid place  bernadine smiled it was really a very unimportant matter but he loved to feel even in his idle moments that he was not altogether wasting his time  i am sorry he said that i am not myself acquainted with one of these mythical personages that i might return you the value of your marvellous information if i dared think however that it would be in any way acceptable i could offer you the diversion of a restaurant dinnerparty for that night the duchess of castleford has kindly offered to act as hostess for me and we are all going on to the gaiety afterwards  delightful lady maxwell exclaimed i should love to come  bernadine bowed  you have then dear lady fulfilled your destiny he said you have given secret information to a foreign person of mysterious identity and accepted payment  now bernadine was a man of easy manners and unruffled composure to the natural insouciance of his aristocratic bringingup he had added the steely reserve of a man moving in the large world engaged more often than not in some hazardous enterprise yet for once in his life and in the midst of the idlest of conversations he gave himself away so utterly that even this woman with whom he was lunchinga very butterfly lady indeedcould not fail to perceive it she looked at him in something like astonishment without the slightest warning his face had become set in a rigid stare his eyes were filled with the expression of a man who sees into another world the healthy colour faded from his cheeks he was white even to the parted lips the wine dripped from his raised glass on to the tablecloth  why whatever is the matter with you she demanded is it a ghost that you see  bernadines effort was superb but he was too clever to deny the shock  a ghost indeed he answered the ghost of a man whom every newspaper in europe has declared to be dead  her eyes followed his the two people who were being ushered to a seat in their immediate vicinity were certainly of somewhat unusual appearance the man was tall and thin as a lath and he wore the clothes of the fashionable world without awkwardness and yet with the air of one who was wholly unaccustomed to them his cheekbones were remarkably high and receded so quickly towards his pointed chin that his cheeks were little more than hollows his eyes were dry and burning flashing here and there as though the man himself were continually oppressed by some furtive fear his thick black hair was shortcropped his forehead high and intellectual he was a strange figure indeed in such a gathering and his companion only served to accentuate the anachronisms of his appearance she was above all things a woman of the momentfair almost florid a little thickset with tightly laced yet passable figure her eyes were blue her hair lightcoloured she wore magnificent furs and as she threw aside her boa she disclosed a mass of jewellery around her neck and upon her bosom almost barbaric in its profusion and setting  what an extraordinary couple lady maxwell whispered  bernadine smiled  the man looks as though he had stepped out of the old testament he murmured  lady maxwells interest was purely feminine and was riveted now upon the jewellery worn by the woman bernadine under the mask of his habitual indifference which he had easily reassumed seemed to be looking away out of the restaurant into the great square of a halfsavage city looking at that marvellous crowd numbered by their thousands even by their hundreds of thousands of men and women whose arms flashed out toward the snowhung heavens whose lips were parted in one chorus of rapturous acclamation looking beyond them to the tall emaciated form of the bareheaded priest in his long robes his windtossed hair and wild eyes standing alone before that multitude in danger of death or worse at any momenttheir idol their hero and again as the memories came flooding into his brain the scene passed away and he saw the bare room with its whitewashed walls and blockedup windows he felt the darkness lit only by those flickering candles he saw the white passionwrung faces of the men who clustered together around the rude table waiting he heard their murmurs he saw the fear born in their eyes it was the night when their leader did not come  bernadine poured out another glass of wine and drank it slowly the mists were clearing away now he was in london at the savoy restaurant and within a few yards of him sat the man with whose name all europe once had rungthe man hailed by some as martyr and loathed by others as the most fiendish judas who ever drew breath bernadine was not concerned with the moral side of this strange encounter how best to use his knowledge of this mans identity was the question which beat upon his brain what use could be made of him what profit for his country and himself and then a feara sudden startling fear little profit perhaps to be made but the dangerthe danger of this man alive with such secrets locked in his bosom the thought itself was terrifying and even as he realised it a significant thing happenedhe caught the eye of the baron de grost lunching alone at a small table just inside the restaurant  you are not at all amusing his guest declared it is nearly five minutes since you have spoken  you too have been absorbed he reminded her  it is that womans jewels she admitted i never saw anything more wonderful the people are not english of course i wonder where they come from  one of the eastern countries without a doubt he replied carelessly  lady maxwell sighed  he is a peculiarlooking man she said but one could put up with a good deal for jewels like that what are you doing this afternoonpicture galleries or your club  neither unfortunately bernadine answered i have promised to go with a friend to look at some polo ponies  do you know she remarked that we have never been to see those japanese prints yet  the gallery is closed until monday he assured her falsely if you will honour me then i shall be delighted  she shrugged her shoulders but said nothing she had an idea that she was being dismissed but bernadine without the least appearance of hurry gave her no opportunity for any further suggestions he handed her into her automobile and returned at once into the restaurant he touched baron de grost upon the shoulder  my friend the enemy he exclaimed smiling  at your service in either capacity the baron replied  bernadine made a grimace and accepted the chair which de grost had indicated  if i may i will take my coffee with you he said i am growing old it does not amuse me so much to lunch with a pretty woman one has to entertain and one forgets the serious business of lunching i will take my coffee and cigarette in peace  de grost gave an order to the waiter and leaned back in his chair  now he suggested tell me exactly what it is that has brought you back into the restaurant  bernadine shrugged his shoulders  why not the pleasure of this few minutes conversation with you he asked  the baron carefully selected a cigar and lit it  that he said goes well but there are other things  as for instance  de grost leaned back in his chair and watched the smoke of his cigar curl upwards  one talks too much he remarked before the cards are upon the table it is not wise  they chatted upon various matters de grost himself seemed in no hurry to depart nor did his companion show any signs of impatience it was not until the two people whose entrance had had such a remarkable effect upon bernadine rose to leave that the mask was for a moment lifted de grost had called for his bill and paid it the two men strolled out together  baron bernadine said suavely linking his arm through the other mans as they passed into the foyer there are times when candour even amongst enemies becomes an admirable quality  those times i imagine de grost answered grimly are rare besides who is to tell the real thing from the false  you do less than justice to your perceptions my friend bernadine declared smiling  de grost merely shrugged his shoulders bernadine persisted  come he continued since you doubt me let me be the first to give you a proof that on this occasion at any rate i am candour itself you had a purpose in lunching at the savoy today that purpose i have discovered by accident we are both interested in those people  the baron de grost shook his head slowly  really he began  let me finish bernadine insisted perhaps when you have heard all that i have to say you may change your attitude we are interested in the same people but in different ways if we both move from opposite directions our friend will vanish he is clever enough at disappearing as he has proved before we do not want the same thing from him i am convinced of that let us move together and make sure that he does not evade us  is it an alliance which you are proposing de grost asked with a quiet smile  why not bernadine answered enemies have united before today against a common foe  de grost looked across the palm court to where the two people who formed the subject of their discussion were sitting in a corner both smoking both sipping some redcoloured liqueur  my dear bernadine he said i am much too afraid of you to listen any more you fancy because this mans presence here was an entire surprise to you and because you find me already on his track that i know more than you do and that an alliance with me would be to your advantage you would try to persuade me that your object with him would not be my object listen i am afraid of youyou are too clever for me i am going to leave you in sole possession  de grosts tone was final and his bow valedictory bernadine watched him stroll in a leisurely way through the foyer exchanging greetings here and there with friends watched him enter the cloakroom from which he emerged with his hat and overcoat watched him step into his automobile and leave the restaurant he turned back with a clouded face and threw himself into an easychair  ten minutes passed uneventfully people were passing backwards and forwards all the time but bernadine through his halfclosed eyes did little save watch the couple in whom he was so deeply interested at last the man rose and with a word of farewell to his companion came out from the lounge and made his way up the foyer turning toward the hotel he walked with quick nervous strides glancing now and then restlessly about him in his eyes to those who understood there was the furtive gleam of the hunted man it was the passing of one who was afraid  the woman left to herself began to look around her with some curiosity bernadine to whom a new idea had occurred moved his chair nearer to hers and was rewarded by a glance which certainly betrayed some interest a swift and unerring judge in such matters he came to the instant conclusion that she was not unapproachable he acted upon impulse rising to his feet he approached her and bowed easily but respectfully  madame he said it is impossible that i am mistaken i have had the pleasure have i not of meeting you in st petersburg  her first reception of his coming was reassuring enough at his mention of st petersburg however she frowned  i do not think so she answered in french you are mistaken i do not know st petersburg  then it was in paris bernadine continued with conviction madame is parisian without a doubt  she shook her head smiling  i do not think that i remember meeting you monsieur she replied doubtfully but perhaps  she looked up and her eyes drooped before his he was certainly a very personablelooking man and she had spoken to no one for so many months  believe me madame i could not possibly be mistaken bernadine assured her smoothly you are staying here for long  she shrugged her shoulders  heaven knows she declared my husband he has i think what you call the wander fever for myself i am tired of it in rome we settle down we stay five days all seems pleasant and suddenly my husbands whim carries us away without an hours notice the same thing at monte carlo the same at paris who can tell what will happen here to tell you the truth monsieur she added a little archly i think that if he were to come back at this moment we should probably leave england tonight  your husband is very jealous bernadine whispered softly  she shrugged her shoulders  partly jealous and partly he has the most terrible distaste for acquaintances he will not speak to strangers himself or suffer me to do so it is sometimesoh it is sometimes very triste  madame has my sympathy bernadine assured her it is an impossible lifethis no husband should be so exacting  she looked at him with her round blue eyes a touch of added colour in her cheeks  if one could but cure him she murmured  i would ask your permission to sit down bernadine remarked but i fear to intrude you are afraid perhaps that your husband may return  she shook her head  it will be better that you do not stay she declared for a moment or two he is engaged he has an appointment in his room with a gentleman but one never knows how long he may be  you have friends in london then bernadine remarked thoughtfully  of my husbands affairs the woman said there is no one so ignorant as i yet since we left our own country this is the first time i have known him willingly speak to a soul  your own country bernadine repeated softly that was russia of course your husbands nationality is very apparent  the woman looked annoyed with herself she remained silent  may i not hope bernadine begged that you will give me the pleasure of meeting you again  she hesitated for a moment  he does not leave me she replied i am not alone for five minutes during the day  bernadine scribbled the name by which he was known in that locality on a card and passed it to her  i have rooms in st jamess street quite close to here he said if you could come and have tea with me today or tomorrow it would give me the utmost pleasure  she took the card and crumpled it in her hand all the time though she shook her head  monsieur is very kind she answered i am afraidi do not think that it would be possible and now if you please you must go away i am terrified lest my husband should return  bernadine bent low in a parting salute  madame he pleaded you will come  bernadine was a handsome man and he knew well enough how to use his soft and extraordinarily musical voice he knew very well as he retired that somehow or other she would accept his invitation even then he felt dissatisfied and ill at ease as he left the place he had made a little progress but after all was it worth while supposing that the man with whom her husband was even at this moment closeted was the baron de grost he called a taxicab and drove at once to the embassy of his country                                       even at this moment de grost and the russianpaul hagon he called himselfwere standing face to face in the latters sittingroom no conventional greetings of any sort had been exchanged de grost had scarcely closed the door behind him before hagon addressed him breathlessly almost fiercely  who are you sir he demanded and what do you want with me  you had my letter de grost inquired  i had your letter the other admitted it told me nothing you speak of business what business have i with any here  my business is soon told de grost replied but in the first place i beg that you will not unnecessarily alarm yourself there is believe me no need for itno need whatever although to prevent misunderstandings i may as well tell you at once that i am perfectly well aware who it is that i am addressing  hagon collapsed into a chair he buried his face in his hands and groaned  i am not here necessarily as an enemy de grost continued you have very excellent reasons i make no doubt for remaining unknown in this city or wherever you may be as yet let me assure you your identity is not even suspected except by myself and one other those few who believe you alive believe that you are in america there is no need for anyone to know that father  stop the man begged piteously stop  de grost bowed  i beg your pardon he said  now tell me the man demanded what is your price i have had money there is not much left sophia is extravagant and travelling costs a great deal but why do i weary you with these things he added let me know what i have to pay for your silence  i am not a blackmailer de grost answered sternly i am myself a wealthy man i ask from you nothing in money i ask you nothing in that way at all a few words of information and a certain paper which i believe you have in your possession is all that i require  information hagon repeated shivering  what i ask de grost declared is really a matter of justice at the time when you were the idol of all russia and the leader of the great revolutionary party you received funds from abroad  i accounted for them hagon muttered up to a certain point i accounted for everything  you received funds from the government of a european power de grost continuedfunds to be applied towards developing the revolution i want the name of that power and proof of what i say  hagon remained motionless for a moment he had seated himself at the table his head resting upon his hand and his face turned away from de grost  you are a politician then he asked slowly  i am a politician de grost admitted i represent a great secret power which has sprung into existence during the last few years our aim at present is to bring closer together your country and great britain russia hesitates because an actual rapprochement with us is equivalent to a permanent estrangement with germany  hagon nodded  i understand he said in a low tone i have finished with politics i have nothing to say to you  i trust de grost persisted suavely that you will be better advised  hagon turned round and faced him  sir he demanded do you believe that i am afraid of death  de grost looked at him steadfastly  no he answered you have proved the contrary  if my identity is discovered hagon continued i have the means of instant death at hand i do not use it because of my love for the one person who links me to this world for her sake i live and for her sake i bear always the memory of the shameful past publish my name and whereabouts if you will i promise you that i will make the tragedy complete but for the rest i refuse to pay your price a great power trusted me and whatever their motives may have been their money came very near indeed to freeing my people i have nothing more to say to you sir  the baron de grost was taken aback he had scarcely contemplated refusal  you must understand he explained that this is not a personal matter even if i myself would spare you those who are more powerful than i will strike the society to which i belong does not tolerate failure i am empowered even to offer you their protection if you will give me the information for which i ask  hagon rose to his feet and before de grost could foresee his purpose had rung the bell  my decision is unchanging he said you can pull down the roof upon my head but i carry next my heart an instant and an unfailing means of escape  a waiter stood in the doorway  you will take this gentleman to the lift hagon directed  there was once more a touch in his manner of that halfdivine authority which had thrilled the great multitudes of his believers de grost was forced to admit defeat  not defeat he said to himself as he followed the man to the lift only a check  nevertheless it was a serious check he could not for the moment see his way farther arrived at his house he followed his usual custom and made his way at once to his wifes rooms violet was resting upon a sofa but laid down her book at his entrance  violet he declared i have come for your advice  he refuses then she asked eagerly  absolutely de grost assured her what am i to do bernadine is already upon the scent he saw him at the savoy today and recognised him  has bernadine approached him yet violet inquired  not yet her husband answered he is half afraid to move i think he realises or will do very soon how serious this mans existence may be for germany  violet was thoughtful for several moments then she looked up  bernadine will try the woman she asserted you say that hagon is infatuated  blindly de grost replied he scarcely lets her out of his sight  your people watch bernadine  always  very well then violet went on you will find that he will attempt an intrigue with the woman the rest should be easy for you  de grost sighed as he bent over his wife  my dear he said there is no subtlety like that of a woman                                       bernadines instinct had not deceived him and the following afternoon his servant who had already received orders silently ushered madame hagon into his apartments she was wrapped in magnificent sables and heavily veiled bernadine saw at once that she was very nervous and wholly terrified he welcomed her in as matteroffact a manner as possible  madame he declared this is quite charming of you you must sit in my easychair here and my man shall bring us some tea i drink mine always after the fashion of your country with lemon but i doubt whether we make it so well wont you unfasten your jacket i am afraid my rooms are rather warm  madame had collected herself but it was quite obvious that she was unused to adventures of this sort her hand when he took it trembled and more than once she glanced furtively toward the door  yes i have come she murmured i do not know why it is not right for me to come yet there are times when i am wearytimes when paul seems fierce and when i am terrified sometimes i even wish that i were back  your husband seems very highly strung bernadine remarked he has doubtless led an exciting life  as to that she replied gazing around her now and gradually becoming more at her ease i know but little he was a student professor at moschaume when i met him i think that he was at one of the universities in st petersburg  bernadine glanced at her covertly it came to him as an inspiration that the woman did not know the truth  you are from russia then after all he said smiling i felt sure of it  yes she admitted reluctantly paul is so queer in these things he will not have me talk of it he prefers that we are taken for french people indeed she went on it is not i who desire to think too much of russia it is not a year since my father was killed in the riots and two of my brothers were sent to siberia  bernadine was deeply interested  they were amongst the revolutionaries  she nodded  yes she answered  and your husband  he too was with them in sympathy secretly too i believe that he worked amongst them only he had to be careful you see his position at the college made it difficult  bernadine looked into the womans eyes and he knew then that she was speaking the truth this man was indeed a great master he had kept her in ignorance  always bernadine said a few minutes later as he passed her tea i read with the deepest interest of the peoples movement in russia tell me what became eventually of their great leaderthe wonderful father paul  she set down her cup untasted and her blue eyes flashed with a fire which turned them almost to the colour of steel  wonderful indeed she exclaimed wonderful judas it was he who wrecked the cause it was he who sold the lives and liberty of all of us for gold  i heard a rumour of that bernadine remarked but i never believed it  it was true she declared passionately  and where is he now bernadine asked  dead she answered fiercely torn to pieces we believe one night in a house near moscow may it be so  she was silent for a moment as though engaged in prayer bernadine spoke no more of these things he talked to her kindly keeping up always his rôle of respectful but hopeful admirer  you will come again soon he begged when at last she insisted upon going  she hesitated  it is so difficult she murmured if my husband knew  bernadine laughed and touched her fingers caressingly  need one tell him he whispered you see i trust you i pray that you will come                                       bernadine was a man rarely moved towards emotion of any sort yet even he was conscious of a certain sense of excitement as he stood looking out upon the embankment from the windows of paul hagons sittingroom a few days later madame was sitting on the settee it was for her answer to a question that he waited  monsieur she said at last turning slowly towards him it must be no indeed i am sorry for you have been very charming to me and without you i should have been dull but to come to your rooms and dine alone tonight it is impossible  your husband cannot return before the morning bernadine reminded her  it makes no difference she answered paul is sometimes fierce and rough but he is generous and all his life he has worshipped me he behaves strangely at times but i know that he caresall the time more perhaps than i deserve  and there is no one else bernadine asked softly who can claim even the smallest place in your heart  monsieur the woman begged you must not ask me that i think that you had better go away  bernadine stood quite still for several moments it was the climax towards which he had steadfastly guided the course of this mild intrigue  madame he declared you must not send me away you shall not  she held out her hand  then you must not ask impossible things she answered  then bernadine took the plunge he became suddenly very grave  sophia he said i am keeping a great secret from you and i can do it no longer when you speak to me of your husband you drive me mad if i believed that really you loved him i would go away and leave it to chance whether or not you ever discovered the truth as it is  well she interposed breathlessly  as it is he continued i am going to tell you now your husband has deceived you he is deceiving you every moment  she looked at him incredulously  you mean that there is another woman  bernadine shook his head  worse than that he answered your husband stole even your love under false pretences you think that his life is a strange one that his nerves have broken down that he flies from place to place for distraction for change of scene it is not so he left rome he left nice he left paris for one and the same reason he left because he went in peril of his life i know little of your history but i know as much as this if ever a man deserved the fate from which he flees your husband deserves it  you are mad she faltered  no i am sane he went on it is you who are mad not to have understood your husband goes ever in fear of his life his real name is one branded with ignominy throughout the world the man whom you have married to whom you are so scrupulously faithful is the man who sent your father to death and your brothers to siberia  father paul she screamed  you have lived with him you are his wife bernadine declared  the colour had left her cheeks her eyes with their pencilled brows were fixed in an almost ghastly stare her breath was coming in uneven gasps she looked at him in silent terror  it is not true she cried at last it cannot be true  sophia he said you can prove it for yourself i know a little of your husband and his doings does he not carry always with him a black box which he will not allow out of his sight  always she assented how did you know by night his hand rests upon it by day if he goes out it is in my charge  fetch it now bernadine directed i will prove my words  she did not hesitate for a moment she disappeared into the inner room and came back after only a few moments absence carrying a black leather dispatchbox  you have the key he asked  yes she answered looking at him and trembling but i dare notoh i dare not open it  sophia he said if my words are not true i will pass out of your life for ever i challenge you if you open that box you will know that your husband is indeed the greatest scoundrel in europe  she drew a key from a gold chain around her neck  there are two locks she told him the other is a combination but i know the word whos that  she started suddenly there was a loud tapping at the door bernadine threw an antimacassar half over the box but he was too late de grost and hagon had crossed the threshold the woman stood like some dumb creature hagon transfixed stood with his eyes riveted upon bernadine his face was distorted with passion he seemed like a man beside himself with fury de grost came slowly forward into the middle of the room  count von hern he said i think that you had better leave  the woman found words  not yet she cried not yet paul listen to me this man has told me a terrible thing  the breath seemed to come through hagons teeth like a hiss  he has told you  listen to me she continued it is the truth which you must tell now he says that youyou are father paul  hagon did not hesitate  it is true he admitted  then there was a silenceshort but tragical hagon seemed suddenly to have collapsed he was like a man who has just had a stroke he stood muttering to himself  it is the endthisthe end he said in a low tone it was for your sake sophia i came to you poor and you would have nothing to say to me my love for you burned in my veins like fever it was for you i did itfor your sake i sold my honour the love of my country the freedom of my brothers for your sake i risked an awful death for your sake i have lived like a hunted man with the cry of the wolves always in my ears and the fear of death and of eternal torture with me day by day have pity on me  she was unmoved her face had lost all expression no one noticed in that rapt moment that bernadine had crept from the room  it was you she cried who killed my father and sent my brothers into exile  god help me he moaned  she turned to de grost  take him away with you please she said i have finished with him  sophia he pleaded  she leaned across the table and struck him heavily upon the cheek  if you stay here she muttered i shall kill you myself                                       that night the body of an unknown foreigner was found in the attic of a cheap lodginghouse in soho the discovery itself and the verdict at the inquest occupied only a few lines in the morning newspapers those few lines were the epitaph of one who was very nearly a rienzi the greater part of his papers de grost mercifully destroyed but one in particular he preserved within a week the muchdelayed treaty was signed at paris london and st petersburg     chapter iv  the first shot   de grost and his wife were dining together at the corner table in a fashionable but somewhat bohemian restaurant both had been in the humour for reminiscences and they had outstayed most of their neighbours  i wonder what people really think of us violet remarked pensively i told lady amershal when she asked us to go there this evening that we always dined together alone somewhere once a week and she absolutely refused to believe me with your own husband my dear she kept on repeating  her ladyships tastes are more catholic the baron declared dryly yet after all violet the real philosophy of married life demands something of this sort  violet smiled and fingered her pearls for a minute  what the real philosophy of married life may be i do not know she said but i am perfectly content with our rendering of it what a fortunate thing peter with your intensely practical turn of mind that nature endowed you with so much sentiment  de grost gazed reflectively at the cigarette which he had just selected from his case  well he remarked there have been times when i have cursed myself for a fool but on the whole sentiment keeps many fires burning  she leaned towards him and dropped her voice a little  tell me she begged do you ever think of the years we spent together in the country do you ever regret  he smiled thoughtfully  it is a hard question that he admitted there were days there which i loved but there were days too when the restlessness camedays when i longed to hear the hum of the city and to hear men speak whose words were of life and death and the great passions i am not sure violet whether after all it is well for one who has lived to withdraw absolutely from the thrill of life  she laughed softly but gaily  i am with you she declared absolutely i think that the fairies must have poured into my blood the joy of living for its own sake i should be an ungrateful woman indeed if i found anything to complain of nowadays yet there is one thing that sometimes troubles me she went on after a moments pause  and that he asked  the danger she said slowly i do not want to lose you peter there are times when i am afraid  de grost flicked the ash from his cigarette  the days are passing he remarked when men point revolvers at one another and hire assassins to gain their ends now it is more a battle of wits we play chess on the board of life still but we play with ivory pieces instead of steel and poison our brains direct and not our muscles  she sighed  it is only the one man of whom i am afraid she said you have outwitted him so often and he does not forgive  de grost smiled it was an immense compliment this  bernadine he murmured softly otherwise our friend the count von hern  bernadine she repeated all that you say is true but when one fails with modern weapons one changes the form of attack bernadine at heart is a savage  the hate of such a man de grost remarked complacently is worth having he has had his own way over here for years he seems to have found the knack of living in a maze of intrigue and remaining untouchable there were a dozen things before i came upon the scene which ought to have ruined him yet there never appeared to be anything to take hold of the criminal investigation department thought they had no chance i remember sir john dory telling me in disgust that bernadine was like one of those marvellous criminals one only reads about in fiction who seem when they pass along the dangerous places to walk upon the air and leave no trace behind  before you came she said he had never known a failure do you think that he is a man likely to forgive  i do not de grost answered grimly it is a battle of coursea battle all the time yet violet between you and me if bernadine were to go half the savour of life for me would depart with him  then there came a serious and wholly unexpected interruption a man in dark plain clothes still wearing his overcoat and carrying a bowler hat had been standing in the entrance of the restaurant for a moment or two looking around the room as though in search of someone at last he caught the eye of the baron de grost and came quickly towards him  charles the baron remarked raising his eyebrows i wonder what he wants  a sudden cloud had fallen upon their little feast violet watched the coming of her husbands servant and the reading of the note which he presented to his master with an anxiety which she could not wholly conceal the baron read the note twice scrutinising a certain part of it closely with the aid of the monocle which he seldom used then he folded it up and placed it in the breastpocket of his coat  at what hour did you receive this charles he asked  a messenger brought it in a taxicab about ten minutes ago sir the man replied he said that it was of the utmost importance and that i had better try and find you  a district messenger  a man in ordinary clothes sir charles answered he looked like a porter in a warehouse or something of that sort i forgot to say that you were rung up on the telephone three times previously by mr greening  the baron nodded  you can go he said there is no reply  the man bowed and retired de grost called for his bill  is it anything serious violet inquired  no not exactly serious he answered i do not understand what has happened but they have sent for me to gowell where it was agreed that i should not go except as a matter of urgent necessity  violet knew better than to show any signs of disquietude  is it in london she asked  certainly her husband replied i shall take a taxicab from here i am sorry dear to have one of our evenings disturbed in this manner i have always done my best to avoid it but this summons is urgent  she rose and he wrapped her cloak around her  you will drive straight home wont you he begged i dare say that i may be back within an hour myself  and if not she asked in a low tone  if not he replied there is nothing to be done  violet bit her lip but as he handed her into the small electric brougham which was waiting she smiled into his face  you will come back and soon peter she declared confidently wherever you go i am sure of that you see i have faith in my star which watches over you  he kissed her fingers and turned away the commissionaire had already called him a taxicab  to london bridge he ordered after a moments hesitation and drove off  the traffic citywards had long since finished for the day and he reached his destination within ten minutes of leaving the restaurant here he paid the man and entering the station turned to the refreshmentroom and ordered a liqueur brandy while he sipped it he smoked a cigarette and fully reread in a strong light the note which he had received the signature especially he pored over for some time at last however he replaced it in his pocket paid his bill and stepping out once more on to the platform entered a telephone booth a few minutes later he left the station and turning to the right walked slowly as far as tooley street he kept on the righthand side until he arrived at the spot where the great arches with their scanty lights make a gloomy thoroughfare into bermondsey in the shadow of the first of these he paused and looked steadfastly across the street there were few people passing and practically no traffic in front of him was a row of warehouses all save one of which was wrapped in complete darkness it was the one where some lights were still burning which de grost stood and watched  the lights such as they were seemed to illuminate the ground floor only from his hidden post he could see the shoulders of a man apparently bending over a ledger diligently writing at the next window a youth seated upon a tall stool was engaged in presumably the same avocation there was nothing about the place in the least mysterious or outoftheway even the blinds of the offices had been left undrawn the man and the boy who were alone visible seemed in a sense to be working under protest every now and then the former stopped to yawn and the latter performed a difficult balancing feat upon his stool de grost having satisfied his curiosity came presently from his shelter almost running into the arms of a policeman who looked at him closely the baron who had an unlighted cigarette in his mouth stopped to ask for a light and his appearance at once set at rest any suspicions the policeman might have had  i have a warehouse myself down in these parts he remarked as he struck the match but i dont allow my people to work as late as that  he pointed across the way and the policeman smiled  they are very often late there sir he said it is a continental wine business and theres always one or two of them over time  its bad business all the same de grost declared pleasantly goodnight policeman  goodnight sir  de grost crossed the road diagonally as though about to take the short cut across london bridge but as soon as the policeman was out of sight he retraced his steps to the building which they had been discussing and turning the battered brass handle of the door walked calmly in on his right and left were countinghouses framed with glass in front the cavernous and ugly depths of a gloomy warehouse he knocked upon the windowpane on the right and passed forward a step or two as though to enter the office the boy who had been engaged in the lefthand countinghouse came gliding from his place passed silently behind the visitor and turned the key of the outer door what followed seemed to happen as though by some mysteriously directed force the figures of men came stealing out from the hidden places the clerk who had been working so hard at his desk calmly divested himself of a false moustache and wig and assuming a more familiar appearance strolled out into the warehouse de grost looked around him with absolutely unruffled composure he was the centre of a little circle of men respectably dressed but every one of them hardfeatured with something in their faces which suggested not the ordinary toiler but the fighting animalthe man who lives by his wits and knows something of danger on the outskirts of the circle stood bernadine  really de grost declared removing his cigarette from his mouth for a moment this is most unexpected in the matter of dramatic surprises my friend bernadine you are most certainly in a class by yourself  bernadine smiled  you will understand of course he said that this little entertainment is entirely for your amusementwell stagemanaged perhaps but my supers are not to be taken seriously since you are here baron might i ask you to precede me a few steps to the tasting office  by all means de grost answered it is this way i believe  he walked with unconcerned footsteps down the warehouse on either side of which were great bins and a wilderness of racking until he came to a small glassenclosed office built out from the wall without hesitation he entered it and removing his hat selected the more comfortable of the two chairs bernadine alone of the others followed him inside closing the door behind de grost who appeared exceedingly comfortable stretched out his hand and took a small black bottle from a tiny mahogany racking fixed against the wall by his side  you will excuse me my dear bernadine he said but i see my friend greening has been tasting a few wines the xx upon the label here signifies approval with your permission  he half filled a glass and pushed the bottle towards bernadine  greenings taste is unimpeachable de grost declared setting down his glass empty no use being a director of a city business you know unless one interests oneself personally in it greenings judgment is simply marvellous i have never tasted a more beautiful wine if the boom in sherry does come he continued complacently we shall be in an excellent position to deal with it  bernadine laughed softly  oh my friendpeter ruff or baron de grost or whatever you may choose to call yourself he said i am indeed wise to have come to the conclusion that you and i are too big to occupy the same little spot on earth  de grost nodded approvingly  i was beginning to wonder he remarked whether you would not soon arrive at that decision  having arrived at it bernadine continued looking intently at his companion the logical sequence naturally occurs to you  precisely my dear bernadine de grost assented you say to yourself no doubt one of us two must go being yourself you would naturally conclude that it must be me to tell you the truth i have been expecting some sort of enterprise of this description for a considerable time  bernadine shrugged his shoulders  your expectations he said seem scarcely to have provided you with a safe conduct  de grost gazed reflectively into his empty glass  you see he explained i am such a lucky person your arrangements tonight however are i perceive unusually complete  i am glad you appreciate them bernadine remarked dryly  i would not for a moment de grost continued ask an impertinent or an unnecessary question but i must confess that i am rather concerned to know the fate of my managerthe gentleman whom you yourself with the aid of a costumier so ably represented  bernadine sighed  alas he said your manager was a very obstinate person  and my clerk  incorruptible bernadine declared absolutely incorruptible i congratulate you de grost your society is one of the most wonderful upon the face of this earth i know little about it but my admiration is very sincere their attention to details and the personnel of their staff is almost perfect i may tell you at once that no sum that could be offered tempted either of these men  i am delighted to hear it de grost replied but i must plead guilty to a little temporary anxiety as to their present whereabouts  at this moment bernadine remarked they are within a few feet of us but as you are doubtless aware access to your delightful river is obtainable from these premises to be frank with you my dear baron we are waiting for the tide to rise  so thoughtful about these trifles de grost murmured but their present position they are i trust not uncomfortable  bernadine stood up and moved to the farther end of the office he beckoned his companion to his side and drawing an electric torch from his pocket flashed the light into a dark corner behind an immense bin the forms of a man and a youth bound with ropes and gagged lay stretched upon the floor de grost sighed  i am afraid he said that mr greening at any rate is most uncomfortable  bernadine turned off the light  at least baron he declared if such extreme measures should become necessary i can promise you one thingyou shall have a quicker passage into eternity than they  de grost resumed his seat  has it really come to that he asked will nothing but so crude a proceeding as my absolute removal satisfy you  nothing else is i fear practicable bernadine replied unless you decide to listen to reason believe me my dear friend i shall miss you and our small encounters exceedingly but unfortunately you stand in the way of my career you are the only man who has persistently baulked me you have driven me to use against you means which i had grown to look upon as absolutely extinct in the upper circles of our profession  de grost peered through the glass walls of the office  eight men not counting yourself he remarked and my poor manager and his faithful clerk lying bound and helpless it is heavy odds bernadine  there is no question of odds i think bernadine answered smoothly you are much too clever a person to refuse to admit that you are entirely in my power  and as regards terms i really dont feel in the least anxious to make my final bow with so little notice de grost said to tell you the truth i have been finding life quite interesting lately  bernadine eyed his prisoner keenly such absolute composure was in itself disturbing he was for the moment aware of a slight sensation of uneasiness which his common sense however speedily disposed of  there are two ways he announced of dealing with an opponent there is the oldfashioned onecrude but in a sense eminently satisfactorywhich sends him finally to adorn some other sphere  i do not like that one de grost interrupted get on with the alternative  the alternative bernadine declared is when his capacity for harm can be destroyed  that needs a little explanation de grost murmured  precisely for instance if you were to become absolutely discredited i think that you would be effectually out of my way your people do not forgive  then discredit me by all means de grost begged it sounds unpleasant but i do not like your callous reference to the river  bernadine gazed at his ancient opponent for several moments after all what was this but the splendid bravado of a beaten man who is too clever not to recognise defeat  i shall require he said your code the keys of your safe which contains a great many documents of interest to me and a free entry into your house  de grost drew a bunch of keys reluctantly from his pocket and laid them upon the desk  you will find the code bound in green morocco leather he announced on the lefthand side underneath the duplicate of a proposed treaty between italy andsome other power between ourselves bernadine i really expect that that is what you are after  bernadines eyes glistened  what about the safe conduct into your house he asked  de grost drew his case from his pocket and wrote a few lines on the back of one of his cards  this will ensure you entrance there he said and access to my study if you see my wife please reassure her as to my absence  i shall certainly do so bernadine agreed with a faint smile  if i may be pardoned for alluding to a purely personal matter de grost continued what is to become of me  you will be bound and gagged in the same manner as your manager and his clerk bernadine replied smoothly i regret the necessity but you see i can afford to run no risks at four oclock in the morning you will be released it must be part of our agreement that you allow the man who stays behind the others for the purpose of setting you free to depart unmolested i think i know you better than to imagine you would be guilty of such gaucherie as an appeal to the police  that unfortunately de grost declared with a little sigh is as you well know out of the question you are too clever for me bernadine after all i shall have to go back to my farm  bernadine opened the door and called softly to one of his men in less than five minutes de grost was bound hand and foot bernadine stepped back and eyed his adversary with an air of illdisguised triumph  i trust baron de grost he said that you will be as comfortable as possible under the circumstances  de grost lay quite still he was powerless to move or speak  immediately bernadine continued i have presented myself at your house verified your safe conduct and helped myself to certain papers which i am exceedingly anxious to obtain he went on i shall telephone here to the man whom i leave in charge and you will be set at liberty in due course if for any reason i meet with treachery and i do not telephone you will join mr greening and his young companion in a littleshall we call it aquatic recreation i wish you a pleasant hour and success in the future baronas a farmer  bernadine withdrew and whispered his orders to his men soon the electric light was turned out and the place was in darkness the front door was opened and closed the group of confederates upon the pavement lit cigarettes and wished one another goodnight with the brisk air of tired employees released at last from long labours then there was silence  it was barely eleven oclock when bernadine reached the westend of london his clothes had become a trifle disarranged and he called for a few minutes at his rooms in st jamess street afterwards he walked to merton house and rang the bell to the servant who answered it he handed his masters card  will you show me the way to the library he asked i have some papers to collect for the baron de grost  the man hesitated even with the card in his hand it seemed a somewhat unusual proceeding  will you step inside sir he begged i should like to show this to the baroness the master is exceedingly particular about anyone entering his study  do what you like so long as you do not keep me waiting bernadine replied your masters instructions are clear enough  violet came down the great staircase a few moments later still in her dinnergown her face a little pale her eyes luminous bernadine smiled as he accepted her eagerly offered hand she was evidently anxious a thrill of triumph warmed his blood once she had been less kind to him than she seemed now  my husband gave you this she exclaimed  a few minutes ago bernadine answered he tried to make his instructions as clear as possible we are jointly interested in a small matter which needs immediate action  she led the way to the study  it seems strange she remarked that you and he should be working together i thought that you were on opposite sides  it is a matter of chance bernadine told her your husband is a wise man baroness he knows when to listen to reason  she threw open the door of the study which was in darkness  if you will wait a moment she said closing the door i will turn on the electric light  she touched the knobs in the wall and the room was suddenly flooded with illumination at the further end of the apartment was the great safe close to it in an easychair his evening coat changed for a smokingjacket with a neatly tied black tie replacing his crumpled white cravat the baron de grost sat awaiting his guest a fierce oath broke from bernadines lips he turned toward the door only in time to hear the key turn violet tossed it lightly in the air across to her husband  my dear bernadine the latter remarked on the whole i do not think that this has been one of your successes my keys if you please  bernadine stood for a moment his face dark with passion  your keys are here baron de grost he said placing them upon the table if a bungling amateur may make such a request of a professor may i inquire how you escaped from your bonds and reached here before me  the baron de grost smiled  really he said you have only to think for yourself for a moment my dear bernadine and you will understand in the first place the letter you sent me signed greening was clearly a forgery there was no one else anxious to get me into their power hence i associated it at once with you naturally i telephoned to the chief of my staffi too am obliged to employ some of these ununiformed policemen my dear bernadine as you may be aware it may interest you to know further that there are seven entrances to the warehouse in tooley street through one of these something like twenty of my men passed and were already concealed in the place when i entered at another of the doors a motorcar waited for me if i had chosen to lift my finger at any time your men would have been overpowered and i might have had the pleasure of dictating terms to you in my own office such a course did not appeal to me you and i as you know dear count von hern conduct our peculiar business under very delicate conditions and the least thing we either of us desire is notoriety i managed things as i thought for the best the moment you left the place my men swarmed in we gently but firmly ejected your guard released greening and my clerk and i passed you myself in fleet street a little more comfortable i think in my forty horsepower motorcar than you in that very disreputable hansom the other details are too absurdly simple one need not enlarge upon them  bernadine shrugged his shoulders  i am at your service he declared calmly  de grost laughed  my dear fellow he said need i say that you are free to come or go to take a whisky and soda with me or to depart at onceexactly as you feel inclined the door was locked only until you restored to me my keys  he crossed the room fitted the key in the lock and turned it  bernadine drew himself up  i will not drink with you he said but some day a reckoning shall come  he turned to the door de grost laid his finger upon the bell  show count von hern out he directed the astonished servant who appeared a moment or two later     chapter v  the seven suppers of andrea korust   baron de grost was enjoying what he had confidently looked forward to as an evenings relaxation pure and simple he sat in one of the front rows of the stalls of the alhambra his wife by his side and an excellent cigar in his mouth an hour or so before he had been in telephonic communication with paris had spoken with sogrange himself and received his assurance of a calm in political and criminal affairs amounting almost to stagnation it was out of the season and though his popularity was as great as ever neither he nor his wife had any social engagements hence this evening at a musichall which peter for his part was finding thoroughly amusing  the place was packedsome said owing to the engagement of andrea korust and his brother others to the presence of mademoiselle sophie celaire in her wonderful danse des apaches the violinist that night had a great reception three times he was called before the curtain three times he was obliged to reiterate his grateful but immutable resolve never to yield to the nightly storm which demanded more from a man who has given of his best slim with the worn face and hollow eyes of a genius he stood and bowed his thanks but when he thought the time had arrived he disappeared and though the house shook for minutes afterwards nothing could persuade him to reappear  afterward came the turn which notwithstanding the furore caused by andrea korusts appearance was generally considered to be equally responsible for the packed housethe apache dance of mademoiselle sophie celaire peter sat slightly forward in his chair as the curtain went up for a time he seemed utterly absorbed by the performance violet glanced at him once or twice curiously it began to occur to her that it was not so much the dance as the dancer in whom her husband was interested  you have seen her beforethis mademoiselle celaire she whispered  peter nodded  yes he admitted i have seen her before  the dance proceeded it was like many others of its sort only a little more daring a little more finished mademoiselle celaire in her tightfitting shabby black frock with her wild mass of hair her flashing eyes her seductive gestures was without doubt a marvellous person the baron watched her every movement with absorbed attention even when the curtain went down he forgot to clap his eyes followed her off the stage violet shrugged her shoulders she was looking very handsome herself in a black velvet dinner gown and a hat so exceedingly parisian that no one had had the heart to ask her to remove it  my dear peter she remarked reprovingly a moderate amount of admiration for that very agile young lady i might perhaps be inclined to tolerate but having watched you for the last quarter of an hour i am bound to confess that i am becoming jealous  of mademoiselle celaire he asked  of mademoiselle sophie celaire  he leaned a little towards her his lips were parted he was about to make a statement or a confession just then a tall commissionaire leaned over from behind and touched him on the shoulder  for monsieur le baron de grost he announced handing peter a note  peter glanced towards his wife  you permit me he murmured breaking the seal  violet shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly her husband was already absorbed in the few lines hastily scrawled across the sheet of notepaper which he held in his hand       illustration 4 monsieur baron de grost illustration backward      4       dear monsieur le baron       come to my dressingroom without fail as soon as you receive      this       sophie celaire  violet looked over his shoulder  the hussy she exclaimed indignantly  her husband raised his eyebrows with his forefinger he merely tapped the two numerals  the double four she gasped  he looked around and nodded the commissionaire was waiting peter took up his silk hat from under the seat  if i am detained dear he whispered youll make the best of it wont you the car will be here and frederick will be looking out for you  of course she answered cheerfully i shall be quite all right  she nodded brightly and peter took his departure he passed through a door on which was painted private and through a maze of scenery and stage hands and ballet ladies by a devious route to the region of the dressingrooms his guide conducted him to the door of one of these and knocked  entrez monsieur a shrill feminine voice replied  peter entered and closed the door behind him the commissionaire remained outside mademoiselle celaire turned to greet her visitor  it is a few words i desire with you as quickly as possible if you please monsieur le baron she said advancing towards him listen  she had brushed out her hair and it hung from her head straight and a little stiff almost like the hair of an indian woman she had washed her face free of all cosmetics and her pallor was almost waxen she wore a dressinggown of green silk her discarded black frock lay upon the floor  i am entirely at your service mademoiselle peter answered bowing continue if you please  you sup with me tonightyou are my guest  he hesitated  i am very much honoured he murmured it is an affair of urgency then mademoiselle will remember that i am not alone here  she threw out her hands scornfully  they told me in paris that you were a genius she exclaimed cannot you feel then when a thing is urgent do you not know it without being told you must meet me with a carriage at the stage door in forty minutes we sup in hamilton place with andrea korust and his brother  with whom peter asked surprised  with the korust brothers she repeated i have just been talking to andrea he calls himself a hungarian bah they are as much hungarian as i am  peter leaned slightly against the table and looked thoughtfully at his companion he was trying to remember whether he had ever heard anything of these young men  mademoiselle he said the prospect of partaking of any meal in your company is in itself enchanting but i do not know your friends the korust brothers apart from their wonderful music i do not recollect ever having heard of them before in my life what excuse have i then for accepting their hospitality pardon me too if i add that you have not as yet spoken as to the urgency of this affair  she turned from him impatiently and throwing herself back into the chair from which she had risen at his entrance she began to exchange the thick woollen stockings which she had been wearing upon the stage for others of fine silk  oh la la she exclaimed you are very slow monsieur le baron it is perhaps my stage name which has misled you i am marie lapouse does that convey anything to you  a great deal peter admitted quickly you stand very high upon the list of my agents whom i may trust  then stay here no longer she begged for my maid waits outside and i need her services go back and make your excuses to your wife in forty minutes i shall expect you at the stage door  an affair of diplomacy this or brute force he inquired  heaven knows what may happen she replied to tell you the truth i do not know myself be prepared for anything but for heavens sake go now i can dress no further without my maid and andrea korust may come in at any moment i do not wish him to find you here  peter made his way thoughtfully back to his seat he explained the situation to his wife so far as he could and sent her home then he waited until the car returned smoking a cigarette and trying once more to remember if he had ever heard anything of andrea korust or his brother from sogrange punctually at the time stated he was outside the stage door of the musichall and a few minutes later mademoiselle celaire appeared a dazzling vision of furs and smiles and jewellery imperfectly concealed a small crowd pressed around to see the famous frenchwoman peter handed her gravely across the pavement into his waiting motorcar one or two of the loungers gave vent to a groan of envy at the sight of the diamonds which blazed from her neck and bosom peter smiled as he gave the address to his servant and took his place by the side of his companion  they see only the externals this mob he remarked they picture to themselves perhaps a little supper for two alas  mademoiselle celaire laughed at him softly  you need not trouble to assume that most disconsolate of expressions my dear baron she assured him your reputation as a man of gallantry is beyond question but remember that i know you also for the most devoted and loyal of husbands we waste no time in folly you and i it is the business of the double four  peter was relieved but his innate politeness forbade his showing it  proceed he said  the brothers korust she went on leaning towards him have a weeks engagement at the alhambra their salary is six hundred pounds they play very beautifully of course but i think that it is as much as they are worth  peter agreed with her fervently he had no soul for music  they have taken the furnished house belonging to one of your dukes in hamilton place for which we are bound taken it too at a fabulous rent mademoiselle celaire continued they have installed there a chef and a whole retinue of servants they were here for seven nights they have issued invitations for seven supper parties  hospitable young men they seem to be peter murmured i read in one of the stage papers that andrea is a count in his own country and that they perform in public only for the love of their music and for the sake of the excitement and travel  a paragraph wholly inspired and utterly false mademoiselle celaire declared firmly sitting a little forward in the car and laying her hand ablaze with jewels upon his coat sleeve listen they call themselves hungarians bah i know that they are in touch with a great european court both of them the court of the country to which they really belong they have plans plans and schemes connected with their visit here which i do not understand i have done my best with andrea korust but he is not a man to be trusted i know that there is something more in these seven supper parties than idle hospitality i and others like me artistes and musicians are invited to give the assemblies a properly bohemian tone but there are to be other guests attracted there no doubt because the papers have spoken of these gatherings  you have some idea of what it all means in your mind peter suggested  it is too vague to put into words she declared shaking her head we must both watch afterwards we will if you like compare notes  the car drew up before the doors of a handsome house in hamilton place a footman received peter and relieved him of his hat and overcoat a trim maid performed the same office for mademoiselle celaire they met a moment or two later and were ushered into a large drawingroom in which a dozen or two of men and women were already assembled and from which came a pleasant murmur of voices and laughter the apartment was hung with pale green satin the furniture was mostly chippendale upholstered in the same shade a magnificent grand piano stood open in a smaller room just visible beyond only one thing seemed strange to the two newly arrived guests the room was entirely lit with shaded candles giving a certain mysterious but not unpleasant air of obscurity to the whole suite of apartments through the gloom the jewels and eyes of the women seemed to shine with a new brilliance slight eccentricities of toilettefor a part of the gathering was distinctly bohemianwere softened and subdued the whole effect was somewhat weird but also picturesque  andrea korust advanced from a little group to meet his guests off the stage he seemed at first sight frailer and slighter than ever his dress coat had been exchanged for a velvet dinner jacket and his white tie for a drooping black bow he had a habit of blinking nearly all the time as though his large brown eyes which he seldom wholly opened were weaker than they appeared to be nevertheless when he came to within a few paces of his newly arrived visitors they shone with plenty of expression without any change of countenance however he held out his hand  dear andrea mademoiselle celaire exclaimed you permit me that i present to you my dear friend well known in parisalas many years agomonsieur le baron de grost monsieur le baron was kind enough to pay his respects to me this evening and i have induced him to become my escort here  it was my good fortune peter remarked smiling that i saw mademoiselle celaires name upon the bills this eveningmy good fortune since it has procured for me the honour of an acquaintance with a musician so distinguished  you are very kind monsieur le baron korust replied  you stay here i regret to hear a very short time  alas andrea korust admitted it is so for myself i would that it were longer i find your london so attractive the people so friendly they fall in with my whims so charmingly i have a hatred you know of solitude i like to make acquaintances wherever i go to have delightful women and interesting men around to forget that life is not always gay if i am too much alone i am miserable and when i am miserable i am in a very bad way indeed i cannot then make music  peter smiled gravely and sympathetically  and your brother does he too share your gregarious instincts  korust paused for a moment before replying his eyes were quite wide open now if one could judge from his expression one would certainly have said that the baron de grosts attempts to ingratiate himself with his host were distinctly unsuccessful  my brother has exactly opposite instincts he said slowly he finds no pleasure in society at the sound of a womans voice he hides  he is not here then peter asked glancing around  andrea korust shook his head  it is doubtful whether he joins us this evening at all he declared my sister however is wholly of my disposition monsieur le baron will permit me that i present her  peter bowed low before a very handsome young woman with flashing black eyes and a type of feature undoubtedly belonging to one of the countries of eastern europe she was picturesquely dressed in a gown of flaming red silk made as though in one piece without trimming or flounces and she seemed inclined to bestow upon her new acquaintance all the attention that he might desire she took him at once into a corner and seated herself by his side it was impossible for peter not to associate the empressement of her manner with the few words which andrea korust had whispered into her ear at the moment of their introduction  so you she murmured are the wonderful baron de grost i have heard of you so often  wonderful peter repeated with twinkling eyes i have never been called that before i feel that i have no claim whatever to distinction especially in a gathering like this  she shrugged her shoulders and glanced carelessly across the room  they are well enough she admitted but one wearies of genius on every side of one genius is not the best thing in the world to live with you know it has whims and fancies for instance look at these roomsthe gloom the obscurityand i love so much the light  peter smiled  it is the privilege of genius he remarked to have whims and to indulge in them  she sighed  to do andrea justice she said it is perhaps scarcely a whim that he chooses to receive his guests in semidarkness he has weak eyes and he is much too vain to wear spectacles tell me you know everyone here  no one peter declared please enlighten me if you think it necessary for myself he added dropping his voice a little i feel that the happiness of my evening is assured without making any further acquaintances  but you came as the guest of mademoiselle celaire she reminded him doubtfully with a faint regretful sigh and a provocative gleam in her eyes  i saw mademoiselle celaire tonight for the first time for years peter replied i called to see her in her dressingroom and she claimed me for an escort this evening i am alas a very occasional wanderer in the pleasant paths of bohemia  if that is really true she murmured i suppose i must tell you something about the people or you will feel that you have wasted your opportunity  mademoiselle peter whispered  she held out her hand and laughed into his face  no she interrupted i shall do my duty opposite you is mademoiselle drezani the famous singer at covent garden do i need to tell you that i wonder rudolf maesterling the dramatist stands behind her there in the corner he is talking to the wonderful cléo whom all the world knows monsieur guyer there he is manager i believe of the alhambra and talking to him is marborg the great pianist the two ladies talking to my brother are esther hammerton whom of course you know by sight she is leading lady is she not at the hilarity theatre the other one is miss ransome they tell me that she is your only really great english actress  peter nodded appreciatively  it is all most interesting he declared now tell me please who is the military person with the stiff figure and sallow complexion standing by the door he seems quite alone  the girl made a little grimace  i suppose i ought to be looking after him she admitted rising reluctantly to her feet he is a soldier just back from indiaa general noseworthy with all sorts of letters after his name if mademoiselle celaire is generous perhaps we may have a few minutes conversation later on she added with a parting smile  say rather if mademoiselle korust is kind de grost replied bowing it depends upon that only  he strolled across the room and rejoined mademoiselle celaire a few moments later they stood apart in a corner  i should like my supper peter declared  they wait for one more guest mademoiselle celaire announced  one more guest do you know who it is  no idea she answered one would imagine that it was someone of importance are you any wiser than when you came dear master she added under her breath  not a whit he replied promptly  she took out her fan and waved it slowly in front of her face  yet you must discover what it all means tonight or not at all she whispered the dear andrea has intimated to me most delicately that another escort would be more acceptable if i should honour him again  that helps he murmured see our last guest arrives ah  a tall sparelooking man was just being announced they heard his name as andrea presented him to a companion  colonel mayson  mademoiselle celaire saw a gleam in her companions eyes  it is comingthe idea she whispered  very vaguely he admitted  who is this colonel mayson  our only military aeronaut peter replied  she raised her eyebrows  aeronaut she repeated doubtfully i see nothing in that both my own country and germany are years ahead of poor england in the air is it not so  peter smiled and held out his arm  see he said supper has been announced afterwards andrea korust will play to us and i think that colonel mayson and his distinguished brother officer from india will talk we shall see  they passed into a room whose existence had suddenly been revealed by the drawing back of some beautiful brocaded curtains supper was a delightful meal charmingly served peter putting everything else out of his head for the moment thoroughly enjoyed himself and remembering his duty as a guest contributed in no small degree towards the success of the entertainment he sat between mademoiselle celaire and his hostess both of whom demanded much from him in the way of attention but he still found time to tell stories which were listened to by everyone and exchanged sallies with the gayest only andrea korust from his place at the head of the table glanced occasionally towards his popular guest with a curious halfhidden expression of distaste and suspicion the more the baron de grost shone the more uneasy andrea became the signal to rise from the meal was given almost abruptly mademoiselle korust hung on to peters arm her own wishes and her brothers orders seemed to absolutely coincide she led him towards a retired corner of the musicroom on the way however peter overheard the introduction which he had expected  general noseworthy is just returned from india colonel mayson korust said in his usual quiet tired tone you will perhaps find it interesting to talk together a little as for me i play because all are polite enough to wish it but conversation disturbs me not in the least  peter passed smiling on to the corner pointed out by his companion which was the darkest and most secluded in the room he took her fan and gloves lit her cigarette and leaned back by her side  how does your brother a stranger to london find time to make the acquaintance of so many interesting people he asked  he brought many letters she replied he has friends everywhere  i have an idea peter remarked that an acquaintance of my own the count von hern spoke to me once about him  she took her cigarette from her lips and turned her head slightly peters expression was one of amiable reminiscence his cheeks were a trifle flushed his appearance was entirely reassuring she laughed at her brothers caution she found her companion delightful  yes the count von hern is a friend of my brothers she admitted carelessly  and of yours he whispered his arm slightly pressed against hers  she laughed at him silently and their eyes met decidedly peter baron de grost found it hard to break away from his old weakness andrea korust from his place near the piano breathed a sigh of relief as he watched a moment or two later however mademoiselle korust was obliged to leave her companion to receive a late but unimportant guest and almost simultaneously colonel mayson passed by on his way to the farther end of the apartment andrea korust was bending over the piano to give some instructions to his accompanist peter leaned forward and his face and tone were strangely altered  you will find general noseworthy of the indian army a little inquisitive colonel he remarked  the latter turned sharply round there was meaning in those few words without doubt there was meaning too in the still cold face which seemed to repel his question he passed on thoughtfully mademoiselle korust with a gesture of relief came back and threw herself once more upon the couch  we must talk in whispers she said gaily andrea always declares that he does not mind conversation but too much noise is of course impossible besides mademoiselle celaire will not spare you to me for long  there is a whole language he replied which was made for whisperers and as for mademoiselle celaire  well  he laughed softly  mademoiselle celaire is i think more your brothers friend than mine he murmured at least i will be generous he has given me a delightful evening i resign my claims upon mademoiselle celaire  it would break your heart she declared  his voice sank even below a whisper decidedly peter baron de grost did not improve  he rose to leave precisely at the right time neither too early nor too late he had spent altogether a most amusing evening there were one or two little comedies which had diverted him extremely at the moment of parting the beautiful eyes of mademoiselle korust had been raised to his very earnestly  you will come again very soontomorrow night she had whispered is it necessary that you bring mademoiselle celaire  it is altogether unnecessary peter replied  let me try and entertain you instead then  it was precisely at that instant that andrea had sent for his sister peter watched their brief conversation with much interest and intense amusement she was being told not to invite him there again and she was rebelling without a doubt he had made a conquest she returned to him flushed and with a dangerous glitter in her eyes  monsieur le baron she said leading him on one side i am ashamed and angry  your brother is annoyed because you have asked me here tomorrow night he asked quickly  it is so she confessed indeed i thank you that you have spared me the task of putting my brothers discourtesy into words andrea takes violent fancies like that sometimes i am ashamed but what can i do  nothing mademoiselle he admitted with a sigh i obey of course did your brother mention the source of his aversion to me  he is too absurd sometimes she declared one must treat him like a great baby  nevertheless there must be a reason peter persisted gently  he has heard some foolish thing from the count von hern she admitted reluctantly do not let us think anything more about it in a few days it will have passed and meanwhile  she paused he leaned a little towards her she was looking intently at a ring upon her finger  if you would really like to see me she whispered and if you are sure that mademoiselle celaire would not object could you not ask me to tea tomorrow or the next day  tomorrow peter insisted with a becoming show of eagerness shall we say at the carlton at five  she hesitated  isnt that rather a public place she objected  anywhere else you like  she was silent for a moment she seemed to be waiting for some suggestion from him none came  the carlton at five she murmured i am angry with andrea i feel even that i could break his wonderful violin in two  peter sighed once more  i should like to twist von herns neck he declared lucky for him that hes in st petersburg let us forget this unpleasant matter mademoiselle the evening has been too delightful for such memories  mademoiselle celaire turned to her escort as soon as they were alone in the car  as an escort let me tell you my dear baron she exclaimed with some pique that you are a miserable failure for the rest  for the rest i will admit that i am puzzled peter said i need to think i have the glimmerings of an ideano more  you will act it is an affair for usfor the double four  without a doubtan affair and a serious one peter assured her i shall act exactly how i cannot say until after tomorrow  tomorrow she repeated  mademoiselle korust takes tea with me he explained                                       in a quiet sort of way the series of supper parties given by andrea korust became the talk of london the most famous dancer in the world broke through her unvarying rule and night after night thrilled the distinguished little gathering an opera singer the star of the season sang a great genius recited and andrea himself gave always of his best apart from this wonderful outpouring of talent andrea korust himself seemed to possess the peculiar art of bringing into touch with one another people naturally interested in the same subjects on the night after the visit of peter baron de grost his grace the duke of rosshire was present the man in whose hands lay the destinies of the british navy and curiously enough on the same night a great french writer on naval subjects was present whom the duke had never met and with whom he was delighted to talk for some time apart on another occasion the military secretary to the french embassy was able to have a long and instructive chat with a distinguished english general on the subject of the recent manoeuvres and the latter received in the strictest confidence some very interesting information concerning the new type of french guns on the following evening the greatest of our colonial statesmen a redhot imperialist was able to chat about the resources of the empire with an english politician of similar views whom he chanced never to have previously met altogether these parties seemed to be the means of bringing together a series of most interesting people interesting not only in themselves but in their relations to one another it was noticeable however that from this side of his little gatherings andrea korust remained wholly apart he admitted that music and cheerful companionship were the only two things in life he really cared for politics or matters of world import seemed to leave him unmoved if a serious subject of conversation were started at suppertime he was frankly bored and took no pains to hide the fact it is certain that whatever interesting topics were alluded to in his presence he remained entirely outside any understanding of them mademoiselle celaire who was present most evenings although with other escorts was puzzled she could see nothing whatever to account for the warning which she had received and had at once passed on as was her duty to the baron de grost she failed also to understand the faint but perceptible enlightenment to which peter himself had admittedly attained after that first evening take that important conversation for instance between the french military attaché and the british general without a doubt it was of interest and especially so to the country which she was sure claimed his allegiance but it was equally without doubt that andrea korust neither overheard a word of that conversation nor betrayed the slightest curiosity concerning it mademoiselle celaire was a clever woman and she had never felt so hopelessly at fault illumination was to come howeverillumination dramatic and complete  the seventh and last of these famous supper parties was in full swing notwithstanding the shaded candles which left the faces of the guests a little indistinct the scene was a brilliant one mademoiselle celaire was wearing her famous diamonds which shone through the gloom like pinpricks of fire garda desmaines the wonderful garda sat next to her host her bosom and hair on fire with jewels yet with the most wonderful light of all glowing in her eyes a famous actor who had thrown his proverbial reticence to the winds kept his immediate neighbours in a state of semihysterical mirth the clink of wineglasses the laughter of beautiful women the murmur of cultivated voices rose and fell through the faint mysterious gloom it was a picturesque a wonderful scene enough pale as a marble statue with the covert smile of the gracious host andrea korust sat at the head of the table well pleased with his company as indeed he had the right to be by his side was a great american statesman who was travelling round the world and yet had refused all other invitations of this sort he had come for the pleasure of meeting the famous dutch writer and politician mr van jool the two were already talking intimately it was at this point that tragedy or something like it intervened a mans impatient voice was heard in the hall outside a mans voice which grew louder and louder more impatient finally more passionate people raised their heads to listen the american statesman who was perhaps the only one to realise exactly what was coming slipped his hand into his pocket and gripped something cold and hard then the door was flung open an apologetic and much disturbed butler made the announcement which had evidently been demanded of him  mr von tassen  a silence followedbreathlessthe silence before the bursting of the storm mr von tassen was the name of the american statesman and the man who rose slowly from his place by his hosts side was the exact double of the man who stood now upon the threshold gazing in upon the room the expression of the two alone was different the newcomer was furiously angry and looked it the sham mr von tassen was very much at his ease it was he who broke the silence and his voice was curiously free from all trace of emotion he was looking his double over with an air of professional interest  on the whole he said calmly very good a little stouter i perceive and the eyebrows a trifle too regular of course when you make faces at me like that it is hard to judge of the expression i can only say that i did the best i could  who the devil are you masquerading in my name the newcomer demanded with emphasis this man is an impostor he added turning to andrea korust what is he doing at your table  andrea leaned forward and his face was an evil thing to look upon  who are you he hissed out  the sham mr von tassen turned away for a moment and stooped down the trick has been done often enough upon the stage often in less time but seldom with more effect the wonderful wig disappeared the spectacles the lines in the face the makeup of diabolical cleverness with his back to the wall and his fingers playing with something in his pocket peter baron de grost smiled upon his host  since you insist upon knowingthe baron de grost at your service he announced  andrea korust was for the moment speechless one of the women shrieked the real mr von tassen looked around him helplessly  will someone be good enough to enlighten me as to the meaning of this he begged is it a roast if so i only want to catch on let me get to the joke if there is one if not i should like a few words of explanation from you sir he added addressing peter  presently the latter replied in the meantime let me persuade you that i am not the only impostor here  he seized a glass of water and dashed it in the face of mr van jool there was a moments scuffle and no more of mr van jool what emerged was a good deal like the shy maurice korust who accompanied his brother at the musichall but whose distaste for these gatherings had been andreas continual lament the baron de grost stepped back once more against the wall his host was certainly looking dangerous mademoiselle celaire was leaning forward staring through the gloom with distended eyes around the table every head was craned towards the centre of the disturbance it was peter again who spoke  let me suggest andrea korust he said that you send your gueststhose who are not immediately interested in this affairinto the next room i will offer mr von tassen then the explanation to which he is entitled  andrea korust staggered to his feet the mans nerve had failed he was shaking all over he pointed to the musicroom  if you would be so good ladies and gentlemen he begged we will follow you immediately  they went with obvious reluctance all their eyes seemed focused upon peter he bore their scrutiny with calm cheerfulness for a moment he had feared korust but that moment had passed a servant obeying his masters gesture pulled back the curtains after the departing crowd the four men were alone  mr von tassen peter said easily you are a man who loves adventures tonight you experience a new sort of one over in your great country such methods as these are laughed at as the cheap device of sensationmongers nevertheless they exist tonight is a proof that they exist  get on to facts sir the american admonished before you leave this room youve got to explain to me what you mean by passing yourself off as thomas von tassen  peter bowed  with much pleasure mr von tassen he declared for your information i might tell you that you are not the only person in whose guise i have figured in fact i have had quite a busy week i have beenlet me seei have been monsieur le marquis de beau kunel on the night when our shy friend maurice korust was playing the part of general henderson i have also been his grace the duke of rosshire when my friend maurice here was introduced to me as françois defayal known by name to me as one of the greatest writers on naval matters a little awkward about the figure i found his grace but otherwise i think that i should have passed muster wherever he was known i have also passed as sir william laureston on the evening when my rival artiste here sang the praises of imperial england  andrea korust leaned forward with venomous eyes  you mean that it was you who was here last night in sir william laurestons place he almost shrieked  most certainly peter admitted but you must remember that after all my performances have been no more difficult than those of your shy but accomplished brother whenever i took to myself a strange personality i found him there equally good as to detail and with his subject always at his fingertips we settled that little matter of the canal didnt we peter remarked cheerfully laying his hand upon the shoulder of the young man  they stared at him these two whitefaced brothers like tigercats about to spring mr von tassen was getting impatient  look here he protested you may be clearing matters up so far as regards mr andrea korust and his brother but im as much in the fog as ever where do i come in  your pardon sir peter replied i am getting nearer things now these two young menwe will not call them hard namesare suffering from an excess of patriotic zeal they didnt come and sit down on a campstool and sketch obsolete forts as those others of their countrymen do when they want to pose as the bland and really exceedingly ignorant foreigners they went about the matter with some skill it occurred to them that it might be interesting to their country to know what sir william laureston thought about the strength of the imperial navy and to what extent his country were willing to go in maintaining their allegiance to great britain then there was the duke of rosshire they thought theyd like to know his views as to the development of the navy during the next ten years there was that little matter too of the french guns it would certainly be interesting to them to know what monsieur le marquis de beau kunel had to say about them these people were all invited to sit at the hospitable board of our host here i however had an inkling on the first night of what was going on and i was easily able to persuade those in authority to let me play their several parts you sir peter added turning to mr von tassen you sir floored me you were not an englishman and there was no appeal which i could make i simply had to risk you i counted upon your not turning up unfortunately you did fortunately you are the last guest this is the seventh supper  mr von tassen glanced around at the three men and made up his mind  what do you call yourself he asked peter  the baron de grost peter replied  then my friend the baron de grost von tassen said i think that you and i had better get out of this so i was to talk about germany with mr van jool eh  i have already explained your views peter declared with twinkling eyes mr van jool was delighted  mr von tassen shook with laughter  say he exclaimed this is a great story if youre ready baron de grost lead the way to where we can get a whisky and soda and a chat  mademoiselle celaire came gliding out to them  i am not going to be left here she whispered taking peters arm  peter looked back from the door  at any rate mr andrea korust he said your first supper was a success colonel mayson was genuine our real english military aeronaut was here and he has disclosed to you maurice korust all that he ever knew henceforth i presume your great country will dispute with us for the mastery of the air  queer country this mr von tassen remarked pausing on the step to light a cigar seems kind of humdrum after new york but theres no use talkingthings do happen over here anyway     chapter vi  the mission of major kosuth   his host very fussy as he always was on the morning of his big shoot came bustling towards de grost with a piece of paper in his hand the party of men had just descended from a large brake and were standing about on the edge of the common examining cartridges smoking a last cigarette before the business of the morning and chatting together over the prospects of the days sport in the distance a cloud of dust indicated the approach of a fasttravelling motorcar  my dear baron sir william bounderby said i want you to change your stand today i must have a good man at the far corner as the birds go off my land from there and addington was missing them shockingly yesterday besides there is a new man coming on your left and i know nothing of his shootingnothing at all  peter smiled  anywhere you choose to put me sir william he assented they came badly for addington yesterday and well for me however ill do my best  i wish people wouldnt bring strangers especially to the one shoot where im keen about the bag i told portal he could bring his brotherinlaw and hes bringing this foreign fellow instead dont suppose he can shoot for nuts did you ever hear of him i wonder the count von hern he calls himself  peter was not on his guard and a little exclamation escaped him  bernadine he murmured softly so the game begins once more  his interest was unmistakable it was not only the chill november air which had brought a touch of colour to his cheeks and the light to his eyes  you seem pleased sir william bounderby remarked curiously you do know the fellow then friend of yours perhaps  peter shook his head  oh yes i know him sir william he replied but i do not think that he would call himself a friend of mine i know nothing about his shooting except that if he got a chance i think that he would like to shoot me  sir william who was a very literal man looked grave  i am sorry he said if you are likely to find this meeting in any way awkward i suppose theres nothing against him eh he added a little nervously i invited him purely on the strength of his being a guest of portals  the count von hern comes i believe peter assured his host of a distinguished european family socially there is nothing whatever against him we happen to have run up against each other once or twice thats all that sort of thing will occur you know when the interests of finance touch the borderline of politics  you have no objection to meeting him then sir william asked  not the slightest peter replied i do not know exactly in what direction the count von hern is extending his activities at present but you will probably find any feeling of annoyance as regards our meeting today is entirely on his side  i am very glad to hear it sir william declared i should not like anything to happen to disturb the harmony of your short visit to us  the motorcar had come to a standstill by this time from it descended mr portal himself a large neighbouring landowner a man of culture and travel with him was bernadine in a very correct shooting suit and tyrolese hat on the other side of mr portal was a short thickset man with olive complexion keen black eyes black moustache and imperial and sombrely dressed in city clothes sir williams eyebrows were slightly raised as he advanced to greet the party peter was at once profoundly interested  mr portal introduced his guests  you will forgive me i am sure for bringing a spectator bounderby he said major kosuth whom i have the honour to presentmajor kosuth sir william bounderbyis high up in the diplomatic service of a people with whom we must feel every sympathythe young turks the count von hern who takes my brotherinlaws place is probably known to you by name  sir william welcomed his visitors cordially  you do not shoot major kosuth he asked  very seldom the turk answered i come today with my good friend count von hern as a spectator if you permit  delighted sir william replied we will find you a safe place near your friend  the little party began to move toward the wood it was just at this moment that bernadine felt a touch upon his shoulder and turning round found peter by his side  an unexpected pleasure my dear count the latter declared suavely i had no idea that you took an interest in such simple sports  the manners of the count von hern were universally quoted as being almost too perfect it is a regrettable fact however that at that moment he sworesoftly perhaps but with distinct vehemence a moment later he was exchanging the most cordial of greetings with his old friend  you have the knack my dear de grost he remarked of turning up in the most surprising places i certainly did not know that amongst your many accomplishments was included a love for field sports  peter smiled quietly he was a very fine shot and knew it  one must amuse oneself these days he said there is little else to do  bernadine bit his lip  my absence from this country i fear has robbed you of an occupation  it has certainly deprived life of some of its savour peter admitted blandly by the by will you not present me to your friend i have the utmost sympathy with the intrepid political party of which he is a member  the count von hern performed the introduction with a reluctance which he wholly failed to conceal the turk however had been walking on his other side and his hat was already lifted peter had purposely raised his voice  it gives me the greatest pleasure major kosuth peter said to welcome you to this country in common i believe with the majority of my countrymen i have the utmost respect and admiration for the movement which you represent  major kosuth smiled slowly his features were heavy and unexpressive there was something of gloom however in the manner of his response  you are very kind baron he replied and i welcome very much this expression of your interest in my party i believe that the hearts of your country people are turned towards us in the same manner i could wish that your countrys political sympathies were as easily aroused  bernadine intervened promptly  major kosuth has been here only one day he remarked lightly i tell him that he is a little too impatient see we are approaching the wood it is as well here to refrain from conversation  we will resume it later peter said softly i have interests in turkey and it would give me great pleasure to have a talk with major kosuth  financial interests the latter inquired with some eagerness  peter nodded  i will explain after the first drive he said turning away  peter walked rather quickly until he reached a bend in the wood he overtook his host on the way and paused for a moment  lend me a loader for half an hour sir william he begged i have to send my servant to the village with a telegram  with pleasure sir william answered there are several to spare ill send one to your stand theres von hern going the wrong way he exclaimed in a tone of annoyance  peter was just in time to stop the whistle from going to his mouth  do me another favour sir william he pleaded give me time to send off my telegram before the count sees what im doing hes such an inquisitive person he went on noticing his hosts look of blank surprise thank you ever so much  peter hurried on to his place it was round the corner of the wood and for the moment out of sight of the rest of the party he tore a sheet from his pocketbook and scribbled out a telegram his man had disappeared and a substitute taken his place by the time the count von hern arrived the latter was now all amiability it was hard to believe from his smiling salutation that he and the man to whom he waved his hand in so airy a fashion had ever declared war to the death  the shooting began a few minutes later major kosuth from a camp stool a few yards behind his friend watched with somewhat languid interest he gave one indeed the impression that his thoughts were far removed from this simple country party the main object of whose existence for the present seemed to be the slaying of a certain number of inoffensive birds he watched the indifferent performance of his friend and the remarkably fine shooting of his neighbour on the left with the same lacklustre eye and want of enthusiasm the beat was scarcely over before peter resigning his smoking guns to his loader lit a cigarette and strolled across to the next stand he plunged at once into a conversation with kosuth notwithstanding bernadines illconcealed annoyance  major kosuth he began i sympathise with you it is a hard task for a man whose mind is centred upon great events to sit still and watch a performance of this sort be kind to us all and remember that this represents to us merely a few hours of relaxation we too have our more serious moments  you read my thoughts well major kosuth declared i do not seek to excuse them for half a lifetime we turks have toiled and striven always in danger of our lives to help forward those things which have now come to pass i think that our lives have become tinged with sombreness and apprehension now that the first step is achieved we go forward still with trepidation we need friends baron de grost  you cannot seriously doubt but that you will find them in this country peter remarked there has never been a time when the english nation has not sympathised with the cause of liberty  it is not the hearts of your people major kosuth said which i fear it is the antics of your politicians sympathy is a great thing and good to have but turkey today needs more the heart of a nation is big but the number of those in whose hands it remains to give practical expression to its promptings is few  bernadine who had stood as much as he could seized forcibly upon his friend  you must remember our bargain kosuth he insistedno politics today until tomorrow evening we rest now i want to introduce you to a very old friend of mine the lordlieutenant of the county  the turk was bustled off a little unwillingly peter watched them with a smile it was many months since he had felt so keen an interest in life the coming of bernadine had steadied his nerves his gun had come to his shoulder like the pistonrod of an engine his eye was clear his nerve still there was something to be done decidedly there was something to be done  no man was better informed in current political affairs but peter instead of joining the cheerful afternoon tea party at the close of the day raked out a file of the times from the library and studied it carefully in his room there were one or two items of news concerning which he made pencil notes he had scarcely finished his task before a servant brought in a dispatch he opened it with interest and drew pencil and paper towards him it was from paris and in the code which he had learnt by heart no written key of which now existed carefully he transcribed it on to paper and read it through it was dated from paris a few hours back  kosuth left for england yesterday envoy from new turkish government requiring loan one million pounds asked for guarantee that it was not for warlike movement against bulgaria declined to give same communicated with english ambassador and informed kosuth yesterday that neither government would sanction loan unless undertaking were given that the same was not to be applied for war against bulgaria turkey is under covenant to enter into no financial obligations with any other power while the interest of former loans remains in abeyance kosuth has made two efforts to obtain loan privately from prominent english financier and french syndicate both have declined to treat on representations from government kosuth was expected return direct to turkey if as you say he is in england with bernadine we commend the affair to your utmost vigilance germany exceedingly anxious enter into close relations with new government of turkey fear kosuths association with bernadine proof of bad faith have had interview with minister for foreign affairs who relies upon our help french secret service at your disposal if necessary  peter read the message three times with the greatest care he was on the point of destroying it when violet came into the room she was wearing a long tea jacket of sheeny silk her beautiful hair was most becomingly arranged her figure as light and girlish as ever she came into the room humming gaily and swinging a gold purse upon her finger  won three rubbers out of four peter she declared and a compliment from the duchess arent i a pupil to be proud of  she stopped short her lips formed themselves into the shape of a whistle she knew very well the signs her husbands eyes were kindling there was a firm set about his lips the palm of his hand lay flat upon that sheet of paper  it was true she murmured it was bernadine who was shooting today  peter nodded  he was on the next stand he replied  then there is something doing of course violet continued my dear peter you may be an enigma to other people to me you have the most expressive countenance i ever saw you have had a cable which you have just transcribed if i had been a few minutes later i think you would have torn up the result as it is i think i have come just in time to hear all about it  peter smiled grimly but fondly he uncovered the sheet of paper and placed it in her hands  so far he said there isnt much to tell you the count von hern turned up this morning with a major kosuth who was one of the leaders of the revolution in turkey i wired paris and this is the reply  she read the message through thoughtfully and handed it back peter lit a match and standing over the fireplace calmly destroyed it  a million pounds is not a great sum of money violet remarked why could not kosuth borrow it for his country from a private individual  a million pounds is not a large sum to talk about peter replied but it is an exceedingly large sum for anyone even a multimillionaire to handle in cash and turkey i gather wants it at once besides considerations which might be of value from a government are no security at all as applied to a private individual  she nodded  do you think that kosuth means to go behind the existing treaty and borrow from germany  peter shook his head  i cant quite believe that he said it would mean the straining of diplomatic relations with both countries it is out of the question  then where does bernadine come in  i do not know peter answered  violet laughed  what is it that you are going to try to find out she asked  i am trying to discover who it is that bernadine and kosuth are waiting to see peter replied the worst of it is i darent leave here i shall have to trust to the others  she glanced at the clock  well go and dress she said im afraid ive a little of your blood in me after all life seems more stirring when bernadine is on the scene                                       the shooting party broke up two days later and peter and his wife returned at once to town the former found the reports which were awaiting his arrival disappointing bernadine and his guest were not in london or if they were they had carefully avoided all the usual haunts peter read his reports over again smoked a very long cigar alone in his study and finally drove down to the city and called upon his stockbroker who was also a personal friend things were flat in the city and the latter was glad enough to welcome an important client he began talking the usual market shop until his visitor stopped him  i have come to you edwardes more for information than anything peter declared although it may mean that i shall need to sell a lot of stock can you tell me of any private financier who could raise a loan of a million pounds in cash within the course of a week  the stockbroker looked dubious  in cash he repeated money isnt raised that way you know i doubt whether there are many men in the whole city of london who could put up such an amount with only a weeks notice  but there must be someone peter persisted think it would probably be a firm or a man not obtrusively english i dont think the jews would touch it and a german citizen would be impossible  semipolitical eh  peter nodded  it is rather that way he admitted  would your friend the count von hern be likely to be concerned in it  why peter asked with immovable face  nothing only i saw him coming out of heseltinewrigges office the other day the stockbroker remarked carelessly  and who is mr heseltinewrigge  a very wealthy american financier the stockbroker replied not at all an unlikely person for a loan of the sort you mention  american citizen peter inquired  without a doubt of german descent i should say but nothing much left of it in his appearance he settled over here in a huff because new york society wouldnt receive his wife  i remember all about it peter declared she was a chorus girl wasnt she nothing particular against her but the fellow had no tact do you know him edwardes  slightly the stockbroker answered  give me a letter to him peter said give my credit as good a leg up as you can i shall probably go as a borrower  mr edwardes wrote a few lines and handed them to his client  office is nearly opposite he remarked wish you luck whatever your scheme is  peter crossed the street and entered the building which his friend had pointed out he ascended in the lift to the third floor knocked at the door which bore mr heseltinewrigges name and almost ran into the arms of a charmingly dressed little lady who was being shown out by a broadshouldered typical american peter hastened to apologise  i beg your pardon he said raising his hat i was rather in a hurry and i quite thought i heard someone say come in  the lady replied pleasantly her companion who was carrying his hat in his hand paused reluctantly  did you want to see me he asked  if you are mr heseltinewrigge i did peter admitted my name is the baron de grost and i have a letter of introduction to you from mr edwardes  mr heseltinewrigge tore open the envelope and glanced through the contents of the note peter meanwhile looked at his wife with genuine but respectfully cloaked admiration the lady obviously returned his interest  why if youre the baron de grost she exclaimed didnt you marry vi brown she used to be at the gaiety with me years ago  i certainly did marry violet brown peter confessed and if you will allow me to say so mrs heseltinewrigge i should have recognised you anywhere from your photographs  say isnt that queer the little lady remarked turning to her husband i should love to see vi again  if you will give me your address peter declared promptly my wife will be delighted to call upon you  the man looked up from the note  do you want to talk business with me baron he asked  for a few moments only peter answered i am afraid i am a great nuisance and if you wish it i will come down to the city again  thats all right mr heseltinewrigge replied myra wont mind waiting a minute or two come through here  he turned back and led the way into a quietlooking suite of offices where one or two clerks were engaged writing at open desks they all three passed into an inner room  any objection to my wife coming in mr heseltinewrigge asked theres scarcely any place for her out there  delighted peter answered  she glanced at the clock  remember we have to meet the count von hern at halfpast one at princes charles she reminded him  her husband nodded there was nothing in peters expression to denote that he had already achieved the first object of his visit  i shall not detain you he said your name has been mentioned to me mr heseltinewrigge as a financier likely to have a large sum of money at his disposal i have a scheme which needs money providing the security is unexceptionable are you in a position to do a deal  how much do you want mr heseltinewrigge asked  a million to a million and a half peter answered  dollars  pounds  it was not mr heseltinewrigges pose to appear surprised nevertheless his eyebrows were slightly raised  say what is this scheme he inquired  first of all peter replied i should like to know whether theres any chance of business if i disclose it  not an atom mr heseltinewrigge declared i have just committed myself to the biggest financial transaction of my life and it will clean me out  then i wont waste your time peter announced rising  sit down for a moment mr heseltinewrigge invited biting the end off a cigar and passing the box towards peter thats all right my wife doesnt mind say it strikes me as rather a curious thing that you should come in here and talk about a million and a half when thats just the amount concerned in my other little deal  peter smiled  as a matter of fact it isnt at all queer he answered i dont want the money i came to see whether you were really interested in the other affairthe turkish loan you know  mr heseltinewrigge withdrew his cigar from his mouth and looked steadily at his visitor  say baron he declared youve got a nerve  not at all peter replied im here as much in your interests as my own  whom do you represent any way mr heseltinewrigge inquired  a company you never heard of peter replied our offices are in the underground places of the world and we dont run to brass plates i am here because i am curious about that loan turkey hasnt a shadow of security to offer you everything which she can pledge is pledged to guarantee the interest on existing loans to france and england she is prevented by treaty from borrowing in germany if you make a loan without security mr heseltinewrigge i suppose you understand your position the loan may be repudiated at any moment  kind of a philanthropist arent you mr heseltinewrigge remarked quietly  not in the least peter assured him i know theres some tricky work going on and i suppose i havent brains enough to get to the bottom of it thats why ive come blundering in to you and why i suppose youll be telling the whole story to the count von hern at luncheon in an hours time  mr heseltinewrigge smoked in silence for a moment or two  this transaction of mine he said at last isnt one i can talk about i guess im on to what you want to know but i simply cant tell you the security is unusual but its good enough for me  it seems so to you beyond a doubt peter replied still you have to do with a remarkably clever young man in the count von hern i dont want to ask you any questions you feel i ought not to but i do wish youd tell me one thing  go right ahead mr heseltinewrigge invited dont be shy  what day are you concluding this affair  mr heseltinewrigge scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully and glanced at his diary  well ill risk that he decided a week today i hand over the coin  peter drew a little breath of relief a week was an immense time he rose to his feet  that ends our business then for the present he said now i am going to ask both of you a favour perhaps i have no right to but as a man of honour mr heseltinewrigge you can take it from me that i ask it in your interests as well as my own dont tell the count von hern of my visit to you  mr heseltinewrigge held out his hand  thats all right he declared you hear myra  ill be dumb baron she promised say when do you think vi can come and see me  peter was guilty of snobbery he considered it quite a justifiable weapon  she is at windsor this afternoon he remarked  what at the garden party mrs heseltinewrigge almost shrieked  peter nodded  i believe theres some fête or other tomorrow he said but were alone this evening why wont you dine with us say at the carlton  wed love to the lady assented promptly  at eight oclock peter said taking his leave  the dinnerparty was a great success mrs heseltinewrigge found herself amongst the class of people with whom it was her earnest desire to become acquainted and her husband was well satisfied to see her keen longing for society likely to be gratified the subject of peters call at the office in the city was studiously ignored it was not until the very end of the evening indeed that the host of this very agreeable party was rewarded by a single hint it all came about in the most natural manner they were speaking of foreign capitals  i love paris mrs heseltinewrigge told her host just adore it charles is often there on business and i always go along  peter smiled there was just a chance here  your husband does not often have to leave london he remarked carelessly  she nodded  not often enough she declared i just love getting about last week we had a perfectly horrible trip though we started off for belfast quite unexpectedly and i hated every minute of it  peter smiled inwardly but he said never a word his companion was already chattering on about something else peter crossed the hall a few minutes later to speak to an acquaintance slipped out to the telephone booth and spoke to his servant  a bag and a change he ordered at euston station at twelve oclock in time for the irish mail your mistress will be home as usual  an hour later the dinnerparty broke up early the next morning peter crossed the irish channel he returned the following day and crossed again within a few hours in five days the affair was finished except for the dénouement  peter ascended in the lift to mr heseltinewrigges office the following thursday calm and unruffled as usual but nevertheless a little exultant it was barely half an hour ago since he had become finally prepared for this interview he was looking forward to it now with feelings of undiluted satisfaction mr heseltinewrigge was in he was told and he was at once admitted to his presence the financier greeted him with a somewhat curious smile  say this is very nice of you to look me up again he exclaimed still worrying about that loan eh  peter shook his head  no im not worrying about that any more he answered accepting one of his hosts cigars the fact of it is that if it were not for me you would be the one who would have to do the worrying  mr heseltinewrigge stopped short in the act of lighting his cigar  im not quite catching on he remarked whats the trouble  there is no trouble fortunately peter replied only a little disappointment for our friends the count von hern and major kosuth i have brought you some information which i think will put an end to that affair of the loan  mr heseltinewrigge sat quite still for a moment his brows were knitted he showed no signs of nervousness  go right on he said  the security upon which you were going to advance a million and a half to the turkish government peter continued consisted of two dreadnoughts and a cruiser being built to the order of that country by messrs shepherd and hargreaves at belfast  quite right mr heseltinewrigge admitted quietly i have been up and seen the boats i have seen the shipbuilders too  did you happen to mention to the latter peter inquired that you were advancing money upon those vessels  certainly not mr heseltinewrigge replied kosuth wouldnt hear of such a thing if the papers got wind of it thered be the devil to pay all the same i have got an assignment from the turkish government  not worth the paper its written on peter declared blandly  mr heseltinewrigge rose unsteadily to his feet he was a strong silent man but there was a queer look about his mouth  what the devil do you mean he demanded  briefly this peter explained the first payment when these ships were laid down was made not by turkey but by an emissary of the german government who arranged the whole affair in constantinople the second payment was due ten months ago and not a penny has been paid notice was given to the late government twice and absolutely ignored according to the charter therefore these ships reverted to the shipbuilding company who retained possession of the first payment as indemnity against loss the count von herns position was this he represents the german government you were to find a million and a half of money with the ships as security you also have a contract from the count von hern to take those ships off your hands provided the interest on the loan became overdue a state of affairs which i can assure you would have happened within the next twelve months practically therefore you were made use of as an independent financier to provide the money with which the turkish government broadly speaking have sold the ships to germany you see according to the charter of the shipbuilding company these vessels cannot be sold to any foreign government without the consent of downing street that is the reason why the affair had to be conducted in such a roundabout manner  all this is beyond me mr heseltinewrigge said hoarsely i dont care a dn who has the ships in the end so long as i get my money  but you would not get your money peter pointed out because there will be no ships i have had the shrewdest lawyers in the world at work upon the charter and there is not the slightest doubt that these vessels are or rather were the entire property of messrs shepherd and hargreaves today they belong to me i have bought them and paid £200000 deposit i can show you the receipt and all the papers  mr heseltinewrigge said only one word but that word was profane  i am sorry of course that you have lost the business peter concluded but surely its better than losing your money  mr heseltinewrigge struck the table fiercely with his fist there was a grey and unfamiliar look about his face  dn it the moneys gone he declared hoarsely they changed the day kosuth had to go back i paid it twentyfour hours ago  peter whistled softly  if only you had trusted me a little more he murmured i tried to warn you  mr heseltinewrigge snatched up his hat  they dont leave till the twotwenty he shouted well catch them at the milan if we dont im ruined by heaven im ruined  they found major kosuth in the hall of the hotel he was wearing a fur coat and otherwise attired for travelling his luggage was already being piled upon a cab mr heseltinewrigge wasted no words upon him  you and i have got to have a talk right here and now he declared wheres the count  major kosuth frowned gloomily  i do not understand you he said shortly our business is concluded and i am leaving by the twotwenty train  you are doing nothing of the sort the american answered standing before him grim and threatening  the turk showed no sign of terror he gripped his silverheaded cane firmly  i think he said that there is no one here who will prevent me  peter who saw a fracas imminent hastily intervened  if you will permit me for a moment he said there is a little explanation i should perhaps make to major kosuth  the turk took a step towards the door  i have no time to listen to explanations from you or anyone he replied my cab is waiting i depart if mr heseltinewrigge is not satisfied with our transaction i am sorry but it is too late to alter anything  for a moment it seemed as though a struggle between the two men was inevitable already people were glancing at them curiously for mr heseltinewrigge came of a primitive school and he had no intention whatever of letting his man escape fortunately at that moment the count von hern came up and peter at once appealed to him  count he said may i beg for your good offices my friend mr heseltinewrigge here is determined to have a few words with major kosuth before he leaves surely this is not an unreasonable request when you consider the magnitude of the transaction which has taken place between them let me beg of you to persuade major kosuth to give us ten minutes there is plenty of time for the train and this is not the place for a brawl  bernadine smiled he was not conscious of the slightest feeling of uneasiness he could conceive many reasons for peters intervention but in his pocket lay the agreement signed by kosuth an accredited envoy of the turkish government besides which he had a further document signed by mr heseltinewrigge witnessed and stamped handing over to him the whole of the security for this very complicated loan on the sole condition that the million and a half with interest was forthcoming his position was completely secure a little discussion with his old enemy might not be altogether unpleasant  it will not take us long kosuth to hear what our friend has to say he remarked we shall be quite quiet in the smokingroom let us go in there and dispose of the affair  the turk turned unwillingly in the direction indicated all four men passed through the café up some stairs and into the small smokingroom the room was deserted peter led the way to the far corner and standing with his elbow leaning upon the mantelpiece addressed them  the position is this he said mr heseltinewrigge has parted with a million and a half of his own money a loan to the turkish government on security which is not worth a snap of the fingers  it is a lie major kosuth exclaimed  my dear baron you are woefully misinformed the count declared  peter shook his head slowly  no he said i am not misinformed my friend here has parted with the money on the security of two battleships and a cruiser now building in shepherd and hargreaves yard at belfast the two battleships and cruiser in question belong to me i have paid two hundred thousand pounds on account of them and hold the shipbuilders receipt  you are mad bernadine cried contemptuously  peter shook his head and continued  the battleships were laid down for the turkish government and the money with which to start them was supplied by the secret service of germany the second instalment was due ten months ago and has not been paid the time of grace provided for has expired the shipbuilders in accordance with their charter were consequently at liberty to dispose of the vessels as they thought fit on the statement of the whole of the facts to the head of the firm he has parted with these ships to me i need not say that i have a purchaser within a mile from here it is a fancy of mine count von hern that those ships will sail better under the british flag  there was a moments tense silence the face of the turk was black with anger bernadine was trembling with rage  this is a tissue of lies he exclaimed  peter shrugged his shoulders  the facts are easy enough for you to prove he said and i have here he added producing a roll of papers copies of the various documents for your inspection your scheme of course was simple enough it fell through for this one reason only a final notice pressing for the second instalment and stating the days of grace was forwarded to constantinople about the time of the recent political troubles the late government ignored it in fairness to major kosuth we will believe that the present government was ignorant of it but the fact remains that messrs shepherd and hargreaves became at liberty to sell those vessels and that i have bought them you will have to give up that money major kosuth  you bet he shall the american muttered  bernadine leaned a little towards his enemy  you must give us a minute or two he insisted we shall not go away i promise you within five minutes you shall hear our decision  peter sat down at the writingtable and commenced a letter mr heseltinewrigge mounted guard over the door and stood there a grim figure of impatience before the five minutes was up bernadine crossed the room  i congratulate you baron he said dryly you are either an exceedingly lucky person or you are more of a genius than i believed kosuth is even now returning his letters of credit to your friend you are quite right the loan cannot stand  i was sure peter answered that you would see the matter correctly  you and i bernadine continued know very well that i dont care a fig about turkey new or old the ships i will admit i intended to have for my own country as it is i wish you joy of them before they are completed we may be fighting in the air  peter smiled and side by side with bernadine strolled across to heseltinewrigge who was buttoning up a pocketbook with trembling fingers  personally peter said i believe that the days of wars are over  that may or may not be bernadine answered one thing is very certain even if the nations remain at peace there are enmities which strike only deeper as the years pass i am going to take a drink now with my disappointed friend kosuth if i raise my glass to the day you will understand  peter smiled  my friend mr heseltinewrigge and i are for the same destination he replied pushing open the swing door which led to the bar i return your good wishes count i too drink to the day  bernadine and kosuth left a few minutes afterwards mr heseltinewrigge who was feeling himself again watched them depart with illconcealed triumph  say you had those fellows on toast baron he declared admiringly i couldnt follow the whole affair but i can see that youre in for big things sometimes remember this if money counts at any time im with you  peter clasped his hand  money always counts he saidand friends     chapter vii  the ghosts of havana harbour   we may now sogrange remarked buttoning up his ulster and stretching himself out to the full extent of his steamer chair consider ourselves at sea i trust my friend that you are feeling quite comfortable  peter baron de grost lying at his ease upon a neighbouring chair with a pillow behind his head a huge fur coat around his body and a rug over his feet had all the appearance of being very comfortable indeed his reply however was a little shortalmost peevish  i am comfortable enough for the present thank you heaven knows how long it will last  sogrange waved his arm towards the great uneasy plain of blue sea the showers of foam leaping into the sunlight away beyond the disappearing coasts of france  last he repeated for eight days i hope consider my dear baron what could be more refreshing more stimulating to our jaded nerves than this think of the december fogs you have left behind the cold driving rain the puddles in the street the grey skieslondon in short at her ugliest and worst  that is all very well peter protested but i have left several other things behind too  as for instance sogrange inquired genially  my wife peter informed him violet objects very much to these abrupt separations this week too i was shooting at saxthorpe and i had also several other engagements of a pleasant nature besides i have reached that age when i find it disconcerting to be called out of bed in the middle of the night to answer a longdistance telephone call and told to embark on an american liner leaving southampton early the next morning it may be your idea of a pleasuretrip it isnt mine  sogrange was amused his smile however was hidden only the tip of his cigarette was visible  anything else  nothing much except that i am always seasick peter replied deliberately i can feel it coming on now i wish that fellow would keep away with his beastly mutton broth the whole ship seems to smell of it  sogrange laughed softly but without disguise  who said anything about a pleasuretrip he demanded  peter turned his head  you did you told me when you came on at cherbourg that you had to go to new york to look after some property there that things were very quiet in london and that you hated travelling alone therefore you sent for me at a few hours notice  is that what i told you sogrange murmured  yes wasnt it true peter asked suddenly alert  not a word of it sogrange admitted it is quite amazing that you should have believed it for a moment  i was a fool peter confessed you see i was tired and a little cross besides somehow or other i never associated a trip to america with  sogrange interrupted him quietly but ruthlessly  lift up the label attached to the chair next to yours read it out to me  peter took it into his hand and turned it over a quick exclamation escaped him  great heavens the count von hernbernadine  just so sogrange assented nice clear writing isnt it  peter sat bolt upright in his chair  do you mean to say that bernadine is on board  sogrange shook his head  by the exercise my dear baron he said of a superlative amount of ingenuity i was able to prevent that misfortune now lean over and read the label on the next chair  peter obeyed his manner had acquired a new briskness  la duchesse della nermino he announced  sogrange nodded  everything just as it should be he declared change those labels my friend as quickly as you can  peters fingers were nimble and the thing was done in a few seconds  so i am to sit next the spanish lady he remarked feeling for his tie  not only that but you are to make friends with her sogrange replied you are to be your captivating self baron the duchesse is to forget her weakness for hot rooms she is to develop a taste for sea air and your society  is she peter asked anxiously old or young  sogrange showed a disposition to fence with the question  not old he answered certainly not old fifteen years ago she was considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world  the ladies of spain peter remarked with a sigh are inclined to mature early  in some cases sogrange assured him there are no women in the world who preserve their good looks longer you shall judge my friend madame comes how about that seasickness now  gone peter declared briskly absolutely a fancy of mine never felt better in my life  an imposing little procession approached along the deck there was the deck steward leading the way a very smart french maid carrying a wonderful collection of wraps cushions and books a blackbrowed pallid manservant holding a hotwater bottle in his hand and leading a tiny pekinese spaniel wrapped in a sealskin coat and finally madame la duchesse it was so obviously a procession intended to impress that neither peter nor sogrange thought it worth while to conceal their interest  the duchesse save that she was tall and wrapped in magnificent furs presented a somewhat mysterious appearance her features were entirely obscured by an unusually thick veil of black lace and the voluminous nature of her outer garments only permitted a suspicion as to her figure which was at that time at once the despair and the triumph of her corsetière with both hands she was holding her furlined skirts from contact with the deck disclosing at the same time remarkably shapely feet encased in trim patent shoes with plain silver buckles and a little more black silk stocking than seemed absolutely necessary the deck steward after a halfpuzzled scrutiny of the labels let down the chair next to the two men the duchesse contemplated her prospective neighbours with some curiosity mingled with a certain amount of hesitation it was at that moment that sogrange shaking away his rug rose to his feet  madame la duchesse permits me to remind her of my existence he said bowing low it is some years since we met but i had the honour of a dance at the palace in madrid  she held out her hand at once yet somehow peter felt sure that she was thankful for her veil her voice was pleasant and her air the air of a great lady she spoke french with the soft sibilant intonation of the spaniard  i remember the occasion perfectly marquis she admitted your sister and i once shared a villa in mentone  i am flattered by your recollection duchesse sogrange murmured  it is a great surprise to meet with you here though she continued i did not see you at cherbourg or on the train  i motored from paris sogrange explained and arrived contrary to my custom i must confess somewhat early will you permit that i introduce an acquaintance whom i have been fortunate enough to find on board monsieur le baron de grostmadame la duchesse della nermino  peter was graciously received and the conversation dealt for a few moments with the usual banalities of the voyage then followed the business of settling the duchesse in her place when she was really installed and surrounded with all the paraphernalia of a great and fanciful lady including a handful of long cigarettes she raised her veil peter who was at the moment engaged in conversation with her was a little shocked with the result her features were worn her face dead white with many signs of the ravages wrought by the constant use of cosmetics only her eyes had retained something of their former splendour these latter were almost violet in colour deepset with dark rims and were sufficient almost in themselves to make one forget for a moment the less prepossessing details of her appearance a small library of books was by her side but after a while she no longer pretended any interest in them she was a born conversationalist a creature of her country entirely and absolutely feminine to whom the subtle and flattering deference of the other sex was as the breath of life itself peter burned his homage upon her altar with a craft which amounted to genius in less than half an hour madame la duchesse was looking many years younger the vague look of apprehension had passed from her face their voices had sunk to a confidential undertone punctuated often by the music of her laughter sogrange with a murmured word of apology had slipped away long ago decidedly for an englishman peter was something of a marvel  madame la duchesse moved her head towards the empty chair  he is a great friend of yoursthe marquis de sogrange she asked with a certain inflection in her tone which peter was not slow to notice  indeed no he answered a few years ago i was frequently in paris i made his acquaintance then but we have met very seldom since  you are not travelling together then she inquired  by no means peter assured her i recognised him only as he boarded the steamer at cherbourg  he is not a popular man in our world she remarked one speaks of him as a schemer  is there anything left to scheme for in france peter asked carelessly he is perhaps a monarchist  his ancestry alone would compel a devoted allegiance to royalism the duchesse declared but i do not think that he is interested in any of these futile plots to reinstate the house of orleans i monsieur le baron am spanish  i have scarcely lived so far out of the world as to have heard nothing of the duchesse della nermino peter replied with empressement the last time i saw you duchesse you were in the suite of the infanta  like all englishmen i see you possess a memory she said smiling  duchesse peter answered lowering his voice without the memories which one is fortunate enough to collect as one passes along life would be a dreary place the most beautiful things in the world cannot remain always with us it is well then that the shadow of them can be recalled to us in the shape of dreams  her eyes rewarded him for his gallantry peter felt that he was doing very well indeed he indulged himself in a brief silence presently she returned to the subject of sogrange  i think she remarked that of all the men in the world i expected least to see the marquis de sogrange on board a steamer bound for new york what can a man of his type find to amuse him in the new world  one wonders indeed peter assented as a matter of fact i did read in a newspaper a few days ago that he was going to mexico in connection with some excavations there he spoke to me of it just now they seem to have discovered a ruined temple of the incas or something of the sort  the duchesse breathed what sounded very much like a sigh of relief  i had forgotten she admitted that new york itself need not necessarily be his destination  for my own part peter continued it is quite amazing the interest which the evening papers always take in the movements of one connected ever so slightly with their world i think that a dozen newspapers have told their readers the exact amount of money i am going to lend or borrow in new york the stocks i am going to bull or bear the mines i am going to purchase my presence on an american steamer is accounted for by the journalists a dozen times over yours duchesse if one might say so without appearing overcurious seems the most inexplicable what attraction can america possibly have for you  she glanced at him covertly from under her sleepy eyelids peters face was like the face of a child  you do not perhaps know she said that i was born in cuba i lived there in fact for many years i still have estates in the country  indeed he answered are you interested then in this reported salvage of the maine  there was a short silence peter who had not been looking at her when he had asked his question turned his head surprised at her lack of response his heart gave a little jump the duchesse had all the appearance of a woman on the point of fainting one hand was holding a scent bottle to her nose the other thin and white ablaze with emeralds and diamonds was gripping the side of her chair her expression was one of blank terror peter felt a shiver chill his own blood at the things he saw in her face he himself was confused apologetic yet absolutely without understanding his thoughts reverted at first to his own commonplace malady  you are ill duchesse he exclaimed you will allow me to call the deck steward or perhaps you would prefer your own maid i have some brandy in this flask  he had thrown off his rug but her imperious gesture kept him seated she was looking at him with an intentness which was almost tragical  what made you ask me that question she demanded  his innocence was entirely apparent not even peter could have dissembled so naturally  that question he repeated vaguely you mean about the maine it was the idlest chance duchesse i assure you i saw something about it in the paper yesterday and it seemed interesting but if i had had the slightest idea that the subject was distasteful to you i would not have dreamed of mentioning it even nowi do not understand  she interrupted him all the time he had been speaking she had shown signs of recovery she was smiling now faintly and with obvious effort but still smiling  it is altogether my own fault baron she admitted graciously please forgive my little fit of emotion the subject is a very sore one amongst my countrypeople you know and your sudden mention of it upset me it was very foolish  duchesse i was a clumsy idiot peter declared penitently i deserve that you should be unkind to me for the rest of the voyage  i could not afford that she answered forcing another smile i am relying too much upon you for companionship ah could i trouble you she added for the moment i need my maid she passes there  peter sprang up and called the young woman who was slowly pacing the deck he himself did not at once return to his place he went instead in search of sogrange and found him in his stateroom sogrange was lying upon a couch in a silk smoking suit with a french novel in his hand and an air of contentment which was almost fatuous he laid down the volume at peters entrance  dear baron he murmured why this haste no one is ever in a hurry upon a steamer remember that we cant possibly get anywhere in less than eight days and there is no task in the world nowadays which cannot be accomplished in that time to hurry is a needless waste of tissue and to a person of my nervous temperament exceedingly unpleasant  peter sat down on the edge of the bunk  i presume you have quite finished he said if so listen to me i am moving in the dark is it my fault that i blunder by the merest accident i have already committed a hideous faux pas you ought to have warned me  what do you mean  i have spoken to the duchesse of the maine disaster  the eyes of sogrange gleamed for a moment but he lay perfectly still  why not he asked a good many people are talking about it it is one of the strangest things i have ever heard of that after all these years they should be trying to salve the wreck  it seems worse than strange peter declared what can be the use of trying to stir up bitter feelings between two nations who have fought their battles and buried the hatchet i call it an an act of insanity  a bugle rang sogrange yawned and sat up  would you mind touching the bell for my servant baron he asked dinner will be served in half an hour afterwards we will talk you and i  peter turned away not wholly pleased  the sooner the better he grumbled or i shall be putting my foot into it again  after dinner the two men walked on deck together the night was dark but fine with a strong wind blowing from the northwest the deck steward called their attention to a long line of lights stealing up from the horizon on their starboard side  thats the lusitania sir shell be up to us in half an hour  they leaned over the rail soon the blue fires began to play about their masthead sogrange watched them thoughtfully  if one could only read those messages he remarked with a sigh it might help us  peter knocked the ash from his cigar and was silent for a time he was beginning to understand the situation  my friend he said at last i have been doing you an injustice i have come to the conclusion that you are not keeping me in ignorance of the vital facts connected with our visit to america wilfully at the present moment you know just a little more but a very little more than i do  what perception sogrange murmured my dear baron sometimes you amaze me you are absolutely right i have some pieces and i am convinced that they would form a puzzle the solution of which would be interesting to us but how or where they fit in i frankly dont know you have the facts so far  certainly peter replied  you have heard of sirdeller  do you mean the sirdeller peter asked  naturally i mean the man whose very movements sway the money markets of the world the man who could if he chose ruin any nation make war impossible who could if he had ten more years of life and was allowed to live draw to himself and his own following the entire wealth of the universe  very eloquent peter remarked well take the rest for granted  then sogrange continued you have probably also heard of don pedro prince of marsine onetime pretender to the throne of spain  quite a striking figure in european politics peter assented quickly he is suspected of radical proclivities and is still it is rumoured an active plotter against the existing monarchy  very well sogrange said now listen carefully four months ago sirdeller was living at the golden villa near nice he was visited more than once by marsine introduced by the count von hern the result of those visits was a long series of cablegrams to certain great engineering firms in america almost immediately the salvage of the maine was started it is a matter of common report that the entire cost of these works is being undertaken by sirdeller  now peter murmured you are really beginning to interest me  this week sogrange went on it is expected that the result of the salvage works will be made known that is to say it is highly possible that the question of whether the maine was blown up from outside or inside will be settled once and for all this week mind baron now see what happens sirdeller returns to america the count von hern and prince marsine come to america the duchesse della nermino comes to america the duchesse sirdeller and marsine are upon this steamer the count von hern travels by the lusitania only because it was reported that sirdeller at the last minute changed his mind and was travelling by that boat mix these things up in your brainthe conjurers hat let us call it sogrange concluded laying his hand upon peters arm sirdeller the duchesse von hern marsine the raising of the mainemix them up and what sort of an omelette appears  peter whistled softly  no wonder he said that you couldnt make the pieces of the puzzle fit tell me more about the duchesse  sogrange considered for a moment  the principal thing about her which links her with the present situation he explained is that she was living in cuba at the time of the maine disaster married to a rich cuban  the affair was suddenly illuminated by the searchlight of romance peter for the first time saw not the light but the possibility of it  marsine has been living in germany has he not he asked  he is a personal friend of the kaiser sogrange replied  they both looked up and listened to the crackling of the electricity above their heads  i expect bernadine is a little annoyed peter remarked  it isnt pleasant to be out of the party sogrange agreed nearly everybody however believed at the last moment that sirdeller had transferred his passage to the lusitania  its going to cost him an awful lot in marconigrams peter said by the by wouldnt it have been better for us to have travelled separately and incognito  sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly  von hern has at least one man on board he replied i do not think that we could possibly have escaped observation besides i rather imagine that any move we are able to make in this matter must come before we reach fire island  have you any theory at all peter asked  not the ghost of a one sogrange admitted one more fact though i forgot to mention you may find it important the duchesse comes entirely against von herns wishes they have been on intimate terms for years but for some reason or other he was exceedingly anxious that she should not take this voyage she on the other hand seemed to have some equally strong reason for coming the most useful piece of advice i could give you would be to cultivate her acquaintance  the duchesse  peter never finished his sentence his companion drew him suddenly back into the shadow of a lifeboat  look  a door had opened from lower down the deck and a curious little procession was coming towards them a man burly and broadshouldered who had the air of a professional bully walked by himself ahead two others of similar build walked a few steps behind and between them a thin insignificant figure wrapped in an immense fur coat and using a strong walkingstick came slowly along the deck it was like a procession of prison warders guarding a murderer or perhaps a nervewrecked royal personage moving towards the end of his days in the midst of enemies with halting steps the little old man came shambling along he looked neither to the left nor to the right his eyes were fixed and yet unseeing his features were pale and bony there was no gleam of life not even in his stonecold eyes like some machinemade man of a new and physically degenerate age he took his exercise under the eye of his doctora strange and miserablelooking object  there goes sirdeller sogrange whispered look at himthe man whose might is greater than any emperors there is no haven in the universe to which he does not hold the key look at himmaster of the world  peter shivered there was something depressing in the sight of that mournful procession  he neither smokes nor drinks sogrange continued women as a sex do not exist for him his religion is a doubting calvinism he has a doctor and a clergyman always by his side to inject life and hope if they can look at him well my friend he represents a great moral lesson  thanks peter replied i am going to take the taste of him out of my mouth with a whisky and soda afterwards im for the duchesse  but the duchesse apparently was not for peter he found her in the musicroom with several of the little marconi missives spread out before her and she cut him dead peter however was a brave man and skilled at the game of bluff so he stopped by her side and without any preamble addressed her  duchesse he said you are a woman of perception which do you believe then in your heart to be the more trustworthythe count von hern or i  she simply stared at him he continued promptly  you have received your warning i see  from whom  from the count von hern why believe what he says he may be a friend of yourshe may be a dear friendbut in your heart you know that he is both unscrupulous and selfish why accept his word and distrust me i at least am honest  she raised her eyebrows  honest she repeated whose word have i for that save your own and what concern is it of mine if you possess every one of the bourgeois qualities in the world you are presuming sir  my friend sogrange will tell you that i am to be trusted peter persisted  i see no reason why i should trouble myself about your personal characteristics she replied coldly they do not interest me  on the contrary duchesse peter continued fencing wildly you have never in your life been more in need of anyones services than you are of mine  the conflict was uneven the duchesse was a nervous highly strung woman the calm assurance of peters manner oppressed her with a sense of his mastery she sank back upon the couch from which she had arisen  i wish you would tell me what you mean she said you have no right to talk to me in this fashion what have you to do with my affairs  i have as much to do with them as the count von hern peter insisted boldly  i have known the count von hern she answered for very many years you have been a shipboard acquaintance of mine for a few hours  if you have known the count von hern for many years peter asserted you have found out by this time that he is an absolutely untrustworthy person  supposing he is she said will you tell me what concern it is of yours do you suppose for one moment that i am likely to discuss my private affairs with a perfect stranger  you have no private affairs peter declared sternly they are the affairs of a nation  she glanced at him with a little shiver from that moment he felt that he was gaining ground she looked around the room it was well filled but in their corner they were almost unobserved  how much do you know she asked in a low tone which shook with passion  peter smiled enigmatically  perhaps more even than you duchesse he replied i should like to be your friend you need oneyou know that  she rose abruptly to her feet  for tonight it is enough she declared wrapping her fur cloak around her you may talk to me tomorrow baron i must think if you desire really to be my friend there is perhaps one service which i may require of you but tonight no  peter stood aside and allowed her to step past him he was perfectly content with the progress he had made her farewell salute was by no means ungracious as soon as she was out of sight he returned to the couch where she had been sitting she had taken away the marconigrams but she had left upon the floor several copies of the new york herald he took them up and read them carefully through the last one he found particularly interesting so much so that he folded it up placed it in his coat pocket and went off to look for sogrange whom he found at last in the saloon watching a noisy game of up jenkins peter sank upon the cushioned seat by his side  you were right he remarked bernadine has been busy  sogrange smiled  i trust he said that the duchesse is not proving faithless  so far peter replied i have kept my end up tomorrow will be the test bernadine has filled her with caution she thinks that i know everythingwhatever everything may be unless i can discover a little more than i do now tomorrow is going to be an exceedingly awkward day for me  there is every prospect of your acquiring a great deal of valuable information before then sogrange declared sit tight my friend something is going to happen  on the threshold of the saloon ushered in by one of the stewards a tall powerfullooking man with a square welltrimmed black beard was standing looking around as though in search of someone the steward pointed out with an unmistakable movement of his head peter and sogrange the man approached and took the next table  steward he directed bring me a glass of vermouth and some dominoes  peters eyes were suddenly bright sogrange touched his foot under the table and whispered a word of warning the dominoes were brought the newcomer arranged them as though for a game then he calmly withdrew the doublefour and laid it before sogrange  it has been my misfortune marquis he said never to have made your acquaintance although our mutual friends are many and i think i may say that i have the right to claim a certain amount of consideration from you and your associates you know me  certainly prince sogrange replied i am charmed permit me to present my friend the baron de grost  the newcomer bowed and glanced a little nervously around  you will permit me he begged i travel incognito i have lived so long in england that i have permitted myself the name of an englishman i am travelling under the name of mr james fanshawe  mr fanshawe by all means sogrange agreed in the meantime  i claim my rights as a corresponding member of the double four the newcomer declared my friend the count von hern finds menace to certain plans of ours in your presence upon this steamer unknown to him i come to you openly i claim your aid not your enmity  let us understand one another clearly sogrange said you claim our aid in what  mr fanshawe glanced around the saloon and lowered his voice  i claim your aid towards the overthrowing of the usurping house of asturias and the restoration to power in spain of my own line  sogrange was silent for several moments peter was leaning forward in his place deeply interested decidedly this american trip seemed destined to lead toward events  our active aid towards such an end sogrange said at last is impossible the society of the double four does not interfere in the domestic policy of other nations for the sake of individual members  then let me ask you why i find you upon this steamer mr fanshawe demanded in a tone of suppressed excitement is it for the sea voyage that you and your friend the baron de grost cross the atlantic this particular week on the same steamer as myself as mr sirdeller andand the duchesse one does not believe in such coincidences one is driven to conclude that it is your intention to interfere  the affair almost demands our interference sogrange replied smoothly with every due respect to you prince there are great interests involved in this move of yours  the prince was a big man but for all his large features and bearded face his expression was the expression of a peevish and passionate child he controlled himself with an effort  marquis he said it is necessaryi say that it is necessary that we conclude an alliance  sogrange nodded approvingly  it is well spoken he said but rememberthe baron de grost represents england and the english interests of our society  the prince of marsines face was not pleasant to look upon  forgive me if you are an englishman by birth baron he said turning towards him but a more interfering nation in other peoples affairs than england has never existed in the pages of history she must have a finger in every pie bah  peter leaned over from his place  what about germany mr fanshawe he asked with emphasis  the prince tugged at his beard he was a little nonplussed  the count von hern he confessed has been a good friend to me the rulers of his country have always been hospitable and favourably inclined towards my family the whole affair is of his design i myself could scarcely have moved in it alone one must reward ones helpers there is no reason however he added with a meaning glance at peter why other helpers should not be admitted  the reward which you offer to the count von hern peter remarked is of itself absolutely inimical to the interests of my country  listen the prince demanded tapping the table before him it is true that within a year i am pledged to reward the count von hern in certain fashion it is not possible that you know the terms of our compact but from your words it is possible that you have guessed very well accept this from me remain neutral now allow this matter to proceed to its natural conclusion let your government address representations to me when the time comes adopting a bold front and i promise that i will obey them it will not be my fault that i am compelled to disappoint the count von hern my seaboard would be at the mercy of your fleet superior force must be obeyed  it is a matter this sogrange said for discussion between my friend and me i think you will find that we are neither of us unreasonable in short prince i see no insuperable reason why we should not come to terms  you encourage me the prince declared in a gratified tone do not believe marquis that i am actuated in this matter wholly by motives of personal ambition no it is not so a great desire has burned always in my heart but it is not that alone which moves me i assure you that of my certain knowledge spain is honeycombedis rotten with treason a revolution is a certainty how much better that that revolution should be conducted in a dignified manner that i with my reputation for democracy which i have carefully kept before the eyes of my people should be elected president of the new spanish republic even if it is the gold of the american who places me there in a year or twos time what may happen who can say this craving for a republic is but a passing dream spain at heart is monarchical she will be led back to the light it is but a short step from the presidents chair to the throne  sogrange and his companion sat quite still they avoided looking at each other  there is one thing more the prince continued dropping his voice as if even at that distance he feared the man of whom he spoke i shall not inform the count von hern of our conversation it is not necessary and between ourselves the count is jealous he sends me message after message that i remain in my stateroom that i seek no interview with sirdeller that i watch only he is too much of the spythe count von hern he does not understand that code of honour relying upon which i open my heart to you  you have done your cause no harm sogrange assured him with subtle sarcasm we come now to the duchesse  the prince leaned towards him it was just at this moment that a steward entered with a marconigram which he presented to the prince the latter tore it open glanced it through and gave vent to a little exclamation the fingers which held the missive trembled his eyes blazed with excitement he was absolutely unable to control his feelings  my two friends he cried in a tone broken with emotion it is you first who shall hear the news this message has just arrived sirdeller will have received its duplicate the final report of the works in havana harbour will await us on our arrival in new york but the substance of it is this the maine was sunk by a torpedo discharged at close quarters underneath her magazine gentlemen the house of asturias is ruined  there was a breathless silence  your information is genuine sogrange asked softly  without a doubt the prince replied i have been expecting this message i shall cable to von hern we are still in communication he may not have heard  we were about to speak of the duchesse peter reminded him  the prince shook his head  another time he declared another time  he hurried away it was already halfpast ten and the saloon was almost empty the steward came up to them  the saloon is being closed for the night sir he announced  let us go on deck peter suggested  they found their way up on to the windward side of the promenade which was absolutely deserted far away in front of them now were the disappearing lights of the lusitania the wind roared by as the great steamer rose and fell on the black stretch of waters peter stood very near to his companion  listen sogrange he said the affair is clear now save for one thing  you mean sirdellers motives  not at all peter answered an hour ago i came across the explanation of these the one thing i will tell you afterwards now listen sirdeller came abroad last year for twelve months travel he took a great house in san sebastian  where did you hear this sogrange asked  i read the story in the new york herald peter continued it is grossly exaggerated of course but this is the substance of it sirdeller and his suite were stopped upon the spanish frontier and treated in an abominable fashion by the customs officers he was forced to pay a very large sum unjustly i should think he paid under protest appealed to the authorities with no result at san sebastian he was robbed right and left his privacy intruded upon in short he took a violent dislike and hatred to the country and everyone concerned in it he moved with his entire suite to nice to the golden villa there he expressed himself freely concerning spain and her government count von hern heard of it and presented marsine the plot was without doubt bernadines cant you imagine how he would put it a revolution he would tell sirdeller is imminent in spain here is the new president of the republic money is no more to you than water you are a patriotic american have you forgotten that the finest warship your country ever built with six hundred of her devoted citizens was sent to the bottom by the treachery of one of this effete race the war was an inefficient revenge the country still flourishes it is for you to avenge america with money marsine can establish a republic in spain within twentyfour hours sirdeller hesitates he would point out that it had never been proved that the destruction of the maine was really due to spanish treachery it is the idea of a business man which followed he at his own expense would raise the maine if it were true that the explosion occurred from outside he would find the money you see the message has arrived after all these years the sea has given up its secret marsine will return to spain with an unlimited credit behind him the house of asturias will crumble up like a pack of cards  sogrange looked out into the darkness perhaps he saw in that great black gulf the pictures of these happenings which his companion had prophesied perhaps for a moment he saw the panorama of a city in flames the passing of a great country under the thrall of these new ideas at any rate he turned abruptly away from the side of the vessel and taking peters arm walked slowly down the deck  you have solved the puzzle baron he said gravely now tell me one thing your story seems to dovetail everywhere  the one thing peter said is connected with the duchesse it was she of her own will who decided to come to america i believe that but for her coming bernadine and the prince would have waited in their own country money can flash from america to england over the wires it does not need to be fetched they have still one fear it is connected with the duchesse let me think  they walked up and down the deck the lights were extinguished one by one except in the smokeroom a strange breed of sailors from the lower deck came up with mops and buckets the wind changed its quarter and the great ship began to roll peter stopped abruptly  i find this motion most unpleasant he said i am going to bed tonight i cannot think tomorrow i promise you we will solve this hush  he held out his hand and drew his companion back into the shadow of a lifeboat a tall figure was approaching them along the deck as he passed the little ray of light thrown out from the smokingroom the mans features were clearly visible it was the prince he was walking like one absorbed in thought his eyes were set like a sleepwalkers with one hand he gesticulated the fingers of the other were twitching all the time his head was lifted to the skies there was something in his face which redeemed it from its disfiguring petulance  it is the man who dreams of power peter whispered it is one of the best moments this he forgets the vulgar means by which he intends to rise he thinks only of himself the dictator king perhaps emperor he is of the breed of egoists  again and again the prince passed manifestly unconscious even of his whereabouts peter and sogrange crept away unseen to their staterooms                                       in many respects the room resembled a miniature court of justice the principal sittingroom of the royal suite which was the chief glory of the adriatic had been stripped of every superfluous article of furniture or embellishment curtains had been removed all evidences of luxury disposed of temporarily the apartment had been transformed into a bare cheerless place seated on a high chair with his back to the wall was sirdeller at his right hand was a small table on which stood a glass of milk a phial a stethoscope behind his doctor at his left hand a smoothfaced silent young manhis secretary before him stood the duchesse peter and sogrange guarding the door was one of the watchmen who from his great physique might well have been a policeman out of livery sirdeller himself in the clear light which streamed through the large window seemed more aged and shrunken than ever his eyes were deepset no tinge of colour was visible in his cheeks his chin protruded his shaggy grey eyebrows gave him an unkempt appearance he wore a black velvet cap a strangely cut black morning coat and trousers felt slippers and his hands were clasped upon a stout ash walkingstick he eyed the newcomers keenly but without expression  the lady may sit he said  he spoke almost in an undertone as though anxious to avoid the fatigue of words the guardian of the door placed a chair into which the duchesse subsided sirdeller held his right hand towards his doctor who felt his pulse all the time sirdeller watched him his lips a little parted a world of hungry excitement in his eyes the doctor closed his watch with a snap and whispered something in sirdellers ear apparently reassuring  i will hear this story sirdeller announced in two minutes every one must leave if it takes longer it must remain unfinished  peter spoke up briskly  the story is this he began you have promised to assist the prince of marsine to transform spain into a republic providing the salvage operations on the maine prove that that ship was destroyed from outside the salvage operations have been conducted at your expense and finished it has been proved that the maine was destroyed by a mine or torpedo from the outside therefore on the assumption that it was the treacherous deed of a spaniard or cuban imagining himself to be a patriot you are prepared to carry out your undertaking and supply the prince of marsine with means to overthrow the kingdom of spain  peter paused the figure on the chair remained motionless no flicker of intelligence or interest disturbed the calm of his features it was a silence almost unnatural  i have brought the duchesse here peter continued to tell you the truth as to the maine disaster  not even then was there the slightest alteration in those ashen grey features  the duchesse looked up she had the air of one only too eager to speak and finish  in those days she said i was the wife of a rich cuban gentleman whose name i withhold the american officers on board the maine used to visit at our house my husband was jealous perhaps he had cause  the duchesse paused even though the light of tragedy and romance side by side seemed suddenly to creep into the room sirdeller listened as one come back from a dead world  one night the duchesse went on my husbands suspicions were changed into knowledge he came home unexpectedly the americanthe officeri loved himwas there on the balcony with me my husband said nothing the officer returned to his ship that night my husband came into my room he bent over my bed it is not you he whispered whom i shall destroy for the pain of death is short anguish of mind may live tonight six hundred ghosts may hang about your pillow  her voice broke there was something grim and unnatural in that curious stillness even the secretary was at last breathing a little faster the watchman at the door was leaning forward sirdeller simply moved his hand to the doctor who held up his finger while he felt the pulse the beat of his watch seemed to sound through the unnatural silence in a minute he spoke  the lady may proceed he announced  my husband the duchesse continued was an officer in charge of the mines and ordnance department he went out that night in a small boat after a visit to the strong house no soul has ever seen or heard of him since or his boat it is only i who know  her voice died away sirdeller stretched out his hand and very deliberately drank a tablespoonful or two of his milk  i believe the ladys story he declared the marsine affair is finished let no one be admitted to have speech with me again upon this subject  he had half turned towards his secretary the young man bowed the doctor pointed towards the door the duchesse peter and sogrange filed slowly out in the bright sunlight the duchesse burst into a peal of hysterical laughter even peter felt for a moment unnerved suddenly he too laughed  i think he said that you and i had better get out of the way sogrange when the count von hern meets us at new york     chapter viii  an alien society   sogrange and peter baron de grost standing upon the threshold of their hotel gazed out upon new york and liked the look of it they had landed from the steamer a few hours before had already enjoyed the luxury of a bath a visit to an american barbers and a genuine cocktail  i see no reason sogrange declared why we should not take a weeks holiday  peter glancing up into the blue sky and down into the faces of the welldressed and beautiful women who were streaming up fifth avenue was wholly of the same mind  if we return by this afternoons steamer he remarked we shall have bernadine for a fellowpassenger bernadine is annoyed with us just now i must confess that i should feel more at my ease with a few thousand miles of the atlantic between us  let it be so sogrange assented we will explore this marvellous city never he added taking his companions arm did i expect to see such women save in my own the mistress of all cities so chic my dear baron and such a carriage we will lunch at one of the fashionable restaurants and drive in the park afterwards first of all however we must take a stroll along this wonderful fifth avenue  the two men spent a morning after their own hearts they lunched astonishingly well at sherrys and drove afterwards in the central park when they returned to the hotel sogrange was in excellent spirits  i feel my friend he announced that we are going to have a very pleasant and in some respects a unique week to meet friends and acquaintances everywhere as one must do in every capital in europe is of course pleasant but there is a monotony about it from which one is glad sometimes to escape we lunch here and we promenade in the places frequented by those of a similar station to our own and behold we know no one we are lookers on perhaps for a long time it might gall for a brief period there is a restfulness about it which pleases me  i should have liked peter murmured an introduction to the lady in the blue hat  you are a gregarious animal sogrange declared you do not understand the pleasure of a little comparative isolation with an intellectual companion such as myself what the devil is the meaning of this  they had reached their sittingroom and upon a small round table stood a great collection of cards and notes sogrange took them up helplessly one after the other reading the names aloud and letting them fall through his fingers some were known to him some were not he began to open the notes in effect they were all the sameon what day would the marquis de sogrange and his distinguished friend care to dine lunch yacht golf shoot go to the opera join a theatre party of what clubs would they care to become members what kind of hospitality would be most acceptable  sogrange sank into a chair  my friend he exclaimed they all have to be answeredthat collection there the visits have to be returned it is magnificent this hospitality but what can one do  peter looked at the pile of correspondence upon which sogranges inroad indeed seemed to have had but little effect  one could engage a secretary of course he suggested doubtfully but the visits our weeks holiday is gone  not at all sogrange replied i have an idea  the telephone bell rang peter took up the receiver and listened for a moment he turned to sogrange still holding it in his hand  you will be pleased also to hear he announced that there are half a dozen reporters downstairs waiting to interview us  sogrange received the information with interest  have them sent up at once he directed every one of them  what all at the same time peter asked  all at the same time it must be sogrange answered give them to understand that it is an affair of five minutes only  they came trooping in sogrange welcomed them cordially  my friend the baron de grost he explained indicating peter i am the marquis de sogrange let us know what we can do to serve you  one of the men stepped forward  very glad to meet you marquis and you baron he said i wont bother you with any introductions but i and the company here represent the press of new york we should like some information for our papers as to the object of your visit here and the probable length of your stay  sogrange extended his hands  my dear friend he exclaimed the object of our visit was i thought already well known we are on our way to mexico we leave tonight my friend the baron is as you know a financier i too have a little money to invest we are going to meet some business acquaintances with a view to inspecting some mining properties that is absolutely all i can tell you you can understand of course that fuller information would be impossible  why thats quite natural marquis the spokesman of the reporters replied we dont like the idea of your hustling out of new york like this though  sogrange looked at the clock  it is unavoidable he declared we are relying upon you gentlemen to publish the fact because you will see he added pointing to the table that we have been the recipients of a great many civilities which it is impossible for us to acknowledge properly if it will give you any pleasure to see us upon our return you will be very welcome in the meantime you will understand our haste  there were a few more civilities and the representatives of the press took their departure peter looked at his companion doubtfully as sogrange returned from showing them out  i suppose this means that we have to catch todays steamer after all he remarked  not necessarily sogrange answered i have a plan we will leave for the southern depot wherever it may be afterwards you shall use that wonderful skill of yours of which i have heard so much to effect some slight change in our appearance we will then go to another hotel in another quarter of new york and take our weeks holiday incognito what do you think of that for an idea  not much peter replied it isnt so easy to dodge the newspapers and the press in this country besides although i could manage myself very well you would be an exceedingly awkward subject your tall and elegant figure your aquiline nose the shapeliness of your hands and feet give you a distinction which i should find it hard to conceal  sogrange smiled  you are a remarkably observant fellow baron i quite appreciate your difficulty still with a club foot ehand spectacles instead of my eyeglasses  oh no doubt something could be managed peter interrupted youre really in earnest about this are you  absolutely sogrange declared come here  he drew peter to the window they were on the twelfth story and to a european there was something magnificent in that tangled mass of buildings threaded by the elevated railway with its screaming trains the clearness of the atmosphere and in the white streets below like polished belts through which the swarms of people streamed like insects  imagine it all lit up sogrange exclaimed the skysigns all ablaze the flashing of fire from those cable wires the lights glittering from those tall buildings this is a wonderful place baron we must see it ring for the bill order one of those magnificent omnibuses press the button too for the personage whom they call the valet perhaps with a little gentle persuasion he could be induced to pack our clothes  with his finger upon the bell peter hesitated he too loved adventures but the gloom of a presentiment had momentarily depressed him  we are marked men remember sogrange he said an escapade of this sort means a certain amount of risk even in new york  sogrange laughed  bernadine caught the midday steamer we have no enemies here that i know of  peter pressed the button an hour or so later the marquis de sogrange and peter baron de grost took their leave of new york  they chose an hotel some distance down broadway within a stones throw of rectors restaurant peter with whitened hair goldrimmed spectacles a slouch hat and a fur coat passed easily enough for an english maker of electrical instruments while sogrange shabbier and in readymade american clothes was transformed into a canadian having some connection with theatrical business they plunged into the heart of new york life and found the whole thing like a tonic the intense vitality of the people the pandemonium of broadway at midnight with its flaming illuminations its eager crowd its inimitable restlessness fascinated them both sogrange indeed remembering the decadent languor of the crowds of pleasureseekers thronging his own boulevards was never weary of watching these men and women they passed from the streets to the restaurants from the restaurants to the theatre out into the streets again back to the restaurants and once more into the streets sogrange was like a glutton the mention of bed was hateful to him for three days they existed without a moments boredom  on the fourth evening peter found sogrange deep in conversation with the head porter in a few minutes he led peter away to one of the bars where they usually took their cocktail  my friend he announced tonight i have a treat for you so far we have looked on at the external night life of new york wonderful and thrilling it has been too but there is the underneath also why not there is a vast polyglot population here full of energy and life a criminal class exists as a matter of course tonight we make our bow to it  and by what means peter inquired  our friend the hall porter sogrange continued has given me the card of an exdetective who will be our escort he calls for us tonight or rather tomorrow morning at one oclock then behold the wand is waved the land of adventures opens before us  peter grunted  i dont want to damp your enthusiasm my canadian friend he said but the sort of adventures you may meet with tonight are scarcely likely to fire your romantic nature i know a little about what they call this underneath world in new york it will probably resolve itself into a visit to chinatown where we shall find the usual dummies taking opium and quite prepared to talk about it for the usual tip after that we shall visit a few low dancing halls be shown the scene of several murders and the thing is done  you are a cynic sogrange declared you would throw cold water upon any enterprise anyway our detective is coming we must make use of him for i have engaged to pay him five dollars  well go where you like peter assented so long as we dine on a roof garden this beastly fur coat keeps me in a chronic state of perspiration  never mind sogrange said consolingly its most effective a roof garden by all means  and recollect peter insisted i bar chinatown weve both of us seen the real thing and theres nothing real about what they show you here  chinatown is erased from our programme sogrange agreed we go now to dine remind me baron that i inquire for these strange dishes of which one hearsterrapin canvasbacked duck green corn and strawberry shortcake  peter smiled grimly  how like a frenchman he exclaimed to take no account of seasons never mind marquis you shall give your order and i will sketch the waiters face by the by if youre in earnest about this expedition tonight put your revolver into your pocket  but were going with an exdetective sogrange replied  one never knows peter said carelessly  they dined close to the stone palisading of one of new yorks most famous roof gardens sogrange ordered an immense dinner but spent most of his time gazing downwards they were higher up than at the hotel and they could see across the tangled maze of lights even to the river across which the great ferry boats were speeding all the whilehuge creatures of streaming fire and whistling sirens the air where they sat was pure and crisp there was no fog no smoke to cloud the almost crystalline clearness of the night  baron sogrange declared if i had lived in this city i should have been a different man no wonder the people are allconquering  too much electricity in the air for me peter answered i like a little repose i cant think where these people find it  one hopes sogrange murmured that before they progress any further in utilitarianism they will find some artist one of themselves to express all this  in the meantime peter interrupted the waiter would like to know what we are going to drink ive eaten such a confounded jumble of things of your ordering that i should like some champagne  who shall say that i am not generous sogrange replied taking up the wine carte champagne it shall be we need something to nerve us for our adventures  peter leaned across the table  sogrange he whispered for the last twentyfour hours i have had some doubts as to the success of our little enterprise it has occurred to me more than once that we are being shadowed  sogrange frowned  i sometimes wonder he remarked how a man of your suspicious nature ever acquired the reputation you undoubtedly enjoy  perhaps it is because of my suspicious nature peter said there is a man staying in our hotel whom we are beginning to see quite a great deal of he was talking to the head porter a few minutes before you this afternoon he supped at the same restaurant last night he is dining now three places behind you to the right with a young lady who has been making flagrant attempts to flirtation with me notwithstanding my grey hairs  your reputation my dear peter sogrange murmured  as a decoy peter interrupted the young ladys methods are too vigorous she pretends to be terribly afraid of her companion but it is entirely obvious that she is acting on his instructions of course this may be a ruse of the reporters on the other hand i think it would be wise to abandon our little expedition tonight  sogrange shook his head  so far as i am concerned he said i am committed to it  in which case peter replied i am certainly committed to being your companion the only question is whether one shall fall to the decoy and suffer oneself to be led in the direction her companion desires or whether we shall go blundering into trouble on our own account with your friend the exdetective  sogrange glanced over his shoulder leaned back in his chair for a moment as though to look at the stars and finally lit a cigarette  there is a lack of subtlety about that young person baron he declared which stifles ones suspicions i suspect her to be merely one more victim to your undoubted charms in the interests of madame your wife i shall take you away the decoy shall weave her spells in vain  they paid their bill and departed a few minutes later the man and the girl were also in the act of leaving the former seemed to be having some dispute about the bill the girl standing with her back to him scribbled a line upon a piece of paper and as peter went by pushed it into his hand with a little warning gesture in the lift he opened it the few pencilled words contained nothing but an address number 15 100th street east  lucky man sogrange sighed  peter made no remark but he was thoughtful for the next hour or so  the exdetective proved to be an individual of fairly obvious appearance whose complexion and thirst indicated a very possible reason for his life of leisure he heard with surprise that his patrons were not inclined to visit chinatown but he showed a laudable desire to fall in with their schemes provided always that they included a reasonable number of visits to places where refreshments could be obtained from first to last the expedition was a disappointment they visited various smokehung dancing halls decorated for the most part with oleographs and cracked mirrors in which sicklylooking young men of unwholesome aspect were dancing with their feminine counterparts the attitude of their guide was alone amusing  say you want to be careful in here he would declare in an awed tone on entering one of these tawdry palaces guess this is one of the toughest spots in new york city you stick close to me and ill make things all right  his method of making things all right was the same in every case he would form a circle of disreputable youths for whose drinks sogrange was called upon to pay the attitude of the young men was more dejected than positively vicious they showed not the slightest signs of any desire to make themselves unpleasant only once when sogrange incautiously displayed a gold watch did the eyes of one or two of their number glisten the exdetective changed his place and whispered hoarsely in his patrons ear  say dont you flash anything of that sort about here that young cove right opposite to you is one of the bestknown sneakthieves in the city youre asking for trouble that way  if he or any other of them want my watch sogrange answered calmly let them come and fetch it however he added buttoning up his coat no doubt you are right is there anywhere else to take us  the man hesitated  there aint much that you havent seen he remarked  sogrange laughed softly as he rose to his feet  a sell my dear friend he said to peter this terrible city keeps its real criminal class somewhere else rather than in the show places  a man who had been standing in the doorway looking in for several moments strolled up to them peter recognised him at once and touched sogrange on the arm the newcomer accosted them pleasantly  say youll excuse my butting in he began but i can see you are kind of disappointed these suckersindicating the exdetectivetalk a lot about what theyre going to show you and when they get you round it all amounts to nothing this is the sort of thing they bring you to as representing the wickedness of new york thats so rastall isnt it  the exdetective looked a little sheepish  yes there aint much more to be seen he admitted perhaps youll take the job on if you think there is  well id engage to show the gentlemen something a sight more interesting than this the newcomer continued they dont want to sit down and drink with the scum of the earth  perhaps sogrange suggested this gentleman has something in his mind which he thinks would appeal to us we have a motorcar outside and we are out for adventures  what sort of adventures the newcomer asked bluntly  sogrange shrugged his shoulders lightly  we are lookerson merely he explained my friend and i have travelled a good deal we have seen something of criminal life in paris and london vienna and budapest i shall not break any confidence if i tell you that my friend is a writer and material such as this is useful  the newcomer smiled  say he exclaimed in a way its fortunate for you that i happened along you come right with me and ill show you something that very few other people in this city know of guess youd better pay this fellow off he added indicating the exdetective hes no more use to you  sogrange and peter exchanged questioning glances  it is very kind of you sir peter decided but for my part i have had enough for one evening  just as you like of course the other remarked with studied unconcern  what kind of place would it be sogrange asked  the newcomer drew them on one side although as a matter of fact everyone else had melted away  have you ever heard of the secret societies of new york he inquired well i guess you havent anywaynot to know anything about them well then listen theres a society meets within a few steps of here which has more to do with regulating the criminal classes of the city than any police establishment therell be a man there within an hour or so who to my knowledge has committed seven murders the police cant get him they never will hes under our protection  may we visit such a place as you describe without danger peter asked calmly  no the man answered theres danger in going anywhere it seems to me if its worth while so long as you keep a still tongue in your head and dont look about you too much theres nothing will happen to you if you get gassing a lot you might tumble in for almost anything dont come unless you like its a chance for you as youre a writer but youd best keep out of it if youre in any way nervous  you said it was quite close sogrange inquired  within a yard or two the man replied its right this way  they left the hall with their new escort when they looked for their motorcar they found it had gone  it dont do to keep them things waiting about round here their new friend remarked carelessly i guess ill send you back to your hotel all right step this way  by the by what street is this we are in peter asked  100th street the man answered  peter shook his head  im a little superstitious about that number he declared is that an elevated railway there i think weve had enough sogrange  sogrange hesitated they were standing now in front of a tall gloomy house unkempt with broken gatea large but miserablelooking abode the passersby in the street were few the whole character of the surroundings was squalid the man pushed open the broken gate  you cross the road right there to the elevated he directed if you aint coming ill bid you goodnight  once more they hesitated peter perhaps saw more than his companion he saw the dark shapes lurking under the railway arch he knew instinctively that they were in some sort of danger and yet the love of adventure was on fire in his blood his belief in himself was immense he whispered to sogrange  i do not trust our guide he said if you care to risk it i am with you  mind the broken pavement the man called out this aint exactly an abode of luxury  they climbed some broken steps their guide opened a door with a yale key the door swung to after them and they found themselves in darkness there had been no light in the windows there was no light apparently in the house their companion produced an electric torch from his pocket  you had best follow me he advised our quarters face out the other way we keep this end looking a little deserted  they passed through a swing door and everything was at once changed a multitude of lamps hung from the ceiling the floor was carpeted the walls clean  we dont go in for electric light their guide explained as we try not to give the place away we manage to keep it fairly comfortable though  he pushed open the door and entered a somewhat gorgeously furnished salon there were signs here of feminine occupation an open piano and the smell of cigarettes once more peter hesitated  your friends seem to be in hiding he remarked personally i am losing my curiosity  guess you wont have to wait very long the man replied with meaning  the room was suddenly invaded on all sides four doors which were quite hidden by the pattern of the wall had opened almost simultaneously and at least a dozen men had entered this time both sogrange and peter knew that they were face to face with the real thing these were men who came silently in not cigarettestunted youths two of them were in evening dress three or four had the appearance of prizefighters in their countenances was one expression common to allan air of quiet and conscious strength  a fairheaded man in a dinner jacket and black tie became at once their spokesman he was possessed of a very slight american accent and he beamed at them through a pair of goldrimmed spectacles  gentlemen he said i am very glad to meet you both  very kind of you im sure sogrange answered our friend here he added indicating their guide found us trying to gain a little insight into the more interesting part of new york life he was kind enough to express a wish to introduce us to you  the man smiled he looked very much like some studious clerk except that his voice seemed to ring with some latent power  i am afraid he said that your friends interest in you was not entirely unselfish for three days he has carried in his pocket an order instructing him to produce you here  i knew it peter whispered under his breath  you interest me sogrange replied may i know whom i have the honour of addressing  you can call me burr the man announced philip burr your names it is not our wish to know  i am afraid i do not quite understand sogrange said  it was scarcely to be expected that you should mr philip burr admitted all i can tell you is that in cases like yours i really prefer not to know with whom i have to deal  you speak as though you had business with us peter remarked  without doubt i have the other replied grimly it is my business to see that you do not leave these premises alive  sogrange drew up a chair against which he had been leaning and sat down  really he said that would be most inconvenient  peter too shook his head sitting upon the end of a sofa and folding his arms something told him that the moment for fighting was not yet  inconvenient or not mr philip burr continued i have orders to carry out which i can assure you have never yet been disobeyed since the formation of our society from what i can see of you you appear to be very amiable gentlemen and if it would interest you to choose the methodsay of your releasewhy i can assure you well do all we can to meet your views  i am beginning sogrange remarked to feel quite at home  you see weve been through this sort of thing before peter added blandly  mr philip burr took a cigar from his case and lit it at a motion of his hand one of the company passed the box to his two guests  youre not counting upon a visit from the police or anything of that sort i hope mr philip burr asked  sogrange shook his head  certainly not he replied i may say that much of the earlier portion of my life was spent in frustrating the wellmeant but impossible schemes of that body of men  if only we had a little more time mr burr declared it seems to me i should like to make the acquaintance of you two gentlemen  the matter is entirely in your own hands peter reminded him we are in no hurry  mr burr smiled genially  you make me think better of humanity he confessed a month ago we had a man heregot him along somehow or otherand i had to tell him that he was up against it like you two are my the fuss he made kind of saddened me to think a man should be such a coward  some people are like that sogrange remarked by the by mr burr youll pardon my curiosity whom have we to thank for our introduction here tonight  i dont know as theres any particular harm in telling you mr burr replied  nor any particular good a man who was standing by his side interrupted say phil you drag these things out too much are there any questions youve got to ask em or any property to collect  nothing of the sort mr burr admitted  then let the gang get to work the other declared  the two men were suddenly conscious that they were being surrounded peters hand stole on to the butt of his revolver sogrange rose slowly to his feet his hands were thrust out in front of him with the thumbs turned down the four fingers of each hand flashed for a minute through the air mr philip burr lost all his selfcontrol  say where the devil did you learn that trick he cried  sogrange laughed scornfully  trick he exclaimed philip burr you are unworthy of your position i am the marquis de sogrange and my friend here is the baron de grost  mr philip burr had no words his cigar had dropped on to the carpet he was simply staring  if you need proof sogrange continued further than any i have given you i have in my pocket at the present moment a letter signed by you yourself pleading for formal reinstatement this is how you would qualify for it you make use of your power to run a common decoy house to do away with men for money what fool gave you our names pray  mr philip burr was only the wreck of a man he could not even control his voice  it was some german or belgian nobleman he faltered he brought us excellent letters and he made a large contribution it was the count von hern  the anger of sogrange seemed suddenly to fade away he threw himself into a chair by the side of his companion  my dear baron he exclaimed bernadine has scored indeed your friend has a sense of humour which overwhelms me imagine it he has delivered the two heads of our great society into the hands of one of its castoff branches bernadine is a genius indeed  mr philip burr began slowly to recover himself he waved his hand nine out of the twelve men left the room  marquis he said for ten years there has been no one whom i have desired to meet so much as you i came to europe but you declined to receive me i know very well we cant keep our end up like you over there because we havent politics and those sort of things to play with but weve done our best weve encouraged only criminology of the highest order weve tried all we can to keep the profession select the gaolbird pure and simple we have cast out the men who have suffered at our hands have been men who have met with their deserts  what about us peter demanded it seems to me that you had most unpleasant plans for our future  philip burr held up his hands  as i live he declared this is the first time that any money consideration has induced me to break away from our principles count von hern had powerful friends who were our friends and he gave me the word straight that you two had an appointment down below which was considerably overdue i dont know even now why i consented i guess it isnt much use apologising  sogrange rose to his feet  well he said i am not inclined to bear malice but you must understand this from me philip burr as a society i dissolve you i deprive you of your title and of your signs call yourself what you will but never again mention the name of the double four with us in europe another era has dawned we are on the side of law and order we protect only criminals of a certain class in whose operations we have faith there is no future for such a society in this country therefore as i say i dissolve it now if you are ready perhaps you will be so good as to provide us with the means of reaching our hotel  philip burr led them into a back street where his own handsome automobile was placed at their service  this kind of breaks me all up he declared as he gave the instructions to the chauffeur if there were two men on the face of this earth whom id have been proud to meet in a friendly sort of way its you two  we bear no malice mr burr sogrange assured him you can if you will do us the honour lunch with us tomorrow at one oclock at rectors my friend here is very interested in the count von hern and he would probably like to hear exactly how this affair was arranged  ill be there sure philip burr promised with a farewell wave of the hand  sogrange and peter drove towards their hotel in silence it was only when they emerged into the civilised part of the city that sogrange began to laugh softly  my friend he murmured you bluffed fairly well but you were afraid oh how i smiled to see your fingers close round the butt of that revolver  what about you peter asked gruffly you dont suppose you took me in do you  sogrange smiled  i had two reasons for coming to new york he said one we accomplished upon the steamer the other was  well  to reply personally to this letter of mr philip burr sogrange replied which letter by the by was dated from 15 100th street new york an ordinary visit there would have been useless to me something of this sort was necessary  then you knew peter gasped notwithstanding all your bravado you knew  i had a very fair idea sogrange admitted dont be annoyed with me my friend you have had a little experience it is all useful it isnt the first time youve looked death in the face adventures come to some men unasked you i think were born with the habit of them  peter smiled they had reached the hotel courtyard and he raised himself stiffly  theres a fable about the pitcher that went once too often to the well he remarked i have had my share of luckmore than my share the end must come some time you know  is this superstition sogrange asked  superstition pure and simple peter confessed taking his key from the office it doesnt alter anything i am fatalist enough to shrug my shoulders and move on but i tell you sogrange he added after a moments pause i wouldnt admit it to anyone else in the world but i am afraid of bernadine i have had the best of it so often it cant last in all weve had twelve encounters the next will be the thirteenth  sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly as he rang for the lift  id propose you for the thirteen club only theres some uncomfortable clause about yearly suicides which might not suit you he remarked  good night and dont dream of bernadine and your thirteenth encounter  i only hope peter murmured that i may be in a position to dream after it     chapter ix  the man behind the curtain   baron de grost glanced at the card which his butler had brought in to him carelessly at first afterwards with that curious rigidity of attention which usually denotes the setting free of a flood of memories  the gentleman would like to see you sir the man announced  you can show him in at once peter replied  the servant withdrew peter during those few minutes of waiting stood with his back to the room and his face to the window looking out across the square in reality seeing nothing completely immersed in this strange flood of memories john dorysir john dory nowa quondam enemy whom he had met but seldom during these later years the figure of this man who had once loomed so largely in his life had gradually shrunk away into the background their avoidance of each other arose perhaps from a sort of instinct which was certainly no matter of illwill still the fact remained that they had scarcely exchanged a word for years and peter turned to receive his unexpected guest with a curiosity which he did not trouble wholly to conceal  sir john dorychief commissioner of scotland yard a person of weight and importancehad changed a great deal during the last few years his hair had become grey his walk more dignified there was the briskness however of his best days in his carriage and in the flash of his brown eyes he held out his hand to his ancient foe with a smile  my dear baron he said i hope you are going to say that you are glad to see me  unless peter replied with a goodhumoured grimace your visit is official i am more than gladi am charmed sit down i was just going to take my morning cigar you will join me good now i am ready for the worst that can happen  the two men seated themselves john dory pulled at his cigar appreciatively sniffed its flavour for a moment and then leaned forward in his chair  my visit baron he announced is semiofficial i am here to ask you a favour  an official favour peter demanded quickly  his visitor hesitated as though he found the question hard to answer  to tell you the truth he declared this call of mine is wholly an inspiration it does not in any way concern you personally or your position in this country what that may be i do not know except that i am sure it is above any suspicion  quite so peter murmured how diplomatic you have become my dear friend  john dory smiled  perhaps i am fencing about too much he said i know of course that you are a member of a very powerful and wealthy french society whose object and aims so far as i know are entirely harmless  i am delighted to be assured that you recognise that fact peter admitted  i might add john dory continued that this harmlessness is of recent date  really you do seem to know a good deal peter confessed  i find myself still fencing dory declared a matter of habit i suppose i didnt mean to when i came i made up my mind to tell you simply that guillot was in london and to ask you if you could help me to get rid of him  peter looked thoughtfully into his companions face but he did not speak he understood at such moments the value of silence  we speak together dory continued softly as men who understand one another guillot is the one criminal in europe whom we all fear not i alone mind youit is the same in berlin in petersburg in vienna he has never been caught it is my honest belief that he never will be caught at the same time wherever he arrives the thunderclouds gather he leaves behind him always a trail of evil deeds  very well put peter murmured quite picturesque  can you help me to get rid of him dory inquired i have my hands full just now as you can imagine what with the political crisis and these constant mass meetings i want guillot out of the country if you can manage this for me i shall be your eternal debtor  why do you imagine peter asked that i can help you in this matter  there was a brief silence john dory knocked the ash from his cigar  times have changed he said the harmlessness of your great society my dear baron is at present admitted but there were days  exactly peter interrupted as shrewd as ever i perceive do you know anything of the object of his coming  nothing  anything of his plans  nothing  you know where he is staying  naturally dory answered he has taken a secondfloor flat in crayshaw mansions shaftesbury avenue as usual he is above all petty artifices he has taken it under the name of monsieur guillot  i really dont know whether there is anything i can do peter decided but i will look into the matter for you with pleasure perhaps i may be able to bring a little influence to bearindirectly of course if so it is at your service lady dory is well i trust  in the best of health sir john replied accepting the hint and rising to his feet i shall hear from you soon  without a doubt peter answered i must certainly call upon monsieur guillot  peter wasted no time in paying his promised visit that same afternoon he rang the bell at the flat in crayshaw mansions a typical french butler showed him into the room where the great man sat monsieur guillot slight elegant preeminently a dandy was lounging upon a sofa being manicured by a young lady he threw down his petit journal and rose to his feet however at his visitors entrance  my dear baron he exclaimed but this is charming of you mademoiselle he added turning to the manicurist you will do me the favour of retiring for a short time permit me  he opened the door and showed her out then he came back to peter  a visit of courtesy monsieur le baron he asked  without a doubt peter replied  it is beyond all measure charming of you guillot declared but let me ask you a question is it peace or war  it is what you choose to make it peter answered  the man threw out his hands there was the shadow of a frown upon his pale forehead it was a matter for protest this  why do you come he demanded what have we in common the society has expelled me very well i go my own way why not i am free of your control today you have no more right to interfere with my schemes than i with yours  we have the ancient right of power peter said grimly you were once a prominent member of our organisation the spoilt protégé of madame a splendid maker if you will of criminal history those days have passed we offered you a pension which you have refused it is now our turn to speak we require you to leave this city in twentyfour hours  the mans face was livid with anger he was of the fair type of frenchman with deepset eyes and a straight cruel mouth only partly concealed by his golden moustache just now notwithstanding the veneer of his too perfect clothes and civilised air the beast had leapt out his face was like the face of a snarling animal  i refuse he cried it is i who refuse i am here on my own affairs what they may be is no business of yours or of anyone elses that is my answer to you baron de grost whether you come to me for yourself or on behalf of the society to which i no longer belong that is my answerthat and the door he added pressing the bell if you will we fight if you are wise forget this visit as quickly as you can  peter took up his hat the manservant was already in the room  we shall probably meet again before your return monsieur guillot he remarked  guillot had recovered himself his smile was wicked but his bow perfection  to the fortunate hour monsieur le baron he replied  peter drove back to berkeley square and without a moments hesitation pressed the levers which set in work the whole underground machinery of the great power which he controlled thenceforward monsieur guillot was surrounded with a vague army of silent watchers they passed in and out even of his flat their motorcars were as fast as his in the streets their fancy in restaurants identical with his guillot moved through it all like a man wholly unconscious of espionage showing nothing of the murderous anger which burned in his blood the reports came to peter every hour although there was indeed nothing worth chronicling monsieur guillots visit to london would seem indeed to be a visit of gallantry he spent most of his time with mademoiselle louise the famous dancer he was prominent at the empire to watch her nightly performance they were a noticeable couple supping together at the milan afterwards peter smiled as he read the reports monsieur guillot was indeed a man of gallantry but he had the reputation of using these affairs to cloak his real purpose those who watched him watched only the more closely monsieur guillot who stood it very well at first unfortunately lost his temper he drove to berkeley square in the great motorcar which he had brought with him from paris and confronted peter  my friend he exclaimed though indeed the glitter in his eyes knew nothing of friendship it is intolerable this do you think that i do not see through these dummy waiters these obsequious shopmen these ladies who drop their eyes when i pass these commissionaires these wouldbe acquaintances i tell you that they irritate me this incompetent futile crowd you pit them against me bah you should know better when i choose to disappear i shall disappear and no one will follow me when i strike i shall strike and no one will discover what my will may be you are out of date dear baron with your thirdrate army of stupid spies you succeed in one thing onlyyou succeed in making me angry  it is at least an achievement that peter declared  perhaps monsieur guillot admitted fiercely yet mark now the result i defy you you and all of them look at your clock it is five minutes to seven it goes well that clock eh  it is the correct time peter said  then by midnight guillot continued shaking his fist in the others face i shall have done that thing which brought me to england and i shall have disappeared i shall have done it in spite of your watchers in spite of your spies in spite even of you monsieur le baron de grost there is my challenge voilà take it up if you will at midnight you shall hear me laugh i have the honour to wish you good night  peter opened the door with his own hands  this is excellent he declared you are now indeed the monsieur guillot of old almost you persuade me to take up your challenge  guillot laughed derisively  as you please he exclaimed by midnight tonight                                       the challenge of monsieur guillot was issued precisely at four minutes before seven on his departure peter spent the next halfhour studying certain notes and sending various telephone messages afterwards he changed his clothes at the usual time and sat down to a têteàtête dinner with his wife three times during the course of the meal he was summoned to the telephone and from each visit he returned more perplexed finally when the servants had left the room he took his chair round to his wifes side  violet he said you were asking me just now about the telephone you were quite right these were not ordinary messages which i have been receiving i am engaged in a little matter which i must confess perplexes me i want your adviceperhaps your help  violet smiled  i am quite ready she announced it is a long time since you gave me anything to do  you have heard of guillot  she reflected a moment  you mean the wonderful frenchman she asked the head of the criminal department of the double four  the man who was at its head when it existed peter replied the criminal department as you know has all been done away with the double four has now no more concern with those who break the law save in those few instances where great issues demand it  but monsieur guillot still exists  he not only exists peter answered but he is here in london a rebel and a defiant one do you know who came to see me the other morning  she shook her head  sir john dory peter continued he came here with a request he begged for my help guillot is here committed to some enterprise which no man can wholly fathom dory has enough to do with other things as you can imagine just now besides i think he recognises that monsieur guillot is rather a hard nut for the ordinary english detective to crack  and you she demanded breathlessly  i join forces with dory peter admitted sogrange agrees with me guillot was associated with the double four too long for us to have him make scandalous history either here or in paris  you have seen him  i have not only seen him peter said i have declared war against him  and he  guillot is defiant peter replied he has been here only this evening he mocks at me he swears that he will bring off this enterprise whatever it may be before midnight tonight and he has defied me to stop him  but you will she murmured softly  peter smiled the conviction in his wifes tone was a subtle compliment which he did not fail to appreciate  i have hopes he confessed and yet let me tell you this violet i have never been more puzzled ask yourself now what enterprise is there worthy of a man like guillot in which he could engage himself here in london between now and midnight any ordinary theft is beneath him the purloining of the crown jewels perhaps he might consider but i dont think that anything less in the way of robbery would bring him here he has his code and he is as vain as a peacock yet money is at the root of everything he does  how does he spend his time here violet asked  he has a handsome flat in shaftesbury avenue peter answered where he lives to all appearance the life of an idle man of fashion the whole of his spare time is spent with mademoiselle louise the danseuse at the empire you see it is halfpast eight now i have eleven men altogether at work and according to my last report he was dining with her in the grillroom at the milan they ordered their coffee just ten minutes ago and the car is waiting outside to take mademoiselle to the empire guillots box is engaged there as usual if he proposes to occupy it he is leaving himself a very narrow margin of time to carry out any enterprise worth speaking of  violet was thoughtful for several moments then she crossed the room took up a copy of an illustrated paper and brought it across to peter he smiled as he glanced at the picture to which she pointed and the few lines underneath  it has struck you too then he exclaimed good you have answered me exactly as i hoped somehow i scarcely trusted myself i have both cars waiting outside we may need them you wont mind coming to the empire with me  mind she laughed i only hope i may be in at the finish  if the finish peter remarked is of the nature which i anticipate i shall take particularly good care that you are not  the curtain was rising upon the first act of the ballet as they entered the musichall and were shown to the box which peter had engaged the house was fullcrowded in fact almost to excess they had scarcely taken their seats when a roar of applause announced the coming of mademoiselle louise she stood for a moment to receive her nightly ovation a slim beautiful creature looking out upon the great house with that faint bewitching smile at the corners of her lips which every photographer in europe had striven to reproduce then she moved away to the music an exquisite figure the personification of all that was alluring in her sex violet leaned forward to watch her movements as she plunged into the first dance peter was occupied looking round the house monsieur guillot was there sitting insolently forward in his box sleek and immaculate he even waved his hand and bowed as he met peters eye somehow or other his confidence had its effect peter began to feel vaguely troubled after all his plans were built upon a surmise it was so easy for him to be wrong no man would show his hand so openly who was not sure of the game then his face cleared a little in the adjoining box to guillots the figure of a solitary man was just visible a man who had leaned over to applaud louise but who was now sitting back in the shadows peter recognised him at once notwithstanding the obscurity this was so much to the good at any rate he took up his hat  for a quarter of an hour you will excuse me violet he said watch guillot if he leaves his place knock at the door of your box and one of my men who is outside will come to you at once he will know where to find me  peter hurried away pausing for a moment in the promenade to scribble a line or two at the back of one of his own cards presently he knocked at the door of the box adjoining guillots and was instantly admitted violet continued her watch she remained alone until the curtain fell upon the first act of the ballet a few minutes later peter returned she knew at once that things were going well he sank into a chair by her side  i have messages every five minutes he whispered in her ear and i am venturing upon a bold stroke there is still something about the affair though which i cannot understand you are absolutely sure that guillot has not moved  violet pointed with her programme across the house  there he sits she remarked he left his chair as the curtain went down but he could scarcely have gone out of the box for he was back within ten seconds  peter looked steadily across at the opposite box guillot was sitting a little farther back now as though he no longer courted observation something about his attitude puzzled the man who watched him with a quick movement he caught up the glasses which stood by his wifes side the curtain was going up for the second act and guillot had turned his head peter held the glasses only for a moment to his eyes and then glanced down at the stage  my god he muttered the mans a genius violet the small motor is coming for you  he was out of the box in a single step violet looked after him looked down upon the stage and across at guillots box it was hard to understand  the curtain had scarcely rung up upon the second act of the ballet when a young lady who met from all the loungers and even from the doorkeeper himself the most respectful attention issued from the stagedoor at the empire and stepped into the large motorcar which was waiting drawn up against the kerb the door was opened from inside and closed at once she held out her hands as yet ungloved to the man who sat back in the corner  at last she murmured and i thought that you had forsaken me it seemed indeed dear one that you had forsaken me  he took her hands and held them tightly but he answered only in a whisper he wore a sombre black cloak and a broadbrimmed hat a muffler concealed the lower part of his face she put her finger upon the electric light but he stopped her  i must not be recognised he said thickly forgive me louise if i seem strange at first but there is more in it than i can tell you no one must know that i am in london tonight when we reach this place to which you are taking me and we are really alone then we can talk i have so much to say  she looked at him doubtfully it was indeed a moment of indecision with her then she began to laugh softly  little one but you have changed she exclaimed compassionately after all why not i must not forget that things have gone so hardly with you it seems odd indeed to see you sitting there muffled up like an old man afraid to show yourself you know how foolish you are with your black cape and that queer hat you are so different from all the others if you seek to remain unrecognised why do you not dress as all the men do anyone who was suspicious would recognise you from your clothes  it is true he muttered i did not think of it  she leaned towards him  you will not even kiss me she murmured  not yet he answered  she made a little grimace  but you are cold  you do not understand he answered they are watching meeven tonight they are watching me oh if you only knew louise how i have longed for this hour that is to come  her vanity was assuaged she patted his hand but came no nearer  you are a foolish little one she said very foolish  it is not for you to say that he replied if i have been foolish were not you often the cause of my folly  again she laughed  oh la la it is always the same it is always you men who accuse for that presently i shall reprove you but nowas for now behold we have arrived  it is a crowded thoroughfare the man remarked nervously looking up and down shaftesbury avenue  stupid she cried stepping out i do not recognise you tonight little one even your voice is different follow me quickly across the pavement and up the stairs there is only one flight the flat i have borrowed is on the second floor i do not care very much that people should recognise me either under the circumstances there is nothing they love so much she added with a toss of the head as finding an excuse to have my picture in the paper  he followed her down the dim hall and up the broad flat stairs keeping always some distance behind on the first landing she drew a key from her pocket and opened a door it was the door of monsieur guillots sittingroom a round table in the middle was laid for supper one light alone and that heavily shaded was burning  oh la la she exclaimed how i hate this darkness wait till i can turn on the lights dear friend and then you must embrace me it is from outside i believe no do not follow i can find the switch for myself remain where you are i return instantly  she left him alone in the room closing the door softly in the passage she reeled for a moment and caught at her side she was very pale guillot coming swiftly up the steps frowned as he saw her  he is there he demanded harshly  he is there louise replied but indeed i am angry with myself see i am faint it is a terrible thing this which i have done he did me no harm that young man except that he was stupid and heavy and that i never loved him who could love him indeed but guillot  he passed on scarcely heeding her words but she clung to his arm  dear one she begged promise that you will not really hurt him promise me that or i will shriek out and call the people from the streets here you will not make an assassin of me promise  guillot turned suddenly towards her and there were strange things in his face he pointed down the stairs  go back louise he ordered back to your rooms for your own sake remember that you left the theatre too ill to finish your performance you have had plenty of time already to get home quick leave me to deal with this young man i tell you to go  she retreated down the stairs dumb her knees shaking still as though with fear guillot entered the room closing the door behind him even as he bowed to that dark figure standing in the corner his left hand shot forward the bolt  monsieur he said  what is the meaning of this the visitor interrupted haughtily i am expecting mademoiselle louise i did not understand that strangers had the right of entry into this room  guillot bowed low  monsieur he said once more it is a matter for my eternal regret that i am forced to intrude even for a moment upon an assignation so romantic but there is a little matter which must first be settled i have some friends here who have a thing to say to you  he walked softly with catlike tread along by the wall to where the thick curtains shut out the inner apartment he caught at the thick velvet dragged it back and the two rooms were suddenly flooded with light in the recently discovered one two stalwartlooking men in plain clothes but of very unmistakable appearance were standing waiting guillot staggered back they were strangers to him he was like a man who looks upon a nightmare his eyes protruded the words which he tried to utter failed him then with a swift nervous presentiment he turned quickly around towards the man who had been standing in the shadows here too the unexpected had happened it was peter baron de grost who threw his muffler and broadbrimmed hat upon the table  five minutes to eleven i believe monsieur guillot peter declared i win by an hour and five minutes  guillot said nothing for several seconds after all though he had great gifts he recovered alike his power of speech and his composure  these gentlemen he said pointing with his left hand towards the inner room i do not understand their presence in my apartments  peter shrugged his shoulders  they represent i am afraid the obvious end of things he explained you have given me a run for my money i confess a monsieur guillot who is remarkably like you still occupies your box at the empire and mademoiselle jeanne lemère the accomplished understudy of the lady who has just left us is sufficiently like the incomparable louise to escape perhaps detection for the first few minutes but you gave the game away a little my dear guillot when you allowed your quarry to come and gaze even from the shadows of his box at the woman he adored  where ishe guillot faltered  he is on his way back to his country home peter replied i think that he will be cured of his infatuation for mademoiselle the assassins whom you planted in that room are by this time in bow street the price which others beside you knew my dear guillot was placed upon that unfortunate young mans head will not pass this time into your pocket for the rest  the rest is of no consequence guillot interrupted bowing i admit that i am vanquished as for those gentlemen there he added waving his hand towards the two men who had taken a step forward i have a little oath which is sacred to me concerning them i take the liberty therefore to admit myself defeated monsieur le baron and to take my leave  no one was quick enough to interfere they had only a glimpse of him as he stood there with the revolver pressed to his temple an impression of a sharp report of guillot staggering back as the revolver slipped from his fingers on to the floor even his death cry was stifled they carried him away without any fuss and peter was just in time after all to see the finish of the second act of the ballet the sham monsieur guillot still smirked at the sham louise but the box by his side was empty  is it over violet asked breathlessly  it is over peter answered  it was after all an unrecorded tragedy in an obscure corner of the morning papers one learned the next day that a frenchman who had apparently come to the end of his means had committed suicide in a furnished flat in shaftesbury avenue two foreigners were deported without having been brought up for trial for being suspected persons a little languid interest was aroused at the inquest when one of the witnesses deposed to the deceased having been a famous french criminal nothing further transpired however and the readers of the halfpenny press for once were deprived of their sensation for the rest peter received with much satisfaction a remarkably handsome signet ring bearing some famous arms and a telegram from sogrange well done baron may the successful termination of your enterprise nerve you for the greater undertaking which is close at hand i leave for london by the night trainsogrange     chapter x  the thirteenth encounter   the marquis de sogrange arrived in berkeley square with the grey dawn of an october morning showing in his appearance and dress few enough signs of his night journey yet he had travelled without stopping from paris by fast motor car and the mail boat  they telephoned me from charing cross peter said that you could not possibly arrive until midday the clerk assured me that no train had yet reached calais  they had reason in what they told you sogrange remarked as he leaned back in a chair and sipped the coffee which had been waiting for him in the baron de grosts study the train itself never got more than a mile away from the gare du nord the enginedriver was shot through the head and the metals were torn from the way paris is within a year now of a second and more terrible revolution  you really believe this peter asked gravely  it is a certainty sogrange replied not i alone but many others can see this clearly everywhere the socialists have wormed themselves into places of trust they are to be met with in every rank of life under every form of disguise the postoffice strike has already shown us what deplorable disasters even a skirmish can bring about today the railway strike has paralysed france our country lies today absolutely at the mercy of any invader as it happens no one is for the moment prepared who can tell how it may be next time  this is bad news peter declared if this is really the position of affairs the matter is much more serious than the newspapers would have us believe  the newspapers sogrange muttered ignore what lies behind some of them i think are paid to do it as for the rest our press had always an ostrichlike tendency the frenchman of the café does not buy his journal to be made sad  you believe then peter asked that these strikes have some definite tendency  sogrange set down his cup and smiled bitterly in the early sunlight still a little cold and unloving peter could see that there was a change in the man he was no longer the debonair aristocrat of the racecourses and the boulevards the shadows under his eyes were deeper his cheeks more sunken he had lost something of the sprightliness of his bearing his attitude indeed was almost dejected he was like a man who sees into the future and finds there strange and gruesome things  i do more than believe that he declared i know it it has fallen to my lot to make a very definite discovery concerning them listen my friend for more than six months the government has been trying to discover the source of this stream of vile socialistic literature which has contaminated the french working classes the pamphlets have been distributed with devilish ingenuity amongst all national operatives the army and the navy the government has failed the double four has succeeded  you have really discovered their source peter exclaimed  without a doubt sogrange assented the government appealed to us first some months ago when i was in america for a time we had no success then a clue and the rest was easy the navy the army the postoffice employees the telegraph and telephone operators and the railway men have been the chief recipients of this incessant stream of foul literature today one cannot tell how much mischief has been actually done the strikes which have already occurred are only the mutterings of the coming storm but mark you wherever those pamphlets have gone trouble has followed what men may do the government is doing but all the time the poison is at work the seed has been sown two millions of money have been spent to corrupt that very class which should be the backbone of france through the fingers of one man has come this shower of gold one man alone has stood at the head of the great organisation which has disseminated this loathsome disease behind himwell we know  the man  it is fitting that you should ask that question sogrange replied the name of that man is bernadine count von hern  peter remained speechless there was something almost terrible in the slow preciseness with which sogrange had uttered the name of his enemy something unspeakably threatening in the cold glitter of his angry eyes  up to the present sogrange continued i have watchedsympathetically of course but with a certain amount of amusementthe duel between you and bernadine it has been against your country and your countrys welfare that most of his efforts have been directed which perhaps accounts for the equanimity with which i have been contented to remain a lookeron it is apparent my dear baron that in most of your encounters the honours have remained with you yet as it has chanced never once has bernadine been struck a real and crushing blow the time has come when this and more must happen it is no longer a matter of polite exchanges it is a duel à outrance  you mean peter began  i mean that bernadine must die sogrange declared  there was a brief silence outside the early morning street noises were increasing in volume as the great army of workers streaming towards the heart of the city from a hundred suburbs passed on to their tasks a streak of sunshine had found its way into the room lay across the carpet and touched sogranges still waxen features peter glanced half fearfully at his friend and visitor he himself was no coward no shrinker from the great issues he too had dealt in life and death yet there was something in the deliberate preciseness of sogranges words as he sat there only a few feet away which was unspeakably thrilling it was like a death sentence pronounced in all solemnity upon some shivering criminal there was something inevitable and tragical about the whole affair a pronouncement had been made from which there was no appeal bernadine was to die  isnt this a little exceeding the usual exercise of our powers peter asked slowly  no such occasion as this has ever yet arisen sogrange reminded him bernadine has fled to this country with barely an hour to spare his offence is extraditable by a law of the last century which has never been repealed he is guilty of treason against the republic of france yet they do not want him back they do not want a trial i have papers upon my person which if i took them into an english court would procure for me a warrant for bernadines arrest it is not this we desire bernadine must die no fate could be too terrible for a man who has striven to corrupt the soul of a nation it is not war this it is not honest conspiracy is it war i ask you to seek to poison the drinking water of an enemy to send stalking into their midst some loathsome disease such things belong to the ages of barbarity bernadine has striven to revive them and bernadine shall die  it is justice peter admitted  the question remains sogrange continued by whose handyours or mine  peter started uneasily  is that necessary he asked  i fear that it is sogrange replied we had a brief meeting of the executive council last night and it was decided for certain reasons to entrust this task into no other hands you will smile when i tell you that these accursed pamphlets have found their way into the possession of many of the rank and file of our own order there is a marked disinclination on the part of those who have been our slaves to accept orders from anyone espionage we can still commandthe best perhaps in europebecause here we use a different class of material but of those underneath we are for the moment doubtful paris is all in a ferment under its outward seemliness a million throats are ready to take up the brazen cry of revolution one trusts nobody one fears all the time  you or i peter repeated slowly it will not be sufficient then that we find bernadine and deliver him over to your countrys laws  it will not be sufficient sogrange answered sternly from those he may escape for him there must be no escape  sogrange peter said speaking in a low tone i have never yet killed a human being  nor i sogrange admitted nor have i yet set my heel upon its head and stamped the life from a rat upon the pavement but one lives and one moves on bernadine is the enemy of your country and mine he makes war after the fashion of vermin no ordinary cutthroat would succeed against him it must be you or i  how shall we decide peter asked  the spin of a coin sogrange replied it is best that way it is best too done quickly  peter produced a sovereign from his pocket and balanced it on the palm of his hand  let it be understood sogrange continued that this is a dual undertaking we toss only for the final honourfor the last stroke if the choice falls upon me i shall count upon you to help me to the end if it falls upon you i shall be at your right hand even when you strike the blow  it is agreed peter said see it is for you to call  he threw the coin high into the air  i call heads sogrange decided  it fell upon the table peter covered it with his hand and then slowly withdrew the fingers a little shiver ran through his veins the harmless head that looked up at him was like the figure of death it was for him to strike the blow  where is bernadine now he asked  get me a morning paper and i will tell you sogrange declared rising he was in the train which was stopped outside the gare du nord on his way to england what became of the passengers i have not heard i knew what was likely to happen and i left an hour before in a 100 hp charron  peter rang the bell and ordered the servant who answered it to procure the daily telegraph as soon as it arrived he spread it open upon the table and sogrange looked over his shoulder these are the headings which they saw in large black characters                       renewed riots in paris                    the gare du nord in flames              terrible accident to the calaisdouvres                             express                           many deaths  peters forefinger travelled down the page swiftly it paused at the following paragraph  the 855 train from the gare du nord carrying many passengers for london after being detained within a mile of paris for over an hour owing to the murder of the enginedriver made an attempt last night to proceed with terrible results near chantilly whilst travelling at over fifty miles an hour the points were tampered with and the express dashed into a goods train laden with minerals very few particulars are yet to hand but the express was completely wrecked and many lives have been lost amongst the dead are the following  one by one peter read out the names then he stopped short a little exclamation broke from sogranges lips the thirteenth name upon that list of dead was the name of bernadine count von hern  bernadine peter faltered bernadine is dead  killed by the strikers sogrange echoed it is a just thing this  the two men looked down at the paper and then up at each other a strange silence seemed to have found its way into the room the shadow of death lay between them peter touched his forehead and found it wet  it is a just thing indeed he repeated but justice and death are alike terrible  late in the afternoon of the same day a motor car splashed with mud drew up before the door of the house in berkeley square sogrange who was standing talking to peter before the library window suddenly broke off in the middle of a sentence he stepped back into the room and gripped his friends shoulder  it is the baroness he exclaimed quickly what does she want here  the baroness who peter demanded  the baroness von ratten you must have heard of hershe is the friend of bernadine  the two men had been out to lunch at the ritz with violet and had walked across the park home sogrange had been drawing on his gloves in the act of starting out for a call at the embassy  does your wife know this woman he asked  peter shook his head  i think not he replied we shall know in a minute  then she has come to see you sogrange continued what does it mean i wonder  peter shrugged his shoulders  there was a knock at the door and his servant entered bearing a card  this lady would like to see you sir on important business he said  you can show her in here peter directed  there was a very short delay the two men had no time to exchange a word they heard the rustling of a womans gown and immediately afterward the perfume of violets seemed to fill the room  the baroness von ratten the butler announced  the door closed behind her the servant had disappeared peter advanced to meet his guest she was a little above medium height very slim with extraordinarily fair hair colourless face and strange eyes she was not strictly beautiful and yet there was no man upon whom her presence was without its effect her voice was like her movements slow and with a grace of its own  you do not mind that i have come to see you she asked raising her eyes to peters i believe before i go that you will think terrible things of me but you must not begin before i have told you my errand it has been a great struggle with me before i made up my mind to come here  wont you sit down baroness peter invited  she saw sogrange and hesitated  you are not alone she said softly i wish to speak with you alone  permit me to present to you the marquis de sogrange peter begged he is my oldest friend baroness i think that whatever you might have to say to me you might very well say before him  it isof a private nature she murmured  the marquis and i have no secrets peter declared either political or private  she sat down and motioned peter to take a place by her side upon the sofa  you will forgive me if i am a little incoherent she implored today i have had a shock you too have read the news you must know that the count von hern is deadkilled in the railway accident last night  we read it in the daily telegraph peter replied  it is in all the papers she continued you know that he was a very dear friend of mine  i have heard so peter admitted  yet there was one subject she insisted earnestly upon which we never agreed he hated england i have always loved it england was kind to me when my own country drove me out i have always felt grateful it has been a sorrow to me that in so many of his schemes in so much of his work bernadine should consider his own country at the expense of yours  sogrange drew a little nearer it began to be interesting this  i heard the news early this morning by telegram she went on for a long time i was prostrate then early this afternoon i began to thinkone must always think bernadine was a dear friend but things between us lately have been different a little strained was it his fault or minewho can say does one tire with the years i wonder i wonder  her eyes were lifted to his and peter was conscious of the fact that she wished him to know that they were beautiful she looked slowly away again  this afternoon as i sat alone she proceeded i remembered that in my keeping were many boxes of papers and many letters which have recently arrived all belonging to bernadine i reflected that there were certainly some who were in his confidence and that very soon they would come from his country and take them all away and then i remembered what i owed to england and how opposed i always was to bernadines schemes and i thought that the best thing i could do to show my gratitude would be to place his papers all in the hands of some englishman so that they might do no more harm to the country which has been kind to me so i came to you  again her eyes were lifted to his and peter was very sure indeed that they were wonderfully beautiful he began to realise the fascination of this woman of whom he had heard so much her very absence of colouring was a charm  you mean that you have brought me these papers he asked  she shook her head slowly  no she said i could not do that there were too many of themthey are too heavy and there are piles of pamphletsrevolutionary pamphlets i am afraidall in french which i do not understand no i could not bring them to you but i ordered my motorcar and i drove up here to tell you that if you like to come down to the house in the country where i have been livingto which bernadine was to have come tonightyes and bring your friend too if you willyou shall look through them before anyone else can arrive  you are very kind peter murmured tell me where it is that you live  it is beyond hitchin she told him up the great north road i tell you at once it is a horrible house in a horrible lonely spot within a day or two i shall leave it myself for ever i hate itit gets on my nerves i dream of all the terrible things which perhaps have taken place there who can tell it was bernadines long before i came to england  when are we to come peter asked  you must come back with me now at once the baroness insisted i cannot tell how soon someone in his confidence may arrive  i will order my car peter declared  she laid her hand upon his arm  do you mind coming in mine she begged it is of no consequence if you object but every servant in bernadines house is german and a spy there are no women except my own maid your car is likely enough known to them and there might be trouble if you will come with me now you and your friend if you like i will send you to the station tonight in time to catch the train home i feel that i must have this thing off my mind you will come yes  peter rang the bell and ordered his coat  without a doubt he answered may we not offer you some tea first  she shook her head  today i cannot think of eating or drinking she replied bernadine and i were no longer what we had been but the shock of his death seems none the less terrible i feel like a traitor to him for coming here yet i believe that i am doing what is right she added softly  if you will excuse me for one moment peter said while i take leave of my wife i will rejoin you presently  peter was absent for only a few minutes sogrange and the baroness exchanged the merest commonplaces as they all passed down the hall sogrange lingered behind  if you will take the baroness out to the car he suggested i will telephone to the embassy and tell them not to expect me  peter offered his arm to his companion she seemed indeed to need support her fingers clutched at his coatsleeve as they passed on to the pavement  i am so glad to be no longer quite alone she whispered almost i wish that your friend were not coming i know that bernadine and you were enemies but then you were enemies not personally but politically after all it is you who stand for the things which have become so dear to me  it is true that bernadine and i were bitter antagonists peter admitted gravely death however ends all that i wish him no further harm  she sighed  as for me she said i am growing used to being friendless i was friendless before bernadine came and latterly we have been nothing to one another now i suppose i shall know what it is to be an outcast once more did you ever hear my history i wonder  peter shook his head  never baroness he replied i understood i believe that your marriage  my husband divorced me she confessed simply he was quite within his rights he was impossible i was very young and very sentimental they say that englishwomen are cold she added perhaps that is so people think that i look cold do you  sogrange suddenly opened the door of the car in which they were already seated she leaned back and half closed her eyes  it is rather a long ride she said and i am worn out i hope you will not mind but for myself i cannot talk when motoring smoke if it pleases you  might one inquire as to our exact destination sogrange asked  we go beyond hitchin up the great north road she told him again the house is called the high house it stands in the middle of a heath and i think it is the loneliest and most miserable place that was ever built i hate it and am frightened in it for some reason or other it suited bernadine but that is all over now  the little party of three lapsed into silence the car driven carefully enough through the busy streets gradually increased its pace as they drew clear of the suburbs peter leaned back in his place thinking bernadine was dead nothing else would have convinced him so utterly of the fact as that simple sentence in the daily telegraph which had been followed up by a confirmation and a brief obituary notice in all the evening papers curiously enough the fact seemed to have drawn a certain spice out of even this adventure to point indeed to a certain monotony in the future their present enterprise important though it might turn out to be was nothing to be proud of a woman greedy for gold was selling her lovers secrets before the breath was out of his body peter turned in his cushioned seat to look at her without doubt she was beautiful to one who understood beautiful in a strange colourless feline fashion the beauty of soft limbs soft movements a caressing voice with always the promise beyond of more than the actual words her eyes now were closed her face was a little weary did she really rest peter wondered he watched the rising and falling of her bosom the quivering now and then of her eyelids she had indeed the appearance of a woman who had suffered  the car rushed on into the darkness behind them lay that restless phantasmagoria of lights streaming to the sky in front blank space peter through halfclosed eyes watched the woman by his side from the moment of her entrance into his library he had summed her up in his mind with a single word she was beyond a doubt an adventuress no woman could have proposed the things which she had proposed who was not of that ilk yet for that reason it behoved them to have a care in their dealings with her at her instigation they had set out upon this adventure which might well turn out according to any fashion that she chose yet without bernadine what could she do she was not the woman to carry on the work which he had left behind for the love of him her words had been frank her action shameful but natural bernadine was dead and she had realised quickly enough the best market for his secrets in a few days time his friends would have come and she would have received nothing he told himself that he was foolish to doubt her there was not a flaw in the sequence of events no possible reason for the suspicions which yet lingered at the back of his brain intrigue it was certain was to her as the breath of her body he was perfectly willing to believe that the death of bernadine would have affected her little more than the sweeping aside of a fly his very common sense bade him accept her story  by degrees he became drowsy suddenly he was startled into a very wideawake state through halfclosed eyes he had seen sogrange draw a sheet of paper from his pocket a gold pencil from his chain and commence to write in the middle of a sentence his eyes were abruptly lifted he was looking at the baroness peter too turned his head he also looked at the baroness without a doubt she had been watching both of them sogranges pencil continued its task only he traced no more characters instead he seemed to be sketching a face which presently he tore carefully up into small pieces and destroyed he did not even glance towards peter but peter understood very well what had happened he had been about to send him a message but had found the baroness watching peter was fully awake now his faint sense of suspicion had deepened into a positive foreboding he had a reckless desire to stop the car to descend upon the road and let the secrets of bernadine go where they would then his natural love of adventure blazed up once more his moment of weakness had passed the thrill was in his blood his nerves were tightened he was ready for what might come seemingly still half asleep yet indeed with every sense of intuition and observation keenly alert  sogrange leaned over from his place  it is a lonely country this into which we are coming madame he remarked  she shrugged her shoulders  indeed it is not so lonely here as you will think it when we arrive at our destination she replied there are houses here but they are hidden by the trees there are no houses near us  she rubbed the pane with her hand  we are i believe very nearly there she said this is the nearest village afterwards we just climb a hill and about half a mile along the top of it is the high house  and the name of the village sogrange inquired  st marys she told him in the summer people call it beautiful around here to me it is the most melancholy spot i ever saw there is so much rain and one hears the drip drip in the trees all the day long alone i could not bear it tomorrow or the next day i shall pack up my belongings and come to london i am unfortunately she added with a little sigh very very poor but it is my hope that you may find the papers of which i have spoken to you valuable  sogrange smiled faintly peter and he could scarcely forbear to exchange a single glance the womans candour was almost brutal  she read their thoughts  we ascend the hill she continued we draw now very near to the end of our journey there is still one thing i would say to you do not think too badly of me for what i am about to do to bernadine whilst he lived i was faithful many a time i could have told you of his plans and demanded a great sum of money and you would have given it me willingly but my lips were sealed because in a way i loved him while he lived i gave him what i owed today he is dead and whatever i do it cannot concern him any more today i am a free woman and i take the side i choose  sogrange smiled suavely  dear madame he replied what you have proposed to us is after all quite natural and very gracious if one has a fear at all about the matter it is as to the importance of these documents you speak of bernadine i know has dealt in great affairs but he was a diplomat by instinct experienced and calculating one does not keep incriminating papers  she leaned a little forward the car had swung round a corner now and was making its way up an avenue as dark as pitch  the wisest of us monsieur le marquis she whispered reckon sometimes without that one element of sudden death what should you say i wonder to a list of agents in france pledged to circulate in certain places literature of an infamous sort what should you say monsieur to a copy of a secret report of your late manoeuvres franked with the name of one of your own staff officers what should you say she went on to a list of socialist deputies with amounts against their names amounts paid in hard cash are these of no importance to you  madame sogrange answered simply for such information if it were genuine it would be hard to mention a price which we should not be prepared to pay  the car came to a sudden standstill the first impression of the two men was that the baroness had exaggerated the loneliness and desolation of the place there was nothing mysterious or forbidding about the plain brown stone house before which they had stopped the windows were streaming with light the hall door already thrown open disclosed a very comfortable hall brilliantly illuminated a manservant assisted his mistress to alight another ushered them in in the background were other servants the baroness glanced at the clock  about dinner carl she asked  it waits for madame the man answered  she nodded  take care of these gentlemen till i descend she ordered you will not mind she added turning pleadingly to sogrange today i have eaten nothing i am faint with hunger afterwards it will be a matter of but half an hour you can be in london again by ten oclock  as you will madame sogrange replied we are greatly indebted to you for your hospitality but for costume you understand that we are as we are  it is perfectly understood she assured him for myself i rejoin you in ten minutes a loose gown that is all  sogrange and peter were shown into a modern bathroom by a servant who was so anxious to wait upon them that they had difficulty in sending him away as soon as he was gone and the door closed behind him peter put his foot against it and turned the key  you were going to write something to me in the car  sogrange nodded  there was a moment he admitted when i had a suspicion it has passed this woman is no roman she sells the secrets of bernadine as she would sell herself nevertheless it is well always to be prepared there were probably others beside bernadine who had the entrée here  the only suspicious circumstance which i have noticed peter remarked is the number of menservants i have seen five already  it is only fair to remember sogrange reminded him that the baroness herself told us that there were no other save menservants here and that they were all spies without a master i cannot see that they are dangerous one needs however to watch all the time  if you see anything suspicious peter said tap the table with your forefinger personally i will admit that i have had my doubts of the baroness but on the whole i have come to the conclusion that they were groundless she is not the sort of woman to take up a vendetta especially an unprofitable one  she is an exceedingly dangerous person for an impressionable man like myself sogrange remarked arranging his tie  the butler fetched them in a very few moments and showed them into a pleasantly furnished library where he mixed cocktails for them from a collection of bottles upon the sideboard he was quite friendly and inclined to be loquacious although he spoke with a slight foreign accent the house belonged to an english gentleman from whom the honoured count had taken it furnished they were two miles from a station and a mile from the village it was a lonely part but there were always people coming or going with ones work one scarcely noticed it he was gratified that the gentlemen found his cocktails so excellent perhaps he might be permitted the high honour of mixing them another it was a day this of deep sadness and gloom one needed to drink something indeed to forget the terrible thing which had happened the count had been a good master a little impatient sometimes but kindhearted the news had been a shock to them all  then before they had expected her the baroness reappeared she wore a wonderful grey gown which seemed to be made in a single piece a gown which fitted her tightly and yet gave her the curious appearance of a woman walking without the burden of clothes sogrange parisian to the fingertips watched her with admiring approval she laid her fingers upon his arm although it was towards peter that her eyes travelled  will you take me in marquis she begged it is the only formality we will allow ourselves  they entered a long low diningroom panelled with oak and with the family portraits of the owner of the house still left upon the walls dinner was served upon a round table and was laid for four there was a profusion of silver very beautiful glass and a wonderful cluster of orchids the marquis as he handed his hostess to her chair glanced towards the vacant place  it is for my companion an austrian lady she explained tonight however i think that she will not come she was a distant connection of bernadines and she is much upset we leave her place and see you will sit on my other side baron  the fingers which touched peters arm brushed his hand and were withdrawn as though with reluctance she sank into her chair with a little sigh  it is charming of you two this she declared softly you help me through this night of solitude and sadness what i should do if i were alone i cannot tell you must drink with me a toast if you will will you make it to our better acquaintance  no soup had been offered and champagne was served with the hors doeuvres peter raised his glass and looked into the eyes of the woman who was leaning so closely towards him that her soft breath fell upon his cheek she whispered something in his ear for a moment perhaps he was carried away but for a moment only then sogranges voice and the beat of his forefinger upon the table stiffened him into sudden alertness they heard a motorcar draw up outside  who can it be the baroness exclaimed setting her glass down abruptly  it is perhaps the other guest who arrives sogrange remarked  they all three listened peter and sogrange with their glasses still suspended in the air  the other guest the baroness repeated madame von estenier is upstairs lying down i cannot tell who this may be  her lips were parted the lines of her forehead had suddenly appeared her eyes were turned toward the door hard and bright then the glass which she had nervously picked up again and was holding between her fingers fell on to the tablecloth with a little crash and the yellow wine ran bubbling on to her plate her scream echoed to the roof and rang through the room it was bernadine who stood there in the doorway bernadine in a long travelling ulster and the air of one newly arrived from a journey they all three looked at him but there was not one who spoke the baroness after her one wild cry was dumb  i am indeed fortunate bernadine said you have as yet i see scarcely commenced you probably expected me i am charmed to find so agreeable a party awaiting my arrival  he divested himself of his ulster and threw it across the arm of the butler who stood behind him  come he continued for a man who has just been killed in a railway accident i find myself with an appetite a glass of wine carl i do not know what that toast was the drinking of which my coming interrupted but let us all drink it together aimée my love to you dear let me congratulate you upon the fortitude and courage with which you have ignored those lying reports of my death i had fears that i might find you alone in a darkened room with tearstained eyes and salvolatile by your side this is infinitely better gentlemen you are welcome  sogrange lifted his glass and bowed courteously peter followed suit  really sogrange murmured the press nowadays becomes more unreliable every day it is apparent my dear von hern that this account of your death was to say the least of it exaggerated  peter said nothing his eyes were fixed upon the baroness she sat in her chair quite motionless but her face had become like the face of some graven image she looked at bernadine but her eyes said nothing every glint of expression seemed to have left her features since that one wild shriek she had remained voiceless encompassed by danger though he knew that they now must be peter found himself possessed by one thought and one thought only was this a trap into which they had fallen or was the woman too deceived  you bring later news from paris than i myself sogrange proceeded helping himself to one of the dishes which a footman was passing round how did you reach the coast the evening papers stated distinctly that since the accident no attempt had been made to run trains  by motorcar from chantilly bernadine replied i had the misfortune to lose my servant who was wearing my coat and who i gather from the newspaper reports was mistaken for me i myself was unhurt i hired a motorcar and drove to boulognenot the best of journeys let me tell you for we broke down three times there was no steamer there but i hired a fishing boat which brought me across the channel in something under eight hours from the coast i motored direct here i was so anxious he added raising his eyes to see how my dear friendmy dear aiméewas bearing the terrible news  she fluttered for a moment like a bird in a trap peter drew a little sigh of relief his selfrespect was reinstated he had decided that she was innocent upon them at least would not fall the ignominy of having been led into the simplest of traps by this whitefaced delilah the butler had brought her another glass which she raised to her lips she drained its contents but the ghastliness of her appearance remained unchanged peter watching her knew the signs she was sick with terror  the conditions throughout france are indeed awful sogrange remarked they say too that this railway strike is only the beginning of worse things  bernadine smiled  your country my dear marquis he said is on its last legs no one knows better than i that it is at the present moment honeycombed with sedition and anarchical impulses the people are rotten for years the whole tone of france has been decadent its fall must even now be close at hand  you take a gloomy view of my countrys future sogrange declared  why should one refuse to face facts bernadine replied one does not often talk so frankly but we three are met together this evening under somewhat peculiar circumstances the days of the glory of france are past england has laid out her neck for the yoke of the conqueror both are doomed to fall both are ripe for the great humiliation you two gentlemen whom i have the honour to receive as my guests he concluded filling his glass and bowing towards them in your present unfortunate predicament represent precisely the position of your two countries  ave cæsar peter muttered grimly raising his glass to his lips  bernadine accepted the challenge  it is not i alas who may call myself cæsar he replied although it is certainly you who are about to die  sogrange turned to the man who stood behind his chair  if i might trouble you for a little dry toast he inquired a modern but very uncomfortable ailment he added with a sigh ones digestion must march with the years i suppose  bernadine smiled  your toast you shall have with pleasure marquis he said but as for your indigestion do not let that trouble you any longer i think that i can promise you immunity from that annoying complaint for the rest of your life  you are doing your best peter declared leaning back in his chair to take away my appetite  bernadine looked searchingly from one to the other of his two guests  yes he admitted you are brave men i do not know why i should ever have doubted it your pose is excellent i have no wish however to see you buoyed up by a baseless optimism a somewhat remarkable chance has delivered you into my hands you are my prisoners you peter baron de grost i have hated all my days you have stood between me and the achievement of some of my most dearly cherished tasks always i have said to myself that the day of reckoning must come it has arrived as for you marquis de sogrange if my personal feelings towards you are less violent you still represent the things absolutely inimical to me and my interests the departure of you two men was the one thing necessary for the successful completion of certain tasks which i have in hand at the present moment  peter pushed away his plate  you have succeeded in destroying my appetite count he declared now that you have gone so far in expounding your amiable resolutions towards us perhaps you will go a little farther and explain exactly how in this eminently respectable house situated i understand in an eminently respectable neighbourhood with a police station within a mile and a dozen or so witnesses as to our present whereabouts you intend to expedite our removal  bernadine pointed towards the woman who sat facing him  ask the baroness how these things are arranged  they turned towards her she fell back in her chair with a little gasp she had fainted bernadine shrugged his shoulders the butler and one of the footmen who during the whole of the conversation had stolidly proceeded with their duties in obedience to a gesture from their master took her up in their arms and carried her from the room  the fear has come to her too bernadine murmured softly it may come to you my brave friends before morning  it is possible peter answered his hand stealing round to his hip pocket but in the meantime what is to prevent  the hip pocket was empty peters sentence ended abruptly bernadine mocked him  to prevent your shooting me in cold blood i suppose he remarked nothing except that my servants are too clever no one save myself is allowed to remain under this roof with arms in their possession your pocket was probably picked before you had been in the place five minutes no my dear baron let me assure you that escape will not be so easy you were always just a little inclined to be led away by the fair sex the best men in the world you know have shared that failing and the baroness alone and unprotected had her attractions eh  then something happened to peter which had happened to him barely a dozen times in his life he lost his temper and lost it rather badly without an instants hesitation he caught up the decanter which stood by his side and flung it in his hosts face bernadine only partly avoided it by thrusting out his arms the neck caught his forehead and the blood came streaming over his tie and collar peter had followed the decanter with a sudden spring his fingers were upon bernadines throat and he thrust his head back sogrange sprang to the door to lock it but he was too late the room seemed full of menservants peter was dragged away still struggling fiercely  tie them up bernadine gasped swaying in his chair tie them up do you hear carl give me brandy  he swallowed half a wineglassful of the raw spirit his eyes were red with fury  take them to the gunroom he ordered three of you to each of them mind ill shoot the man who lets either escape  but peter and sogrange were both of them too wise to expend any more of their strength in a useless struggle they suffered themselves to be conducted without resistance across the white stone hall down a long passage and into a room at the end the window and fireplace of which were both blocked up the floor was of red flags and the walls whitewashed the only furniture was a couple of kitchen chairs and a long table the door was of stout oak and fitted with a double lock the sole outlet so far as they could see was a small round hole at the top of the roof the door was locked behind them they were alone  the odd trick to bernadine peter exclaimed hoarsely wiping a spot of blood from his forehead my dear marquis i scarcely know how to apologise it is not often that i lose my temper so completely  the matter seems to be of very little consequence sogrange answered this was probably our intended destination in any case seems to be rather an unfortunate expedition of ours i am afraid  one cannot reckon upon men coming back from the dead peter declared it isnt often that you find every morning and every evening paper mistaken as for the woman i believe in her she honestly meant to sell us those papers of bernadines i believe that she too will have to face a day of reckoning  sogrange strolled around the room subjecting it everywhere to a close scrutiny the result was hopeless there was no method of escape save through the door  there is certainly something strange about this apartment peter remarked it is to say the least of it unusual to have windows in the roof and a door of such proportions all the same i think that those threats of bernadines were a little strained one cannot get rid of ones enemies nowadays in the oldfashioned melodramatic way bernadine must know quite well that you and i are not the sort of men to walk into a trap of anyones setting just as i am quite sure that he is not the man to risk even a scandal by breaking the law openly  you interest me sogrange said i begin to suspect that you too have made some plans  but naturally peter replied once before bernadine set a trap for me and he nearly had a chance of sending me for a swim in the thames since then one takes precautions as a matter of course we were followed down here and by this time i should imagine that the alarm is given if all was well i was to have telephoned an hour ago  you are really sogrange declared quite an agreeable companion my dear baron you think of everything  the door was suddenly opened bernadine stood upon the threshold and behind him several of the servants  you will oblige me by stepping back into the study my friends he ordered  with great pleasure sogrange answered with alacrity we have no fancy for this room i can assure you  once more they crossed the stone hall and entered the room into which they had first been shown on the threshold peter stopped short and listened it seemed to him that from somewhere upstairs he could hear the sound of a womans sobs he turned to bernadine  the baroness is not unwell i trust he asked  the baroness is as well as she is likely to be for some time bernadine replied grimly  they were all in the study now upon a table stood a telephone instrument bernadine drew a small revolver from his pocket  baron de grost he said i find that you are not quite such a fool as i thought you some one is ringing up for you on the telephone you will reply that you are well and safe and that you will be home as soon as your business here is finished your wife is at the other end if you breathe a single word to her of your approaching end she shall hear through the telephone the sound of the revolver shot that sends you to hell  dear me peter protested i find this most unpleasant if youll excuse me i dont think ill answer the call at all  you will answer it as i have directed bernadine insisted only remember this if you speak a single illadvised word the end will be as i have said  peter picked up the receiver and held it to his ear  who is there he asked  it was violet whose voice he heard he listened for a moment to her anxious flood of questions  there is not the slightest cause to be alarmed dear he said yes i am down at the high house near st marys bernadine is here it seems that those reports of his death were absolutely unfounded danger unprotected why my dear violet you know how careful i always am simply because bernadine used once to live here and because the baroness was his friend i spoke to sir john dory over the telephone before we left and an escort of half a dozen police followed us they are about the place now i have no doubt but their presence is quite unnecessary i shall be home before long dear yes perhaps it would be as well to send the car down anyone will direct him to the housethe high house st marys remember goodbye  peter replaced the receiver and turned slowly round bernadine was smiling  you did well to reassure your wife even though it was a pack of lies you told her he remarked  peter shrugged his shoulders contemptuously  my dear bernadine he said up till now i have tried to take you seriously you are really passing the limit i must positively ask you to reflect a little do men who live the life that you and i live trust anyone am i is the marquis de sogrange here after a lifetime of experience likely to leave the safety of our homes in company with a lady of whom we knew nothing except that she was your companion without precautions i do you the justice to believe you are a person of common sense i know that we are as safe in this house as we should be in our own war cannot be made in this fashion in an overpoliced country like england  do not be too sure bernadine replied there are secrets about this house which have not yet been disclosed to you there are means my dear baron of transporting you into a world where you are likely to do much less harm than here means ready at hand which would leave no more trace behind than those crumbling ashes can tell of the coalmine from which they came  peter preserved his attitude of bland incredulity  listen he said drawing a whistle from his pocket it is just possible that you are in earnest i will bet you then if you like a hundred pounds that if i blow this whistle you will either have to open your door within five minutes or find your house invaded by the police  no one spoke for several moments the veins were standing out upon bernadines forehead  we have had enough of this folly he cried if you refuse to realise your position so much the worse for you blow your whistle if you will i am content  peter waited for no second bidding he raised the whistle to his lips and blew it loudly and persistently again there was silence bernadine mocked him  try once more dear baron he advised your friends are perhaps a little hard of hearing try once more and when you have finished you and i and the marquis de sogrange will find our way once more to the gunroom and conclude that trifling matter of business which brought you here  again peter blew his whistle and again the silence was broken only by bernadines laugh suddenly however that laugh was checked everyone had turned toward the door listening a bell was ringing throughout the house  it is the front door one of the servants exclaimed  no one moved as though to put the matter beyond doubt there was a steady knocking to be heard from the same direction  it is a telegram or some late caller bernadine declared hoarsely answer it carl if anyone would speak with the baroness she is indisposed and unable to receive if anyone desires me i am here  the man left the room they heard him withdraw the chain from the door bernadine wiped the sweat from his forehead as he listened he still gripped the revolver in his hand peter had changed his position a little and was standing now behind a highbacked chair they heard the door creak open a voice outside and presently the tramp of heavy footsteps peter nodded understandingly  it is exactly as i told you he said you were wise not to bet my friend  again the tramp of feet in the hall there was something unmistakable about the sound something final and terrifying bernadine saw his triumph slipping away once more this man who had defied him so persistently was to taste the sweets of victory with a roar of fury he sprang across the room he fired his revolver twice before sogrange with a terrible blow knocked his arm upwards and sent the weapon spinning to the ceiling peter struck his assailant in the mouth but the blow seemed scarcely to check him they rolled on the floor together their arms around one anothers necks it was an affair that but of a moment peter as lithe as a cat was on his feet again almost at once with a torn collar and an ugly mark on his face there were strangers in the room now and the servants had mostly slipped away during the confusion it was sir john dory himself who locked the door bernadine struggled slowly to his feet he was face to face with half a dozen policeconstables in plain clothes  you have a charge against this man baron the police commissioner asked  peter shook his head  the quarrel between us he replied is not for the police courts although i will confess sir john that your intervention was opportune  i on the other hand sogrange put in demand the arrest of the count von hern and the seizure of all papers in this house i am the bearer of an autograph letter from the president of france in connection with this matter the count von hern has committed extraditable offences against my country i am prepared to swear an information to that effect  the police commissioner turned to peter  your friends name he demanded  the marquis de sogrange peter told him  he is a person of authority  to my certain knowledge peter replied he has the implicit confidence of the french government  sir john dory made a sign in another moment bernadine would have been arrested it seemed indeed as though nothing could save him now from this crowning humiliation he himself white and furious was at a loss how to deal with an unexpected situation suddenly a thing happened stranger than any one of them there had ever known or dreamed of so strange that even men such as peter sogrange and dory whose nerves were of iron faced one another doubting and amazed the floor beneath them rocked and billowed like the waves of a canvas sea the windows were filled with flashes of red light a great fissure parted the wall the pictures and bookcases came crashing down beneath a shower of masonry it was the affair of a second above them shone the stars and around them a noise like thunder bernadine who alone understood was the first to recover himself he stood in the midst of them his hands above his head laughing as he looked around at the strange stormlaughing like a madman  the wonderful carl he cried oh matchless servant arrest me now if you will you dogs of the police rout out my secrets dear baron de grost tuck them under your arm and hurry to downing street this is the hospitality of the high house my friends it loves you so well that only your ashes shall leave it  his mouth was open for another sentence when he was struck a whole pillar of marble from one of the rooms above came crashing through and buried him underneath a falling shower of masonry peter escaped by a few inches those who were left unhurt sprang through the yawning wall out into the garden sir john sogrange peter and three of the menone limping badly came to a standstill in the middle of the lawn before them the house was crumbling like a pack of cards and louder even than the thunder of the falling structures was the roar of the red flames  the baroness peter cried and took one leap forward  i am here she sobbed running to them from out of the shadows i have lost everythingmy jewels my clothes all except what i have on they gave me but a moments warning  is there anyone else in the house peter demanded  no one but you who were in that room she answered  your companion  she shook her head  there was no companion she faltered i thought it sounded better to speak of her i had her place laid at table but she never even existed  peter tore off his coat  there are the others in the room he exclaimed we must go back  sogrange caught him by the shoulder and pointed to a shadowy group some distance away  we are all out but bernadine he said for him there is no hope quick  they sprang back only just in time the outside wall of the house fell with a terrible crash the room which they had quitted was now blotted out of existence it was not long before from right and left in all directions along the country road came the flashing of lights and little knots of hurrying people  it is the end peter muttered yesterday i should have regretted the passing of a brave enemy today i hail with joy the death of a brute  the baroness who had been sitting upon a garden seat sobbing came softly up to them she laid her fingers upon peters arm imploringly  you will not leave me friendless she begged the papers i promised you are destroyed but many of his secrets are here  she tapped her forehead  madame peter answered i have no wish to know them years ago i swore that the passing of bernadine should mark my own retirement from the world in which we both lived i shall keep my word tonight bernadine is dead tonight sogrange my work is finished  the baroness began to sob again  and i thought that you were a man she moaned so gallant so honourable  madame sogrange intervened i shall commend you to the pension list of the double four  she dried her eyes  it is not money only i want she whispered her eyes following peter  sogrange shook his head  you have never seen the baroness de grost he asked her  but no  ah sogrange murmured our escort madame is at your serviceso far as london
