milton himself describes it simply as a mask by others it has been criticised and estimated as a lyrical drama a drama in the epic style a lyric poem in the form of a play a phantasy an allegory a philosophical poem a suite of speeches or majestic soliloquies and even a didactic poem such variety in the description of the poem is explained partly by its complex charm and manysided interest and partly by the desire to describe it from that point of view which should best reconcile its literary form with what we know of the genius and powers of its author those who like dr johnson have blamed it as a drama have admired it as a series of lines or as a lyric one writer who has found that its characters are nothing its sentiments tedious its story uninteresting has nevertheless doubted whether there will ever be any similar poem which gives so true a conception of the capacity and the dignity of the mind by which it was produced bagehots literary studies some who have praised it as an allegory see in it a satire on the evils both of the church and of the state while others regard it as alluding to the vices of the court alone some have found its lyrical parts the best while others charmed with its divine philosophy have commended those deep conceits which place it alongside of the faerie queen as shadowing forth an episode in the education of a noble soul and as a poets lesson against intemperance and impurity but no one can refuse to admit that more than any other of miltons shorter poems it gives us an insight into the peculiar genius and character of its author it was in the opinion of hallam sufficient to convince any one of taste and feeling that a great poet had arisen in england and one partly formed in a different school from his contemporaries it is true that in the early poems we do not find the whole of milton for he had yet to pass through many years of trouble and controversy but comus in a special degree reveals or foreshadows much of the milton of paradise lost whether we regard its place in miltons life in the series of his works or in english literature as a whole the poem is full of significance it is worth while therefore to consider how its form was determined by the external circumstances and previous training of the poet by his favourite studies in poetry philosophy history and music and by his noble theory of life in general and of a poets life in particular  the mask was represented at ludlow castle on september 29th 1634 it was probably composed early in that year it belongs therefore to that group of poems lallegro il penseroso arcades comus and lycidas written by milton while living in his fathers house at horton near windsor after having left the university of cambridge in july 1632 as he was born in 1608 he would be twentyfive years of age when this poem was composed during his stay at horton 163239 which was broken only by a journey to italy in 16389 he was chiefly occupied with the study of the greek roman italian and english literatures each of which has left its impress on comus he read widely and carefully and it has been said that his great and original imagination was almost entirely nourished or at least stimulated by books his residence at horton was accordingly preeminently what he intended it to be and what his father wisely and gladly permitted it to bea time of preparation and ripening for the work to which he had dedicated himself we are reminded of his own words in comus                      and wisdoms self     oft seeks to sweet retired solitude     where with her best nurse contemplation     she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings     that in the various bustle of resort     were all toruffled and sometimes impaired  we find in comus abundant reminiscences of miltons study of the literature of antiquity it would not be too much to say that the literature of antiquity was to miltons genius what soil and light are to a plant it nourished it coloured it developed it it determined not merely his character as an artist but it exercised an influence on his intellect and temper scarcely less powerful than hereditary instincts and contemporary history it at once animated and chastened his imagination it modified his fancy it furnished him with his models on it his taste was formed on it his style was moulded from it his diction and his method derived their peculiarities it transformed what would in all probability have been the mere counterpart of caedmons paraphrase or langlands vision into paradise lost and what would have been the mere counterpart of corydons doleful knell and the satire of the three estates into lycidas and comus quarterly review no 326  but milton has also told us that spenser was his master and the full charm of comus cannot be realised without reference to the artistic and philosophical spirit of the author of the faerie queene both poems deal with the war between the body and the soulbetween the lower and the higher nature in an essay on spenser as a philosophic poet de vere says the perils and degradations of an animalised life are shown under the allegory of sir guyons sea voyage with its successive storms and whirlpools its rock of reproach strewn with wrecks and dead mens bones its wandering islands its quicksands of unthriftihead its whirlepoole of decay its seamonsters and lastly its bower of bliss and the doom which overtakes it together with the deliverance of acrasias victims transformed by that witchs spells into beasts still more powerful is the allegory of worldly ambition illustrated under the name of the cave of mammon the legend of holiness delineates with not less insight those enemies which wage war upon the spiritual life all this milton had studied in the faerie queene and had understood it and like sir guyon he felt himself to be a knight enrolled under the banner of parity and selfcontrol so that in comus we find the sovereign value of temperance or selfregulationwhat the greeks called σωφροσύνηset forth no less clearly than in spensers poem in miltons mask it becomes almost identical with virtue itself the enchantments of acrasia in her bower of bliss become the spells of comus the armour of belphoebe becomes the complete steel of chastity while the supremacy of conscience the bounty of nature and mans ingratitude the unloveliness of mammon and of excess the blossom of courtesy oft found on lowly stalk and the final triumph of virtue through striving and temptation all are dwelt upon      it is the mind that maketh good or ill     that maketh wretch or happie rich or poore  so speaks spenser and milton similarly      he that has light within his own clear breast     may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day     but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts     benighted walks under the midday sun     himself is his own dungeon  in endeavouring still further to trace by means of verbal or structural resemblances the sources from which milton drew his materials for comus critics have referred to peeles old wives tale 1595 to fletchers pastoral the faithful shepherdess of which charles lamb has said that if all its parts had been in unison with its many innocent scenes and sweet lyric intermixtures it had been a poem fit to vie with comus or the arcadia to have been put into the hands of boys and virgins to have made matter for young dreams like the loves of hermia and lysander to ben jonsons mask of pleasure reconciled to virtue 1619 in which comus is the god of cheer or the belly and to the comus of erycius puteanus henri du puy professor of eloquence at louvain it is true that fletchers pastoral was being acted in london about the time milton was writing his comus that the poem by the dutch professor was republished at oxford in 1634 and that resemblances are evident between miltons poem and those named but professor masson does well in warning us that infinitely too much has been made of such coincidences after all of them even the most ideal and poetical the feeling in reading comus is that all here is different all peculiar whatever milton borrowed he borrowed as he says himself in order to better it  it is interesting to consider the mutual relations of the poems written by milton at horton everything that milton wrote is miltonic he had what has been called the power of transforming everything into himself and these poems are accordingly evidences of the development of miltons opinions and of his secret purpose it has been said that lallegro and il penseroso are to be regarded as the pleadings the decision on which is in comuslallegro representing the cavalier and il penseroso the puritan element this is true only in a limited sense it is true that the puritan element in the horton series of poems becomes more patent as we pass from the two lyrics to the mask of comus and from comus to the elegy of lycidas just as in the corresponding periods of time the evils connected with the reign of charles i and with lauds crusade against puritanism were becoming more pronounced but we can hardly regard milton as having expressed any new decision in comus the decision is already made when vain deluding joys are banished in il penseroso and loathed melancholy in lallegro the mask is an expansion and exaltation of the delights of the contemplative man but there is still a place for the unreproved pleasures of the cheerful man unless it were so comus could not have been written there would have been no sunshine holiday for the rustics and no victorious dance for the gentle lady and her brothers but in comus we realise the mutual relation of lallegro and il penseroso we see their application to the joys and sorrows of the actual life of individuals we observe human nature in contact with the hard assays of life and subsequently in lycidas we are made to realise that this human nature is miltons own and to understand how it was that his puritanism which three years before had permitted him to write a cavalier mask should three years after lead him from the fresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial prose  the mask was a favourite form of entertainment in england in miltons youth and had been so from the time of henry viii in whose reign elaborate masked shows introduced from italy first became popular but they seem to have found their way into england in a crude form even earlier and we read of court disguisings in the reign of edward iii it is usually said that the mask derives its name from the fact that the actors wore masks and in halls chronicle we read that in 1512 on the day of epiphany at night the king with eleven others was disguised after the manner of italy called a mask a thing not seen before in england they were appareled in garments long and broad wrought all with gold with visors and caps of gold the truth however seems to be that the use of a visor was not essential in such entertainments which from the first were called masks the word masker being used sometimes of the players and sometimes of their disguises the word has come to us through the french form masque cognate with spanish mascarada a masquerade or assembly of maskers otherwise called a mummery up to the time of henry viii these entertainments were of the nature of dumbshow or tableaux vivants and delighted the spectators chiefly by the splendour of the costumes and machinery employed in their representation but afterwards the chief actors spoke their parts singing and dancing were introduced and the composition of masks for royal and other courtly patrons became an occupation worthy of a poet they were frequently combined with other forms of amusement all of which were in the case of the court placed under the management of a master of revels whose official title was magister jocorum revellorum et mascorum in the first printed english tragedy gorboduc 1565 each act opens with what is called a dumbshow or mask but the more elaborate form of the mask soon grew to be an entertainment complete in itself and the demand for such became so great in the time of james i and charles i that the history of these reigns might almost be traced in the succession of masks then written ben jonson who thoroughly established the mask in english literature wrote many court masks and made them a vehicle less for the display of painting and carpentry than for the expression of the intellectual and social life of his time his masks are excelled only by comus and possess in a high degree that doric delicacy in their songs and odes which sir henry wotton found so ravishing in miltons mask jonson in his lifetime declared that next himself only fletcher and chapman could write a mask and apart from the compositions of these writers and of william browne inner temple masque there are few specimens worthy to be named along with jonsons until we come to miltons arcades other maskwriters were middleton dekker shirley carew and davenant and it is interesting to note that in carews coelum brittanicum 16334 for which lawes composed the music the two boys who afterwards acted in comus had juvenile parts it has been pointed out that the popularity of the mask in miltons youth received a stimulus from the puritan hatred of the theatre which found expression at that time and drove nonpuritans to welcome the mask as a protest against that spirit which saw nothing but evil in every form of dramatic entertainment milton who enjoyed the theatreboth jonsons learned sock and what ennobled hath the buskined stagewas led through his friendship with the musician lawes to compose a mask to celebrate the entry of the earl of bridgewater upon his office of lord president of the council in the principality of wales and the marches of the same he had already written also at the request of lawes a mask or portion of a mask called arcades and the success of this may have stimulated him to higher effort the result was comus in which the mask reached its highest level and after which it practically faded out of our literature  miltons two masks arcades and comus were written for members of the same noble family the former in honour of the countess dowager of derby and the latter in honour of john first earl of bridgewater who was both her stepson and soninlaw this twofold relation arose from the fact that the earl was the son of viscount brackley the countesss second husband and had himself married lady frances stanley a daughter of the countess by her first husband the fifth earl of derby amongst the children of the earl of bridgewater were three who took important parts in the representation of comusalice the youngest daughter then about fourteen years of age who appeared as the lady john viscount brackley who took the part of the elder brother and thomas egerton who appeared as the second brother we do not know who acted the parts of comus and sabrina but the part of the attendant spirit was taken by henry lawes gentleman of the chapel royal and one of his majestys private musicians the earls children were his pupils and the mask was naturally produced under his direction miltons friendship with lawes is shown by the sonnet which the poet addressed to the musician      harry whose tuneful and well measurd song       first taught our english music how to span       words with just note and accent not to scan       with midas ears committing short and long     thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng       with praise enough for envy to look wan       to after age thou shalt be writ the man     that with smooth air couldst humour best our tongue     thou honourst verse and verse must lend her wing       to honour thee the priest of phoebus quire       that tunst their happiest lines in hymn or story     dante shall give fame leave to set thee higher       than his casella who he wood to sing       met in the milder shades of purgatory  we must remember also that it was to lawes that miltons comus owed its first publication and as we see from the dedication prefixed to the text that he was justly proud of his share in its first representation  such were the persons who appeared in miltons mask they are few in number and the plan of the piece is correspondingly simple there are three scenes which may be briefly characterised thus      i the tempter and the tempted lines 1658        scene a wild wood     ii the temptation and the rescue lines 659958        scene the palace of comus    iii the triumph lines 9591023        scene the presidents castle  in the first scene after a kind of prologue lines 192 the interest rises as we are introduced first to comus and his rout then to the lady alone and nightfoundered and finally to comus and the lady in company at the same time the nature of the ladys trial and her subsequent victory are foreshadowed in a conversation between the brothers and the attendant spirit this is one of the more miltonic parts of the mask in the philosophical reasoning of the elder brother as opposed to the matteroffact arguments of the younger we trace the young poet fresh from the study of the divine volume of plato and filled with a noble trust in god in the second scene we breathe the unhallowed air of the abode of the wily tempter who endeavours under fair pretence of friendly ends to wind himself into the pure heart of the lady but his gay rhetoric is futile against the sunclad power of chastity and he is driven off the scene by the two brothers who are led and instructed by the spirit disguised as the shepherd thyrsis but the lady having been lured into the haunt of impurity is left spellbound and appeal is made to the pure nymph sabrina who is swift to aid a virgin such as was herself in hardbesetting need it is in the contention between comus and the lady in this scene that the interest of the mask may be said to culminate for here its purpose stands revealed it is a song to temperance as the ground of freedom to temperance as the guard of all the virtues to beauty as secured by temperance and its central point and climax is in the pleading of these motives by the lady against their opposites in the mouth of the lord of sensual revel milton classical writers in the third scene the lady alice and her brothers are presented by the spirit to their noble father and mother as triumphing in victorious dance oer sensual folly and intemperance the spirit then speaks the epilogue calling upon mortals who love true freedom to strive after virtue      love virtue she alone is free     she can teach ye how to climb     higher than the sphery chime     or if virtue feeble were     heaven itself would stoop to her  the last couplet milton afterwards on his italian journey entered in an album belonging to an italian named cerdogni and underneath it the words coelum non animum muto dum trans mare curro and his signature joannes miltonius anglus the juxtaposition of these verses is significant though he had left his own land milton had not become what fifty or sixty years before roger ascham had condemned as an italianated englishman he was one of those worthy gentlemen of england whom all the siren tongues of italy could never untwine from the mast of gods word nor no enchantment of vanity overturn them from the fear of god and love of honesty aschams scholemaster and one might almost infer that milton in his account of the sovereign plant haemony which was to foil the wiles of comus had remembered not only homers description of the root moly that hermes once to wise ulysses gave16a but also aschams remarks thereupon the true medicine against the enchantments of circe the vanity of licentious pleasure the enticements of all sin is in homer the herb moly with the black root and white flower sour at first but sweet in the end which hesiod termeth the study of virtue hard and irksome in the beginning but in the end easy and pleasant and that which is most to be marvelled at the divine poet homer saith plainly that this medicine against sin and vanity is not found out by man but given and taught by god miltons comus like his last great poems is a poetical expression of the same belief his poetical works the outcome of his inner life his life of artistic contemplation are in the words of prof dowden various renderings of one dominant ideathat the struggle for mastery between good and evil is the prime fact of life and that a final victory of the righteous cause is assured by the existence of a divine order of the universe which milton knew by the name of providence   footnotes  16a it is noteworthy that lamb whose allusiveness is remarkable employs in his account of the plant moly almost the exact words of miltons description of haemony compare the following extract from the adventures of ulysses with lines 629640 of comus the flower of the herb moly which is sovereign against enchantments the moly is a small unsightly root its virtues but little known and in low estimation the dull shepherd treads on it every day with his clouted shoes but it bears a small white flower which is medicinal against charms blights mildews and damps       comus     a mask    presented at ludlow castle 1634    before    john earl of bridgewater    then president of wales     the copy of a

with new obligations both for a very kind letter from you dated the sixth of this month and for a dainty piece of entertainment which came therewith wherein i should much commend the tragical part if the lyrical did not ravish me with a certain doric delicacy in your songs and odes whereunto i must plainly confess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our language ipsa mollities19a but i must not omit to tell you that i now only owe you thanks for intimating unto me how modestly soever the true artificer for the work itself i had viewed some good while before with singular delight having

directions for shaping of your farther journey into italy where he did reside by my choice some time for the king after mine own recess from venice  i should think that your best line will be through the whole length of france to marseilles and thence by sea to genoa whence the passage into tuscany is as diurnal as a gravesend barge i hasten as you do to florence or siena the rather to tell you a

form of a shell  232 meanders margent green maeander a river of asia minor remarkable for the windings of its course hence the verb to meander and hence also in keightleys opinion the mention of the river as a haunt of echo it is more probable however that as the lady addresses echo as the sweet queen of parley and the unhappy lover of the lost narcissus the river is here mentioned because of its associations with music and misfortune the marsyas was a tributary of the maeander and the legend was that the flute upon which marsyas played in his rash contest with apollo was carried into the maeander and after being thrown on land dedicated to apollo the god of song comp lyc 5863 where the muses and misfortune are similarly associated by a reference to orpheus whose gory visage and lyre were carried down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore further the maeander is associated with the sorrows of the maiden byblis who seeks her lost brother caunus called by ovid maeandrius juvenis since the above was written prof j w hales has given the following explanation of miltons allusion the real reason is that the meander was a famous haunt of swans and the swan was a favourite bird with the greek and latin writersone to whose sweet singing they perpetually allude athenaeum april 20 1889 margent marge and margin are forms of the same word  233 the violetembroidered vale the notion that flowers broider or ornament the ground is common in poetry comp par lost iv 700 under foot the violet crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay broidered the ground in lyc 148 the flowers

would give you some violets but they withered all when my father died prof hales however thinks that some particular vale is here alluded to and argues with much acumen that the poet referred to the woodlands close by athens to the northwest through which the cephissus flowed and where stood the birthplace of sophocles who sings of his native colonus as frequented by nightingales the same critic regards the epithet violetembroidered as a translation of the greek ἰοστέφανος  crowned with violets frequently applied by aristophanes to athens of which colonus was a suburb macaulay also refers to athens as the violetcrowned city it is at least very probable that milton might here associate the nightingale with colonus as he does in par reg iv 245 see the following note  234 lovelorn nightingale the nightingale whose loved ones are lost comp virgil georg iv 511 as the nightingale wailing in the poplar shade plains for her lost young  while she weeps the night through and sitting

makes frequent allusion to the nightingale in il penseroso it is philomel in par reg iv 245 it is the attic bird and in par lost viii 518 it is the amorous bird of night he calls it the attic bird in allusion to the story of philomela the daughter of pandion king of athens near the academy was colonus which sophocles has celebrated as the haunt of nightingales browne philomela was changed at her own prayer into a nightingale that she might escape the vengeance of her brotherinlaw tereus the epithet lovelorn however seems to point to the legend of aēdon greek ἀηδών a nightingale who having killed her own son by mistake was changed into a nightingale whose mournful song was represented by the greek poets as the lament of the mother for her child  235 her sad song mourneth ie sings her plaintive melody sad song forms a kind of cognate accusative  237 likest thy narcissus narcissus who failed to return the love of echo was punished by being made to fall in love with his own image

platos phaedo in a conversation between socrates and cebes       socrates speaking of the pure soul that soul i say herself      invisible departs to the invisible worldto the divine and      immortal and rational thither arriving she is secure of bliss      and is released from the error and folly of men their fears and      wild passions and all other human ills and for ever dwells as      they say of the initiated in company with the gods is not this      true cebes       cebes yes beyond a doubt       soc but the soul which has been polluted and is impure at the      time of her departure and is the companion and servant of the body      always and is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the      desires and pleasures of the body until she is led to believe that      the truth only exists in a bodily form which a man may touch and      see and taste and use for the purposes of his luststhe soul i      mean accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual      principle which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible and can be      attained only by philosophydo you suppose that such a soul will      depart pure and unalloyed       ceb that is impossible       soc she is held fast by the corporeal which the continual      association and constant care of the body have wrought into her      nature       ceb very true       soc and this corporeal element my friend is heavy and weighty      and earthy and is that element by which such a soul is depressed      and dragged down again into the visible world because she is      afraid of the invisible and of the world belowprowling about      tombs and sepulchres in the neighbourhood of which as they tell      us are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not      departed pure but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible       ceb that is very likely socrates       soc yes that is very likely cebes and these must be the      souls not of the good but of the evil who are compelled to      wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former      evil way of life and they continue to wander until through the      craving after the corporeal which never leaves them they are      imprisoned finally in another body and they may be supposed to      find their prisons in the same natures which they have had in their      former lives  further on in the same dialogue socrates says       each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the      soul to the body until she becomes like the body and believes      that to be true which the body affirms to be true and from      agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is      obliged to have the same habits and haunts and is not likely ever      to be pure at her departure

the grammatical construction is may thy lofty head be crowned round with many a tower and terrace and here and there may thy lofty head be crowned with groves of myrrh and cinnamon growing upon thy banks this makes banks objective and upon a preposition the only objection to this reading is that the notion of crowning the head upon the banks is peculiar the difficulty vanishes when we recollect that milton frequently connects two clauses with one subject rather loosely the subject of the second clause is thou implied in thy lofty head an exact parallel to this is found in lalleg 121 122 whose bright eyes rain influence and judge the prize also in il pens 1557 let my due feet never fail to walk  and love etc also in lyc 88 89 the explanation adopted by prof masson is that milton had in view two greek verbsπεριστεφανόω to put a crown round and ἐπιστεφανόω to put a crown upon thus may thy lofty head be crowned round with many a tower and terrace and thy banks here and there be crowned upon with groves of myrrh and cinnamon this makes banks nominative and upon an adverb  in the bridgewater ms the stage direction here is song ends  942 not a waste etc ie let there not be a

this would give additional significance to these lines and to the change of scene after l 957 furlong  furrowlong it thus came to mean the length of a field and is now a measure of length  949 many a friend many a is a peculiar idiom which has been explained in different ways one view is that many is a corruption of the french mesnie a train or company and a a corruption of the preposition of the singular noun being then substituted for the plural through confusion of the preposition with the article a more correct view seems to be that many is the as manig which was in old english used with a singular noun and without the article eg manig mann  many men in the thirteenth century the indefinite article began to be inserted thus mony enne thing  many a thing just as we say what a thing such a thing this would seem to show that a is not a corruption of of and that there is no connection with the french word mesnie milton in this passage uses many a friend with a plural verb gratulate the

became immortal and was united to him for ever in this story psyche represents the human soul gk ψυχή which is disciplined and purified by earthly misfortune and so fitted for the enjoyment of true
