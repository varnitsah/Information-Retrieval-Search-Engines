33201629	did you ever wonder at the lonely life the bird in a cuckoo clock     has to leadthat it might possibly love and hate just as easily as     a real animal of flesh and blood philip dick used that idea for     this brief fantasy tale were sure that after reading it youll     give cuckoo clocks more respect    beyond     the    door   by  philip k dick    larry thomas bought a cuckoo clock  for his wifewithout knowing the  price he would have to pay   that night at the dinner table he brought it out and set it down beside her plate doris stared at it her hand to her mouth my god what is it she looked up at him brighteyed  well open it  doris tore the ribbon and paper from the square package with her sharp nails her bosom rising and falling larry stood watching her as she lifted the lid he lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall  a cuckoo clock doris cried a real old cuckoo clock like my mother had she turned the clock over and over just like my mother had when pete was still alive her eyes sparkled with tears  its made in germany larry said after a moment he added carl got it for me wholesale he knows some guy in the clock business otherwise i wouldnt have he stopped  doris made a funny little sound  i mean otherwise i wouldnt have been able to afford it he scowled whats the matter with you youve got your clock havent you isnt that what you want  doris sat holding onto the clock her fingers pressed against the brown wood  well larry said whats the matter  he watched in amazement as she leaped up and ran from the room still clutching the clock he shook his head never satisfied theyre all that way never get enough  he sat down at the table and finished his meal  the cuckoo clock was not very large it was handmade however and there were countless frets on it little indentations and ornaments scored in the soft wood doris sat on the bed drying her eyes and winding the clock she set the hands by her wristwatch presently she carefully moved the hands to two minutes of ten she carried the clock over to the dresser and propped it up  then she sat waiting her hands twisted together in her lapwaiting for the cuckoo to come out for the hour to strike  as she sat she thought about larry and what he had said and what she had said too for that matternot that she could be blamed for any of it after all she couldnt keep listening to him forever without defending herself you had to blow your own trumpet in the world  she touched her handkerchief to her eyes suddenly why did he have to say that about getting it wholesale why did he have to spoil it all if he felt that way he neednt have got it in the first place she clenched her fists he was so mean so damn mean  but she was glad of the little clock sitting there ticking to itself with its funny grilled edges and the door inside the door was the cuckoo waiting to come out was he listening his head cocked on one side listening to hear the clock strike so that he would know to come out  did he sleep between hours well she would soon see him she could ask him and she would show the clock to bob he would love it bob loved old things even old stamps and buttons he liked to go with her to the stores of course it was a little awkward but larry had been staying at the office so much and that helped if only larry didnt call up sometimes to  there was a whirr the clock shuddered and all at once the door opened the cuckoo came out sliding swiftly he paused and looked around solemnly scrutinizing her the room the furniture  it was the first time he had seen her she realized smiling to herself in pleasure she stood up coming toward him shyly go on she said im waiting  the cuckoo opened his bill he whirred and chirped quickly rhythmically then after a moment of contemplation he retired and the door snapped shut  she was delighted she clapped her hands and spun in a little circle he was marvelous perfect and the way he had looked around studying her sizing her up he liked her she was certain of it and she of course loved him at once completely he was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door  doris went to the clock she bent over the little door her lips close to the wood do you hear me she whispered i think youre the most wonderful cuckoo in the world she paused embarrassed i hope youll like it here  then she went downstairs again slowly her head high  larry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start doris said it was because he didnt wind it right and it didnt like being only halfwound all the time larry turned the job of winding over to her the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down without remorse and someone had to be ever after it winding it up again  doris did her best but she forgot a good deal of the time then larry would throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand up he would go into the diningroom where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace he would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door he would wind it up  why do you put your thumb over the door doris asked once  youre supposed to  she raised an eyebrow are you sure i wonder if it isnt that you dont want him to come out while youre standing so close  why not  maybe youre afraid of him  larry laughed he put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb when doris wasnt looking he examined his thumb  there was still a trace of the nick cut out of the soft part of it whoor whathad pecked at him                                       one saturday morning when larry was down at the office working over some important special accounts bob chambers came to the front porch and rang the bell  doris was taking a quick shower she dried herself and slipped into her robe when she opened the door bob stepped inside grinning  hi he said looking around  its all right larrys at the office  fine bob gazed at her slim legs below the hem of the robe how nice you look today  she laughed be careful maybe i shouldnt let you in after all  they looked at one another half amused half frightened presently bob said if you want ill  no for gods sake she caught hold of his sleeve just get out of the doorway so i can close it mrs peters across the street you know  she closed the door and i want to show you something she said you havent seen it  he was interested an antique or what  she took his arm leading him toward the diningroom youll love it bobby she stopped wideeyed i hope you will you must you must love it it means so much to mehe means so much  he bob frowned who is he  doris laughed youre jealous come on a moment later they stood before the clock looking up at it hell come out in a few minutes wait until you see him i know you two will get along just fine  what does larry think of him  they dont like each other sometimes when larrys here he wont come out larry gets mad if he doesnt come out on time he says  says what  doris looked down he always says hes been robbed even if he did get it wholesale she brightened but i know he wont come out because he doesnt like larry when im here alone he comes right out for me every fifteen minutes even though he really only has to come out on the hour  she gazed up at the clock he comes out for me because he wants to we talk i tell him things of course id like to have him upstairs in my room but it wouldnt be right  there was the sound of footsteps on the front porch they looked at each other horrified  larry pushed the front door open grunting he set his briefcase down and took off his hat then he saw bob for the first time  chambers ill be damned his eyes narrowed what are you doing here he came into the diningroom doris drew her robe about her helplessly backing away  i bob began that is we he broke off glancing at doris suddenly the clock began to whirr the cuckoo came rushing out bursting into sound larry moved toward him  shut that din off he said he raised his fist toward the clock the cuckoo snapped into silence and retreated the door closed thats better larry studied doris and bob standing mutely together  i came over to look at the clock bob said doris told me that its a rare antique and that  nuts i bought it myself larry walked up to him get out of here he turned to doris you too and take that damn clock with you  he paused rubbing his chin no leave the clock here its mine i bought it and paid for it  in the weeks that followed after doris left larry and the cuckoo clock got along even worse than before for one thing the cuckoo stayed inside most of the time sometimes even at twelve oclock when he should have been busiest and if he did come out at all he usually spoke only once or twice never the correct number of times and there was a sullen uncooperative note in his voice a jarring sound that made larry uneasy and a little angry  but he kept the clock wound because the house was very still and quiet and it got on his nerves not to hear someone running around talking and dropping things and even the whirring of a clock sounded good to him  but he didnt like the cuckoo at all and sometimes he spoke to him  listen he said late one night to the closed little door i know you can hear me i ought to give you back to the germansback to the black forest he paced back and forth i wonder what theyre doing now the two of them that young punk with his books and his antiques a man shouldnt be interested in antiques thats for women  he set his jaw isnt that right  the clock said nothing larry walked up in front of it isnt that right he demanded dont you have anything to say  he looked at the face of the clock it was almost eleven just a few seconds before the hour all right ill wait until eleven then i want to hear what you have to say youve been pretty quiet the last few weeks since she left  he grinned wryly maybe you dont like it here since shes gone he scowled well i paid for you and youre coming out whether you like it or not you hear me  eleven oclock came far off at the end of town the great tower clock boomed sleepily to itself but the little door remained shut nothing moved the minute hand passed on and the cuckoo did not stir he was someplace inside the clock beyond the door silent and remote  all right if thats the way you feel larry murmured his lips twisting but it isnt fair its your job to come out we all have to do things we dont like  he went unhappily into the kitchen and opened the great gleaming refrigerator as he poured himself a drink he thought about the clock  there was no doubt about itthe cuckoo should come out doris or no doris he had always liked her from the very start they had got along well the two of them probably he liked bob tooprobably he had seen enough of bob to get to know him they would be quite happy together bob and doris and the cuckoo  larry finished his drink he opened the drawer at the sink and took out the hammer he carried it carefully into the diningroom the clock was ticking gently to itself on the wall  look he said waving the hammer you know what i have here you know what im going to do with it im going to start on youfirst he smiled birds of a feather thats what you arethe three of you  the room was silent  are you coming out or do i have to come in and get you  the clock whirred a little  i hear you in there youve got a lot of talking to do enough for the last three weeks as i figure it you owe me  the door opened the cuckoo came out fast straight at him larry was looking down his brow wrinkled in thought he glanced up and the cuckoo caught him squarely in the eye  down he went hammer and chair and everything hitting the floor with a tremendous crash for a moment the cuckoo paused its small body poised rigidly then it went back inside its house the door snapped tightshut after it  the man lay on the floor stretched out grotesquely his head bent over to one side nothing moved or stirred the room was completely silent except of course for the ticking of the clock                                       i see doris said her face tight bob put his arm around her steadying her  doctor bob said can i ask you something  of course the doctor said  is it very easy to break your neck falling from so low a chair it wasnt very far to fall i wonder if it might not have been an accident is there any chance it might have been  suicide the doctor rubbed his jaw i never heard of anyone committing suicide that way it was an accident im positive  i dont mean suicide bob murmured under his breath looking up at the clock on the wall i meant something else  but no one heard him
