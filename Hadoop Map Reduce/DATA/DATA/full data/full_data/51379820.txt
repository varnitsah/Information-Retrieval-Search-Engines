was one of a suite of rooms occupied by mrs antoinette seaver jones widely known for her wealth and beauty and this girla little thing of elevenwas the only child of mrs antoinette seaver jones and was named alora  it was not cold that made her shiver for across the handsomely furnished room an open window gratefully admitted the summer sunshine and the summer breeze near the window where the draught came coolest a middleaged woman in a sober dress sat reading alora did not look at this person but kept her gaze fixed anxiously upon the doorway that led to the corridor and the spasmodic shudders that at times shook her little body seemed due to nervous fear  the room was so still that every tick of the dresden clock could be distinctly heard when miss gorham aloras governess turned a page of her book the rustle was appallingly audible and the clock ticked on and miss gorham turned page after page and still the child sat bowed upon her chair and eagerly eyed the passageway  it seemed ages before the outer door of the suite finally opened and a man moved softly down the passage and paused at the entrance of the reception room the man was whitehaired dignified and distinguished in appearance hat in hand he stood as if undecided while alora bounded from her seat and came to him her eyes big and pleading reading his face with dramatic intentness  well well my dear what is it he said in a kindly voice  may i see my mamma now doctor she asked  he shook his head turning to the table to place his hat and gloves upon it  not just yet little one he gently replied and noting her quickdrawn breath of disappointment he added why i havent seen her myself this morning  why do you keep me from her doctor anstruther dont you know its its wicked and cruela sob in her voice  the old physician looked down upon the child pityingly  mamma is illvery ill you knowand to disturb her mightit might well it might make her worse he explained lamely  i wont disturb her theres a nurse in there all the time why should i disturb my mamma more than a nurse asked alora pleadingly  he evaded the question the big eyes disconcerted him  when i have seen your mother said he i may let you go to her for a few minutes but you must be very quiet so as not to excite her we must avoid anything of an exciting nature you understand that dont you lory  she studied his face gravely when he held out a hand to her she clung to it desperately and a shudder again shook her from head to foot  tell me doctor anstruther in low passionate tones is my mother dying  he gave an involuntary start  who put that notion into your head lory  miss gorham  he frowned and glanced reprovingly at the governess who had lowered her book to her lap and was regarding the scene with stolid unconcern  you mustnt mind such idle gossip my dear i am the doctor you know and i am doing all that can be done to save your mothers life dont worry until i tell you to lory and now let me go to see my patient  he withdrew his hand from her clasp and turned into the passage again the girl listened to his footsteps as he approached her mothers bedchamber paused a moment and then softly opened the door and entered silence again pervaded the reception room the clock resumed its loud ticking miss gorham raised her book alora went back to her chair trembling  the front bedchamber was bright and cheery a big room fitted with every modern luxury the doctor blinked his eyes as he entered from the dim passage for here was sunlight and fresh air in plenty beside the bed stood a huge vase of roses their delicate fragrance scenting the atmosphere upon the bed beneath a costly lace coverlid lay a woman thirtyfive years of age her beautiful face still fresh and unlined the deep blue eyes turned calmly upon the physician  welcome doctor anstruther she said do you realize you have kept me waiting  i am sorry mrs jones he replied approaching her there are so many demands upon my time that  i know a little impatiently but now that you are here please tell me how i am this morning  how do you feel  i do not suffer but it takes more morphine to quiet the pain janet has used the hypodermic four times since midnight with a glance at the grayrobed nurse who stood silently by the table  the doctor nodded thoughtfully looking down her there was small evidence of illness in her appearance but he knew that her hours were numbered and that the dread disease that had fastened upon her was creeping on with ever increasing activity she knew it too and smiled a grim little smile as she added how long can i last at this rate  do not anticipate my dear he answered gravely let us do all that may be done and  i must know she retorted i have certain important arrangements to make that must not be needlessly delayed  i can understand that mrs jones  then tell me frankly how long have i to live  perhaps a month possibly less but  you are not honest with me doctor anstruther what i wish to know what i must knowis how soon this disease will be able to kill me if we manage to defer the end somewhat all the better but the fiend must not take me unaware before i am ready to resign my life  he seated himself beside the bed and reflected this was his most interesting patient he had attended her constantly for more than a year and in this time had learned to admire not only her beauty of person but her gameness and wholesome mentality he knew something of her past life and history too as well from her own lips as from common gossip for this was no ordinary woman and her achievements were familiar to many  she was the daughter of captain bob seaver whose remarkable career was known to every man in the west captain bob was one fortyniners and had made fortunes and lost them with marvelous regularity he had a faculty for finding gold but his speculations were invariably unwise so his constant transitions from affluence to poverty and vice versa were the subject of many amusing tales many no doubt grossly exaggerated and the last venture of captain bob seaver before he died was to buy the discredited tenspot mine and start to develop it  at that time he was a widower with one motherless childantoinettea girl of eighteen who had been reared partly in mining camps and partly at exclusive girls schools in the east according to her fathers varying fortunes tony seaver as she was generally called in those days combined culture and refinement with a thorough knowledge of mining and when her father passed away and left her absolute mistress of the tantalizing tenspot she set to work to make the mine a success directing her men in person and displaying such shrewd judgment and intelligence coupled with kindly consideration for her assistants that she became the idol of the miners all of whom were proud to be known as employees of tony seavers tenspot would have died for their beautiful employer if need be  and the tenspot made good in five years tony had garnered a million or two of wellearned dollars and then she sold out and retired from business also to the chagrin of an army of suitors she married an artist named jason jones whose talent it was said was not so great as his luck so far his fame rested on his being tony seavers husband but tonys hobby was art and she had recognized real worth she claimed in jason jones creations on her honeymoon she carried her artist husband to europe and with him studied the works of the masters in all the art centers of the continent then enthusiastic and eager for jasons advancement she returned with him to new york and set him up in a splendid studio where he had every convenience and incentive to work  so much the world at large knew it also knew that within three years mrs antoinette seaver jones separated from her husband and with her baby girl returned west to live the elaborate jones studio was abandoned and broken up and the promising young artist disappeared from the public eye mrs jones a thorough business woman had retained her fortune in her own control and personally attended to her investments she became noted as a liberal patron of the arts and a generous donor to worthy charities in spite of her youth wealth and beauty she had no desire to shine in society and lived a somewhat secluded life in luxurious family hotels attending with much solicitude to the training and education of her daughter alora  at first she had made denver her home but afterward migrated from one middlewest city to another until she came to chicago where she had now lived for nearly three years occupying the most expensive suite of rooms at the very exclusive hotel voltaire  alora fairly worshipped her beautiful mother and although mrs antoinette seaver jones was considered essentially cold and unemotional by those who knew her casually there was no doubt she prized her child as her dearest possession and lavished all the tenderness and love of which she was capable upon her  retrospectively doctor anstruther considered this historical revue of his fair patient as he sat facing her it seemed a most unhappy fate that she should be cut off in the flower of her womanhood but her case was positively hopeless and she knew it and had accepted the harsh verdict without a murmur bravery had always been tony seavers prime characteristic to doctor anstruther it seemed that she might as well know the truth which she had demanded from his lips  this disease is one that accelerates toward the end he said within the past few days we have noted its more virulent tendency all we can do now is to keep you from suffering untilthe end  and that will bewhen she demanded  i think i can safely give you a week but  then i must act at once she said as he hesitated i must first of all make provision for aloras future and in this i require your help  you know you may depend upon me he said simply  please telegraph at once to my husband jason jones in new york  the request startled him for never before had she mentioned her husbands name in his presence but he asked calmly enough  what is his address  hand me that small memorandumbook pointing to the stand beside him he obeyed and as she turned the leaves slowly she said  doctor anstruther you have been my good and faithful friend and you ought to know and to understand why i am now sending for my husband from whom i have been estranged for many years when i first met jason jones he was a true artist and i fell in love with his art rather than with the man i was ambitious that he should become a great painter worldfamous he was very poor until he married me and he had worked industriously to succeed but as soon as i introduced him to a life of comforti might even add of luxuryhis ambition to work gradually deserted him with his future provided for as he thought he failed to understand the necessity of devoting himself to his brush and palette but preferred a life of easeof laziness if you will so we quarreled i tried to force him back to his work but it was no use my money had ruined his career i therefore lost patience and decided to abandon him hoping that when he was again thrown upon his own resources he would earnestly resume his profession and become a master as i believed him competent to be we were not divorced we merely separated finding i had withdrawn his allowance he was glad to see me go for my unmerciful scoldings had killed any love he may have had for me but he loved lory and her loss was his hardest trial i may have been as much to blame as he for our lack of harmony but i have always acted on my impulses  ill give jason jones the credit for not whimpering she resumed thoughtfully after a brief pause nor has he ever since appealed to me for money i dont know how well he has succeeded for we do not correspond but i have never heard his name mentioned in the art circles i have frequented he remained in new york i believe and so i chose to keep away from new york a year or two ago however i met a man who had known jason jones and who gave me his address here it is 1744 east sixtyseventh street will you make a copy of it doctor  he nodded  what shall i say in the telegram he asked writing the address in his notebook  tell him i am dying and seek a reconciliation before i pass away beg him to come to me at once  dr anstruther jotted down the instructions underneath the address  you must understand she continued that jason jones is an honorable man and in many ways a highminded gentleman i have lived with him as his wife and i know that he is well fitted to care for our child and to rear her properly i have left my entire fortune to alora but i have made jason my sole executor and he is to have control under certain restrictions of all the income until alora is eighteen i think he will be glad to accept the responsibility both on aloras account and for the money  doubtless if he has not been a success as an artist since your separation remarked the doctor drily  the man i spoke of said jason was living in quite modest circumstances he said that although he had succeeded in selling a few paintings they had brought rather insignificant sumswhich surprised me as i know they must have possessed a degree of merit however i may be mistaken in thinking his talent exceptional anyhow my experiment in leaving him to his own devices seems not to have resulted as i had hoped and i now am willing he should handle aloras income and live comfortably while he is educating her she will probably provide for her father when she comes of age but i have not included such a request in my will and i have endeavored in case he proves inclined to neglect her to require the court to appoint another guardian that is of course merely a precaution for i know his nature is gentle and kind and he adoresor at least he used to adore children  the doctor sat notebook in hand musing the matteroffact businesslike way in which she referred to her marital relations and her assumed unconcern over her own dreadful fate impressed the good man as extraordinary but he was relieved to know that little alora of whom he had grown quite fond was to have the guardianship of a parent and glad that the character of jason jones was above reproach the mans failure to succeed as an artist while it might have been a source of chagrin to his artloving wife did not lower him to any extent in dr anstruthers opinion  i suppose alora does not remember her father he presently remarked  she was about two years old when we separated  and you say your will is already drawn  judge bernsted my lawyer has attended to it it is now in his possession properly signed and witnessed  if bernsted drew the will it is doubtless legal and in accordance with your wishes but who witnessed it  my nurse janet  he glanced at the motionless figure of the attendant who had remained so inert at her post by the window that he had quite forgotten her presence she was a young woman perhaps thirty years of age and not unprepossessing in appearance in spite of her modest uniform  janets one peculiarity was her downcast eyes they were good eyes bright and intelligent but she kept them veiled by their long lashes and drooping lids dr anstruther attached no significance to this trait doubtless a habit of modest reserve acquired in her profession he had himself recommended the woman to mrs jones having frequently employed her on other cases and found her deft skillful and thoroughly reliable janet ormes signature to the will he regarded as satisfactory since judge bernsted had accepted it  a moan from his patient suddenly aroused the doctor her face was beginning to twitch spasmodically with pain in an instant janet was at her side hypodermic needle in hand and the opiate was soon administered  send the telegram muttered mrs jones still breathing hard and as you go out doctor send alora to me i shall have relief in a few moments  to be sure he said rising lory has been begging to see you and ill attend to the telegram at once    chapter ii mother and daughter  the child crept softly to her mothers bedside but once there she impulsively threw her arms about mamma tones neck and embraced her so tightly that the sick woman was obliged to tear the little arms away she did this tenderly though and holding the trembling hands in her own kissed both of lorys cheeks before she said  ive news for you dear  are you better mamma asked lory  of course not was the calm reply you mustnt expect mamma ever to get well my darling but that shouldnt worry younot too much you know one of the queer things about life is that it has an end sooner or later and in mammas case it comes to an end a little sooner than you and i might wish it to  oh mamma tone an agonized cry with the small hands clasped tightly over her throbbing heart but tony seaver did not flinch  the news i have will surprise you lory dear your father who loved you devotedly when you were a baby but whom you have never known till now is coming here to see us  aloras eyes grew big with wonder but other thoughts drove even this strange news from her mind  i cant let you go mamma tone she wailed sobbing i cant let you die and leave me all alone  the womans breast heaved she was silent a moment and then said quietly  even kings and queens sweetheart have no command over life and death when it is too late to help it we realize we have been born when it is too late to help it we realize we must die but why complain when it is the fate of all humanity to be true to our creator who directs all things we must bow to his will without protest you will love your father lory because he will love you and he is a good man and kindly so i believe he will make your life as happy as i could have done  i dont want him i want you mammai want you  the mother sighed wearily and the alert nurse advanced and said to the child in grave cold tones  you must control yourself miss alora if you wish to remain  the threat quieted the little girl at once  ill be good mamma tone she whispered softly talk to me and tell me what i must do  so the dying woman talked to her not of herself but of aloras father and of how she would like her child to conduct herself while she grew in womanhood she spoke of her will and told lory what it meant to her and how she had safeguarded her interests as well as she was able to this lory listened intently and although she still trembled at times she had tony seavers blood in her veins and could be brave in spite of the terrors that faced her dimly she realized that her mother was suffering through the knowledge of their inevitable parting even as alora was suffering and felt she could comfort that beloved mother more by controlling her grief bravely than by giving way to it in her mothers presence  meantime dr anstruther had returned to his office and had written and dispatched the following telegram  jason jones 1744 east 67th st new york city  your wife is dying at the hotel voltaire and wishes reconciliation before she passes away come quickly as any delay may prove dangerous notify me by wire when to expect you edward anstruther m d  he left orders that the answer be delivered to him at his office or residence as soon as received but the day and the night passed without a word from jason jones dr anstruther telephoned the telegraph office and was assured his message had been delivered to the party in new york as otherwise they would be notified to that effect  knowing mrs jones dangerous condition the good doctor was worried but the following morning brought the delayed answer  if necessary for me to come you must send money for expenses  it was signed jason jones and its tone and its demand annoyed dr anstruther exceedingly  confound the fellow he exclaimed any decent man would have borrowed the money or even pawned his watch and jewelry to get to a dying wife who calls for him either mrs jones is mistaken in her husbands kindly character orwell he may have changed since last she knew him  he did not hesitate however to go to the office and send money by telegraph to jason jones furnishing the required sum from his own pocket rather than allow antoinette to see her husbands telegram he even sent more than was necessary muttering to himself the poor devil may have some bills to settle before he can get away and in any event she must not be disappointed because her impecunious husband lacks a few dollars i fancy the poor artist will be amazed to find himself suddenly raised from poverty to affluence for little lorys income will be enormous and he will have seven years at least to enjoy it unrestrained i hope he added thoughtfully as he drove back to his office that mrs jones has made no error in her judgment of this man for it is considerable power to place in anyones hands and alora is such a dear that i want her properly taken care of  when he made his next visit to his patient he said in answer to her questioning look  mr jones will be here tomorrow i think he will notify me of his arrival and i will be here to meet him i believe it will be advisable for me to see him first you know in order toehehto post him a bit he added meaningly  yes she replied i fear it will be something of a shock to jason even though we have practically been strangers for years he is sure to be grieved and sympathetic but do not bore him with particulars doctor send him to me as soon as you have prepared him for the interview    chapter iii aloras father  a man slouched into the lofty foyer of the hotel voltaire and paused uncertainly as if awed by the splendor of the place a boy in uniform hastened to relieve him of his hand baggage which consisted of a rollmeup or carryall of brown canvas strapped around the middle such as one often sees in traveling on the continent it seemed a much used and abused affair and painted upon the ends were the dimmed initials j j  this man was plainly dressed his clothing was of the cheap readymade variety worn nearly to shabbiness and matched by a gray flannel shirt with a flowing black tie knotted at the throat and a soft gray hat that was a bit weatherstained his shoes were shabby and unshined his whole appearance was out of keeping with the palatial hotel he had entered  without relinquishing his baggage to the boy he asked sharply  is dr anstruther here  but now dr anstruther who had been impatiently waiting espied the arrival and after a glance at the initials on the travelingroll said in hesitating tones  mr jason jones  yes you must be the doctor who telegraphed me  i am doctor anstruther  all right wheres my wife  there was no especial anxiety in his tones which were slow and distinct and a trifle sharp he seemed ill at ease and looked around the foyer again as if fearing he had entered the wrong place  i will lead you to her presently replied the physician gravely but first sir i must acquaint you with her condition which is serious i have engaged a room for you here and if you will please register we will go there together and talk undisturbed  all right said jason jones he registered at the desk and then turned and announced im ready go ahead  those present in the foyer cast curious glances at the stranger as he passed them and followed dr anstruther to the elevator the boy accompanied them now carrying the roll of baggage the grandeur of the room they entered which was convenient to the suite of mrs jones seemed to astonish the artist although it was as simply furnished as any the great hotel contained however he made no remark but removed his hat seated himself and looked inquiringly at the physician  mrs jones began dr anstruther is really dying i cannot say how long she may survive but it is a matter of daysperhaps hours her greatest anxiety at present is to be reconciled with you whom she has not seen or even communicated with for years  did she say that  yes  and she wants to be reconciled  she does  rather a queer notion that remarked mr jones musingly  very natural i think under the circumstances stiffly replied the doctor she has every confidence in you and admires your character exceedingly although it was her desire that you live apart  the mans stolid countenance relaxed in a grina somewhat scornful and unbelieving expressionbut he did not speak he was not a very tall man he was thin of figure and hardened of muscle his head was bald in front giving him the appearance of a high forehead and the hair at the back and around the ears was beginning to gray his eyes were light blue his nose was shapely and his jaws prominent and tightly set in repose his age was about forty  mrs jones continued the doctor knows that you are due to arrive at this time and is eagerly counting the minutes not that you are so dear to her he asserted in retaliation for the sneer upon his hearers lips but because she has important business matters to arrange with you before she passes away  business matters  so she has told me i believe he said after a brief period of hesitation during which he considered how best to handle this peculiar artist that i will allow you to see your wife at once that you may learn her plans from her own lips  indeed he had already decided that jason jones must have changed materially and for the worse since antoinette seaver had known him perhaps when she had talked with the man she would revise her opinion of him and make other disposition of her finances and the guardianship of her child in that case it would not be well for him to give her husband any inkling of her present plans having reached this conclusion dr anstruther rose abruptly and said come with me please  jason jones made no demur without remark he followed his conductor into the hallway and to the entrance to the suite occupied by his wife the governess had been instructed to take alora out for a ride there was no one in the little reception room here however the doctor halted and pointing to the door at the further end of the passage he said  that is your wifes sick chamber please enter quietly and remember the danger of exciting mrs jones unduly be gentle andconsiderate  jason jones nodded a moment he regarded the door with curious intentness savoring of reluctance then he slowly advanced opened it and went in closing the door softly behind him  dr anstruther seated himself in the reception room the artist puzzled him greatly although he prided himselfthrough long professional experienceon being able to read human nature with some accuracy this summons to his dyingwife ought to seem the most natural thing in the world to jason jones yet the man appeared dazed and even bewildered by the event and while he had once lived in luxurious surroundings his later experiences must have been so wholly different that the splendor of his wifes mode of living quite embarrassed him yes the contrast was sharp it must be admitted the man had formerly shared tony seavers immense wealth he had enjoyed the handsomest studio in new york and thenback to poverty to drudgery to a struggle for mere food and clothing years of hardship were likely to have had a decided effect upon the character of a man who was doubtless weak in the beginning it would make him hard and bitter and  a shrill scream startled him it came from the sick chamber and was echoed by another cryhoarse and terrifiedin a mans voice  dr anstruther sprang to his feet and hurried into the patients bedchamber  the womans dead doctor cried jason jones standing in the middle of the room shes dead  the physician hastened to the bedside where janet orme the nurse was bending over the still form pushing her away dr anstruther made a hurried examination  it was true the woman was dead at the very moment of reunion with the husband from whom she had so long been parted she had passed on to another life leaving reconciliation in abeyance  mrs antoinette seaver jones lay beneath her lace covered with features contorted mouth half open and eyes staring wildly a paroxysm of pain had carried her off the good doctor well knew the pain and the excitement of the moment very tenderly he bent down and closed the eyes and pressed the lips together he smoothed the lines from the cheeks so that the face became more natural in appearance then with a sighfor he had become fond of this brave beautiful patienthe turned away to find jason jones and the nurse janet confronting one another in tense attitudes the man stared wonderingly into the nurses face janet her eyes now unveiled returned the stare with an expression that dr anstruther could not fathom  they seemed to feel the doctors observation for janet turned her back abruptly while the man swung around and tiptoed hastily from the room  dr anstruther looked at the nurse reflectively  who was it that screamed was it you or mrs jones he asked  she hesitated a moment  it was i she replied i saw her face and knew thatthat the end had come  it was a lie and the nurse knew that the shrewd doctor recognized it as a lie but he made no comment and with a last regretful look toward the bed he followed jason jones out    chapter iv aloras new life  time sears all heart wounds the scars remain perhaps but as the clock ticks on the ache is stilled and the soreness finally passes away  at first alora was heartbroken over her mothers loss she lived in a sort of stupor for weeks after the funeral her fathers presence she accepted without comment or emotion for it had been arranged by mamma tone she did not consider in those first weeks whether she cared for her newly found father or not her mothers statement that he was a good man and would love alora dearly was taken by the child as a matter of fact while her mothers injunction to love him and confide in him in her stead was for the present ignored  indeed during those first weeks lory had no fault to find with her new protector for she saw little of him jason jones retained his room at the hotel and allowed alora and her governess to inhabit the handsome suite her mother had occupied although they were much too small for the big apartments however lory would have felt uncomfortable just then in any other place her mothers chamber was closed and the curtains drawn but every night before she retired to her own little room the child would steal in in the dark and feel her way to the empty bed and kiss the pillow on which her dear mothers head had rested miss gorham the governess was aware of these evening excursions but offered no objection indeed the woman objected to nothing that did not interfere with her own personal comfort and convenience under the eyes of mrs jones she had been prim and dutiful but there was no one to chide her now however neglectful she chose to be and it was true that during these days the little girl required no particular care alora resumed her morning studies with meekness a week after her mother had been laid away and in the afternoons she rode or walked with miss gorham or received the callers who came to console poor antoinette seaver jones child  despite her haughty reserve mrs antoinette seaver jones had accumulated a wide circle of acquaintancesif not friendswho sincerely mourned her untimely death and would have been glad to befriend her little girl were such services needed but it was known that aloras father had now appeared to guard her welfare and there was so much money in the jones family that no financial aid was required therefore these acquaintances could only call to see alora and profess their friendship  the child listened gravely to their stilted praises of her mother and accepted their platitudes in good faith it was indeed comforting to hear so many nice things said of her loved one  her father was never present on these occasions he was by no means a sociable man sometimes he came in for a few minutes in the morning and sat down and stared at the girl in a way half curious and half speculative and said little and presently went away as quietly as he had come  the nurse janet orme left on the day that mrs jones died and alora had almost forgotten the young woman when one afternoon she came to see her janet no longer wore her nurses uniform but was dressed in ultrafashionable apparel and to the childs amusement affected the manners of a lady she talked more with miss gorham than with the little girl and was keen to know what arrangements had been made for their future miss gorham admitted that she had no idea of mr jones intentions of course they could not remain long in this elaborate suite a smaller one would be more satisfactory in every way but mr jones had not as yet mentioned the subject  a few days afterward during one of their walks alora was surprised to see her father and nurse janet riding past in a hired automobile the two seemed engaged in earnest conversation and neither noticed alora or her governess miss gorham snorted rather disdainfully but without remark and lory was not especially interested in the matter  meantime letters of administration had been issued to jason jones and the control of his wifesnow alorasproperty legally placed in his hands judge bernsted attended to all the necessary details and while he did not admire the artist and secretly believed he was unfitted for the task of handling so much money he loyally insisted that the dead womans wishes be obeyed to the letter  dr anstruther had called on the attorney and had ventured to state his misgivings concerning jason jones pleading that alora was likely to suffer through the mans indifference and lack of culture but judge bernsted declared it was not his duty to criticise character but to see that the wishes of his clients were obeyed in this case doubtless the mans wife knew him more intimately than anyone else and if she trusted him aware as she must be of his faults and virtues it would be presumptuous for anyone to try to break her will or otherwise interfere with her carefully planned arrangements  but jason jones was improving in a way he had bought new clothes and a supply of linen and although he did not wear them with the ease of one accustomed to modish dress they certainly improved his appearance he was quiet and unassuming he made no friends and few acquaintances he never mentioned himself or his personal history and never referred to his wife except when forced to do so by some of her meddling friendswell meaning people who sought his acquaintance to condole with him or perhaps to attempt to cultivate him for antoinette seaver jones sake but these found him so unresponsive that they soon left him alone  the legal business even though it progressed smoothly required time for consummation so it was somewhat more than three months before all the details were complete alora a sadfaced child with no especial interest in life kept no track of time and plodded along in her morningstudies and took her afternoon drives or walks in a perfunctory manner that rendered miss gorhams duties light indeed but all this ended suddenly and jason jones ended it  he came to the rooms one morning and said to the governess in his abrupt way pack up  what do you mean sir was the startled query  just what i say get the childs things and your own ready to move out of this place by saturday also pack the personal belongings of mrs jones put them in separate trunks and boxes so i can have them stored do you understand me  ii shall need assistance gasped the bewildered miss gorham  then get a maidor a porteror bothto help you  alora was present and listened with awakening interest a change of any sort would be pleasant she reflected  where are we going she asked as her father turned away  it was the one question miss gorham wanted to ask too but mr jones left the room without reply  three days was little enough time to gather up and pack the accumulation of years the governess knew there were many big trunks in the storeroom of the hotel belonging to mrs jones and these she ordered brought up to the rooms then she procured two maids told them what and how to pack and composedly resumed her reading  i am no menial she told alora with a lofty air of superiority these persons will do their work properly im sure  on saturday morning mr jones appeared again  is everything ready he demanded  ask susan and jane replied miss gorham  susan and jane declared everything was packed even to the suit cases and traveling satchels  but where are we going inquired the governess  you are going wherever you please said jason jones i do not require your services longer  youre going to discharge me she said startled  you are already discharged  but who will look after poor lory who will attend to her education and totoher comforts  i will here is your money i have paid you a week in advance in lieu of notice  a week pooh im hired by the year asserted the woman defiantly  have you a written contract  no a verbal contract is just as good  it wont hold in law take your traps and goat once  the governess looked at him he was absolutely calm and determined instinctively she knew that any protest would be unavailing  alora regarded the dismissal of her governess with as much unconcern as her father displayed miss gorham had been her companion for years but had never won the smallest corner of the girls heart although she was not aware of the fact the womans constant presence and lack of interest in her had become oppressive the childs first sensation on realizing their future separation was one of distinct relief  when miss gorham had gone seeming to begrudge the terse goodbye she gave her pupil the girls father quietly said come alora and walked away  she followed him to a waiting taxicab in which had been heaped her hand luggage and his own and they drove away from the grand hotel where she had lived in luxury for so long and where so many indelible memories had been impressed upon her childish mind with as little ado as if they had been transient guests  when the cab drew up at a railway station alora asked  are we leaving town then father  yes he replied i am returning to new york  she felt a slight sinking of the heart just then but it was followed by a sense of elation the old life in which her adored mother had played so prominent a part was being abandoned forever and this troubled her she knew not why  but since mamma tone had gone away the old life had lost its charm and become dull and stupid lory was not sure she could be happier elsewhere but her crushed and dispirited nature responded to the suggestion of change it was interesting to have something different to look forward to  the man beside her was no more congenial than gorham had been but he was her father he was the guardian selected by her dead mother and in obeying his wishes she might find her future life more grateful than had been the dreadful dreary months since mamma tone had left her  somehow jason jones seemed uneasy in the presence of his daughter during the journey to new york he rode most of the time in the smoking compartment only appearing to take alora to the diner for her meals the child was equally uncomfortable in her fathers society and was well pleased to be left so much alone  so with very little questioning or conversation on either side father and daughter came to their destination and alora found herself deposited in a small suite of rooms on the third floor of a grimy and dingy house in east sixtyseventh streetone of a long row of similar houses that were neither residences nor business establishments but hovered between the two there were several little tin signs nailed beside the entrance and lory noticed that one of these read jason jones studio 3rd floor it was an old sign scarcely legible while others beside it seemed bright and new and when the girl had climbed laboriously up the three flights and the artist had unlocked the door at the head of the stairs with a key which he took from his pocket she found everything about the rooms she entered as old and faded as the sign on the door    chapter v in the studio  the fact that it was beginning to grow dark prevented alora from observing all the tawdriness of her new home and what she saw inspired her more with curiosity than dismay the little girl had been reared from babyhood in an atmosphere of luxury through environment she had become an aristocrat from the top of her head to the tips of her toes this introduction to shabbiness was unique nor could she yet understand that such surroundings were familiar to many who battle for existence in a big city the very fact that her fathers humble flat was different made it far more interesting to the child than new apartments such as she had been accustomed to therefore she had no thought at this time of protest her own little room contained a small iron bed one straight chair with a wooden bottom and a brokenlegged dresser over which hung a cracked mirror the small rag rug was worn threadbare  while she stood in the doorway of this room solemnly regarding it her father said over her shoulder  you wont need both those big trunks here im sure ill store them somewhere in the studio covered with drapes they wont be noticed i cant imagine what that woman packed them with  my dresses replied alora even then i left a lot at the voltaire for the maids to sell or give away mamma used to send them to the salvation army  two trunks of dresses ought to last for a good many years he remarked in a reflective tone  oh no indeed said lory miss gorham was about to engage a dressmaker for me whenwhenyou said wed go away im growing fast you know and i was to have a dozen or fifteen summer frocks made and a lot of lingerie  then we moved just in time to save that expense he declared setting his stern jaws together theres been a terrible waste of money through that woman gorham were well rid of her  he turned away to the studio and the child followed him there he turned on the electric lights which were not very bright and alora took a look at the workroom and thought it seemed more comfortable than the other rooms of the flat  her father began dusting and arranging half a dozen paintings of various sizes mounted on stretchers none was finished some were scarcely begun lory tried to see what they represented perhaps she had inherited from her mother a bit of artistic instinct if so it was that which prompted her to shrug her small shoulders slightly and then turn away to the window  in the dimly lighted street outside a man drove up with the baggage mr jones had purchased for himself in chicago a new trunka small and inexpensive oneand there were two big trunks and a suitcase belonging to alora after these had been carried up and placed in the studiothe only room that would hold themher father said  we will go out now and get some dinner you wont need your coat for the restaurant is just around the corner  alora marveled at the restaurant even more than at the studio furnishings it looked a hundred years old and the atmosphere still retained the fumes of much ancient cookery the linen was coarse the plating worn from the forks and spoons through constant use the dishes thick and clumsy and well nicked alora was hungry and she ate what her father ordered for her although she decided it did not taste very nice  when they sat down a man from behind the counter approached them and bending low said in a quiet tone  you know jones its to be a cash deal from now on  of course replied aloras father with a slight frown also ill pay you the old account if youll make out the bill  the man smiled patted aloras heada liberty she indignantly resentedand went back to his desk  during the meal and indeed ever since their arrival in new york jason jones cast frequent puzzled glances into the face of his little daughter who until now had accepted her changed conditions with evident indifference but as they ate together in silence her small features grew grave and thoughtful and her father shrank from meeting the inquiring glances of her big eyes yet even now she made no complaint neither did she ask questions her look was expectant however and that was what embarrassed him  after the dinner they went back to the dingy studio where the man lighted a pipe and sat opposite his small daughter puffing uneasily they were both reserved there was an indefinable barrier between them which each was beginning to recognize presently alora asked to go to bed and he sent her to her room with a nod of relief  next morning they had breakfast at the same stuffy little restaurant and afterward alora unpacked some things from her trunks and put them in the drawers of the brokenlegged dresser it seemed odd to have no maid to wait upon her but she was glad to have something to do as she passed to and from the studio she noticed that her father had resumed work on a picture that represented two cows eating a broken pumpkin that lay in a cornfield he worked slowly and never seemed satisfied with what he did as if lacking confidence in his ability lory decided he couldnt be blamed for that  the child plodded drearily along in her new life for a full week then she began to grow restless for the place was hateful and repulsive to her but now an incident occurred that gave her new cause for wonder  one day the door opened and a woman walked into the studio it was janet orme her mothers former nurse but what a new and astonishing janet it was her silken gown was very fashionable somewhat too modish for good taste for it was elaborately trimmed and embroidered she wore considerable jewelry including diamonds her shoes were elegant and her hose daintily clocked her hat must have been a french milliners choicest creation if good clothes could make janet orme a lady there was no question of her social standing yet even little alora felt that janet was out of her elementthat she fell short in some vague way of being what she was ambitious to appear  so said the nurse glancing around the room with frank disdain this is where you hang out jason is it  aloras father confronted the woman with a menacing frown  what do you mean by coming here he demanded  i had two reasons she answered carelessly seating herself in the only easy chair the room contained in the first place i wanted to see how a rich man lives  well you see dont you a muttering growl  i certainly do and i realize you are quite comfortable and ought to be happy here jasonyou and the millionaire heiress your daughter alora  as she spoke she turned to glance sharply at the child who met her look with disconcerting gravity aloras eyes expressed wonder tinged with a haughty tolerance of an inferior that struck home to janet and made her flush angrily  your sneers said jason jones still frowning but now speaking with composure must indicate that you have graduated from servitude i cannot admit that my mode of living is any of your business janet in these retired but respectable rooms i have worked and been contented for years until  until you came into your money and found you didnt have to worry over your next meal she interjected well that ought to make you still more content and that reminds me of the second object of my visit i want some money  so soon  dont try to crawfish it was agreed you should give me a check whenever i asked for it i want it now and for the full amountevery single penny of it  he stared at her fixedly seeming fearful and uncertain how to answer  i cannot spare it all today  humbug she snapped you can and will spare it i must have the money or  her significant pause caused him to wriggle in his seat  youre a miserly coward she declared im not robbing you you will have an abundance for your needs why do you quarrel with dame fortune dont you realize you can pay your rent now and eat three square meals a day and not have to work and slave for them you can smoke a good cigar after your dinner instead of that eternal pipe and go to a picture show whenever the mood strikes you why man youre independent for the first time in your life and the finances are as sure as shooting for a good seven years to come  he glanced uneasily at alora  owing to my dead wifes generosity he muttered  janet laughed  of course said she and if you play your cards skillfuly when alora comes of age she will provide for you an income for the rest of your life youre in luck and why just because you are jason jones and long ago married antoinette seaver and her millions and are now reaping your reward so for decencys sake dont grumble about writing me that check  all this was frankly said in the presence of alora jones the heiress of whose person and fortune her father jason jones was now sole guardian it was not strange that the man seemed annoyed and ill at ease his scowl grew darker and his eyes glinted in an ugly way as he replied after a brief pause  you seem to have forgotten aloras requirements and my duty to her  pooh a child but weve allowed liberally for her keep im sure she cant keep servants and three dressmakers its true but a simple life is best for her shell grow up a more sensible and competent woman by waiting on herself and living as most girls do at her age i didnt have shoes or stockings alora has been spoiled and a bit of worldly experience will do her good  shes going to be very rich when she comes into her fortune said aloras father and then  and then she can do as she likes with her money just now her income is too big for her needs and the best thing you can do for her is to teach her economya virtue you seem to possess whether by nature or training in a high degree but i didnt come here to argue give me that check  he walked over to his little desk sat down and drew a check book from his pocket  alora although she had listened intently to the astonishing conversation did not quite comprehend what it meant janets harsh statement bewildered her as much as did her fathers subject subservience to the woman all she realized was that janet orme her dead mothers nurse wanted moneyaloras moneyand her father was reluctant to give it to her but dared not refuse money was an abstract quantity to the eleven year old child she had never handled it personally and knew nothing of its value if her father owed janet some of her money perhaps it was for wages or services rendered her mother and alora was annoyed that he haggled about it even though the woman evidently demanded more than was just there was plenty of money she believed and it was undignified to argue with a servant  jason jones wrote the check and rising handed it to janet  there said he that squares our account it is what i agreed to give you but i did not think you would demand it so soon to pay it just now leaves me in an embarrassing position  i dont believe it she rejoined youre cutting coupons every month or so and you may thank your stars i dont demand a statement of your income but i know you jason jones and you cant hoodwink me try as you may you hid yourself in this hole and thought i wouldnt know where to find you but youll soon learn that you cant escape my eagle eye so take your medicine like a man and thank your lucky stars that youre no longer a struggling starving unrecognized artist goodbye until i call again  youre not to call again he objected  well well see just for the present im in no mood to quarrel with you and youd better not quarrel with me jason jones goodbye  she tucked the check into her purse and ambled out of the room after a supercilious nod to alora who failed to return the salutation jason jones stood in his place still frowning until janets highheeled shoes had clattered down the two flights of stairs alora went to the window and looking down saw that a handsome automobile stood before the house with a chauffeur and footman in livery janet entered this automobile and was driven away  alora turned to look at her father he was filing his pipe and scowling more darkly than ever    chapter vi flitting  once more they moved suddenly and the second flitting came about in this way  alora stood beside the easel one morning watching her father work on his picture not that she was especially interested in him or the picture but there was nothing else for her to do she stood with her slim legs apart her hands clasped behind her staring rather vacantly when he looked up and noted her presence  well what do you think of it he asked rather sharply  of the picture said lory  of course  i dont like it she asserted with childish frankness  eh you dont like it why not girl  well she replied her eyes narrowing critically that cows horn isnt on straightthe red cows left horn and its the same size all the way up  he laid down his palette and brush and gazed at his picture for a long time the scowl came on his face again usually his face was stolid and expressionless but alora had begun to observe that whenever anything irritated or disturbed him he scowled and the measure of the scowl indicated to what extent he was annoyed when he scowled at his own unfinished picture lory decided he was honest enough to agree with her criticism of it  finally the artist took a claspknife from his pocket opened the blade and deliberately slashed the picture from top to bottom this way and that until it was a mere mass of shreds then he kicked the stretcher into a corner and brought out another picture which he placed on the easel  well how about that he asked looking hard at it himself  alora was somewhat frightened at having caused the destruction of the cow picture so she hesitated before replying iid rather not say  how funny he said musingly but until now i never realized how stiff and unreal the daub is shall i finish it alora  i think so sir she answered  again the knife slashed through the canvas and the remains joined the scrapheap in the corner  jason jones was not scowling any more instead there was a hint of a humorous expression on his usually dull features only pausing to light his pipe he brought out one after another of his canvases and after a critical look destroyed each and every one  lory was perplexed at the mad act for although her judgment told her they were not worth keeping she realized that her father must have passed many laborious hours on them but now that it had dawned on him how utterly inartistic his work was in humiliation and disgust he had wiped it out of existence with this thought in mind the girl was honestly sorry him  but jason jones did not seem sorry when the last ruined canvas had been contemptuously flung into the corner he turned to the child and said to her in a voice so cheerful that it positively startled her  get your hat and lets take a walk an artists studio is no place for us lory doesnt it seem deadly dull in here and outside the sun is shining  the rest of the day he behaved much like a human being he took the girl to the park to see the zoo and bought her popcorn and peanutsa wild extravagance for him later in the day they went to a picture show and finally entered a downtown restaurant quite different from and altogether better than the one where they had always before eaten and enjoyed a really good dinner when they left the restaurant he was still in the restless and reckless mood that had dominated him and said  suppose we go to a theatre wont you like that better than you would returning to our poky rooms  yes indeed responded alora  they had seats in the gallery but could see very well just before the curtain rose alora noticed a party being seated in one of the boxes the lady nearest the rail dressed in an elaborate evening gown was janet orme there was another lady with her conspicuous for blonde hair and much jewelry and the two gentlemen who accompanied them kept in the background as if not too proud of their company  alora glanced at her fathers face and saw the scowl there for he too had noted the boxparty but neither of the two made any remark and soon the child was fully absorbed in the play  as they left the theatre janets party was entering an automobile laughing and chatting gaily both father and daughter silently watched them depart and then they took a street car and went home  get to bed girl said jason jones when they had mounted the stairs ill smoke another pipe i guess  when she came out of her room next morning she heard her father stirring in the studio she went to him and was surprised to find him packing his trunk which he had drawn into the middle of the room  now that youre up said he in quite a cheerful tone well go to breakfast and then ill help you pack your own duds only one trunk though girl for the other must go into storage and you may see it again some time and you may not  are we going away she inquired hoping it might be true  we are were going a long way my girl do you care  of course said she amazed at the question for he had never considered her in the least im glad i dont like your studio  he laughed and the laugh shocked her she could not remember ever to have heard jason jones laugh before  i dont like the place either girl and thats why im leaving it for good this time i was a fool to return here in trying to economise i proved extravagant  alora did not reply to that she was eager to begin packing and hurried through her breakfast all the things she might need on a journey she put into one trunk she was not quite sure what she ought to take and her father was still more ignorant concerning a little girls wardrobe but finally both trunks were packed and locked and then mr jones called a wagon and carted away the extra trunk of aloras and several boxes of his own to be deposited in a storage warehouse  she sat in the bare studio and waited for his return the monotony of the past weeks which had grown oppressive was about to end and for this she was very grateful for from a life of luxury the child had been dumped into a gloomy studio in the heart of a big bustling city that was all unknown to her and where she had not a single friend or acquaintance her only companion had been a strange man who happened to be her father but displayed no affection for her no spark of interest in her happiness or even comforts for the first time in her life she lacked a maid to dress her and keep her clothes in order there was no one to attend to her education no one to amuse her no one with whom to counsel in any difficulty she had been somewhat afraid of her peculiar father and her natural reserve derived from her mother had deepened in his society yesterday and this morning he had seemed more human more companionable yet alora felt that it was due to a selfish elation and recognized a gulf between them that might never be bridged her father differed utterly from her mother in breeding in intelligence in sympathy he was not of the same world even the child could realize that and yet he was her fatherall she had left to depend upon to cling to she wondered if he really possessed the good qualities her mother had attributed to him if so when she knew him better she might learn to like him  he was gone a long time it seemed but as soon as he returned the remaining baggage was loaded on the wagon and sent away and then they left the flat and boarded a street car for down town on lower broadway mr jones entered a bank and seemed to transact considerable business lory saw him receive several papers and a lot of money then they went to a steamship office near by where her father purchased tickets  afterward they had lunch and jason jones was still in high spirits and seemed more eager and excited than alora had ever before known him  were going across the big waterto europe he told her at luncheon so if there is anything you positively need for the trip tell me what it is and ill buy it no frivolities though qualifying his generosity but just stern necessities and you must think quick for our boat leaves at four oclock and weve no time to waste  but alora shook her head once she had been taken by her mother to london paris and rome but all her wants had been attended to and it was so long agofour or five yearsthat that voyage was now but a dim remembrance  no one noticed them when they went aboard there was no one to see them off or to wish them bon voyage it saddened the child to hear the fervent goodbyes of others for it emphasized her own loneliness  yes quite friendless was little alora she was going to a foreign land with no companion but a strange and uncongenial man whom fate had imposed upon her in the guise of a parent as they steamed out to sea and alora sat on deck and watched the receding shores of america she turned to her father with the first question she had ventured to ask  where are we going to london  not now he replied this ship is bound for the port of naples i didnt pick naples you know but took the first ship sailing today having made up my mind to travel i couldnt wait he added with a chuckle of glee youre not particular as to where we go are you  no said alora  thats lucky he rejoined for it wouldnt have made any difference anyhow    chapter vii mary louise intrudes  it was four years later when on a sunny afternoon in april a carriage broke down on the amalfi road between positano and sorrento in italy a wheel crumpled up and the driver stopped his horses and explained to his passengers in a jumble of mixed italian and english that he could go no farther the passengers an old gentleman of distinguished appearance and a young girl as fresh and lovely as a breath of spring clambered out of the rickety vehicle and after examining the wheel admitted that their driver spoke truly on one side the road was a steep descent to the sea opposite the hillside was masked by a trellis thick with grapevines the road curved around the mountain so there was no other vista  heres a nice fix granpa jim exclaimed the girl with an amused laugh where are we and whats going to become of us  that is somewhat of a complicated problem mary louise and i cant guess it offhand without due reflection replied granpa jim whom others called colonel hathaway i imagine however that we are about three miles from positano and five or six from sorrento and its a stiff walk for old legs or young in either direction besides theres our luggage which i am loth to abandon and disinclined to carry  the driver interposed  givea me the moment signoreperhaps the houran i return to positano for more carriagewheelsome other my cousin luigi he leeve in positano an luigi have amany carriagewheel in hes shed i sure signore i getta the wheel  that is a sensible idea said the old gentleman make haste my man and we will wait here  the driver unhitched his horses from the vehicle and after strapping a blanket on one of them for a saddle mounted it and departed  i takea the two horse he explained for one to ridea me an one for to ridea the wheel  they watched him amble away down the road and mary louise shook her head and remarked  he will never make it in an hour at that rate granpa jim and in two hours the sun will have set and it will be dinner time already i feel the pangs of hunger  those who travel in italy said her grandfather should be prepared to accept any happening in a spirit of resignation a moment ago we were jogging merrily along toward a good hotel and a savory dinner but now  this entire carriage seems ready to fall apart declared the girl standing in the road and viewing the ancient vehicle critically so its a wonder something didnt break sooner now if we could get to the other side of that trellis granpa jim we might find a shady spot to rest while our charioteer is searching for a new wheel  there must be a gate somewhere about he answered eyeing the vineclad barrier come mary louise let us investigate  a hundred yards down the road they came to some rude stone steps and a wicket the old gentleman lifted the wooden latch and found the gate unlocked followed by mary louise he entered the vineyard and discovered a narrow wellbeaten path leading up the hillside  perhaps there is a house near by said the girl shall we go on granpa jim  why not my dear these italians are hospitable folk and we may get a cake and a cup of goats milk to stay our appetite  so they climbed the hill following the little path and presently came upon a laborer who was very deliberately but methodically cultivating the vines with a vshaped hoe seeing the strangers the man straightened up and leaning upon his hoe eyed them with evident suspicion  good afternoon said the old gentleman in italianone of the few phrases in the language he had mastered  oh i speak the english signore replied the man doffing his hat i am silvio allegheri you must know and i live in america some time  why this is like meeting an old friend exclaimed mary louise winning the fellow instantly with her smile but why did you leave america silvio  because i have make my fortune there was the solemn reply it is easy to make the fortune in america signorina i am chef in the restaurant in sanduskyyou know sanduskymost excellent in a few years i save much money then i return here an purchase an estate my estate is three miles across the hill yonder and there is a road to it which is not much used however it is a fine estate an i am rent it to my cousin for five hundred lira a year such good business habit i learn in america  why dont you live on your estate yourself inquired the girl  it is not yet the time answered the man with a shake of his head i am but fiftytwo years alive and while i am still so young i shall work for others and save the money my estate brings me when i get old and can no longer work for the others then i will go to my estate an be happy  very sensible commented the old gentleman and whom do you work for now  the student americano signore the one who has rented this valuable estate i am the signore students valet his gardener and at times his chef i grease his automobile which is a very small chugchug but respectable and i clean his shoeswhen i can catch him with them off i am valuable to him and for three years he has paid me fair wages  is this a big estate asked mary louise  enormous signorina it comprises three acres  and where is the house  just over the hill yonder signore  does the student americano live here all alone  with his daughter who is the signorina alora  oh there is a daughter then and you say they are americans  surely signorina who else would pay the great price for this estate for three years the land pays nothing backa few oranges some grapes when they are cared for a handful of almonds and olives and there is a servant besides myself my niece leona who is housemaid and assists the young lady  this sounds promising said mary louise turning to her grandfather suppose we go up to the house are the people at home silviothe signore student and his daughter  the man reflected leaning on his hoe  i think they are both at the mansion signorina although the student americano may not yet have returned from sorrento the road to the mansion is beyond the hill on the other side of the estate so i am not sure the signore student has returned but you will find the signorina alora there if you decide to venture on but perhaps you are the friends of my employer and his daughter  what is his name asked colonel hathaway  it is jones the american saying is mister jason jones but here he is only called the signore student americano  why asked mary louise  because his occupation is reading he does nothing else always there is a book in his hand and always he is thinking of the things he reads he does not often speak even to his daughter he does not have friends who visit him if you should call at the mansion then you will be the first people who have done so for three years  there was something in this reportin the manner of the man as well as his wordsthat caused the strangers to hesitate the description of the student led them to suspect he was a recluse who might not welcome them cordially but mary louise reflected that there was a daughter and decided that any american girl shut up on this threeacre estate for three years would be glad to meet another american girl so she said abruptly  come on granpa jim lets call it is possible that americans will have something better in the larder than cakes and goats milk  the hilltop was reached sooner than they expected and in a little vale was the old mansiona really attractive vineclad villa that might have stood a century or so it was not very big but there were numerous outbuildings which rendered the size of the house proper unimportant as mary louise and her grandfather drew nearer they discovered a charming flower garden carefully tended and were not surprised to find a young girl bending over a rosebush    chapter viii mary louise meets alora  the two stood motionless a moment looking at the girl and mary louise marked the graceful figure and attractive features with real delight the signorina alora as the man had called her was nearly her own agefifteen mary louise judged her to beand her golden hair and fair complexion proclaimed her an american but now the girls quick ears had detected presence and she looked up with a startled expression half fearful and half shy and turned as if to fly but in the next moment she had collected herself and advanced with hesitating steps to meet them  pardon our intrusion said colonel hathaway raising his hat our carriage broke down on the amalfi road a little while ago and our driver has gone to positano for a new wheel meantime we were exploring our surroundings and stumbled upon the path leading to this spot forgive the trespass if you will and allow me to present my granddaughter mary louise burrows i am colonel james hathaway of new york although we usually reside at a little town called dorfield  the girls bow was stiff and awkward she blushed in an embarrassed way as she replied  i am alora jones sir and am living here for a time with my father jason jones we also are americans at least we used to be  then doubtless you are yet responded the colonel with a smile may we pay our respects to your father  hehe is not home yet she answered more embarrassed than before he went to sorrento for some books this morning and has not yet returned but perhaps he will be back soon she added seeming to ponder the matter will you not come in andand have some refreshment in my fathers absence ii am glad towelcome you  she glanced shyly at mary louise as if to implore her to forgive any seeming lack of hospitality and accept her coldly worded invitation no one could look at mary louise without gaining confidence and the friendly smile and warm handclasp made alora feel instantly that here was a girl who would prove congenial under any circumstances really it would not take them long to become friends and poor alora had no girl friends whatever  she led them into a cool and comfortable living room and called to leona to fetch tea and biscuits  we are entirely shut in here she explained it seems to me worse than a convent for there i would see other girls while here i see no one but the servantsand my father as an afterthought year in and year out  its a pretty place declared mary louise cheerfully  but its an awfully dreary place too and sometimes i feel that id like to run awayif i knew where to go said alora frankly  you have lived here three years asked colonel hathaway  yes we left new york more than four years ago and traveled a year in different places always stopping at the little towns where there is not much to interest one then my father found this place and rented it and here weve stayedi cant say livedever since i get along pretty well in the daytime with my flowers and the chickens to tend but the evenings are horribly lonely sometimes i feel that i shall go mad  mary louise marked her wild look and excited manner and her heart went out in sympathy to the lonely girl colonel hathaway too intuitively recognized aloras plaint as a human cry for help and did not need to guess the explanation the man in the vineyard had called her father the student and said he was a reserved man and never was seen without a book in his hand this would mean that he was not companionable and aloras protest plainly indicated that her father devoted small time if any to the cultivation of his daughters society  i suppose remarked the old gentleman that mr jones is so immersed in his studies that he forgets his daughter lacks society am amusement  mary louise caught the slight scornful smile that for a moment curled aloras lips but the girl replied very seriously  my father dislikes society i believe he would be quite content to live in this little coopedup place forever and see no one but the servants to whom he seldom speaks also he ignores me and i am glad he does but before my mother died her voice breaking a little i was greatly loved and petted and i cant get used to the change i ought not to say this to strangers i know but i am very lonely and unhappy becausebecause my father is so different from what my mother was  mary louise was holding her trembling hand now and stroking it sympathetically  tell us about your mother she said softly is it long since you lost her  more than four years returned alora i was her constant companion and she taught me to love art and music and such things for art was her hobby i did not know my father in those days you see forfor they did not live together but in her last illness mamma sent for him and made him my guardian my mother said that my father would love me but she must have misjudged him  colonel hathaway had listened with interest  tell me your mothers name said he  she was mrs antoinette seaver jones and  indeed exclaimed the colonel why i knew antoinette seaver before she married and a more beautiful and cultured woman i never met her father captain seaver was my friend and i met his daughter several times both at his mining camp and in the city so you see my dear we must be friends  aloras eyes fairly glistened with delight and mary louise was as pleased as she was surprised  of course were friends she cried pressing the girls hand and isnt it queer we have come together in this singular manner in a foreign country and just because our carriagewheel happened to break  i thought your mother married an artist said mary louises grandfather reflectively  she did at least she thought jason jones was an artist answered alora with bitter emphasis but he was in fact a mere dauber he became discouraged in his attempts to paint and soon after he took me to new york he destroyed all his workreally it was dreadfuland since then he has never touched a brush  that is strange mused the colonel i once saw a landscape by jason jones that was considered a fine conception skillfully executed that was the opinion of so good a judge as captain seaver himself therefore for some reason the mans genius must have forsaken him  i think that is true agreed alora for my mothers estimate of art was undoubtedly correct i have read somewhere that discouragement sometimes destroys ones talent though in after years with proper impulse it may return with added strength in my fathers case she explained he was not able to sell his workand no wonder so now he does nothing at all but read and even that doesnt seem to amuse him much  the colonel had now remembered that antoinette seaver jones was a woman of great wealth and therefore her daughter must be an heiress what a shame to keep the girl hidden in this outoftheway place when she should be preparing to assume an important position in the world  may i ask your age my dear he said  i am fifteen sir replied alora  and your father is the guardian of your fortune  yes by my mothers wish  i suppose you are receiving proper instruction  none at all sir since i have been in my fathers care i have had no instruction whatever that isnt right is it  what isnt right demanded a gruff voice and all three turned to find jason jones standing in the doorway    chapter ix mary louise scents a mystery  colonel hathaway instantly rose  i beg your pardon said he i am colonel james hathaway an american and this is my granddaughter mary louise burrows our carriage met with an accident on the main road below and we wandered in here while waiting for repairs and chanced to meet your daughter you are mr jones i believe  he nodded still standing in his place and regarding his visitors with unconcealed suspicion under his arm he held several books  who informed you that i was living here he demanded  i was wholly unaware of the fact said the colonel stiffly i did not know you were in italy i did not know such an important person existed strange to say although i can remember that an artist named jason jones once married antoinette seaver the daughter of my old friend captain robert seaver  oh you remember that do you  this is the first time i have had the distinguished honor of meeting you sir and i trust it will be the last time  thats all right said jason jones more cordially i cant see that its any of my affair either way  we have been making the acquaintance of tony seavers daughter miss alora jones in your absence but we will not intrude farther mr jones come mary louise  oh dont go pleaded alora catching mary louises arm and just then leona entered with the tea and biscuits  sit down man said jason jones in a less aggressive tone ive no objection to your coming here under the circumstances and you are our first visitors in three years thats often enough but now that you are here make yourself at home whats happening over in america have you been there lately  he laid his books on a table and sat down but after that one speech which he perhaps considered conciliatory he remained glum and allowed the others to do the talking  colonel hathaway had stayed because he noted the leading look in mary louises eyes he was himself interested in alora and indignant over her evident neglect for her sake he would bear the insolence of his host an insolence he recognized as characteristic of the man  alora in her fathers presence lost her fluent speech and no longer dared mention personal matters to her guests both mary louise and her grandfather tried to lead alora and jason jones to speak of themselvesof their life and future plansbut the man evaded direct answers and the girl had suddenly become silent and reserved  finally however mary louise had an idea  we are bound for sorrento said she where we intend to stay a week at the hotel vittoria will you let alora come to us for ever sunday as our guest we will drive here and get her the day after tomorrow thats saturday you knowand fetch her home on monday  no said jason jones  oh why not father pleaded the girl  youve no fit clothes i dont want you hanging around sorrento he replied  it will be a nice change for your daughter and it will give us much pleasure to entertain her said mary louise  its a capital idea declared the colonel positively and looking the other man straight in the eye he added i am sure you will withdraw your objections mr jones  the man dropped his eyes frowning but presently he said to alora  go if you want to but keep out of the town dont leave the hotel grounds  why not asked his daughter in a defiant tone  its not safe i know sorrento and these rascally italians would be glad to steal you if they had the chance and then blackmail me a ransom  mary louise laughed  what a fine adventure that would be she exclaimed but we will promise to guard alora and keep her from the clutches of bandits i didnt know there were any left in italy  to get rid of them youd have to depopulate the country said jason jones it is no laughing matter young woman andmy daughter is somewhat valuable    chapter x mere speculation  the driver returned with the wheel it fitted the axle but was some two or three inches larger in diameter than the other rear wheel and moreover it was flat on one side so that when they started to conclude their journey the motion of the carriage was something startlinga rockabye baby ride mary louise called it  but the wheels turned and the carriage progressed and when they were well on their way the girl said  what do you think of that man granpa jim  do you mean aloras father jason jones  yes of course  i am surprised at two things said the old colonel first it is curious that tony seaver a rarely cultured woman should have married such a man and again it is amazing that she should have confided her daughter and her fortune to his care  do you know observed mary louise sliding closer to him and dropping her voice although there was absolutely no chance of being overheard i scent a mystery in that family granpa jim  that seems to be one of your regular diversionsto scent mysteries he replied and usually my dear the suspicion is unwarranted the most commonplace people frequently impress you with the idea that they are other than what they seem are leading double lives or are endeavoring to conceal some irregularity of conduct youve a faculty of reading the natures and characteristics of strangers by studying their eyes their facial expressions and their oddities of demeanor which is interesting psychologically but too often  you are unjust granpa declared mary louise indignantly didnt you yourself say there are two curious and surprising things about this man jones  not exactly i said it was curious and astonishing that antoinette seaver should have trusted so fully a man who impresses me as a churl his own child little alora appears to dislike and even to despise him and  there cried mary louise im vindicated your observations fully justify my remark that theres a mystery in that family did you notice the books he brought home and laid upon the table  no said colonel hathaway rather bewildered  they were novels by marie correlli h g wells and o henry a student then a student of modern novels a man who reads and reads to keep his mind from dwelling on past history he is a disappointed artist to begin with  that is certainly odd rejoined the old gentleman reflectively the one picture i ever saw by jason jones was certainly good i remember that once when i was lunching with bob seaverthat was antoinettes father you knowhe told me his daughter was interested in a young artist of exceptional talent and he took me to a gallery to show me what this man could do i am not an art critic as you are aware my dear but this landscape of jason jones appealed to me as delightful captain bob knew art and so did antoinette so it is evident that jones could paint but for some reason became dissatisfied with his work and abandoned it perhaps his ambition was too lofty for human skill to realize yet nothing less would content him  mary louise sat silent for a while then she asked  did jason jones impress you as a man capable of a great ambition would you guess him an artist who had once accomplished admirable things  artists are always peculiar stated her grandfather they must be temperamental in order to be artists and temperaments differ widely had i not known something of jason jones history i might have felt on making his acquaintance today that he is not an ordinary man for gruff and churlish though he proved it is undeniable that he has selected a charming and retired spot in which to live  or to hide she interrupted  or that with considerable wealth at his command he lives simply and unostentatiously enjoying natures choice gifts and content with the simple life he leads with only the society of his young daughter  whom he neglects and refuses to educate properly declared the girl what makes you think he is wealthy  i know that antoinette made millions after her father died from the mines by current report she retired and invested her money wisely in sound securities which accords with her excellent business reputation her daughter not being of agelet me see she must have been but eleven when her mother passed awaythere would be a guardian appointed for the heiress and alora told us that it was her mothers wish that her father act as her guardian so the conclusion is evident that mr jones has a large income at his command  all the more reason he should be generous but he isnt spending much of it said mary louise  no he is probably living simply in order that his daughters fortune may increase during the years of her minority that is a point in his favor you must admit  nevertheless asserted the young girl i think there is something wrong in the jones family it isnt due to alora shes a dear little thing wild and untamed but very lovable im sure so the fault must lie with her boorish father allowing that once he was a big man something has mysteriously soured him and rendered his life hateful not only to himself but to all around him  look mary louise were getting into sorrento said the colonel here the road leaves the sea and crosses the plateau to the town youll like sorrento im sure for it is one of the quaintest places in old italyand the hotel is really comfortable    chapter xi alora speaks frankly  on saturday forenoon the colonel engaged a carriagea substantial one this timeand with mary louise drove to jason jones villa so that alora might return with them in time for lunch they did not see the artist who was somewhere about the grounds but kept out of view but alora was ready and waiting her cheeks flushed and her eyes alight and she slipped her foreign little straw satchel in the carriage and then quickly followed it as if eager to be off  father is rather disagreeable this morning she asserted in a sharp voice when they were on the highway to sorrento he repented his decision to let me go with you and almost forbade me but i rebelled and she paused i have found that when i assert myself i can usually win my way for father is a coward at heart  it pained mary louise to hear so unfilial a speech from the lips of a young girl colonel hathaways face showed that he too considered it unmannerly to criticise a parent in the presence of strangers but both reflected that aloras life and environments were unenviable and that she had lacked in these later years at least the careful training due one in her station in society so they deftly changed the subject and led the girl to speak of italy and its delightful scenery and romantic history alora knew little of the country outside of the sorrento peninsula but her appreciation of nature was artistic and innately true and she talked well and interestingly of the surrounding country and the quaint and amusing customs of its inhabitants  how long do you expect to remain here asked mary louise  ive no idea was the reply father seems entirely satisfied with our quarters for he has no ambition in life beyond eating three simple meals a day sleeping from nine at night until nine in the morning and reading all the romances he is able to procure he corresponds with no one save his banker in america and sees no one but the servants and me but to me the monotony of our existence is fast becoming unbearable and i often wonder if i can stand it for three years longeruntil im eighteen then i shall be my own mistress and entitled to handle my own money and you may rest assured i shall make up for lost time  they let that remark pass also but later in the afternoon when luncheon was over and the two girls were wandering in the lovely gardens of the hotel vittoria while the colonel indulged in an afternoon siesta mary louise led alora to speak freely of her past life  my grandfather says that your mother must have left you a good deal of money she remarked  yes mamma told me it was a large fortune and that i must guard it wisely and use it generously to help others less favored replied alora thoughtfully  and she left it all in your fathers keeping  not the principal that is all invested and thank goodness my father cannot touch it in any way but the income is paid to him regularly and he may do as he pleases with it i am sure mamma expected i would have every reasonable wish gratified and be taught every womanly accomplishment but im treated as a mere dependent im almost destitute of proper clothingreally mary louise this is the best dress i possessand ive been obliged to educate myself making a rather poor job of it i fear i read the best of fathers books when he is done with them and note carefully the manner in which the characters express themselves and how they conduct themselves in society as well as in worldly contact i do not wish to be wholly gauche when i come into my kingdom you see and the books are my only salvation i dont care much for the stories but some of the good writers are safe guides to follow in the matter of dialogue and deportment fortunately fathers books are all in english he doesnt understand much italian although i have learned to speak the language like a nativelike our native servants you know  mary louise reflected on this confession im afraid alora dear that modern novels are not prone to teach morality or to develop a girls finer intuitions she said gravely i think you express yourself very wellbetter than i do indeedbut you need association with those who can convey to you the right principles of thought and thus encourage your mental development culture and refinement seem to come more from association than from books although there is an innate tendency in all wellborn people to acquire them spontaneously but there youll accuse me of preaching and after all i think youve done just splendidly under rather trying circumstances  you dont know how trying they are declared alora with a sigh father and i are wholly uncongenial and we fight on the slightest provocation this morning our trouble was over money i wanted a little to take with me for my purse hasnt a lira in it but no not a centisimo would he give up he insisted that if i was to be your guest you would pay all my expenses  of course said mary louise but what does he do with all that big income is he saving it for you  no indeed hes saving it for himself mamma told me the last time i saw her before she died that if father was good to me and kind and loving i could provide for him in some way after i came into my money she said she would leave the manner of it to my judgment but he isnt kind or loving or good and knows very well that when im of age hell never see another cent of my money so now hed hoarding my income for future use  isnt it strange that your mother should have trusted him so fully asked mary louise  yes it does seem strange i remember her saying that he loved luxury and all the comfort that money will buy and so she wanted him to have this income to spend because he was my father and because she felt she had ruined his career as an artist by surrounding him with luxuries during their early married life and afterward had embittered him by depriving him of them but the man doesnt know what luxury means mary louise his tastes are those of a peasant  yet once your mother loved him and believed in him  ii think she believed in him im quite sure she did  then his nature must have changed i can imagine alora that when your mother first knew him he was hardworking and ambitious he was talented too and that promised future fame but when he married a wealthy woman he lost his ambition success being no longer necessary after a period of ease and comfort in the society of his lovely wife for granpa says your mother was very lovelyhe lost both the wife and the luxuries he enjoyed a big man alora would have developed a new ambition but it seems your father was not big his return to poverty after your mothers desertion made him bitter and reckless perhaps it dulled his brain and that is why he is no longer able to do good work he was utterly crushed i imagine and hadnt the stamina to recover his former poise he must have been ten years or so in this condition despairing and disinterested when the wheel of fortune turned and he was again in the possession of wealth he had now the means to live as he pleased but those years had so changed him that he couldnt respond to the new conditions doubtless he was glad in a way but he was now content merely to exist doesnt that seem logical alora  indeed mary louise was delighted with her solution of the problem it was in keeping with her talent for deducing the truth from meagre facts by logically putting them together and considering them as a whole it was seldom she erred in these deductions but alora seemed unimpressed and noting her glum look mary louise said again doesnt all this seem logical dear  no said alora father isnt the man to be crushed by anything hes shrewd enough in his bourgeois way once long agoback in new yorka woman made him give her money it was money you know and i have often thought he ran away from america to escape her further demands  who was the woman  my mothers nurse  oh was it her wages she demanded  perhaps so i may have misjudged father in that case but it seemed to mei was a mere child thenthat it must have been a larger sum than wages would have amounted to yet perhaps not anyhow he left america right afterward and when we had wandered a year or so in various countries we settled down here  wont he have to account for all the money he has spent and given away when you come of age inquired mary louise  no mother distinctly told me i was to ask for no accounting whatever her will says he is to handle the income as he sees fit just as if it were his own so long as he provides properly for his daughter and treats her with fatherly consideration thats the only reason he keeps me with him guarding my person but neglecting the other injunctions if he set me adrift as im sure hed like to do i could appeal to the court and his income would cease and another guardian be appointed i believe there is something of that sort in the will and that is why he is so afraid of losing me but he gives me no chance to appeal to anyone although i sometimes think i shall run away and leave him in the lurch if i could get to chicago and tell judge bernsted my mothers lawyer how i am treated i believe he could make the court set aside my fathers guardianship but i cant get ten miles away from here for lack of money  how your dear mother would grieve if she knew her plans for your happiness have failed exclaimed mary louise  alora frowned and somehow that frown reminded mary louise of the girls father  my mother ought to have known my father better she declared sullenly i must not criticize her judgment for her memory is my most precious possession and i know she loved me devotedly but there is one thing in her history i can never understand  and that questioned mary louise curiously as alora paused  my mother was an educated woman wellbred and refined  yes granpa jim told me that  then how could she have married my father who is not a gentleman and never could have impressed a lady with the notion he was one  mary louise hesitated for to admit this would send her deductions so carefully constructed tumbling in ruins but alora ought to know the man  if that is true dear said she it is the strangest part of your story and of course we can only guess the reason for the only one who could have explained it properly was your mother    chapter xi jason jones is frightened  when alora had retired to her bedroom that night mary louise told to her grandfather who was her trusted confidant all that the unhappy girl had related  of course she added aloras explanations dispel my half formed suspicion that there is some mystery about jason jones i now see that you were right granpa jim to laugh at me when i suggested such a thing for in truth the man is easily understood once you become acquainted with his history however i now dislike him more than ever  in justice to jason jones remarked the old colonel we must acquit him of being a hypocrite he doesnt attempt to mask his nature and a stranger is bound to see him at his worst doubtless antoinette seaver understood the man better than we are able to and sixteen years ago or so when he had youth talent and ambition his disagreeable characteristics were probably not so marked as for alora she is strongly prejudiced against her father and we must make due allowance for her bitterness the feeling probably arose through her sudden transfer from the care of a generous and loving mother to that of an ungracious fathera parent she had never before known a child of eleven is likely to form strong affections and passionate dislikes  do you know said mary louise it shocks me this hatred of her father it seems so unnatural i wish we could bring them to understand one another better granpa jim  that might prove a difficult task my dear he replied with a smile gently stroking her hair the while and i do not think we are justified in undertaking it how many times during our travels mary louise has your impulsive and tender heart urged you to assume the burdens of other people you seem to pick up a trail of sorrow or unhappiness with the eagerness of a bloodhound and i have all i can do to call you off the scent one small girl cant regulate the world you know and in this case we are likely to see very little of alora jones and her artist father we will be nice to them during the few days we are here but we must soon move on or well never get home for your birthday as we have planned  mary louise sighed  youre almost always right granpa jim she admitted but in all our european travels ive not met so interesting a person as alora and shes an american girl which draws us still closer together im going to make her promise that when shes of age and her own mistress she will let me know and come to us for a visit wouldnt that be all right granpa  he assured her it would be quite proper and that he also admired alora and was sorry for her  on sunday forenoon they went to the cathedral and in the afternoon took a boat to the blue grottoes in the evening there was a concert in the hotel all that day the two girls were arm in arm and chatting together developing their mutual liking while the old colonel trudged along in their wake and was generally ignored in the conversation on monday they planned an excursion to capri for you wont mind if we dont get you home until after dinner will you asked mary louise  not at all said alora i want to make the most of this vacation  her father may mind however suggested the colonel  i dont care whether he does or not retorted the girl tossing her head he has no consideration for me so why should i consider him  i dont like that attitude dear said mary louise frankly ii dont wish to be snippy you know but you should not forget that he is your father  that replied alora doggedly is merely my misfortune and im not going to allow it to ruin all my life  on monday morning they had scarcely finished breakfast when jason jones appeared at the hotel having driven over from the villa in his little automobilea tiny foreign contrivance that reminded one of a childs cart but could cover the ground with considerable speed they were sitting on the big piazza when aloras father came striding up to them with a white fearstruck face in his trembling hands he held the morning naples newspaper and without a word of greeting he said abruptly  have you heard the news  colonel hathaway rose and bowed  good morning mr jones said he i do not read the local newspapers for my knowledge of italian is indifferent  so is mine responded the artist but i know enough of their lingo to make out that italy has entered this fool war shes going to fight the austrians he continued his voice shaking nervously and do you know what that will mean sir  i cant imagine replied the colonel calmly  it means that presently well have all that horde of germans overrunning italy theyll conquer this helpless land as sure as fate and well all be burned out and tortured and mutilated in the fiendish german way  my dear sir you are frightened without warrant declared colonel hathaway it will take some time to conquer italy and i cannot imagine the austrians acting as you suggest  back of the austrians are the germans and those prussians are worse than wild american indians insisted jones if they got their clutches on my daughter it would be more horrible than death and i dont propose to leave her in danger a single minute im going to quit this country ive come for alora we must pack up and catch the first ship from naples for america  there was blank silence for a moment  im not afraid said alora with a laugh but if it means our getting out of this tiresome place and sailing for home im glad that italys gone into the war  colonel hathaway was grave and thoughtful the agitation of the artist seemed to increase with every moment  when does the next boat for america leave naples asked mary louise  tuesday said aloras father weve just time to pack our possessions and leave  time cried his daughter why i can pack all my possessions in an hour go home sir and fuss around as much as you like ill join you some time this evening  he gave her a queer look hesitating  we are surely safe enough for the present remarked the colonel the first act of war will be to send all the soldiers to the north border the fighting will be done in the trentino for some time to come  you dont know these people said jones shifting uneasily from one foot to another theyre all brigands by nature and many of them by profession as soon as the soldiers are sent north all law and order will cease and brigandage will be the order of the day  this is absurd exclaimed the colonel testily youre not talking sense  thats a matter of opinion sir but i know my own business and im going to get out of here  wait a week longer suggested mary louise we are to sail ourselves on the boat that leaves naples a week from tuesday and it will be nice for alora and me to travel home together  no i wont wait get your things alora and come with me at once  have you made reservations on the boat inquired colonel hathaway refusing to be annoyed by the mans brusque words and rough demeanor  ill do that at once by telephone thats one reason i came over ill telephone the steamship office while the girl is getting ready  i will go with you said the colonel as the artist turned away  while jones used the telephone booth of the hotel colonel hathaway conversed with the proprietor and afterward with the hall porter who was better posted and spoke better english  this is outrageous roared the artist furiously bursting from the booth tomorrows boat is abandoned the government requires it as a transport why why why and he wrung his hands despairingly  i do not know sir returned the colonel smiling at his futile passion  the smile seemed to strike jones like a blow he stopped abruptly and stared at the other man for a full minuteintently suspiciously then he relaxed  youre right said he coldly its folly to quarrel with fate ive booked for a week from tuesday hathaway and we must stick it out till then do you take the same boat  that is my intention  well theres no objection now ill go get alora  but alora hearing of the postponed sailing positively refused to return home with him and mary louise supporting her new friend urged her to extend her stay with her at the hotel strangely enough the more he was opposed the more quiet and composed the artist became he even ceased to tremble and an odd apathy settled over him  the hall porter said the colonel thinks this is the safest place in italy the troops have been on the border for months and their positions are strongly fortified there is no brigandage outside of sicily where the mafia is not yet wholly suppressed  jones grinned rather sheepishly  all right take his word for it said he and if youll be responsible for the girl you may keep her till were ready to sail perhaps thats the best way after all then without a word of goodbye he entered his little motor car and started down the driveway  a strange man said the colonel looking after him i wonder if it really was the war that frightened himor something elseor if he was actually frightened at all  alora laughed  you cant guess father try as you may she said usually he is cold as ice but once in awhile he gets these wild fits which i find rather amusing you cant understand that of course but if you were obliged to live under the same roof with jason jones you would welcome his outbursts as relief from the monotony of contemptuous silence    chapter xii silvios gold  jason jones urged his little car to its best speed until he gained his villa entering the ground he was confronted by his factotum the italian silvio  he sprang out and approached the man  is the prisoner safe he whispered  certainly signore  is she still in the grapehouse  with the wine presses signore  and she cant get out  unless she becomes small like a rat signore  jones glanced around suspiciously then fixed his gaze on a little outbuilding of stone with a tiled roof which stood quite removed from the others of the group  has she screamed or cried out he asked the man  not since i put her in las night signore  good youve fed her  the plenty she eat very well its a nice lady signore  shes dangerous listen silvio we must keep her there a week longer  if i am jailer a week i mus double my price he asserted shrugging his shoulders  nonsense  the lady will offer me more to let her out she say so  what youd betray me  not if i have the goldhere in my handnow signore  jones grew red and then white he eyed the man wickedly he scowled and silvio smiled pleasantly silvio was big for an italian big and brawny as his smile faded his face assumed a look of stubborn determination  so you want the gold now silvio  at once if it please the signore the gendarmes are ugly if the law is broken their jails are not as pleasant as the grapehouse so the gold must be twice the amount we had spoken of signore  and you will promise she shall not escape that youll keep her safe untiluntil i tell you to let her go  that is our bargain signore  jones sighed regretfully  very well then silvio he said youre a robberthe son of a brigandthe spawn of a bandit but come with me to the house and you shall have your gold           alora stayed all that week with mary louise hearing nothing of her father and almost forgetting her unhappiness in the society of her delightful new friend it was sunday evening when the colonel and mary louise drove their guest over to the villa and the two parties did not see one another again until they met on the deck of the steamer in naples on the following tuesday morning  the joneses came aboard very quietly just at the last moment and at the gangplank aloras father was confronted by a grimy italian boy who handed him a letter without pausing to read it jones hurried below and he kept his stateroom until the ship was well out in the blue mediterranean on its way to gibraltar and new york but no one missed him for alora and mary louise were happy at being reunited and granpa jim was happy in seeing them happy   chapter xiii dorfield  in one of the middlewest states there is a delightful little city called dorfield it hasnt so many thousand inhabitants but in all its aspects and its municipal equipment it is indeed a modern city it has factories and a big farming community to support its streets of neat and progressive shops and at the west side of the business district is a residence section where broad wooded streets furnish the setting for many cozy homes some of the houses are old and picturesque and some are new and imposing but each has its flowerlit garden its fruit and shade trees and its little garage or barn tucked away in the back yard  when you come to oak street there is a rambling frame house on the corner set well back where peter conant the lawyer lives with his good wife and his niece irene macfarlane who is seventeen this is one of the ancient dwellings of dorfield for the conants are old inhabitants right next them stands a more modern and expensive if less attractive mansion with grounds twice as large and a velvet lawn that puts the conants carelesslycropped grass to shame but the two families are neighbors and friends nevertheless for in the new house lives colonel james hathaway and his granddaughter mary louise burrows at least they live there when at home and although they seem persistent ramblers they are glad to have this refuge to return to when wearied with traveling and sightseeing  one morning in june mr conant was just seating himself at the breakfast table when a messengerboy delivered a telegrama night letter from new york the lawyer a short thickset man of middle age with a stern countenance but mild blue eyes laid aside his morning paper and read the telegram with his usual deliberation mrs conant silently poured the coffee knowing any interference would annoy him irene the niece was a cripple and sat in her wheeled chair at the table between her uncle and aunt she was a pleasantfaced happy little maid consistently ignoring her withered limbs and thankful that from her knees up she was normal and that her wheeled chair rendered her fairly independent of assistance in all ordinary activities everyone loved irene macfarlane because of her brave and cheery acceptance of her misfortune and her merry speech and spontaneous laughter rendered her as aunt hannah often declared the light of the house irene was moreover an intimate and highly valued friend of her next door neighbor mary louise burrows  mr peter conant sipping his coffee reflectively read the lengthy telegram a second time then he said somewhat irritably and chopping his words into distinct syllables as was his habit at all times  i wonder why people imagine a lawyers duties cover every phase of life my clients use me as a realestate agent a horse trader a purchasing agent a father confessor an automobile expert a medical adviser and sometimesin their simplicityas a banker  whats wrong now peter inquired mrs conant with wifely sympathy  colonel hathaway wants to know  oh is mary louise coming back cried irene eagerly  he frowned at her  what does the colonel wish to know peter  i object to this unwarrantable crossexamination said he it is customary to first allow one to state his case  forgive me uncle peter  take your time said aunt hannah composedly buttering the toast you will anyhow and im sure irene and i have both learned to curb our feminine curiosity  he glanced at the telegram again  do you know if the pelton place has been rented my dear  the pelton place why it wasnt rented yesterday for i passed by there and saw the rent sign still in the window mr harlan is the agent  i know and where can we find a female houseservant hannah  now see here peter its all very well for you to keep your own counsel when theres a professional secret to be guarded but if you want any help from me youve got to open your mouth and talk out plainly so i can answer you in a sensible way  youre always sensible hannah he observed quite unruffled by her demand and then he ate a whole slice of toast and drank his coffee and handed his cup for more before he spoke another word  irene devoted herself to her breakfast she knew uncle peters ways and that it was useless to attempt to hurry him or force him to explain until he was quite ready to do so aunt hannah bided her time peter was a thoughtful man and he was doubtless thinking his wife was not only a clever helpmate but was noted for her consideration of her erratic spouse  the colonel said mr conant at last has run across a man who wants to make his home in dorfield a very sensible idea the colonel met the man in europe the man  whats the mans name inquired mrs conant  he referred to the telegram  jones jason jones  i never heard of him  he looked at her reproachfully  why should you my dear the colonel found the man in europe we live in dorfield the man it seems has a daughter  oh goody cried irene  who has become a friend of mary louise therefore the colonel wires to ask if there is a furnished house to rent at a modest price and if a competent female servant can be secured for the man and his daughter he requests me to wire an answer promptly that is the gist of the telegram although the colonel in his usual extravagant way has paid for more words than were required to express his meaning  and what are you going to do about it demanded mrs conant  i am endeavoring to gain information from my wife  very well what does he mean by a modest price the pelton place is expensive the rent is sixty dollars a month while a comfortable house like that of the widow harrington rents for fifteen dollars with good solid furniture  is mrs harringtons house for rent he asked  yes shell go to live with her married daughter as soon as she can find a tenant the poor creature needs the money and her house is just around the corner from here and her back yard backs up to the colonels back yard now the pelton place is two blocks from here and the peltons dont need the money because theyre already too rich and aristocratic to live in dorfield any longer  hmm murmured mr conant it occurs to me that a friend of colonel hathaway might desire a more luxurious home than that of the widow harrington  doesnt the telegram say a modest price  it does ill quote both places and let the man jones take his choice and how about the female servant hannah  leave that to me i can hire plenty but if mr jason jones takes the pelton place he will want one kind of a servant and if he takes mrs harringtons house hell want a different sort  he gazed at her admiringly and passed his cup again saying  youve a logical mind my dear had you been a man you might have become a fairly good lawyer  no peter not another drop youve two cups already  are you sure hannah  absolutely positive  then said he rising with a sigh ill go to the office  to mr conants disappointment to mrs conants delight to irenes satisfaction and the astonishment of all mr jason jones selected mrs harringtons modest house and ordered it rented and prepared for his arrival on the following thursday this was conveyed in a second telegram from colonel hathaway who requested the lawyer to inform old uncle eben and aunt sally the colonels own faithful colored servants and caretakers that he and mary louise would return home on the same day  you see said aunt hannah triumphantly i sized the joneses up pretty well it isnt necessary for a man to be rich to be a friend of the dear colonel for he considers a man rather than a mans pocketbook  yet a man who can afford to travel abroad with his daughter began mr conant argumentatively should certainly be able and willing  what do you know about him peter perhaps he has spent his ready money in europe and is now obliged to economize unless that is the case why does he come to a sleepy little town like dorfield which is almost forgotten by the big world to settle down   why hes the colonels friend retorted the lawyer stiffly  and mary louise is his daughters friend said irene that accounts for it of course and they couldnt have picked a prettier place dorfield may be sleepy and quiet and half forgotten by the rest of the big world but its simply delightful as a residence didnt colonel hathaway choose it for a home and the colonel could afford to live at the waldorfastoria if he wanted to  i know why you are pleased irene remarked aunt hannah smiling upon her niece youre going to have another girl friend  she wont be as nice as mary louise though was the reply theres no girl in the world as sweet and lovely as mary louise  or one that innocently gets into more trouble declared mr conant  that said aunt hannah is because she cant let other peoples troubles alone    chapter xiv home again  mr conant who was colonel hathaways lawyer and confidential agent was at the train to meet his important client on his return to dorfield the first to alight from the coach was the colonel who greeted his lawyer with a cordial handclasp mary louise kissed peter conant upon his impassive cheek and presented him to a pretty young girl who clung to her arm smiling yet half bewildered by her arrival in a strange town there seemed no one else with the party and mr conant glanced over the crowd of passengers and said  mr jones did not accompany you then  why yes i suppose hes here answered the colonel carelessly i believe he traveled another car  i dont see him anywhere added mary louise i wonder if anyone reminded him that this is the place to get off  never mind said alora if father cant keep track of himself let him go on to another station i cant lose him for long thats certain  there he is up ahead announced mara louise hes quarreling with his porter about something  to save the tip suggested alora scornfully  mary louise rushed to greet an old colorful man with snowwhite hair who was picking up their hand baggage  oh uncle eben im so glad to see again she exclaimed and hows aunt sallie and is my pony well and are the goldfish still alive and  bress yo soul may weeze said the delighted old servant evbodys well an joyful to see youall back agin  the colonel shook uncle ebens handsboth of themin a kindly but dignified manner i suppose the automobile is still running uncle  not jes dis yere minnit kunl with a glad chuckle but dat cars gwine ter run jes as soon as weall gits aboahd what yo think is ben doin all winter kunl in dat lonesomeness house cept keepin dat car greased up  did you grease it in the house then uncle asked mary louise gravely but with twinkling eyes  old eben chuckled again for this was a happy hour for him but while he chuckled he led them to where the automobile stood waiting behind the others slowly followed jason jones carrying his own luggage and eyeing every detail of his surroundings in the manner of a countryman paying his first visit to town he was inwardly sizing up dorfield as a place of residence when jones got into the car the colonel briefly introduced him to the lawyer  this is mr jones mr conant  he looked at the lawyer and gave a slight nod and mr conants bow was very stiff and formal already he had with fair accuracy grasped the relationship of the man to the others alora jones seemed a fine girl the right sortand mary louise was evidently fond of her the colonel barely tolerated the man jones whom he did not like for the daughters sake the girl herself lacked in respect for her father and this unfilial attitude seemed condoned by both mary louise and the colonel which was evidence that there was something wrong about jason jones with such a cue for guidance mr conant decided he had no use for jason jones either  uncle eben first drove the car to the widow harringtons cottage where mrs conant awaited the new tenants to introduce them to their servant and to assure them that everything was prepared for their convenience then they drove to colonel hathaways home where irene was at the gate in her wheeled chair a bunch of her choicest roses in her hand ready to welcome her friend mary louise and to be kissed and hugged with girlish enthusiasm  it was a happy homecoming indeed for mary louise and colonel hathaway breathed a deep sigh of relief as he entered his own portals  from now on he said to his granddaughter that evening i am under no obligation to assist that impossible person jones or to even associate with him for your sake my darling i have suffered the infliction of his presence with fortitude even going to the extent of locating him in our beloved town of dorfield that you and alora might enjoy one anothers society but from this time forward jason jones is to be a distant acquaintance rather than a companion congratulate me mary louise  i do granpa jim she replied soberly and i thank you too it has been a trial for both of us but weve been really helpful to poor alora i want to try to bring a little happiness into her life and encourage her to become as sweet and lovable a girl as she has the nature to be and this could never have been accomplished had we allowed her to drift in the sole companionship of her disagreeable father    chapter xv the puzzle becomes intricate  alora formed an immediate friendship for crippled irene macfarlane first based on sympathy and afterward on genuine admiration that one condemned to pass her entire life in a wicker wheelchair should be so bright and cheerful with no word of protest or even a reference to her own misfortune was deemed wonderful by alora and she soon found that irene had an excuse or explanation for every seeming annoyance her friends suffered and delighted to console them at the same time she allowed no one to console her because she declared she needed no consolation  such a disposition invited confidence and soon irene knew more of aloras past history including her trials and tribulations than even mary louise had yet learned and was shocked and grieved at the girls vengeful defiance of her father due to his neglect and coldness as well as to his contemptible selfishness but irene had an excuse ready even for the artist  poor mr jones she said one day when the three girls were together and had been discussing aloras troubles think what a trial must have been to him to be saddled with the care of a child he had not seen since babyhood and had no especial interest in as for affection between them it could not sprout nor grow because there was no mutual understanding to germinate it your fathers life my dear had been wrecked by his separation from your mother and the money meant little to him at that period of his life when you were left to his care but did he refuse the obligation so inconsiderately thrust upon him no although a man of reserved naturealmost a recluseself absorbed and shrinking from association others he accepted the care of an eleven year old child and without being able to change his disposition to suit her requirements has guarded her health and safety ever since  so that he can use my money added alora with a shrug  but you admit that he doesnt squander money on himself  i dont know what he does with it if he wants books he buys them he bought a rickety automobile in italy and never took me to ride in it but his extravagance seems to end there ive read some letters that he left around showing that he is investing thousands in his own name what for i cant guess as he is too miserly ever to have a use for it  well he may be intending to endow some deserving charity suggested irene and as for his not loving you alora i fancy you have never tried to win your fathers love  no one could love that man  you have never been able to get beneath his reserve you came to him from a luxurious life a petted and pampered child and his simple tastes and unemotional nature repelled you from the first is it not so  im not sure irene i needed sympathy and affection had my father been different had he shown love for me or even fatherly consideration i would have responded eagerly but he ignored me there has never been any companionship between us he has guarded my personal safety because i was of financial value to him once when i contracted a fever he was really worried and hired a skillful doctor and a trained nurse but he never entered my sickroom when i was well he reproached me for costing him so much money i told him it was my money and he was costing me more than i could ever cost him i reminded him he would have been a beggar but for my income and that shut him up at once  theres the whole trouble declared irene constant friction and a lack of consideration for one another such remarks could not have made him more gracious toward you alora and you did not appreciate his care in furnishing you with the means of recovery  had i died said the girl my fortune would have gone to a bunch of thirdcousins whom i have never seen that would have stopped fathers right to the income you see  irene sighed and mary louise smiled it was almost impossible to defend mr jones consistently with alora present to accuse him  the artist at first took little interest in his new home the cottage was small and not very cheerful but it was cheap and all that jason jones seemed to care for was a place to stay that was not expensive he continued his reading and had a book in his hand from morning till night he seldom left the cottage except for a trip to the public library or to a bookstore and never spoke to anyone unless it was necessary  their maid was jane gladys odonnel stout and goodnatured an indifferent cook and rather untidy she was twenty years old and the eldest of a large and impoverished family her mother was a laundress took in washinand her earnings with the wages of jane gladys must suffice to feed many hungry mouths that was why mrs conant had hired jane gladys aunt hannah knew the girl was not very competent but she was cheap so mr jones accepted her without protest alora had lived so long abroad that she did not know what a competent american housemaid is  one forenoonthey had now been a month at dorfieldmr jones was seated on the little front porch reading as usual when a queer buzzing in the air overhead aroused his attention  whats that he called sharply and jane gladys who was dusting in the little room behind him replied  that sor is only steve kanes flyin machine  a what  a flyinmachine sor kane has a facthry fer makin the crazy things in the town yonderover by the south side  indeed he got up and went into the yard to watch the faraway speck in the sky that was humming so persistently why theres another there are two of them he exclaimed as if to himself  there might be a dozen sor cause theres a school for airyairy airyflyin over by kanes facthry where they teaches the folks to fly that buy the machines  he stood a long time watching the sky when the last aeroplane had disappeared he resumed his reading but the next day he watched for the machines again abandoning his book to follow the course of the flyers  where did you say that factory is located he asked jane gladys  over by the gas works sor be the south side ye takes the ellem street car at the four corners on a sunday there be crowds awatchin the airdivils  he started to read again but gave it up and glanced nervously up and down the little porch jane gladys noted this with surprise for he was usually quiet and unobservant like th toad in th garden what squats under a bush all day an fergits hes alive till a fly lights on his nose as she expressed it to the family at home  after lunch mr jones went to town and after making inquiries took the car to the aviation works and field he watched the construction of flying machines in the factory and saw one or two pupils take short flights in the air and jason jones was so interested that he was late to dinner that evening  next day he was at the aviation field again and from that time he haunted the place silent and composed but watching every detail of manufacture and listening to the experts as they instructed the pupils these were not manythree altogetheralthough stephen kanes aeroplane was now admitted to be one of the safest and most reliable ever invented and one day one of the instructors noticing the silent man who had watched so long invited him to take a flight thinking perhaps to frighten him but jason jones promptly accepted the invitation and with perfect composure endured the strange experience and returned to ground with heightened color but no other evidence of excitement could alora have seen him that day she would have acquitted him of cowardice  but alora knew nothing of her fathers odd fancy for some time after he became interested in aeroplanes she was not often at home during the day frequently taking lunch with mary louise or irene and passing much of her time in their company she had no interest whatever in her fathers movements and jane gladys didnt think to mention the matter to her for flyinmachines had ceased to be a novelty in dorfield and the sound of their buzzing through the air was heard many times a day but in turning over a pile of her fathers books one day in his absence alora found several treatises on aviation and was almost startled to find that jason jones cared for any reading aside from light novels  she had been hunting at the time for a novel to read herself so turning from the aviation literature to a shelf of fiction she began searching for an interesting title presently as she drew out one of her fathers books it opened by accident at a place where a letter had been tucked ina letter written on soiled and coarse paper of a foreign make it was addressed sig jaysn jones at the steamer hercules to sail for new york usa opening it she found it signed silvio alleghero  that was their manservant in italy so with a smile of anticipated amusement she read the letter it was brief indeed but the girls expression soon changed to a puzzled look for the scrawl said  honored signore at your command i have this morning three hours after your departure for naples allowed the prisoner to escape  how funny she exclaimed knitting her brows i cant remember any prisoner at the villa perhaps it was the cat it would be just like silvio to consider the release of a cat a important event  she replaced the letter in the book and after selecting another novel forgot silvios epistle entirely  another time when alora happened to be at home for their noonday luncheon and her father did not appear jane gladys quietly remarked in answer to her query that th ol man was probly over to the flyinmachine works  does he go there often she asked in surprise  why he mostly lives there asserted the maid  alora laughed and afterward told mary louise as a bit of humorous gossip that the man who had heretofore failed to find any interest in life had at last succumbed to the fascination of the aeroplane  well im glad of it said mary louise ive often wondered lory how your father could be so infatuated with novelreading absorbing stories of human interest if they have any interest at all with such avidity while the real people all around him failed to interest him at all i have thought perhaps he read to keep his mind fromfrom other things that it would make him unhappy to dwell upon  i have thought so too replied alora musingly and this queer fancy of his for a new and unusual invention may serve the same purpose but i too am glad he has found a diversion that will keep him away from home that barn of a cottage will become more homelike without his eternal presence  peter conant the lawyer had paid little heed to jason jones since the latters arrival in dorfield he had heard his wife and irene gossip about the girl and her father and state that alora was an heiress and mr jones merely the guardian of her fortune until she came of age but his legal mind decided that the girls fortune must be a modest one since they lived so economically and dressed so plainly colonel hathaway who might have undeceived him in this regard seldom spoke to the lawyer of anything but his own affairs and had forborne to mention mr jones and his personal affairs in any way  therefore mr conant was somewhat surprised when one morning jason jones called at his office and asked for an interview the lawyer was busy that day and attaching little importance to his caller he demanded brusquely  well sir what can i do for you  the man seated himself and glanced around the room before replying the big desk littered with papers the cabinet files and stiff chairs seemed to meet his approval in the outer office a girl was busily clicking a typewriter  you are colonel hathaways lawyer i believe said jones  i have that honor sir  thats why i came to you the colonel is a prosperous man and has judgment i want your advice about investing some money  peter conant regarded him with a speculative gaze the thought flashed through his mind that if jones had any money to invest he might better buy himself a new necktie and have his shoes repaired or even invest in a new dress for his daughter who needed it but he merely said in his peculiar way of chopping each word off short as he uttered it  how much have you to invest  not a great deal at this moment but i am i constantly receiving dividends and interest on my daughters securities and so if i am going to live in dorfield i shall need a lawyer to advise me how to reinvest the money as well as how to make out the papers properly i dont want to make any mistakes and get robbedeven by my lawyer but ill pay you a fair price perhaps i should explain that while the income is derived from my daughters property the investments are to be made in my name  why so  the income belongs to me by my dead wifes will as long as alora is alive and in my keeping when the girl is eighteen she will manage her own affairs and ill be quit of herand out of any further income as well so im investing now to secure my future  i see how old is your daughter at this time  fifteen  so youve three years more to grab the income  exactly  how much money do you wish to invest today  twelve thousand dollars  peter conant sat up straight in his chair  and you say this is but part of the income  the estate is valued at nearly two million dollars  the lawyer gave a low whistle of amazement beside this enormous sum even colonel hathaways holdings shrank into insignificance  you surprise me he said i imagine then that you can afford to live somewhat better than you do  that is none of your business  true good day mr jones  eh  i wont accept you as a client  why not sir  thank you for asking in the first place i dont like you said peter conant nor do i approve of your treating your daughtera great heiressas you do and hoarding all her enormous income for your personal use youre not toting fair it is an unjust arrangement and ill have nothing to do with it  jason jones sat still and stared at him  good day sir repeated the lawyer curtly  the man did not move peter turned to his papers  see here the artist presently remarked lets come to an understanding i dont like you either youre insulting but youre honest and i think i could trust you  im not especially honest retorted the lawyer but im particular i dont need clients and i dont want a client im ashamed of  still the man did not offer to go instead he reflected for awhile in his stolid unemotional way while peter conant frowned and examined the papers on his desk  i believe youll see the thing in a different light if you read my wifes will said jones ive brought a copy of it with me thinking it might help you to understand my affairs  is it an attested copy asked the lawyer turning around again  yes  let me see it  mr conant decided to read the will with the idea that he might find in it some way to assist alora when he had finished the document he was disappointed mrs antoinette seaver jones a woman clever enough to make a fortune had been foolish enough to give her former husband autocratic power over her money during her daughters minority had the man been a gentleman the folly would have been mitigated but jason jones in mr conants opinion was a selfish miserly conscienceless rascal enjoying a yearly income that was a small fortune in itself he had neglected to educate his daughter properly to clothe her as befitted her station in life or to show her ordinary fatherly consideration affection and kindness seemed foreign to the mans nature he handed the will back and said  you have taken an unfair advantage of the confidence reposed in you by your dead wife who doubtless loved her child legally your actions cannot be assailed but morally they should ostracize you from decent society as i said before i do not want your business ill have nothing to do with you  jones remained unruffled  im a stranger in the city he remarked perhaps you will recommend me to some good lawyer  no there are a score of lawyers in town make your own choice  the man rose and put on his hat  i said you were honest and i was right he calmly remarked ill say now that you are a fool and im right in that also and with these words he walked away  that was his only protest to the humiliating rebuff he showed no anger he did not seem annoyed he simply rode down in the elevator examined the directory and selected another lawyer in the same building    chapter xvi alora wins her way  mary louise decided that alora jones improved on acquaintance there were many admirable traits in her character that had lain dormant until developed by association with two girls of her own age who were themselves gentle and considerate it is true that alora at times was still headstrong and willful and unable to bridle her tongue when irritated but neither mary louise nor irene ever reproved her by word or look so that she grew ashamed of her outbursts and when at home her father aroused her to anger she fled to her girl friends and sought in their companionship the antidote to her vexation the two friends had decided it was unwise to comment on aloras unhappy family relations and soon she discovered this and refrained from burdening them with her home quarrels  no one could witness irenes patient resignation to misfortune without admiring her character and being touched by her bravery and gentleness and association with this crippled girl was softening aloras hard and defiant nature wonderfully had the association continued it might have redeemed the prospective heiress from many of the faults she had acquired through years of neglect and rebellion against fate but the close triumvirate of girl friends was suddenly dissolved early in july by no less a person than will morrisona wealthy and kindly natured gentleman who was a friend of both the conants and colonel hathaway  will morrison had purchased a yacht it was anchored in the breakwater near the chicago yacht club and its owner intended making a summer trip through the great lakes and cordially invited the conants and irene and mary louise and colonel hathaway to accompany his party  unfortunately mrs conant at that time was ill she had contracted a lingering but mild form of spring fever that would keep her in bed for weeks and irene who was devoted to her aunt would not leave her to the mercies of a nurse mary louise wanted to go though for the morrisons were delightful people and any yacht they purchased would be sure to be safe and comfortable  since the conants could not go mary louise suggested to her grandfather that they ask will morrison to invite alora jones and the colonel approved the idea because he thought it would do alora much good to mingle with refined people such as were sure to form the yacht party so when he answered mr morrisons letter he told him something of alora and asked permission to fetch her along  im not at all sure he said to mary louise that mr jones will permit alora to go with us  nor am i the girl replied but perhaps alora can coax him to consent it might be a good idea for you to ask him too granpa jim  my dear he remonstrated do you think i ought to hazard that mans sneers and insults even to favor your friend alora  no i do not granpa jim she laughingly rejoined that was a foolish suggestion and i withdraw it if alora fails ill speak to him myself im not afraid of jason jones and he doesnt growl at me as he does at poor lory  they did not mention the proposal to alora until the colonel had received a telegram from will morrison saying by all means invite miss jones to join us knew her mother once and will be glad to have her with us  alora was delighted at the prospect of a yachting trip and decided at once that she would go especially as colonel hathaway said she would be mary louises guest on the trip to chicago and no money would be needed for expenses so she attacked her father in a somewhat original manner  mr jones had conceived a passion for flying and had just purchased an aeroplane he was to begin his lessons at once and was so thoroughly immersed in his strange fancy that he paid little heed to anything else his books were neglected his former quiet lifeamounting almost to physical inertionhad given place to a nervous and allconsuming desire to master the rather strenuous art of aviation alora was quite unaware of this transformation for as usual jason jones kept his own counsel and followed his inclinations without conference with anyone the girl knew that her father haunted the aviation field but anything that kept him amused away from home was gratefully approved by her  usually the two breakfasted together in silence lately mr jones had hurried through with the meal so as to get away and he did not return for lunch so on this important morning alora said casually  im going away for three or four weeks  where to he asked sharply suddenly rousing from his abstraction  im going on a yachting trip with mary louise and colonel hathaway were to be the guests of a mr morrison and his wife who own the yacht  morrison morrison he repeated suspiciously then as if relieved i dont know any morrisons  nor do i they are old friends of the hathaways and the conants however  well you cant go its nonsense  why  yachts are dangerous i dont want you drowned  id be as safe on a yacht as i would be in this house she declared do you think i intend to take any chances with my life please remember that when im eighteen i shall have a fortune and be able to lead an independent lifea pleasant lifea life in sharp contrast to this one therefore im going to live to enjoy my money  he gave her a shrewd look of approval the argument seemed to appeal to him it quieted to an extent his fears for her safety  anyhow said alora bluntly im going and i dare you to stop me  he was silent a while considering the proposition just now he would be busy at the aviation field and in colonel hathaways charge the girl was likely to be quite safe he was inclined to relax his vigilance over his precious daughter on this occasion  how long do the hathaways expect to be away he inquired  mary louise says we will surely be home three weeks from the day we leave  surely  without fail  hmm its a risk something might delay you do you know what would happen if you left me for sixty days or more  of course i do that will of my mothers states that if at any time my devoted father develops any neglect of me or lack of interest in his darling daughter such as allowing me to become separated from him for longer than sixty days at one time the court has the privilege at its option of deposing him as administrator of my estate and appointing another guardian the other guardian however is to be paid a salary and the income in that case is to accrue to the benefit of my estate  how did you learn all that he demanded  you left a copy of the will lying around and i read it and made a copy of it for myself i now know my mothers will by heart she suggests that if we must live together in loving companionship you will probably have me educated by tutors at home and her objection to girls schoolsi wonder whywas the principal reason she inserted the clause that we must never be separated it would prevent you from sending me away to school but as for the tutors i havent yet made their acquaintance  tutors cost money he said in a surly tone  i realize that and while there is an abundance of money the will states that it is to be entirely in your control but weve quarreled on that subject too many times already without your loosening your grip on the dollars to get back to our subject i assure you i shall not be gone longer than twentyone days and the trip wont cost you a single penny  when did you propose going  we take the noon train on monday for chicago  he got his hat and left the house without another word leaving alora exultant she hurried over to tell mary louise the good news  did he really consent asked mary louise  well he didnt forbid it said the girl and thats the same thing    chapter xvii the disappearance  the train was late getting into chicago that monday night colonel hathaway took mary louise and alora to the blackington but the hotel was so crowded that the girls could not get adjoining rooms however they secured rooms just across the hall from one another and the colonels room was but two doors removed from that of his granddaughter so the three were not greatly separated  never mind dear said mary louise as she kissed her friend good night tomorrow we go aboard the yacht and that will be our home for a long time  what time will you breakfast asked alora  well were up late and granpa jim likes to sleep mornings can you fast until halfpast eight alora  yes indeed with a laugh im used to somewhat early hours so i shall probably be dressed by seven but ill find plenty to amuse me until you are up and ill knock on your door at eightthirty  but in the morning alora failed to knock on mary louises door as she had promised the colonel was ready for breakfast having enjoyed a good nights rest and mary louise said to him  alora probably slept later than she expected to shall i risk wakening her granpa jim  i think so he replied she has slept long enough for a young girl  mary louise ran across the hall and knocked at the door of 216 she knocked again for there was no answer she did not dare call out for fear of disturbing other guests of the hotel the colonel now came and rapped upon the panels but without any better result  i think she must have left her room and is perhaps in the parlor or in the hotel lobby he said  a chambermaid was passing through the hall and overheard the remark  the party in 216 has been up a long time sir she asserted i found the door ajar at six oclock and so i went in and made up the room  poor alora exclaimed mary louise laughingly she was too excited to sleep and as you say we shall probably find her somewhere about the hotel enjoying the sights  but they could not find the girl anywhere in the hotel after a long and careful search for her colonel hathaway left word at the desk that if his room or mary louises room was called to report that they would be found in the breakfast room  the old gentleman was distinctly annoyed as they sat down to breakfast  the foolish girl is wandering about the streets somewhere he complained and it was unmannerly to leave the hotel without consulting me since she is our guest and in my care  mary louises sweet face wore a troubled expression  it is not like alora granpa jim she asserted in defense of her friend usually i have found her quite considerate then after a pause ii hope nothing has happened to her  dont worry he replied shes a wideawake girl and has a tongue in her head so she cant get lost why mary louise alora knows the city well for she used to live in chicago with her mother  until she was eleven that was four years ago but i did not think of her getting lost the automobiles you know are so thick  yes dear and theres the lake and the railroad crossings and the street cars but the chances are against our little friends being drowned or run over especially so early in the day when there isnt much traffic again i ask you not to worry  but mary louise couldnt help worrying they lingered over the breakfast but alora did not join them then they waited around the hotel until nearly noon without receiving a word from her finally colonel hathaway too became nervous he telephoned the central police station to inquire if a young girl of aloras description had met with an accident there was no record of such an accident but in half an hour a detective came to the hotel and asked for the colonel  tell me all the particulars of the young ladys disappearance please he requested  when he had received this information he said  let us go to her room  the key to no 216 had not been turned in at the office but was missing with a passkey they unlocked the door of aloras room and found her suit case open her toilet articles lying upon the dresser and her nightrobe neatly folded ready for packing her hat was missing however and the little jacket she wore with her tailored suit  the detective touched nothing but examined the room and its contents with professional care  let us call the chambermaid who made up the room he suggested  the woman was easily found and when she appeared the detective asked  did you fold this nightrobe or did you find it already folded  why it was lyin carelesslike over the foot of the bed said she so i folded it up  why didnt you hang it in the closet  the clerk had notified me the room would be vacated today so i knew that when the young lady came back shed want to pack it in her grip  and at what time did you find the door ajar  at sixten sir i come on duty at six  you did not see miss jones  no sirif that were the ladys name  you found no one prowling about the halls  didnt see a soul sir  thank you thats all  when she had gone the detective said to the colonel in a reassuring tone  i wouldnt worry sir although ill admit this prolonged absence of miss jones is puzzling but perhaps she has gone to call on an old friend and will presently return and apologize i remember her mother a remarkable woman sirwho used to live at the voltaire she had a lot of friends in chicago did mrs antoinette seaver jones so its likely her daughter is looking some of them up  i wish you would do all you can to locate her pleaded colonel hathaway the young girl was placed in my care by her father and i feel personally responsible for her safety  shes safe enough sir no sign of a struggle in her room no report of an accident in the city went out of her own volition and will probably come back the same way when shes ready im going back to the office now but ill instruct our men to keep a good lookout for miss jones if we hear anything ill let you know at once in the meantime if the girl happens to turn up you must telephone me of the fact  he handed the colonel his card and went away  this is dreadful granpa jim exclaim mary louise that man cant help us a bit what do you think we ought to do  why weve done all in our power already it seems to me he answered the police will keep a good lookout for alora  ive no confidence in that detective  why not my dear he seemed quite courteous and gentlemanly  but he isnt especially interested he didnt probe far enough into the case he never asked why the key to aloras door was missing yet the maid found the door ajarhalf open said mary louise would she take the key and leave the door open  whyno that is strange mary louise  the detective didnt inquire at the office whether the night clerk had seen alora pass through and go out but i inquired granpa and the night clerk goes off duty at six oclock when the relief clerk comes on but neither saw any girl at all leave the office no one was in the hotel lobby at that hour  that is strange too how could alora get out otherwise  i cant guess granpa im going to telegraph josie ogorman and ask her advice said mary louise  do its a good idea josie might put us on the right track approved the colonel  so mary louise went to the telegraph office in the hotel lobby and sent the following message  josie ogorman 1225 f street washington d c  a girl friend has mysteriously disappeared from the blackington where we are stopping what shall i do mary louise burrows  two hours later she received this answer  miss mary louise burrows hotel blackington chicago  notify police at once keep cool im coming josie ogorman  mary louise felt tremendously relieved when she read this josie was a girl of her own age but she was the daughter of one of the most celebrated secret service men in the employ of the united states government and john ogorman had trained josie from babyhood in all the occult details of his artful profession it was his ambition that some day this daughter would become a famous female detective but he refused to allow her to assume professional duties until she had become thoroughly qualified to excel he did not wish her to be ordinary but extraordinary and josies talents so far had seemed to justify his expectations mary louise knew josie very well and admired and loved her for in her amateur way josie had once helped to solve a stubborn mystery that threatened the happiness of both the old colonel and his granddaughter and through this experience the two girls had become friends josie ogorman was devoted to mary louise who knew she could rely on josies judgment in this emergency but had scarcely expected her to come all the way from washington to chicago to render her personal assistance  in appearance the young girlwho was destined some day to become a great detectivewas not especially prepossessing she was short of form and inclined to be stoutchubby she called herself she had red hair a freckled face and a turnedup nose but her eyes round and blue and innocent in expression as those of a baby dominated her features and to an extent redeemed their plainness  mary louise hurried to the colonel  granpa jim she cried excitedly josie is coming  that is very good of her replied the colonel highly pleased josie is very resourceful and while she may not be able to trace alora she will at least do all in her power and perhaps her clever little brain will be able to fathom the mystery of the girls disappearance  she tells us to notify the police but we did that at once i dont know of anything else we can do granpa until josie comes  colonel hathaway communicated with the police office several times that day and found the officials courteous but calmprolific of assurances but not especially concerned this was but one of a number of peculiar cases that daily claimed their attention  i should hire a private detective were not josie coming he told mary louise but of course it is possible we shall hear of alora directly or indirectly before morning  but they did not hear and both passed a miserable wakeful anxious night  there is no use in our consulting aloraa father for the present remarked the old gentleman next morning the news would only worry him you remember how very particular he was in charging me to guard his daughters safety  yes and i know why replied mary louise alora has told me that if she is lost strayed or stolen for sixty days her father might be relieved of his guardianship and lose the income he enjoys now i wonder granpa jim if alora has purposely lost herself with mischievous intent so as to get rid of her father whom she abhors  the colonel considered this thoughtfully  i think not he decided the girl is impulsive and at times reckless and doubtless she would like to be free from her fathers guardianship but i am sure she is too fond of you and has too much respect for me to run away from us without a word besides she has no money  really said mary louise despondently it is the strangest thing i ever knew  josie ogorman arrived at the hotel at six oclock in the afternoon having caught the fast train from washington the evening before she came in as unconcernedly as if she had lived at the hotel and merely been out to attend a matinee and greeted the colonel with a bright smile and mary louise with a kiss  my but im hungry were her first words i hope you havent dined yet  oh josie began mary louise on the verge of tears this dreadful  i know dear but we must eat and lets not talk or think of the trouble till our stomachs are in a comfortable condition which way is the dining room  neither the colonel nor mary had eaten much since aloras disappearance but they took josie in to dinner realizing it would be impossible to get her to talk seriously or to listen to them until she was quite ready to do so and during the meal josie chattered away like a magpie on all sorts of subjects except that which weighed most heavily on their minds and the little thing was so bright and entertaining that they were encouraged to dine more heartily than they otherwise would have done  but afterward when they had adjourned to a suite that had now been given them and which included a cosy little sitting room and after the colonel had been ordered to light his cigar which always composed his nerves the ogorman girl suddenly turned serious and from the depths of an easy chair with her hands clasped behind her red head she said  now to business begin at the beginning and tell me all there is to tell  havent i written you something about alora josie asked mary louise  never mind whether you have or havent imagine ive forgotten it i want every detail of the girls history  so mary louise told it with a few comments from her grandfather she began with their first meeting with alora and her eccentric father in italy and related not only all the details of their acquaintance but such facts as alora had confided to her of her mothers death and her subsequent unhappy relations with her father and guardian alora had often talked freely to mary louise venting in her presence much bitterness and resentment over her cruel fateas she deemed it so knowing josies desire to obtain the most seemingly trifling detail of a case mary louise told the story as connectedly and comprehensively as possible avoiding all personal comment so as to leave josies mind free from prejudice  during the recital josie sat very still with closed eyes reclining lazily in her chair and refraining from any interruption  now colonel she said tell me all that mary louise has forgotten to mention  she has told you more than i knew myself he declared of course we informed the police of our friends disappearance and they sent a detective here who went into the affair very carefully yet so far  i know said josie nodding i called at the police station before i came here on leaving the train the detective is al howard and hes a nice fellow but rather stupid you mustnt expect any results from that source to be sure the department might stumble on a clew but the chances are they wouldnt recognize it even then  im certainly surprised to hear that said the colonel  because you are ignorant of police methods they mean well but have so much to handle in a big city like this that they exist in a state of perpetual bewilderment  but what are we to do pleaded mary louise tell us josie  how do i know asked the girl with a smile im just josie ogorman a student detective who makes as many blundersalasas a fullfledged tec but i thought id be able to help or i wouldnt have come ive a personal interest in this case mary louise because its your case and i love you so lets get to work have you a photograph of alora jones  no was the reply  then give me a word picture of her  both mary louise and the colonel tried to do this and josie seemed satisfied  now then she said rising lets go to her room i hope it hasnt been disturbed since she left it  the police have taken the key and forbidden anyone to enter the room  quite proper but well go there just the same  the room was but a few steps away in the same corridor and when they arrived there josie drew a bunch of slender keys from her purse and unlocked the door with no difficulty having entered she turned on the electric lights and cast a curious glance around  lets read aloras room said she while her companions stood listening to begin with we see her nightdress nicely folded and her toilet articles arranged in neat order on the dresser chambermaid did that for alora is not neat proving that her stuff was just strewn around and the orderly maid put things straight which leads to the supposition that alora was led away rather suddenly  oh do you think so  she left the door ajar but took the key intended of course to lock her room but was so agitated by what she saw or heard that she forgot and just walked away  but no one saw her leave the hotel observed mary louise  then she didnt pass through the office but through the less used ladies entrance at the side  that was not unlocked they told me until after seven oclock  then she left by the servants entrance  the servants  quite likely youll say she didnt know anything about it or where it was but the fact remains that alora left the hotel id like to see that chambermaid i believe you told me she comes on duty at six oclock in the morning all right ill catch her at six a m tomorrow  the detective interviewed her stated colonel  i know and she answered all his questions my questions will be different if alora used the servants entrance she went out with a servant or with someone who knew the ways of the hotel intimately  i dont see that objected mary louise  nor do i but there lies our trail alora didnt pass out through the office nor did she make her exit through the less public ladies entrance there are only two other ways to get out of here through the baggage door and by the servants entrance at the rear which lets into an alley the head porter will know whether alora went out the baggage door but as its usually very highon a level with the platform of a baggagewagoni dont believe she jumped it that leaves the servants entrance as the probable exit for our missing one and as she was a perfect stranger to the arrangements of this hotel she couldnt have gone that way unless someone guided her so our course is clear mary louise find out who enticed alora from the hotel and it wont be difficult to trace her and discover what has become of her  enticed josie  had force been used she would have screamed and attracted attention let us say she was decoyed  you think then that alora was kidnapped  let us reason the girl couldnt have had an enemy in chicago according to her history for she was only eleven when she left here and no one hates an eleven year old child having no enemy she has doubtless escaped personal harm but alora is an heiress and a lot of people in chicago know that you suggest kidnapping well perhaps thats the solution held for ransom  that would be the first idea of jason jones exclaimed mary louise he has always seemed afraid of such a thing  in that case however i do not believe her father would pay a ransom declared colonel hathaway  oh indeed he would asserted mary louise emphatically we mustnt forget that if alora isnt found and restored to him within a given time he will lose all her income for the next three years  josie looked at her friend admiringly then she laughed  youre a better detective than any of us she remarked what ive been groping for is the object of the abduction and youve hit the nail squarely on the head now were getting down to brass tacks so to speak the whole thing is explained by the one wordblackmail girl disappears papa is threatened with the lose of thousands very well papa pay up relinquish a part of the income and you may keep the rest refuse and you lose it all ergo papa pays  that certainly seems a logical conclusion admitted the colonel  then said josie thoughtfully we must decide whether to put it up to mr jones and let him pay or to go on with the search  well go on exclaimed mary louise we may be wrong and poor alora may be in danger or suffering we must rescue her as soon as possible  the girl was in my care said the colonel and i feel responsible for her safety moreover blackmail is a crime against society and the plot should be foiled even were we not interested in the victim of it i am anxious to find alora before her father is approached  then josie decided we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to locate and recover her if we have diagnosed the case correctly we have to deal with a shrewd and unprincipled if not clever person cleverness too we may encounter and then our task will be doubly hard  poor dear alora sighed mary louise its a shame she should suffer because some cruel person wants her fathers money the fortune her mother left her has been a misfortune to her daughter instead of a blessing  money said josie sententiously is a dangerous thing its possession or the lack of it leads to fourfifths of the worlds crimes the other onefifth is charged to hatred and jealousy but dear mehere i am philosophizing when i ought to be thinking  then think josie and think to some purpose pleaded mary louise  if our hastily constructed theory is correct remarked john ogormans daughter papa jones will soon hear from aloras abductor with a financial proposition  i hope we shall find her before then returned the colonel earnestly we ought not to delay an instant with that idea in view indeed our theory may be quite wrong and alora be in desperate need of immediate assistance  correct sir agreed josie but we wont abandon our theory until we evolve a better one and in following this lead we must first discover who in chicago is aware of the terms of the will of antoinette seaver jones also who is familiar enough with papa jones love of money to believe he can be successfully blackmailed what information can either of you give me along those lines  alora has talked to irene a good deal about that dreadful will replied mary louise irene has repeated many of her statements to me also alora has frankly spoken to me at times and her queer history has interested us all but i cannot remember that any such person as you describe is in any way mixed up with the story judge bernsted drew up the will for aloras mother he was her lawyer and she trusted him fully  she was justified declared josie i know of judge bernsted by reputation he died a year ago  then continued mary louise reflectively there was mrs jones doctor who was very kind to alora and who also enjoyed her mothers confidence his name was anstrutherdr anstruther  he is a prominent physician in chicago declared josie who seemed to know every important person of every locality for this had been part of her education it is impossible that dr anstruther could have any knowledge of this plot moreover it doesnt seem to me like a mans plot i dont believe alora would have accompanied a strange man under any circumstances for shes knocked around the world enough to have learned prudence the crime is feminine what woman knew of this will and was an intimate friend of mrs jones or of mr jones  really said mary louise i dont know  nor you colonel  i do not recollect hearing of any woman connected with the jones historyexcept aloras former governess a miss gorham who was discharged by mr jones at the time he took his daughter from chicago to new york  that isnt such a bad clew josie quickly returned sitting up straight and staring reflectively at the old gentleman miss gorham eh now how long had she been aloras governess  for some years i believe it was mary louise who answered this question  then she doubtless knew the family secrets was alora fond of her  i think not she has told me that at the time they separated she was glad to be rid of the woman  then the woman may be the kind that would resort to blackmail discharged from a good place where she had drawn pay for years she would be angry brooded during the last four years on her imagined wrongs and figured out a neat revenge had sized up papa jones and knew he clung to money with a desperate grip and would pay some rather than lose all couldnt get another job was poor had no money to chase up jones but figured he would some time return to chicago and give her an opportunity play her game discovered that alora had arrived at this hotel andsee here what would prevent the former governess now in reduced circumstances from being employed as a servant in this very hotel perhaps as a night chambermaid may have seen alora enter her room and recognized her former pupil during the long night she figured and planned how to take advantage of the fortunate circumstances early in the morning before she left here went to alora and in some way induced the girl to go out with her alora would accompany her old governess without suspicion sotheres the whole story in a nutshell rather cleverly figured out  oh josie it must be true cried mary louise who had eagerly followed this plausible reasoning  and it may not laughed josie its just a theory and good detectives distrust theories which often befog clever brains still the deduction sounds mighty logical im going to my room now to give the suggestion some serious thought ill try to tear it to pieces or at least to pick holes in it when i came away daddy said to me josie beware that imagination of yours if it asserts itself sit on it daddy was glad to have me tackle the case and try to help you for these little affairs give me practice but he hates to have me make a flat failure so for dear old daddys sake im not going to let any goodlooking theory lead me astray good night youd both better go to bed for i can see you had little sleep last night but your strain must now relax for youve pushed the responsibility onto my poor little shoulders and now its up to me to worry    chapter xviii on the trail  josie ogorman loved mysteries for their own sake she loved them because they required solutions and to solve a mystery is not only interesting but requires a definite amount of talent since she was a wee thing perched on her fathers knee officer ogorman had flooded her ears with the problems he daily encountered had turned the problems inside out and canvassed them from every possible viewpoint questioning the child if this or that was most probable by this odd method he not only enjoyed the society of his beloved daughter but argued himself through shrewd reasoning into a lucid explanation of many puzzling cases to his pleased surprise as little josie grew older she began to answer his questions taking a part in his professional arguments with himself and from that time her training as a detective began  john ogorman had never been quite sure whether his fatherly adoration unduly influenced him or whether josie was indeed an exceptionally talented girl so having firmly determined to train her to become a girl detective he had so far held her in leash permitting her to investigate various private cases but refusing to place her in professional worksuch as the secret serviceuntil she had gained experience and acquired confidence in herself confidence was the one thing josie lacked most she took her mistakes too much to heart  the girl was full of enthusiasm however and now meant to untangle the mystery of alora jones if it were possible to do so both to please mary louise and to enjoy the satisfaction of success after saying good night to her friends and before going to her own room the girl wandered about the big hotel making casual inquiries and obtaining more or less useful information afterward she sat in her room and arranged in her mind the complete history of alora so far as she was informed of it and made notes of all facts which seemed to bear on the present problem  next morning she inquired for the housekeeper and found that lady seated in her little office on the third floor of the hotel  im trying to trace one of the servants who left you monday night or early tuesday morning she said after informing the woman that she was engaged in tracing the missing girl alora jones i am not sure what name you knew her by but her real name was gorham  no one has left us this week returned the housekeeper who seemed disposed to converse freely with her visitor  are you sure of that  why im positive we treat our help well and they seldom leave us im sure no woman employed in this hotel down to the lowest kitchen scullion has resigned or been discharged during the last few days  and there is no one still in your service named gorham  no one its an unusual name and i should have remembered it  do any of the guests ever use the servants entrance  certainly not it is reserved exclusively for the employees some of our guests have private maids who occasionally use the rear entrances and mrs tollivers trained nurses are allowed to pass out that way too but  she stopped abruptly as if some new thought had occurred to her  what is it asked josie who was watching her face  why i have just recollected that mrs tollivers night nurse did not show up tuesday evening for some reason and they were obliged to telephone for another  who is mrs tolliver  one of our permanent guests who is suffering just now from a severe attack of rheumatism she employs two trained nurses a day nurse and a night nurse  and the night nurse left her post tuesday morning and did not return in the evening as she was expected to do  thats it miss mrs tolliver was greatly annoyed but fortunately she was able to secure another nurse at once  what was the nurses namethe one who abandoned her job without notice  let me see it wasnt gorham ill call alice my assistant i feel quite sure that she will know  alice promptly answered the bell and on being questioned said  the nurse was mrs orme shed been with mrs tolliver ever since she was took sick and was the best nurse shes had  why did she leave asked josie  i dont know miss im sure she were a quiet body never sayin much to no one but quite ladylike she were an most of us liked her  can you describe her  well she isnt tallnot so very tall you knowan shes got a good form an good manners i take it shes about thirtyfive an handsome for her age good eyes but mostly looks down an dont show em very neat an tidy brown hair she wore gray clothes you knowthe reglar nurses uniform  do you know where mrs orme lives  no miss havent the faintest idea  who is mrs tollivers doctor  the house physician dr pease his office is no 633 in this hotel  thank you alice  josie hunted up mary louise  have you ever heard that a trained nurse named mrs orme is in any way connected with aloras history she asked  no im pretty sure alora has never mentioned such a person what about her josie  i think alora went away with her have you any description of miss gorham the governess  not especially said mary louise trying to remember alora has sometimes referred to her as old skinny but that doesnt mean anything  it means she isnt mrs orme anyhow answered josie in a disappointed tone  mary louise considered this in her usual careful way she would like to help josie if she could  who do you suppose this mrs orme could be she presently asked  some one whom alora knew years ago when her mother was alive of course her name may not have been orme then and she may not have been a trained nurse thats why i was inclined to connect her with gorham  wait a minute josie a nurse do you say why i remember something about a nurse noaloras mothers nurse when we were in italy where i first knew alora she told me that her father at one time when they lived in new york had been forced to give money to a woman and alora believed he had left america to escape this persons further demands when i asked who the woman was she said it was her mothers nurse but im pretty sure she didnt mention her name  josies freckled face now wore a broad smile  how simple any enigma proves when you have the key she remarked with an air of relief the mystery is solved my dear its all as easy as a b c  in that case said mary louise more mystified than ever kindly oblige me with the key  with pleasure you havent given me much time to forge a chain so ill add each link as it occurs to me mrs jones during her last illness had a nurse a good nurse too in whom she had confidence when mrs jones sent for her husband from whom she had been estranged the nurse was aware of the action when the husband camealoras fatherwithout doubt the nurse remained in the sick room during the interview husband and wife quarreled instead of making upthis guess is justified by the mans disagreeable dispositionand mrs jones hastily wrote a codicil to her will and gave it into the nurses keeping with instructions to deliver it to her lawyer then the poor lady overexcited lay back and died and the man jason jonesrealized that his lack of diplomacy had euchred him out of a big income for seven years but he put up a job with the nurse who held his fate in her hands in the shape of scrap of paper if shed give him that codicilno that isnt rightif shed keep it to herself and not let anyone know of its existence mr jones proposed to give her a share of the money she considered this easier than working and the bargain was struck isnt that a logical chain of events so far mary louise  but what a terrible thing to do josie  yes human nature in its worst aspect selfishness greed unscrupulousnessand still human nature well the woman followed him to new york and got some of the money as alora said but the nurse wanted more and was likely to bleed the man more liberally than he liked so being afraid of her he ran away to europe nurse spent her money couldnt find jason jones to get more and so returned to chicago and practiced her profession again any dummy could figure that out  i cannot see responded mary louise how that accounts for aloras disappearance  why of course the woman knew all about the terms of the will she was nursing a mrs tolliver in this hotel when she discovered aloras arrival how she discovered it doesnt matter in the morning when the day nurse arrived to take her place she left mrs tolliver and went directly to aloras room the girl instantly recognized her and would probably have a warm place in her heart for her mothers old nurse decided to walk part of the way home with her so they could talk over old timesyou and the colonel being still asleepbut was enticed to the nurses house and promptly locked up and held as a weapon to force old jones to pay up this completes the chain a woman who would enter into such an ugly deal with jason jones as i have described would not hesitate to capture alora especially as it proved an easy thing to do  mary louise drew a long breath if i could believe that theory josie she said it would relieve me of much worry for id know alora is safe butwhat was it your father said about your imagination  josie laughed this isnt wholly imagination you goose for its based on a knowledge of human nature as ive hinted also its a scientific matching of the pieces in the puzzle why mary louise in this deduction we have all the necessary elements of the usual crime a womanalways look for a woman in a mystery my dearmoney the cause of fourfifths of all crimes and a guilty man who is afraid of being forced to disgorge his illgotten gains then we will add an innocent girl who suffers through the machinations of others some of my conclusions may not be exactly correct but in the main the story is absolutely logical  thats what you said last night josie when you thought the governess gorham had abducted alora  true but i have later information which doesnt entirely upset the theory but changes the actors in the drama i dont say that further investigations may not alter this present plot in some of its details but the main facts are too lucid and undeniable to get far away from im now going to interview the house physician and get mrs ormes address  when she had gone mary louise went to granpa jim with the tale of josies latest discoveries and colonel hathaway was so impressed by the theory that he decided to telegraph peter conant to catch the noon train and come straight to chicago  the complications suggested by josie will require a lawyers advice he said and mr conant knows law and can advise us how to handle the case when we have discovered where alora is confined  meanwhile josie went to the doctors office and after waiting some time was finally admitted to his private room  i came to ask for the address of a trained nursea mrs ormewhom you recommended to mrs tolliver she began her innocent eyes regarding the physician gravely  dr pease frowned  i cannot recommend her again said he although shes a good nurse she is unreliable and left my patient without notice when she was badly needed  i merely want to find her declared josie im a stranger in town and ive a letter of introduction to mrs orme  i dont know her address i got the woman through dr anstruther  oh may i telephone dr anstruther then  ive no objection theres a telephone in the outer office but youre not likely to catch him much before noon dr anstruther is a very busy man  josie went to her own room to telephone she telephoned dr anstruthers office at intervals all the morning but did not succeed in getting him until nearly two oclock then he answered that he did not know mrs ormes address having always secured her services through the sisters hospital  josie tried the sisters hospital and learned that mrs orme lived in an apartment at 524 morgan avenue she took a taxicab and drove there determining to obtain an interview with the woman by posing as a nurse who desired assistance in securing employment but disappointment confronted her mrs orme had moved from the apartment ten days ago and her present address was unknown  she has taken considerable pains to cover her traces said josie to mary louise when she returned from her futile trip  i hope youre not discouraged dear returned mary louise anxiously the local detectives have done nothing at all so you are our only hope josie  the embryo detective smiled sweetly  im not here on a pleasure trip she said although i enjoy travel and good hotel fodder as well as anyone this is business but so far im just feeling my way and getting a start you cant open a mystery as you do a book mary louise it has to be pried open the very fact that this mrs orme has so carefully concealed her hidingplace is assurance that shes the guilty party who abducted alora being positive of that it only remains to find hernot an impossibility by any meansand then we shall have no difficulty in liberating her prisoner  but to find her can you do that josie  certainly with a little help from the police which they will gladly furnish they know im daddys daughter for i have already introduced myself to them and while they may be slow to take the initiative they are always quite willing to aid in an affair of this sort now it stands to reason mary louise that the nurse didnt use the streets to promenade with alora that would have been dangerous to her plans there are so few people abroad in chicago at six oclock in the morning that those who met the two would have noted and remembered them for the same reason mrs orme did not take a street car or the elevated therefore she took a cab and the cabman who drove them will know mrs ormes address  but who was the cabman asked mary louise  that said josie is to be my next discovery    chapter xix decoyed  the excitement of being once more in a big city rendered alora jones wakeful on that eventful tuesday morning following her arrival in chicago at daybreak she rose and peered trough the window into a gray and unimpressive side street then disinclined to return to bed she slowly began dressing  presently a sharp knock sounded upon her door somewhat surprised she opened it far enough to see a middleaged woman attired in nurses uniform standing in the dim hallway  miss jones miss alora jones questioned the woman in a soft voice  yes what is it  ive a message for you may i come in  alora fearful that mary louise or the colonel might have been taken suddenly ill threw wide the door and allowed the woman to enter as the nurse closed the door behind her alora switched on the electric light and then facing her visitor for the first time recognized her and gave a little cry of surprise  janet  yes i am janet orme your mothers nurse  but i thought you abandoned nursing after you made my father give you all that money an accent of scorn in her tone  i did for a time was the quiet answer all that money was not a great sum it was not as much as your father owed me so i soon took up my old profession again  the womans voice and attitude were meek and deprecating yet aloras face expressed distrust she remembered janets jaunty insolence at her fathers studio and how she had dressed extravagantly and attended theatre parties and fashionable restaurants scattering recklessly the money she had exacted from jason jones janet with an upward sweep of her half veiled eyes read the girls face clearly but she continued in the same subdued tones  however it is not of myself i came here to speak but on behalf of your mothers old friend doctor anstruther  oh did he send you here  yes i am his nurse just now he has always used me on his important cases and now i am attending the most important case of allhis own  is dr anstruther ill then asked alora  he is dying his health broke weeks ago as you may have heard and gradually he has grown worse this morning he is sinking rapidly we have no hope that he will last through the day  oh im sorry for that exclaimed alora who remembered the kindly old doctor with real affection he had been not only her mothers physician but her valued friend  he learned quite by accident of your arrival here last evening janet went on and so he begged me to see you and implore you to come to his bedside i advised him not to disturb you until morning but the poor man is very restless and so i came here at this unusual hour it seems he is anxious to tell you some secret which your dead mother confided to his keeping and realizing his hours are numbered he urges you to lose no time in going to him that is the message entrusted to me  there was no emotion in her utterance the story was told calmly as by one fulfilling a mission but indifferent as to its success alora did not hesitate  how far is it she quickly asked  a fifteen minute ride  the girl glanced at her watch it was not quite six oclock mary louise and the colonel would not appear for breakfast for a good two hours yet and after breakfast they were all to go to the yacht the hour was opportune affording her time to visit poor doctor anstruther and return before her friends were up had alora paused to give janets story more consideration she might have seen the inconsistencies in the nurses statements but her only thoughts were to learn her mothers secret and to show her sincere consideration for her kindly old friend  hastily completing her attire she added her hat and jacket and then said  i am ready janet  i hope we shall find him still alive remarked the nurse a cleverly assumed anxiety in her tone as she took the key from inside the door and fitted it to the outer side of the lock  alora passed out scarcely aware that janet had pretended to lock the door halfway down the hall the woman handed her the key  come this way please she said it is nearer to the carriage which is waiting for us  at the rear of the building they descended the stairs and passed through an anteroom fitted with lockers for the use of the employees of the hotel no one happened to be in the anteroom at that moment and they gained the alley without encountering a single person janet quickly led the girl through the alley and soon they came to a closed automobile which evidently awaited them janet opened the door for alora and followed the girl inside the car which started at once and sped along the quiet streets  you will find doctor anstruther very feeble said the nurse for he has suffered greatly but i am sure it will give him pleasure to see you again i hope he will recognize you i scarcely recognized you myself you have changed so much since last we saw you at the voltaire your resemblance to your mother is quite marked however  and so during the ride she kept up a flow of desultory conversation intended to distract aloras attention from the section of the city through which they were passing she spoke of dr anstruther mostly and answered such questions as alora put to her in a calm unemotional manner well calculated to allay suspicion the woman kept her eyes veiled by her lashes as of yore but her face seemed to have aged and grown harder in its lines there was no hint now of her former gay life in new york she had resumed the humble tones and manners peculiar to her profession such as alora remembered were characteristic of her at the time she nursed her mother  this is the place said janet as the cab came to a stop let us move softly as noise disturbs my patient  alora had paid no attention to the direction they had driven but on leaving the car she found herself facing a threestoried brick flat building of not very prepossessing appearance then were several vacant lots on either side of this building giving it a lonely appearance and in the lower windows were pasted placards to let  oh does doctor anstruther live here asked alora somewhat astonished  without seeming to have heard the question janet mounted the steps and opened the front door with a latchkey alora followed her inside and up two dingy flights to the third floor once she started to protest for the deadly silence of the place impressed her with a vague foreboding that something was amiss but janet silenced her with a warning finger on her lips and on reaching the upper landing herself avoided making a noise as she cautiously unlocked the door she stood listening a moment and then entered and nodded to the girl to follow  they were in a short dark passage which separated the landing from the rooms of the flat janet closed the outer door startling her companion with the sharp click it made and quickly opened another door which led into a shabby living room at the front of the building standing just within this room alora glanced around with the first real sensation of suspicion she had yet experienced janet raised her lids for a sweeping view of the girls face and then with a light laugh began to remove her own cloak and cap which she hung in a closet  come child make yourself at home she said in a mocking triumphant voice as she seated herself in a chair facing the bewildered girl i may as well inform you that this is to be your home for some time to comeuntil jason jones decides to rescue you you wont object i hope dont get nervous and youll find your quarters very comfortable if retired  alora understanding now first shuddered then grew tense and cast a hurried glance at the hall door behind her  have you lied to me janet she demanded  yes  and this is a trap doctor anstruther is not sick he did not send for me he is not here  you have guessed correctly alora  the girl wheeled and in a quick run reached the door to the landing it was fast locked  help she cried and stopped to listen help help  come in and take off your things called janet undisturbed by the outcry this building hasnt a soul in it but ourselves and you may yell for help until you are hoarse without being heard but dont be frightened im not going to hurt you in fact id like to make your confinement as cheerful as possible cant you understand the truth that i am simply holding your person in order to force jason jones to pay the money he owes me    chapter xx janets triumph  alora stood by the door irresolute wondering what to do it occurred to her that she was not much afraid of janet orme she had been trapped in order to bleed her father of money it was all her fathers fault his fault and janets  suppose you help me get our breakfast suggested the nurse coolly it will take your mind off your trouble and keep you from brooding i admit im hungry and im sure youll feel better for a cup of coffee  she passed into another room as she spoke and alora realizing the hall door could not be forced by her puny strength advanced into the living room there were three other doorways opening from this apartment she could hear janet rattling dishes and pans so the way she had gone led into the kitchen the other two doors she found gave entrance to small bedrooms neither having egress other than through the living room the furniture in all the rooms was cheap and tawdry but fairly comfortable  alora sat down and tried to collect her thoughts janet got the breakfast unaided and then came to summon her alora quietly walked into the kitchen and sat down at a little table spread for two there was a dish of crisp bacon some toast and coffee alora silently ate and drank determined to maintain her strength having finished her meal she sat back and asked  do you mind explaining what all this means  no indeed im glad to explain replied the woman raising her eyelids an instant to flash a glance of approval at her prisoner i have already said that i was obliged to annoy you in order to reach your father the dear father is an elusive person you know and is determined to avoid paying the money he owes me i havent been able to locate him lately but i have located you and you are mighty precious to him because if he loses you he loses the income from your fortune therefore it is my intention to hold you here until jason jones either pays my demands or allows the probate court to deprive him of his guardianship the proposition is really very simple as you see  still said alora i do not quite understand how did you know of my value to my father  i witnessed your mothers will was the reply  alora remembered that this was true  but why does my father still owe you money you were paid for nursing my mother and if your demands are merely blackmail why does not my father defy you  ill tell you answered janet it is a bit of ancient history but it may interest you your mother renounced your father when you were scarcely a year old i met jason jones soon afterward and believingas your own deluded mother didthat he would become a great artist i gambled with him on his career in other words i supported jason jones with all my earnings as a nurse for a period of six years and in return he signed an agreement which states that onehalf of all the money he received in the future from whatever source must be paid to me in return for my investment doubtless we both thought at the time that any money he got would come from the sale of his pictures neither could have dreamed that your mother would call him to her on her deathbed and present sent him with your income until you came of ageseven years control of a fortune with no other obligation than to look after a child and keep her with him but the agreement between us covered even that astonishing event imagine if you can jason jones amazement when he entered your mothers sick chamber to find mehis partneracting as her nurse he was also annoyed for he realized i knew the terms of the will and would demand my share of his income can you blame me he hadnt made good as an artist and this was my only chance to get back some of the hard earned savings i had advanced him but jason jones isnt square alora hes mean and shifty as perhaps you have discovered he gave me some money at first when i followed him to new york as you know but after that the coward ran away that provoked me and made me determined to run him down i traced him to europe and followed him there but he evaded me for a full year until my money was gone and i was forced to return to america for nearly three years longer i worked as a nurse and hoarded my earnings then through your fathers banker in new york i managed to learn his address the banker didnt tell me but i did a little spy work and in the banks mail i found a letter in jason jones handwriting postmarked positano italy that was all the clew i needed and i went to italy and soon located my man i faced him in his own villai believe you were away at the timeand when he found he was caught he cringed and begged for mercy and promised to give me all that belonged to me he said he had a lot of gold in his possession and he would pay me partly in gold and partly in drafts on his new york banker then he left the room to get the gold and returned with a husky italian servant who seized and bound me and threw me into a stone house used to store grapes where i was kept a prisoner for nearly ten days and treated like a dog  finally the italian released me asserting that jason jones was on his way to america i followed as soon as i could get passage in a ship but your clever father had left new york before i arrived there and i could not discover where he had hidden himself once more he had beaten me  her voice was hard and angry alora was tempted to believe the story for many of its details she knew were true she remembered for one thing that queer letter from silvio which she had discovered tucked inside one of her fathers books it stated that according to orders the italian had released the prisoner so the prisoner had been janet and alora could well understand her determination to secure revenge  it seems to me she said that you should have taken your contract with my father to a lawyer and brought suit to recover the money due you surely that would have been the easiest way to collect it  janets face grew red her lashes dropped still further over the eyes but she answered after an instants pause  i do not wish the world to know what a fool i was to support an imitation artist for six long years a lawsuit means publicity and i have a little pride left i assure you besides collecting her thoughts as she spoke i cannot see the wisdom of dividing my share with a lawyer when i can bring your father to terms myself i know i have executed a bold stroke in seizing you and making you my prisoner but its a stroke thats bound to win it was conceived last night on the spur of the moment lately i have been nursing in chicago where i am better known than in new york and can get better wages since my return from italy ive been saving to renew the search for jason jones while nursing a mrs tolliver at the hotel blackington fortune suddenly smiled on me i chanced to examine the hotel register last night and found you were registered with colonel hathaways party your room number was marked opposite your name so i had you properly located during the night while on duty in mrs tollivers room i had ample time to figure out a plan of action i knew you were fond of old doctor anstruther and so used his name for a lure i had already rented this flat not with the idea of using it for a prison but because it was cheap and so isolated that i could sleep during the daytime without being disturbed i believe thats all that i need explain to you our little adventure of this morning you will now be able to understand perfectly also you will understand the fact that you must remain a prisoner until my purpose is accomplished im sorry for you but it cant be helped wont you have another cup of coffee alora  alora had no answer ready janets story did not satisfy her she felt that somewhere there was a flaw in it but she decided to bide her time    chapter xxi the price of liberty  alora being in the main a sensible girl strove to make the best of her unpleasant predicament she longed to notify mary louise that she was safe and well and in answer to her pleadings janet agreed she might write a letter to that effect with no hint that she was imprisoned or where she could be found and the nurse would mail it for her so alora wrote the letter and showed it to janet who could find no fault with its wording and promised to mail it when she went out to market which she did every morning carefully locking her prisoner in it is perhaps needless to state that the letter never reached mary louise because the nurse destroyed it instead of keeping her agreement to mail it letters can be traced and janet did not wish to be traced just then  the days dragged by with little excitement alora sought many means of escape but found none practical once while janet was unlocking the hall door to go to market the girl made a sudden dash to get by her and so secure her freedom but the woman caught her arm and swung her back so powerfully that alora fell against the opposite wall bruised and half stunned she was no match for janet in strength  im sorry said janet complacently but you brought it on yourself im not brutal but i wont be balked please remember my girl that to me this is a very important enterprise and ive no intention of allowing you to defeat my plans  usually the woman was not unpleasant in her treatment of alora but conversed with her frankly and cheerfully as if striving to relieve her loneliness  have you written to my father about me the girl asked one day  not yet was the reply i dont even know where jason jones may be found for you havent given me his address but theres no hurry you have been missing only a week so far jason jones has doubtless been notified of your disappearance and is beginning to worry of course he will imagine i am responsible for this misfortune and his alarm will grow with the days that pass finally when his state of mind becomes desperate you will give me his address and he will hear from me i shall have no trouble at that crisis in bringing my dishonest partner to terms  i cant see the object of waiting so long protested alora how long do you intend to keep me here  i think you should remain missing about fifty days during which time they will search for you in vain your fathers search for you will include a search for me and ive figured on that and defy him to find me the sisters hospital the only address known to the physicians who employ me believe ive gone to some small indiana town on a case but i neglected to give them the name of the town so theres a blind lead that will keep my pursuers busy without their getting anywhere its easy to hide in a big city here you are very safe alora mid discovery is impossible  janet had abandoned her nurses costume from the first day of the girls imprisonment when she went out which was only to a nearby market and grocery she wore an unobtrusive dress  every day seemed more dreary to alora than the last she soon became very restless under her enforced confinement and her nerves as well as her general health began to give way she had been accustomed to outofdoor exercise and these rooms were close and stuffy because janet would not allow the windows open  for twelve days and nights poor alora constantly planned an escape only to abandon every idea she conceived as foolish and impractical she looked forward to fifty days of this life with horror and believed she would go mad if forced to endure her confinement so long    chapter xxii a compromise  if i had any money of my own alora said to janet orme on the morning of the twelfth day of imprisonment i would gladly pay it to free  janet flashed a quick glance at her do you mean that she asked with illsuppressed eagerness  i do indeed declared the girl moaning dismally but i never have a cent to call my own  janet sat still for some time thinking  i too wish you were free she admitted resuming the conversation for my position as jailer obliges me to share your confinement and its wearing on me as it is on you but you have unconsciously given me a thoughtan idea that seems likely to lead to a compromise between us im going to consider it seriously and if it still looks good to me ill make you a proposition  saying this she retired to her bedroom and closed the door after her leaving alora in a fit of nervous trembling through halfformed hopes that she might gain her release  it was nearly an hour before janet returned when she came from her room she stood before the girl for a time and seemed to study her face alora was anxious and did not endeavor to conceal the fact in her hand the woman held a paper which she presently laid upon the centertable  i have decided to make you a proposition she said turning to seat herself near the table if it interests you all right if it doesnt you may of course reject it my offer is this if you will tell me where to find your father and will promise not to mention me to him or to warn him of my intentions and if you will sign this paper which i have prepared i will allow you to return to your friends today you are not especially fond of jason jones i believe  not especially although he is my father returned alora eyeing the woman expectantly  then you can have no objection to my forcing him to disgorge my share of his income which you would not get in any event i dont know how much of an allowance he makes you but  i dont get any allowance said alora in fact he gives me nothing  then my demands on your father will not affect your interests are you willing to give me his address and promise not to warn him  under the circumstances yes  very well i accept your plighted wordyour word of honor now sign this paper and you may go  she took the paper from the table and handed it to alora who read as follows  for value received in services faithfully rendered and which i hereby freely and without coercion acknowledge i hereby promise and agree to pay to janet orme jones on the day that i attain my majority the sum of fifty thousand dollars which sum is to be paid from my estate without recourse equivocation or attempt to repudiate the said obligation inasmuch as i willingly admit the said sum to be justly due the said janet orme jones signed  alora read the paper twice with growing indignation then she glanced up at her jailer and muttered questioningly jones janet orme jones  a family name my dear the joneses are so thick and so unimportant that generally i do not use the name but this is a legal document i hope you wont try to claim relationship she added with a light laugh  im not going to promise you so enormous a sum as fifty thousand dollars even to secure my liberty said alora its out of all reasonitsitsoutrageous  very well returned janet coolly thats your own affair this is merely a compromise proposition suggested by yourself as i told you let us say no more about it  alora was greatly disheartened after allowing her hopes to run so high the disappointment was now doubly keen her defiance melted away with the thought of all the weary days of imprisonment she must endure until janet was ready to act  ii might agree to give you five thousand dollars she ventured  nonsense im not gunning for small game alora did you but realize it i am quite considerate in exacting only fifty thousand your estate is worth two millions your income is something like eighty thousand a year and this payment would leave you thirty thousand to use the first year after you come into your fortune i dont believe you could spend thirty thousand in a year when you are eighteen years of age  alora turned away and going to the front window looked through its stained and unwashed panes into the gloomy street below the sight emphasized her isolation from the world her imprisonment was becoming unbearable after all she reflected in reckless mood what did so small a share of her prospective fortune weigh against her present comfortand healthand happiness  janet was stealthily watching her  should you decide to sign the paper said the nurse you must make up your mind not to raise a row when payday comes the money will come out of your income and instead of investing it in more bonds you will have invested it in your liberty you wont be inconvenienced in the slightest degree on the other hand this money will mean everything to mea modest competence for my old age and relief from the drudgery of working ive had a hard life my girl for nursing is mere slavery to the whims of sick people consider also that for six years jason jones squandered all my savings in trying to paint pictures that were not worth the canvas he ruined if i had that money now i wouldnt need to descend to this disgraceful mode of recouping my bank account but under the circumstances dont you think i am justly entitled to some of the jones money  youre going to get a lot from my father  true but that is for his indebtedness while this amount is for your freedom a scrape of the pen and you secure liberty fresh air and the privilege of rejoining your friends who are probably getting anxious about you if you are the sensible girl i take you to be you wont hesitate  alora knew the woman was pleading her own case but the arguments appealed to her she was weak and nervous and her longing for liberty outweighed her natural judgment  i suppose im a fool but  slowly she approached the table where the written promissory note still lay janet had placed a pen and inkstand beside it    chapter xxiii mary louise has an intuition  i wish josie said mary louise dolefully youd let me help in this search for alora  id be glad to dear if i could think of a single thing you can do replied her friend just now im on the most tedious task imaginable visiting the army of cabdrivershorse and taxihere in chicago and trying to find the one who carried a woman and a girl away from the blackington at six oclock that eventful tuesday morning  have you met with any success at all asked mary louise  that question proves youre not fitted for detective work josie laughingly asserted a moments reflection would assure you that when i found my man my search would be ended ergo no success has yet attended my efforts ive interviewed a couple of hundreds however and that leaves only a few hundreds left to question  but the whole thing drags terribly complained mary louise days are passing and who knows what may be happening to poor alora while you are hanging around the cabstands  josies face grew grave in sober tones she said  im just as anxious as you are mary louise but this case is really puzzling because chicago is such a big city that criminals may securely hide themselves here for monthseven for yearswithout being discovered mrs orme was clever enough to leave few traces behind her as far as clews are concerned she might have evaporated into thin air taking alora with herexcept for this matter of the cabman thats why i am pinning my faith to this search knowing all the time nevertheless that mrs orme may have provided for even that contingency and rendered the discovery of the cabman impossible to do that however she would have to use a private equipage involving a confederate and i believe she preferred to take chances with a hired cab  what are the police doing inquired mary louise nervously  nothing they were soon discouraged and lost interest in the matter when i took hold of the case but i dont intend to get discouraged i hate to be stumped as you know and it seems to me after careful consideration that success may follow the discovery of the cabdriver ive not been neglecting other trails i assure you ive obtained a pretty fair record of the history of nurse orme she has the habit of drudging in sick rooms until she accumulates enough capital to lead a gay life for a month or so after which she resumes nursing in order to replenish her purse shes a good nurse and a wild spendthrift but aside from the peculiarity mentioned theres nothing in her career of especial interest the woman is pretty well known both in new york and chicago for she squanders in the first city and saves in the other but of her early history there is no information available in her wildest moods she has never done anything to warrant her arrest yet the police have kept a suspicious eye on her for years  poor alora wailed mary louise miserably i wish i could do something for her  you did a lot for her when you put me on her trail declared josie with conviction ive a hunch i shall win ive wired daddy ogorman all about the case but he says he cant advise me in other words hes watching to see whether i make good or cave in and i just dare not fail so keep your courage mary louise and muster all the confidence you are able to repose in me i may not know all the tricks of the sleuths but i know some of them and now im off to interview more cabmen  mary louise sighed as her friend left her she was indeed very unhappy and restless during those days of tedious waiting peter conant had come to chicago on the colonels demand but mary louise couldnt see how he was able to help them one bit  of course the lawyer had said in his terse choppy manner whoever abducted the girl is criminally liable we can put the party in jail  when we get her suggested mary louise impatiently the party is mrs orme we have established that fact without a doubt and if we could get her wed also get alora  just so peter replied and between the ogorman girl and the police we ought to capture the woman soon i have a degree of confidence in josie ogorman and somewhat more confidence in the police  do you think we should notify jason jones inquired colonel hathaway  i have considered that sir in all its phases and knowing the mans peculiar characteristics i believe such a course is not as yet desirable jones is so enthralled by his latest craze over aviation that he would be no fit adviser and could render no practical assistance in the search for his daughter on the other hand his association would be annoying for he would merely accuse you of neglect in permitting alora to be stolen while in your care i have seen a copy of his wifes will and know that the girls loss may cost him his guardianship and the perquisites that pertain to it in that case he will probably sue you for the loss of the money claiming aloras abduction was due to your carelessness  he could not win such an absurd suit however declared the colonel  still he might be awarded damages asserted the lawyer juries are uncertain the law is somewhat elastic judges are peculiar  dont worry granpa jim said mary louise soothingly as she sat on the arm of his chair and rubbed the wrinkles from his forehead there must be such a thing as justice even in law  law is justice stated mr conant resenting the insinuation but justice is sometimes recognized by humans in one form and sometimes in another i do not say that jason jones could collect damages on such complaint but he assuredly would have a case  mr conant had desired to return home after the first conference with his client but he admitted that his wife was recovering from her indisposition and a kindly neighbor was assisting irene in the care of her so he yielded to his clients urgent request to remain colonel hathaway was more alarmed by aloras disappearance than he allowed mary louise to guess and he wanted mr conant to spur the police to renewed effort in addition to this the colonel and his lawyer usually spent the best part of each day pursuing investigations on their own account with the result that mary louise was left to mope alone in the hotel rooms  the young girl was fond of alora and secretly terrified over her mysterious disappearance she tried to embroider as she sat alone and waited for something to happen but her nerveless fingers would not hold the needle she bought some novels but could not keep her mind on the stories hour by hour she gazed from the window into the crowded street below searching each form and face for some resemblance to alora she had all the newspapers sent to her room that she might scan the advertisements and personals for a clew and this led her to following the news of the great war in which she found a partial distraction from her worries and one morning after her grandfather and the lawyer had left her she was glancing over the columns of the tribune when an item caught her eye that drew from her a cry of astonishment the item read as follows  the grand prize at the exhibition of american paintings being held in the art institute was yesterday awarded by the jury to the remarkable landscape entitled poppies and pepper trees by the california artist jason jones this picture has not only won praise from eminent critics but has delighted the thousands of visitors who have flocked to the exhibition so the award is a popular one the associated artists are tendering a banquet tonight to jason jones at the congress hotel where he is staying the future of this clever artist promises well and will be followed with interest by all admirers of his skillful technique and marvelous coloring  mary louise read this twice trying to understand what it meant then she read it a third time  how strangely we have all been deceived in aloras father she murmured i remember that granpa jim once claimed that any man so eccentric might well possess talent but even mr jones own daughter did not believe he was a true artist and alora never guessed he was still continuing to paintalone and in secretor that he had regained his former powers and was creating a masterpiece we have all been sadly wrong in our judgment of jason jones only his dead wife knew he was capable of great things  she dropped the paper still somewhat bewildered by the remarkable discovery  and he is here in chicago too she mused continuing her train of thought and we all thought he was stupidly learning to fly in dorfield oh now i understand why he allowed alora to go with us he wanted to exhibit his picturethe picture whose very existence he had so carefully guardedand knew that with all of us out of the way afloat upon the great lakes he could come here without our knowledge and enter the picture in the exhibition it may be he doubted its successhe is diffident in some waysand thought if it failed none of us at home would be the wiser but im sure that now he has won he will brag and bluster and be very conceited and disagreeable over his triumph that is the mans natureto be cowed by failure and bombastic over success its singular come to think it over how one who has the soul to create a wonderful painting can be so crude and uncultured so morose andandcruel  suddenly she decided to go and look at the picture the trip would help to relieve her loneliness and she was eager to see what jason jones had really accomplished the institute was not far from her hotel she could walk the distance in a few minutes so she put on her hat and set out for the exhibition  on her way disbelief assailed her i dont see how the man did it she mentally declared i wonder if that item is just a huge joke because the picture was so bad that the reporter tried to be ironical  but when she entered the exhibition and found a small crowd gathered around one pictureit was still early in the dayshe dismissed at once that doubtful supposition  that is the jason jones picture said an attendant answering her question and nodding toward the admiring group thats the prizewinnerover there  mary louise edged her way through the crowd until the great picture was in full view and then she drew a long breath awestruck delighted filled with a sense of allpervading wonder  its a tremendous thing whispered a man beside her to his companion theres nothing in the exhibit to compare with it and how it breathes the very spirit of california  california thought mary louise of course those yellow poppies and lacy pepper trees with their deep red berries were typical of no other place and the newspaper had called jason jones a california artist when had he been in california she wondered alora had never mentioned visiting the pacific coast  yet sometime surely her father must have lived there was it while alora was a small child and after her mother had cast him off he could have made sketches then and preserved them for future use  as she stood there marveling at the superb genius required to produce such a masterpiece of art a strange notion crept stealthily into her mind promptly she drove it out but it presently returned it would not be denied finally it mastered her  anyhow she reflected setting her teeth together ill beard the wolf in his den if my intuition has played me false at worst the man can only sneer at me and ive always weathered his scornful moods but if i am right  the suggestion was too immense to consider calmly with quick nervous steps she hastened to the congress hotel and sent up her card to jason jones on it she had written in pencil i shall wait for you in the parlor please come to me    chapter xxiv an interruption  before you sign this promissory note remarked janet orme as alora reluctantly seated herself at the table you must perform the other part of your agreement and give me the present address of your father jason jones  he lives in dorfield said alora  write his street numberhere on this separate sheet  the girl complied  is it a private house or is it a studio  a cottage father doesnt paint any more  that is very sensible of him declared the nurse yet i wonder how he can resist painting he has always had a passion for the thing and in the old days was never happy without a brush in his hand he had an idea he could do something worth while but that was mere delusion for he never turned out anything decent or that would sell in the market therefore the money he spent for paints brushes and canvasmoney i worked hard to earnwas absolutely wasted does your father keep any servants  one maid an irish girl born in the town  still economical i see well thats all the information i require you have given your word of honor not to notify him that i have discovered his whereabouts is it not so  yes said alora  now sign the note  alora pen in hand hesitated while she slowly read the paper again she hated to give fifty thousand dollars to this scheming woman even though the loss of such a sum would not seriously impair her fortune but what could she do  sign it girl exclaimed janet impatiently  alora searched the note for a loophole that would enable her afterward to repudiate it she knew nothing of legal phrases yet the wording seemed cleverly constructed to defeat any attempt to resist payment  sign cried the woman with pen hovering over the place where she had been told to write her name alora still hesitated and seeing this the nurses face grew dark with anger a sudden click sounded from the hall door but neither heard it  sign she repeated half rising with a threatening gesture  no dont sign please said a clear voice and a short stumpy girl with red hair and freckled face calmly entered the room and stood smilingly before them  janet uttered an exclamation of surprise and annoyance and sank back in her chair glaring at the intruder alora stared in speechless amazement at the smiling girl whom she had never seen before  how did you get in here demanded janet angrily  why i just unlocked the door and walked in was the reply delivered in a cheery and somewhat triumphant voice  this is a private apartment  indeed i thought it was a prison said the girl i imagined you mrs orme to be a jailer and this young personwho is miss alora jones i believei supposed to be your prisoner perhaps im wrong but i guess im right  the nurse paled the look she flashed from her halfveiled eyes was a dangerous look she knew in the instant that the stranger had come to liberate alora but the next instant she reflected that all was not lost for she had already decided to release her prisoner without compulsion it was important to her plans however that she obtain the promissory note so instantly controlling herself she lightly touched aloras arm and said in her usual soft voice  sign your name my dear and then we will talk with this person  alora did not move to obey for she had caught a signal from the redheaded girl  i object to your signing that paper protested the stranger seating herself in a vacant chair i havent the faintest idea what it is youre about to sign but if i were you i wouldnt do it  it is the price of my liberty explained alora  well this is a free country and liberty doesnt cost anything ive a carriage waiting outside and i will drive you back to the colonel and mary louise free of charge you wont even have to whack up on the cab hire  the nurse slowly rose and faced the girl  who are you she demanded  no one of importance was the answer im just josie ogorman the daughter of john ogorman of washington who is a lieutenant in the governments secret service  then youre a detective  the aforesaid john ogorman declares im not he says i must learn a lot before i become a real detective so at present im just practicing mary louise is my friend you know she continued now addressing alora and you are a friend of mary louise so when you mysteriously disappeared she telegraphed me and i came on to hunt you up that wasnt an easy job for an amateur detective i assure you and it cost me a lot of time and some worry but glory be ive now got you located and mrs ormes jig is up  the nurse moved softly to the door that led into the passage and locked it putting the key into her pocket  now said she with another flash of those curious eyes i have two prisoners  josie laughed  i could almost have sworn youd try that trick she remarked it was on the cards and you couldnt resist it permit me to say mrs orme that youre a rather clever woman and i admire cleverness even when its misdirected but my daddy has taught me in his painstaking way not to be caught napping a good soldier provides for a retreat as well as an advance ive been on your trail for a long time and only this morning succeeded in winning the confidence of the cabman who drove you here wasnt sure of course that you were still here until i saw aloras face at the window a while ago then i knew id caught you the cab is a closed one and holds four inside so i invited three policeman to accompany me one is at the back of this house one at the front door and the third is just outside here on the landing probably he can hear us talking hes a big man that third policeman and if i raise my voice to cry out he could easily batter down the door you have locked and come to my rescue now will you be good mrs orme  the nurse realized her defeat she deliberately took the note from the table and tore it up  you have really foiled me my girl she said philosophically although if you knew all you would not blame me for what i have done  youve decided not to dig any money out of alora then  it wouldnt matter to her but i have abandoned the idea however i shall insist on making jason jones pay me liberally for my disappointment now take the girl and go get your things on alora  josie regarded her thoughtfully  i had intended to arrest you mrs orme she remarked but honestly i cant see what good it would do while it would cause mary louise and the dear colonel a heap of trouble in prosecuting you so unless miss jones objects  all i want it to get away from here to be out of her clutches asserted alora  then let us go the woman deserves punishment but doubtless shell get her just deserts in other ways get your things on my dear the cab and the policemen are waiting  janet orme unlocked the door to the passage then she stood motionless with drooping eyelids while the two girls passed out alora greatly unnerved and still fearful clung to the arm of her rescuer  when they had gained the street and were about to enter the closed automobile she asked where are the three policemen  invisible returned josie very cheerfully i had to invent that story my dear and the recording angel is said to forgive detectives for lying  she followed alora into the car and closed the door  drive to the blackington please she called to the driver  and as they whirled away she leaned from the window and waved a parting signal to mrs orme who stood in the upper window her face contorted and scowling with chagrin at the discovery that she had been outwitted by a mere girl    chapter xxv jason jones  the colonel and peter conant had just entered the drawing room of the suite at the hotel and found mary louise absent this was unusual and unaccountable and they were wondering what could have become of the girl when the door suddenly burst open and josies clear voice cried triumphantly  ive got her ive captured the missing heiress at last  both men astonished rose to their feet as alora entered and with a burst of tears threw her arms around the old colonels neck for a few moments the tableau was dramatic all being speechless with joy at the reunion colonel hathaway patted aloras head and comforted the sobbing girl as tenderly as if she had been his own grandchildor mary louise  josie perched herself lightly on the centertable and swinging her legs complacently back and forth explained her discovery in a stream of chatter for she was justly elated by her success  and to think she concluded that i never missed a clew that it was really the nurse mrs ormemrs jones old nursewho stole alora according to our suspicions and that her object was just what i thought to get money from that miser jason jones daddy will be pleased with this triumph im pleased mary louise will be pleased andby the way where is mary louise  i dont know confessed the colonel who had just placed alora now more selfpossessed in a chair i was beginning to worry about her when you came in she seldom leaves these rooms except for a few moments and even then she tells me or leaves word where she is going i spoke to the clerk when i returned and he said she had left the hotel early this morning and its now four oclock  josies smile faded and her face became grave  now who she said could have an object in stealing mary louise complications threaten us in this matter and the first thing we must do is  oh alora exclaimed mary louise who had softly opened the door and caught sight of her friend next moment the two girls were locked in an embrace and josie a shade of disappointment struggling with her sunny smile remarked coolly  very well that beats the champion female detective out of another job but i might have known mary louise wouldnt get herself stolen no such adventure ever happens to her  mary louise turned to the speaker with an earnest look on her sweet face  an adventure has happened to me josie andandi hardly know how to break the news  she held alora at arms length and looked gravely into her friends face alora noted the serious expression and said quickly  what is it bad news for me  ii think not replied mary louise hesitatingly but itsits wonderful news and i hardly know how to break it to you  the best way remarked josie much interested is to let it out in a gush wonderful stuff never causes anyone to faint  alora said mary louise solemnly your father is here  where  he is just outside in the corridor  why doesnt he come in asked the colonel  he neednt have worried about me said alora in sullen tone but i suppose it was the danger of losing his money that  no interrupted mary louise you mistake me jason jones the great artista splendid cultured man and  a sharp rap at the door made her pause answering the colonels summons a bellboy entered  for mr conant sir he said offering a telegram  the lawyer tore open the envelope as the boy went out and after a glance at it exclaimed in shocked surprise great heavens  then he passed the message to colonel hathaway who in turn read it and passed it to josie ogorman blank silence followed while mary louise and alora eyed the others expectantly  who did you say is outside in the corridor demanded josie in a puzzled tone  aloras father replied mary louise  jason jones  jason jones repeated mary louise gravely  well then listen to this telegram it was sent to mr peter conant from dorfield and says jason jones killed by falling from an aeroplane at ten oclock this morning notify his daughter  alora drew a quick breath and clasped her hands over her heart uncongenial as the two had been jason jones was her fatherher only remaining parentand the suddenness of his death shocked and horrified the girl indeed all present were horrified yet mary louise seemed to bear the news more composedly than the othersas if it were a minor incident in a great drama she slipped an arm around her girl friends waist and said soothingly  never mind dear it is dreadful i know what an awful way to die and yetand yet alorait may be all for the best  josie slid down from the table her active brain was the first to catch a glimmering of what mary louise meant  shall i call that man in she asked excitedly the man whom you say is aloras father  no answered mary louise let me go for him please ii must tell him this strange news myself try to quiet yourself alora andand be prepared im going to introduce to youjason jones  she uttered the last sentence slowly and with an earnestness that bewildered all her hearersexcept perhaps josie ogorman and then she left the room  the little group scarcely moved or spoke  it seemed an age to them yet it was only a few moments when mary louise came back leading by the hand a tall handsome gentleman who bore in every feature in every movement the mark of good birth culture and refinement and in a voice that trembled with nervous excitement the girl announced  this is jason jonesa california artistthe man who married antoinette seaver he is aloras father and the otherthe other  why the other was a fraud of course exclaimed josie    chapter xxvi what mary louise accomplished  i am quite sure it is unnecessary to relate in detail the scene that followed mary louises introduction or the excited inquiries and explanations which naturally ensued to those present the scene was intensely dramatic and never to be forgotten but such a meeting between father and daughter is considered too sacred to be described here  mary louises intuition had not played her false she had found at the congress hotel another jason jones far different from the one she had known and a few questions elicited the fact that he was indeed the father of alora so as briefly as she could she told him how another man had usurped his place and seized all of aloras income at the same time willfully depriving the girl of such comforts and accomplishments as one in her position should enjoy  and to think she added indignantly that he is not jason jones at all  i believe you are mistaken there replied the artist thoughtfully jason is a family name derived from one of our most eminent ancestors and in my generation it is also borne i have learned by one of my second cousins a jason jones who is also a painter and aspires to fame as an artist i have never met the man but his indifferently executed canvases offered for sale under our common name formerly caused me considerable annoyance and perhaps interfered with my career but of late i have not heard of this jason jones for soon after my separation from my wife i went to southern california and located in a little bungalow hidden in a wild canyon of the santa monica mountains there i have secluded myself for years determined to do some really good work before i returned east to prove my ability some time after antoinette died i saw a notice to that effect in a newspaper but there were no comments and i did not know that she had made me guardian of our child that was like antoinette he continued in gentler tones she was invariably generous and considerate of my shortcomings even after we realized we were not fitted to live together her renunciation of me seemed harsh at first for i could not understand her ambitions but in fact she drove me to success i have won the grand prize after all these years of patient labor and from now on my future is assured  have you never longed for your child asked mary louise reproachfully  i have indeed in imagination i have followed aloras growth and development year by year and one of my most cherished anticipations when coming here was to seek out my daughter and make myself known to her i knew she had been well provided for in worldly goods and i hoped to find her happy and content if my picture received favorable comment at the exhibition i intended to seek alora i did not expect to win the grand prize           it was this newly discovered jason jones and his daughterwho already loved him and shyly clung to this responsive and congenial parentwho went to dorfield with the colonel and mary louise and peter conant and josie ogorman to attend the obsequies of the other less fortunate jason jones mrs orme was there too mrs janet orme jones for she admitted she was the dead mans wife and told them in a chastened but still defiant mood how the substitution of her husband for the other artist had come about  many years ago when i was nursing in a new york hospital she said a man was brought in with both arms broken having been accidentally knocked down by a streetcar i was appointed to nurse him and learned from him that he was jason jones a poor artist who was however just about to win recognition he showed me a newspaper clipping that highly praised a painting then being exhibited at the metropolitan museum of art which was signed jason jones i know now that it wasnt his picture at all but the work of his cousin but at the time the clipping deceived me  i was ambitious to become something more than a nurse i thought that to be the wife of a famous artist would bring me wealth and a position in society so i married jason joneswithout loveand he married me also without lovein order to get my wages he won where i lost for during several years i foolishly supported him with my savings always expecting him to become famous at first he attributed his failures to his broken arms although they had healed perfectly and i ignorantly accepted the excuse it was only after years of waiting for the man to prove his ability that i finally woke to the truththat he had no talentand i then left him to his own devices in chicago i sought to forget my unfortunate past and found regular employment there in my profession  it was while nursing mrs jones that i overheard her give to doctor anstruther the supposed address of her husband which had been furnished her by a casual acquaintance and tell him to wire jason jones to come to her at once i well knew a mistake had been made and that she had given the doctor my own husbands addressthe address of an entirely different jason jones my first impulse was to undeceive her but that would involve humiliating explanations so i hesitated and finally decided to remain silent when the doctor had gone to telegraph and the die was cast i reflected that my husband whom i knew to be sunk in poverty would ignore the request to come to chicago to be reconciled to his dying wife my jason wouldnt care whether i lived or died and wouldnt have spent a cent to be reconciled with me for of course he would think it was i who asked for him since he would know nothing of antoinette seaver jones or that she was the wife of his distant relative the other jason jones  he did indeed answer doctor anstruther by saying he would not come unless his expenses were advanced so the good doctor launched the future deception by sending him ample funds i knew of this action and wondered what i ought to do there would be a terrible mixup when my husband appeared and i realized how disappointed the sick woman would be knowing her condition to be dangerous i feared the shock would kill her which it really did for still i kept silent i told myself that i had not aided in the deception in any way that it was a trick of fate and i could not be blamed i thought that when doctor anstruther met my husband there would be explanations and the truth would come out but somehow that did not happen jason jones walked into antoinette seaver jones room expecting to find me dying and saw a strange woman in the bed and his wifein good healthstanding before him he let out an oath in his surprise and my patient who had raised up in bed to stare at him uttered a low moan and fell back on her pillow dead i saw the tragedy and involuntarily screamed and jason jones saw she was dead and cried out in fear i had just time to recover my wits and whisper to him to keep his mouth shut and i would make him rich when doctor anstruther hurried into the room  the whole thing was unpremeditated up to that time but now i assisted fate for i had witnessed mrs jones will and knew well its contents no one seemed to know there were two artists named jason jones and everyone accepted my husband as aloras father and the one entitled to her guardianship and to profit by the terms of the will  an hour after mrs jones died i secured a secret interview with my husband who until then had been thoroughly bewildered and explained to him that the mistake in identity would if he took prompt advantage of it give him the control of an enormous income for seven years until the child reached the age of eighteen he was fearful at first that the other jason jones would appear and prosecute him for swindling but as the husband of antoinette seaver had not been heard from in years even by his own wife i induced him to accept the risk it was i who virtually put that income into my husbands hands and in return he agreed to supply me with whatever money i demanded up to a half of his receipts but he proved that there is not always honor among thieves for after he had been made legal executor of the estate and his fears had somewhat subsided he endeavored to keep all the money for himself and begrudged me the one or two instalments i forced him to give me strangely enough this formerly povertystricken artist now developed a love of accumulationa miserly love for the money itself and hated to spend any of it even on himself or on the girl to whom he owed his good fortune the coward actually ran away and hid himself in europe and i having spent all the money he had given me with the idea i had an inexhaustible fund to draw upon was forced to turn nurse again  after three years i had saved enough to follow him to europe where i located him at a lonely villa in italy its very loneliness was my undoing for he made a husky servant lock me up in an outhouse and there i was held a prisoner until jason had again escaped to america he thought he could hide better in the united states and that i wouldnt have the money to follow him there but i had fortunately saved enough for my return passage by the time i got home however he had completely disappeared and all my efforts failed to locate him so i returned to chicago and again resumed my profession  you will say i might have denounced him as an impostor and made the police hunt him up but that would have ruined my chances of ever getting another penny of the money and might have involved me personally jason knew that and it made him bold to defy me i silently bided my time believing that fate would one day put the man in my power  you know how i happened to find alora in chicago and how i lured her to my home and kept her there a prisoner  it was found that the dead man had made large investments in his own name and as he had left no will janet declared that this property now belonged to her as his widow lawyer conant however assured her that as the money had never been legally her husbands but was secured by him under false pretenses all the investments and securities purchased with it must be transferred to the real jason jones to whom they now belonged the court would attend to that matter  and it serves you right madam added peter conant for concocting the plot to swindle aloras father out of the money his dead wife intended him to have you are not properly punished for you should be sent to jail but your disappointment will prove a slight punishment at least  so far as i knew answered janet defending her crime aloras father was either dead or hidden in some corner of the world where he could never be found to my knowledge there was no such person existent so the substitution of my husband for him did him no injury and merely kept the income out of the clutches of paid executors had the right man appeared at any time during these four years to claim his child and the money he might easily have secured them by proving his identity so the fault was his as much as mine  jason jones had personally listened to the womans confession which filled him with wonder while severely condemning her unscrupulous methods he refused to prosecute her although mr conant urged him to do so and even carried his generosity to the extent of presenting her with one of her dead husbands small investments obtaining from her in return the promise to lead an honest and respectable life  it had been the artists intention to return to his california bungalow but after the probate court had acknowledged him and transferred to him the guardianship of his daughter he decided to devote the coming years to alora and endeavor to recompense her with fatherly devotion for the privations and unhappiness she had formerly endured  alora did not wish to be separated from mary louise so her father purchased the handsome residence of senator huling which was situated directly opposite to that of colonel hathaway in dorfield and succeeded in making it a real home for his daughter  josie ogorman went back to washington well pleased with her success although she said with a little grimace of feigned regret  i did pretty well for an amateur for i tackled a tough case and won out but after all it was mary louise who solved the mystery and restored alora to her honestfortrue father
