84886709	night watches  by ww jacobs    the weaker vessel  mr gribble sat in his small front parlour in a state of angry amazement it was halfpast six and there was no mrs gribble worse still there was no tea  it was a state of things that had only happened once before that was three weeks after marriage and on that occasion mr gribble had put his foot down with a bang that had echoed down the corridors of thirty years  the fire in the little kitchen was out and the untidy remains of mrs gribbles midday meal still disgraced the table  more and more dazed the indignant husband could only come to the conclusion that she had gone out and been run over  other things might possibly account for her behaviour that was the only one that would excuse it  his meditations were interrupted by the sound of a key in the front door and a second later a small anxious figure entered the room and leaning against the table strove to get its breath  the process was not helped by the alarming distension of mr gribbles figure  ii got homequick as i couldhenry said mrs gribble panting  where is my tea  demanded her husband  what do you mean by it  the fires out and the kitchen is just as you left it  iive been to a lawyers henry said mrs gribble and i had to wait  lawyers  repeated her husband  i got a letter this afternoon telling me to call  poor uncle george that went to america is gone  that is no excuse for neglecting me said mr gribble  of course people die when they are old  is that the one that got on and made money  his wife apparently struggling to repress a little excitement nodded hehes left me two hundred pounds a year for life henry she said dabbing at her pale blue eyes with a handkerchief  theyre going to pay it monthly sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a month thats how he left it  two hund began mr gribble forgetting himself  two hungo and get my tea  if you think youre going to give yourself airs because your uncles left you money you wont do it in my house  he took a chair by the window and while his wife busied herself in the kitchen sat gazing in blank delight at the little street  two hundred a year  it was all he could do to resume his wonted expression as his wife reentered the room and began to lay the table  his manner however when she let a cup and saucer slip from her trembling fingers to smash on the floor left nothing to be desired  its nice to have money come to us in our old age said mrs gribble timidly as they sat at tea  it takes a load off my mind  old age said her husband disagreeably  what dye mean by old age im fiftytwo and feel as young as ever i did  you look as young as ever you did said the docile mrs gribble i cant see no change in you  at least not to speak of  not so much talk said her husband  when i want your opinion of my looks ill ask you for it  when do you start getting this money  tuesday week first of may replied his wife  the lawyers are going to send it by registered letter  mr gribble grunted  i shall be sorry to leave the house for some things said his wife looking round  weve been here a good many years now henry  leave the house  repeated mr gribble putting down his teacup and staring at her  leave the house  what are you talking about  but we cant stay here henry faltered mrs gribble  not with all that money  they are building some beautiful houses in charlton grove nowbathroom tiled hearths and beautiful stained glass in the front door and all for twentyeight pounds a year  wonderful  said the other with a mocking glint in his eye  and iron palings to the front garden painted chocolatecolour picked out with blue continued his wife eyeing him wistfully  mr gribble struck the table a blow with his fist  this house is good enough for me he roared and whats good enough for me is good enough for you  you want to waste money on show thats what you want stained glass and bowwindows  you want a bowwindow to loll about in do you shouldnt wonder if you dont want a servantgal to do the work  mrs gribble flushed guiltily and caught her breath  were going to live as weve always lived pursued mr gribble money aint going to spoil me  i aint going to put on no side just because ive come in for a little bit  if you had your way we should end up in the workhouse  he filled his pipe and smoked thoughtfully while mrs gribble cleared away the teathings and washed up  pictures good to look upon formed in the smokepictures of a hale hearty man walking along the primrose path arminarm with two hundred a year of the mahogany and plush of the saloon bar at the grafton arms of sunday jaunts and the oval on summer afternoons  he ate his breakfast slowly on the first of the month and the meal finished took a seat in the window with his pipe and waited for the postman  mrs gribbles timid reminders concerning the flight of time and consequent fines for lateness at work fell on deaf ears  he jumped up suddenly and met the postman at the door  has it come  inquired mrs gribble extending her hand  by way of reply her husband tore open the envelope and handing her the covering letter counted the notes and coin and placed them slowly in his pockets  then as mrs gribble looked at him he looked at the clock and snatching up his hat set off down the road  he was late home that evening and his manner forbade conversation mrs gribble with the bereaved air of one who has sustained an irremediable loss sighed fitfully and once applied her handkerchief to her eyes  thats no good said her husband at last that wont bring him back  bring who back inquired mrs gribble in genuine surprise  why your uncle george said mr gribble  thats what youre turning on the watercart for aint it  i wasnt thinking of him said mrs gribble trying to speak bravely i was thinking of  well you ought to be interrupted her husband  he wasnt my uncle poor chap but ive been thinking of him off and on all day  that bloaterpaste you are eating now came from his kindness  i brought it home as a treat  i was thinking of my clothes said mrs gribble clenching her hands together under the table  when i found i had come in for that money the first thing i thought was that i should be able to have a decent dress  my old ones are quite worn out and as for my hat and jacket  go on said her husband fiercely  go on  thats just what i said trust you with money and we should be poorer than ever  im ashamed to be seen out said mrs gribble  a womans place is the home said mr gribble and so long as im satisfied with your appearance nobody else matters  so long as i am pleased thats everything  what do you want to go dressing yourself up for  nothing looks worse than an overdressed woman  what are we going to do with all that money then  inquired mrs gribble in trembling tones  thatll do said mr gribble decidedly  thatll do  one o these days youll go too far  you start throwing that money in my teeth and see what happens  ive done my best for you all these years and theres no reason to suppose i shant go on doing so  what did you say  what  mrs gribble turned to him a face rendered ghastly by terror  ii saidit was my money she stammered  mr gribble rose and stood for a full minute regarding her  then kicking a chair out of his way he took his hat from its peg in the passage and with a bang of the streetdoor that sent a current of fresh sweet air circulating through the house strode off to the grafton arms  it was past eleven when he returned but even the spectacle of his wife laboriously darning her old dress failed to reduce his goodhumour in the slightest degree  in a frivolous mood he even took a feather from the dismembered hat on the table and stuck it in his hair  he took the stump of a strong cigar from his lips and exhaling a final cloud of smoke tossed it into the fireplace  uncle george dead he said at last shaking his head  hadnt pleasure acquaintance but good man  good man  he shook his head again and gazed mistily at his wife  he was a teetotaller she remarked casually  he was teetoiler repeated mr gribble regarding her equably  good man  uncle george deadteetoller  mrs gribble gathered up her work and began to put it away  bedtime said mr gribble and led the way upstairs singing  his goodhumour had evaporated by the morning and having made a light breakfast of five cups of tea he went off with lagging steps to work it was a beautiful spring morning and the idea of a man with two hundred a year and a headache going off to a warehouse instead of a days outing seemed to border upon the absurd  what use was money without freedom his toil was sweetened that day by the knowledge that he could drop it any time he liked and walk out a free man into the sunlight  by the end of a week his mind was made up  each day that passed made his hurried uprising and scrambled breakfast more and more irksome and on monday morning with hands in trouserpockets and legs stretched out he leaned back in his chair and received his wifes alarming intimations as to the flight of time with a superior and sphinxlike smile  its too fine to go to work today he said lazily  come to that any day is too fine to waste at work  mrs gribble sat gasping at him  so on saturday i gave em a weeks notice continued her husband and after potts and co had listened while i told em what i thought of em they said theyd do without the weeks notice  youve never given up your job  said mrs gribble  i spoke to old potts as one gentleman of independent means to another said mr gribble smiling  thirtyfive bob a week after twenty years service  and he had the cheek to tell me i wasnt worth that  when i told him what he was worth he talked about sending for the police  what are you looking like that for  ive worked hard for you for thirty years and ive had enough of it  now its your turn  youd find it hard to get another place at your age said his wife especially if they wouldnt give you a good character  place  said the other staring  place  i tell you ive done with work  for a man o my means to go on working for thirtyfive bob a week is ridiculous  but suppose anything happened to me said his wife in a troubled voice  thats not very likely said mr gribble  youre tough enough  and if it did your money would come to me  mrs gribble shook her head  what roared her husband jumping up  ive only got it for life henry as i told you said mrs gribble in alarm  i thought you knew it would stop when i died  and whats to become of me if anything happens to you then  demanded the dismayed mr gribble  what am i to do  mrs gribble put her handkerchief to her eyes  and dont start weakening your constitution by crying shouted the incensed husband  what are you mumbling  i sasasaid lets hopeyoull go first sobbed his wife  then it will be all right  mr gribble opened his mouth and then realizing the inadequacy of the english language for moments of stress closed it again  he broke his silence at last in favour of uncle george  mind you he said concluding a peroration which his wife listened to with her fingers in her earsmind you i reckon ive been absolutely done by you and your precious uncle george  ive given up a good situation and now any time you fancy to go off the hooks im to be turned into the street  ill try and live for your sake henry said his wife  think of my worry every time you are ill pursued the indignant mr gribble  mrs gribble sighed and her husband after a few further remarks concerning uncle george his past and his future announced his intention of going to the lawyers and seeing whether anything could be done  he came back in a state of voiceless gloom and spent the rest of a beautiful day indoors smoking a pipe which had lost much of its flavour and regarding with a critical and anxious eye the small weedy figure of his wife as she went about her work  the second months payment went into his pocket as a matter of course but on this occasion mrs gribble made no requests for new clothes or change of residence  a little nervous cough was her sole comment  got a cold  inquired her husband starting  i dont think so replied his wife and surprised and touched at this unusual display of interest coughed again  is it your throat or your chest  he inquired gruffly  mrs gribble coughed again to see  after five coughs she said she thought it was her chest  youd better not go out o doors today then said mr gribble dont stand about in draughts and ill fetch you in a bottle of cough mixture when i go out  what about a laydown on the sofa  his wife thanked him and reaching the sofa watched with halfclosed eyes as he cleared the breakfasttable  it was the first time he had done such a thing in his life and a little honest pride in the possession of such a cough would not be denied  dim possibilities of its vast usefulness suddenly occurred to her  she took the cough mixture for a week by which time other symptoms extremely disquieting to an easeloving man had manifested themselves going upstairs deprived her of breath carrying a loaded teatray produced a long and alarming stitch in the side  the last time she ever filled the coalscuttle she was discovered sitting beside it on the floor in a state of collapse  youd better go and see the doctor said mr gribble  mrs gribble went  years before the doctor had told her that she ought to take life easier and she was now able to tell him she was prepared to take his advice  and you see i must take care of myself now for the sake of my husband she said after she had explained matters  i understand said the doctor  if anything happened to me began the patient  nothing shall happen said the other  stay in bed tomorrow morning and ill come round and overhaul you  mrs gribble hesitated  you might examine me and think i was all right she objected and at the same time you wouldnt know how i feel  i know just how you feel was the reply  goodbye  he came round the following morning and following the dejected mr gribble upstairs made a long and thorough investigation of his patient  say ninetynine he said adjusting his stethoscope  mrs gribble ticked off ninetynines until her husbands ears ached with them  the doctor finished at last and fastening his bag stood with his beard in his hand pondering  he looked from the little whitefaced woman on the bed to the bulky figure of mr gribble  you had better lie up for a week he said decidedly  the rest will do you good  nothing serious i spose  said mr gribble as he led the way downstairs to the small parlour  she ought to be all right with care was the reply  care  repeated the other distastefully  whats the matter with her  shes not very strong said the doctor and hearts dont improve with age you know  under favourable conditions shes good for some years yet  the great thing is never to thwart her  let her have her own way in everything  own way in everything  repeated the dumbfounded mr gribble  the doctor nodded  never let her worry about anything he continued and above all never find fault with her  not said mr gribble thicklynot even for her own good  unless you want to run the risk of losing her  mr gribble shivered  let her have an easy time said the doctor taking up his hat pamper her a bit if you like it wont hurt her  above all dont let that heart of hers get excited  he shook hands with the petrified mr gribble and went off grinning wickedly  he had few favourites and mr gribble was not one of them  for two days the devoted husband did the housework and waited on the invalid  then he wearied and at his wifes suggestion a small girl was engaged as servant  she did most of the nursing as well and having a great love for the sensational took a grave view of her mistresss condition  it was a relief to mr gribble when his wife came downstairs again and he was cheered to see that she looked much better  his satisfaction was so marked that it brought on her cough again  its this house i think she said with a resigned smile  it never did agree with me  well youve lived in it a good many years said her husband controlling himself with difficulty  its rather dark and small said mrs gribble  not but what it is good enough for me  and i dare say it will last my time  nonsense  said her husband gruffly  you want to get out a bit more youve got nothing to do now we are wasting all this money on a servant why dont you go out for little walks  mrs gribble went after several promptings and the fruit of one of them was handed by the postman to mr gribble a few days afterwards halfchoking with wrath and astonishment he stood over his trembling wife with the first drapers bill he had ever received  one pound two shillings and threepence threefarthings he recited it must be a mistake  it must be for somebody else  mrs gribble with her hand to her heart tottered to the sofa and lay there with her eyes closed  i had to get some dress material she said in a quavering voice you want me to go out and im so shabby im ashamed to be seen  mr gribble made muffled noises in his throat then afraid to trust himself he went into the backyard and taking a seat on an upturned bucket sat with his head in his hands peering into the future  the dressmakers bill and a bill for a new hat came after the next monthly payment and a bill for shoes came a week later  hoping much from the wellknown curative effects of fine feathers he managed to treat the affair with dignified silence  the only time he allowed full play to his feelings mrs gribble took to her bed for two days and the doctor had a hearttoheart talk with him on the doorstep  it was a matter of great annoyance to him that his wife still continued to attribute her illhealth to the smallness and darkness of the house and the fact that there were only two of the houses in charlton grove left caused a marked depression of spirits  it was clear that she was fretting  the small servant went further and said that she was fading away  they moved at the september quarter and a slight but temporary improvement in mrs gribbles health took place  her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkled over new curtains and new linoleum  the tiled hearths and stained glass in the front door filled her with a deep and solemn thankfulness  the only thing that disturbed her was the fact that mr gribble to avoid wasting money over necessaries contrived to spend an unduly large portion on personal luxuries  we ought to have some new things for the kitchen she said one day  no money said mr gribble laconically  and a mat for the bathroom  mr gribble got up and went out  she had to go to him for everything  two hundred a year and not a penny she could call her own  she consulted her heart and that faithful organ responded with a bound that set her nerves quivering  if she could only screw her courage to the stickingpoint the question would be settled for once and all  white and trembling she sat at breakfast on the first of november waiting for the postman while the unconscious mr gribble went on with his meal  the doubleknocks down the road came nearer and nearer and mr gribble wiping his mouth sat upright with an air of alert and pleased interest  rapid steps came to the front door and a double bang followed  always punctual said mr gribble goodhumouredly  his wife made no reply but taking a bluecrossed envelope from the maid in her shaking fingers looked round for a knife  her gaze encountered mr gribbles outstretched hand  after you he said sharply  mrs gribble found the knife and hacking tremulously at the envelope peeped inside it and with her gaze fastened on the window fumbled for her pocket  she was so pale and shook so much that the words died away on her husbands lips  youyou had better let me take care of that he said at last  it isall right gasped his wife  she put her hand to her throat and hardly able to believe in her victory sat struggling for breath  before her grim and upright her husband sat a figure of helpless smouldering wrath  you might lose it he said at last  i shant lose it said his wife  to avoid further argument she arose and went slowly upstairs  through the doorway mr gribble saw her helping herself up by the banisters her left hand still at her throat  then he heard her moving slowly about in the bedroom overhead  he took out his pipe and filled it mechanically and was just holding a match to the tobacco when he paused and gazed with a puzzled air at the ceiling  blamed if it dont sound like somebody dancing  he growled
