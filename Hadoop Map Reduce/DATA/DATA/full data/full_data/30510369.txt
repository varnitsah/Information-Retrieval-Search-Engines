30510369	the lazy tour of two idle apprentices     chapter i    in the autumn month of september eighteen hundred and fiftyseven wherein these presents bear date two idle apprentices exhausted by the long hot summer and the long hot work it had brought with it ran away from their employer  they were bound to a highly meritorious lady named literature of fair credit and repute though it must be acknowledged not quite so highly esteemed in the city as she might be  this is the more remarkable as there is nothing against the respectable lady in that quarter but quite the contrary her family having rendered eminent service to many famous citizens of london  it may be sufficient to name sir william walworth lord mayor under king richard ii at the time of wat tylers insurrection and sir richard whittington  which latter distinguished man and magistrate was doubtless indebted to the ladys family for the gift of his celebrated cat  there is also strong reason to suppose that they rang the highgate bells for him with their own hands  the misguided young men who thus shirked their duty to the mistress from whom they had received many favours were actuated by the low idea of making a perfectly idle trip in any direction  they had no intention of going anywhere in particular they wanted to see nothing they wanted to know nothing they wanted to learn nothing they wanted to do nothing  they wanted only to be idle  they took to themselves after hogarth the names of mr thomas idle and mr francis goodchild but there was not a moral pin to choose between them and they were both idle in the last degree  between francis and thomas however there was this difference of character  goodchild was laboriously idle and would take upon himself any amount of pains and labour to assure himself that he was idle in short had no better idea of idleness than that it was useless industry  thomas idle on the other hand was an idler of the unmixed irish or neapolitan type a passive idler a bornand bred idler a consistent idler who practised what he would have preached if he had not been too idle to preach a one entire and perfect chrysolite of idleness  the two idle apprentices found themselves within a few hours of their escape walking down into the north of england that is to say thomas was lying in a meadow looking at the railway trains as they passed over a distant viaductwhich was his idea of walking down into the north while francis was walking a mile due south against timewhich was his idea of walking down into the north in the meantime the day waned and the milestones remained unconquered  tom said goodchild the sun is getting low  up and let us go forward  nay quoth thomas idle i have not done with annie laurie yet and he proceeded with that idle but popular ballad to the effect that for the bonnie young person of that name he would lay him doon and deeequivalent in prose to lay him down and die  what an ass that fellow was cried goodchild with the bitter emphasis of contempt  which fellow asked thomas idle  the fellow in your song  lay him doon and dee  finely hed show off before the girl by doing that  a sniveller  why couldnt he get up and punch somebodys head  whose asked thomas idle  anybodys  everybodys would be better than nobodys  if i fell into that state of mind about a girl do you think id lay me doon and dee  no sir proceeded goodchild with a disparaging assumption of the scottish accent id get me oop and peetch into somebody  wouldnt you  i wouldnt have anything to do with her yawned thomas idle why should i take the trouble  its no trouble tom to fall in love said goodchild shaking his head  its trouble enough to fall out of it once youre in it retorted tom  so i keep out of it altogether  it would be better for you if you did the same  mr goodchild who is always in love with somebody and not unfrequently with several objects at once made no reply  he heaved a sigh of the kind which is termed by the lower orders a bellowser and then heaving mr idle on his feet who was not half so heavy as the sigh urged him northward  these two had sent their personal baggage on by train  only retaining each a knapsack  idle now applied himself to constantly regretting the train to tracking it through the intricacies of bradshaws guide and finding out where it is nowand where now and where nowand to asking what was the use of walking when you could ride at such a pace as that  was it to see the country  if that was the object look at it out of the carriage windows  there was a great deal more of it to be seen there than here  besides who wanted to see the country  nobody  and again whoever did walk  nobody  fellows set off to walk but they never did it they came back and said they did but they didnt  then why should he walk  he wouldnt walk  he swore it by this milestone  it was the fifth from london so far had they penetrated into the north  submitting to the powerful chain of argument goodchild proposed a return to the metropolis and a falling back upon euston square terminus  thomas assented with alacrity and so they walked down into the north by the next mornings express and carried their knapsacks in the luggagevan  it was like all other expresses as every express is and must be it bore through the harvest country a smell like a large washing day and a sharp issue of steam as from a huge brazen teaurn  the greatest power in nature and art combined it yet glided over dangerous heights in the sight of people looking up from fields and roads as smoothly and unreally as a light miniature plaything now the engine shrieked in hysterics of such intensity that it seemed desirable that the men who had her in charge should hold her feet slap her hands and bring her to now burrowed into tunnels with a stubborn and undemonstrative energy so confusing that the train seemed to be flying back into leagues of darkness  here were station after station swallowed up by the express without stopping here stations where it fired itself in like a volley of cannonballs swooped away four countrypeople with nosegays and three men of business with portmanteaus and fired itself off again bang bang bang  at long intervals were uncomfortable refreshmentrooms made more uncomfortable by the scorn of beauty towards beast the public but to whom she never relented as beauty did in the story towards the other beast and where sensitive stomachs were fed with a contemptuous sharpness occasioning indigestion  here again were stations with nothing going but a bell and wonderful wooden razors set aloft on great posts shaving the air  in these fields the horses sheep and cattle were well used to the thundering meteor and didnt mind in those they were all set scampering together and a herd of pigs scoured after them  the pastoral country darkened became coaly became smoky became infernal got better got worse improved again grew rugged turned romantic was a wood a stream a chain of hills a gorge a moor a cathedral town a fortified place a waste  now miserable black dwellings a black canal and sick black towers of chimneys now a trim garden where the flowers were bright and fair now a wilderness of hideous altars all a blaze now the water meadows with their fairy rings now the mangy patch of unlet building ground outside the stagnant town with the larger ring where the circus was last week  the temperature changed the dialect changed the people changed faces got sharper manner got shorter eyes got shrewder and harder yet all so quickly that the spruce guard in the london uniform and silver lace had not yet rumpled his shirtcollar delivered half the dispatches in his shiny little pouch or read his newspaper  carlisle  idle and goodchild had got to carlisle  it looked congenially and delightfully idle  something in the way of public amusement had happened last month and something else was going to happen before christmas and in the meantime there was a lecture on india for those who liked itwhich idle and goodchild did not likewise by those who liked them there were impressions to be bought of all the vapid prints going and gone and of nearly all the vapid books  for those who wanted to put anything in missionary boxes here were the boxes  for those who wanted the reverend mr podgers artists proofs thirty shillings here was mr podgers to any amount  not less gracious and abundant mr codgers also of the vineyard but opposed to mr podgers brotherly tooth and nail  here were guidebooks to the neighbouring antiquities and eke the lake country in several dry and husky sorts here many physically and morally impossible heads of both sexes for young ladies to copy in the exercise of the art of drawing here further a large impression of mr spurgeon solid as to the flesh not to say even something gross  the working young men of carlisle were drawn up with their hands in their pockets across the pavements four and six abreast and appeared much to the satisfaction of mr idle to have nothing else to do the working and growing young women of carlisle from the age of twelve upwards promenaded the streets in the cool of the evening and rallied the said young men  sometimes the young men rallied the young women as in the case of a group gathered round an accordionplayer from among whom a young man advanced behind a young woman for whom he appeared to have a tenderness and hinted to her that he was there and playful by giving her he wore clogs a kick  on market morning carlisle woke up amazingly and became to the two idle apprentices disagreeably and reproachfully busy  there were its cattle market its sheep market and its pig market down by the river with rawboned and shockheaded rob roys hiding their lowland dresses beneath heavy plaids prowling in and out among the animals and flavouring the air with fumes of whiskey  there was its corn market down the main street with hum of chaffering over open sacks  there was its general market in the street too with heather brooms on which the purple flower still flourished and heather baskets primitive and fresh to behold  with women trying on clogs and caps at open stalls and bible stalls adjoining with doctor mantles dispensary for the cure of all human maladies and no charge for advice and with doctor mantles laboratory of medical chemical and botanical scienceboth healing institutions established on one pair of trestles one board and one sunblind  with the renowned phrenologist from london begging to be favoured at sixpence each with the company of clients of both sexes to whom on examination of their heads he would make revelations enabling him or her to know themselves  through all these bargains and blessings the recruitingsergeant watchfully elbowed his way a thread of war in the peaceful skein  likewise on the walls were printed hints that the oxford blues might not be indisposed to hear of a few fine active young men and that whereas the standard of that distinguished corps is full six feet growing lads of five feet eleven need not absolutely despair of being accepted  scenting the morning air more pleasantly than the buried majesty of denmark did messrs idle and goodchild rode away from carlisle at eight oclock one forenoon bound for the village of hesket newmarket some fourteen miles distant  goodchild who had already begun to doubt whether he was idle  as his way always is when he has nothing to do had read of a certain black old cumberland hill or mountain called carrock or carrock fell and had arrived at the conclusion that it would be the culminating triumph of idleness to ascend the same  thomas idle dwelling on the pains inseparable from that achievement had expressed the strongest doubts of the expediency and even of the sanity of the enterprise but goodchild had carried his point and they rode away  up hill and down hill and twisting to the right and twisting to the left and with old skiddaw who has vaunted himself a great deal more than his merits deserve but that is rather the way of the lake country dodging the apprentices in a picturesque and pleasant manner  good weatherproof warm pleasant houses well whitelimed scantily dotting the road  clean children coming out to look carrying other clean children as big as themselves harvest still lying out and much rained upon here and there harvest still unreaped  wellcultivated gardens attached to the cottages with plenty of produce forced out of their hard soil lonely nooks and wild but people can be born and married and buried in such nooks and can live and love and be loved there as elsewhere thank god mr goodchilds remark  byandby the village  black coarsestoned roughwindowed houses some with outer staircases like swiss houses a sinuous and stony gutter winding up hill and round the corner by way of street  all the children running out directly  women pausing in washing to peep from doorways and very little windows  such were the observations of messrs idle and goodchild as their conveyance stopped at the village shoemakers  old carrock gloomed down upon it all in a very illtempered state and rain was beginning  the village shoemaker declined to have anything to do with carrock no visitors went up carrock  no visitors came there at all  aa the world ganged awa yon  the driver appealed to the innkeeper the innkeeper had two men working in the fields and one of them should be called in to go up carrock as guide  messrs idle and goodchild highly approving entered the innkeepers house to drink whiskey and eat oatcake  the innkeeper was not idle enoughwas not idle at all which was a great fault in himbut was a fine specimen of a northcountry man or any kind of man  he had a ruddy cheek a bright eye a well knit frame an immense hand a cheery outspeaking voice and a straight bright broad look  he had a drawingroom too upstairs which was worth a visit to the cumberland fells  this was mr francis goodchilds opinion in which mr thomas idle did not concur  the ceiling of this drawingroom was so crossed and recrossed by beams of unequal lengths radiating from a centre in a corner that it looked like a broken starfish  the room was comfortably and solidly furnished with good mahogany and horsehair  it had a snug fireside and a couple of wellcurtained windows looking out upon the wild country behind the house  what it most developed was an unexpected taste for little ornaments and nicknacks of which it contained a most surprising number  they were not very various consisting in great part of waxen babies with their limbs more or less mutilated appealing on one leg to the parental affections from under little cupping glasses but uncle tom was there in crockery receiving theological instructions from miss eva who grew out of his side like a wen in an exceedingly rough state of profile propagandism  engravings of mr hunts country boy before and after his pie were on the wall divided by a highlycoloured nautical piece the subject of which had all her colours and more flying and was making great way through a sea of a regular pattern like a ladys collar  a benevolent elderly gentleman of the last century with a powdered head kept guard in oil and varnish over a most perplexing piece of furniture on a table in appearance between a driving seat and an angular knife box but when opened a musical instrument of tinkling wires exactly like davids harp packed for travelling  everything became a nicknack in this curious room  the copper teakettle burnished up to the highest point of glory took his station on a stand of his own at the greatest possible distance from the fireplace and said  by your leave not a kettle but a bijou  the staffordshireware butterdish with the cover on got upon a little round occasional table in a window with a worked top and announced itself to the two chairs accidentally placed there as an aid to polite conversation a graceful trifle in china to be chatted over by callers as they airily trifled away the visiting moments of a butterfly existence in that rugged old village on the cumberland fells  the very footstool could not keep the floor but got upon a sofa and therefrom proclaimed itself in high relief of white and livercoloured wool a favourite spaniel coiled up for repose  though truly in spite of its bright glass eyes the spaniel was the least successful assumption in the collection being perfectly flat and dismally suggestive of a recent mistake in sitting down on the part of some corpulent member of the family  there were books too in this room books on the table books on the chimneypiece books in an open press in the corner  fielding was there and smollett was there and steele and addison were there in dispersed volumes and there were tales of those who go down to the sea in ships for windy nights and there was really a choice of good books for rainy days or fine  it was so very pleasant to see these things in such a lonesome byplaceso very agreeable to find these evidences of a taste however homely that went beyond the beautiful cleanliness and trimness of the houseso fanciful to imagine what a wonder a room must be to the little children born in the gloomy villagewhat grand impressions of it those of them who became wanderers over the earth would carry away and how at distant ends of the world some old voyagers would die cherishing the belief that the finest apartment known to men was once in the hesketnewmarket inn in rare old cumberlandit was such a charmingly lazy pursuit to entertain these rambling thoughts over the choice oatcake and the genial whiskey that mr idle and mr goodchild never asked themselves how it came to pass that the men in the fields were never heard of more how the stalwart landlord replaced them without explanation how his dogcart came to be waiting at the door and how everything was arranged without the least arrangement for climbing to old carrocks shoulders and standing on his head  without a word of inquiry therefore the two idle apprentices drifted out resignedly into a fine soft close drowsy penetrating rain got into the landlords light dogcart and rattled off through the village for the foot of carrock  the journey at the outset was not remarkable  the cumberland road went up and down like all other roads the cumberland curs burst out from backs of cottages and barked like other curs and the cumberland peasantry stared after the dogcart amazedly as long as it was in sight like the rest of their race  the approach to the foot of the mountain resembled the approaches to the feet of most other mountains all over the world  the cultivation gradually ceased the trees grew gradually rare the road became gradually rougher and the sides of the mountain looked gradually more and more lofty and more and more difficult to get up  the dogcart was left at a lonely farmhouse  the landlord borrowed a large umbrella and assuming in an instant the character of the most cheerful and adventurous of guides led the way to the ascent  mr goodchild looked eagerly at the top of the mountain and feeling apparently that he was now going to be very lazy indeed shone all over wonderfully to the eye under the influence of the contentment within and the moisture without  only in the bosom of mr thomas idle did despondency now hold her gloomy state  he kept it a secret but he would have given a very handsome sum when the ascent began to have been back again at the inn  the sides of carrock looked fearfully steep and the top of carrock was hidden in mist  the rain was falling faster and faster  the knees of mr idlealways weak on walking excursionsshivered and shook with fear and damp  the wet was already penetrating through the young mans outer coat to a brandnew shootingjacket for which he had reluctantly paid the large sum of two guineas on leaving town he had no stimulating refreshment about him but a small packet of clammy gingerbread nuts he had nobody to give him an arm nobody to push him gently behind nobody to pull him up tenderly in front nobody to speak to who really felt the difficulties of the ascent the dampness of the rain the denseness of the mist and the unutterable folly of climbing undriven up any steep place in the world when there is level ground within reach to walk on instead was it for this that thomas had left london  london where there are nice short walks in level public gardens with benches of repose set up at convenient distances for weary travellerslondon where rugged stone is humanely pounded into little lumps for the road and intelligently shaped into smooth slabs for the pavement no it was not for the laborious ascent of the crags of carrock that idle had left his native city and travelled to cumberland never did he feel more disastrously convinced that he had committed a very grave error in judgment than when he found himself standing in the rain at the bottom of a steep mountain and knew that the responsibility rested on his weak shoulders of actually getting to the top of it  the honest landlord went first the beaming goodchild followed the mournful idle brought up the rear  from time to time the two foremost members of the expedition changed places in the order of march but the rearguard never altered his position  up the mountain or down the mountain in the water or out of it over the rocks through the bogs skirting the heather mr thomas idle was always the last and was always the man who had to be looked after and waited for  at first the ascent was delusively easy the sides of the mountain sloped gradually and the material of which they were composed was a soft spongy turf very tender and pleasant to walk upon  after a hundred yards or so however the verdant scene and the easy slope disappeared and the rocks began  not noble massive rocks standing upright keeping a certain regularity in their positions and possessing now and then flat tops to sit upon but little irritating comfortless rocks littered about anyhow by nature treacherous disheartening rocks of all sorts of small shapes and small sizes bruisers of tender toes and trippers up of wavering feet  when these impediments were passed heather and slough followed  here the steepness of the ascent was slightly mitigated and here the exploring party of three turned round to look at the view below them  the scene of the moorland and the fields was like a feeble watercolour drawing half sponged out the mist was darkening the rain was thickening the trees were dotted about like spots of faint shadow the divisionlines which mapped out the fields were all getting blurred together and the lonely farmhouse where the dogcart had been left loomed spectral in the grey light like the last human dwelling at the end of the habitable world  was this a sight worth climbing to see  surely surely not  up againfor the top of carrock is not reached yet  the land lord just as goodtempered and obliging as he was at the bottom of the mountain  mr goodchild brighter in the eyes and rosier in the face than ever full of cheerful remarks and apt quotations and walking with a springiness of step wonderful to behold  mr idle farther and farther in the rear with the water squeaking in the toes of his boots with his twoguinea shootingjacket clinging damply to his aching sides with his overcoat so full of rain and standing out so pyramidically stiff in consequence from his shoulders downwards that he felt as if he was walking in a gigantic extinguisherthe despairing spirit within him representing but too aptly the candle that had just been put out up and up and up again till a ridge is reached and the outer edge of the mist on the summit of carrock is darkly and drizzingly near is this the top  no nothing like the top  it is an aggravating peculiarity of all mountains that although they have only one top when they are seen as they ought always to be seen from below they turn out to have a perfect eruption of false tops whenever the traveller is sufficiently illadvised to go out of his way for the purpose of ascending them  carrock is but a trumpery little mountain of fifteen hundred feet and it presumes to have false tops and even precipices as if it were mont blanc  no matter goodchild enjoys it and will go on and idle who is afraid of being left behind by himself must follow  on entering the edge of the mist the landlord stops and says he hopes that it will not get any thicker  it is twenty years since he last ascended carrock and it is barely possible if the mist increases that the party may be lost on the mountain  goodchild hears this dreadful intimation and is not in the least impressed by it  he marches for the top that is never to be found as if he was the wandering jew bound to go on for ever in defiance of everything  the landlord faithfully accompanies him  the two to the dim eye of idle far below look in the exaggerative mist like a pair of friendly giants mounting the steps of some invisible castle together  up and up and then down a little and then up and then along a strip of level ground and then up again  the wind a wind unknown in the happy valley blows keen and strong the rainmist gets impenetrable a dreary little cairn of stones appears  the landlord adds one to the heap first walking all round the cairn as if he were about to perform an incantation then dropping the stone on to the top of the heap with the gesture of a magician adding an ingredient to a cauldron in full bubble  goodchild sits down by the cairn as if it was his studytable at home idle drenched and panting stands up with his back to the wind ascertains distinctly that this is the top at last looks round with all the little curiosity that is left in him and gets in return a magnificent view ofnothing  the effect of this sublime spectacle on the minds of the exploring party is a little injured by the nature of the direct conclusion to which the sight of it pointsthe said conclusion being that the mountain mist has actually gathered round them as the landlord feared it would  it now becomes imperatively necessary to settle the exact situation of the farmhouse in the valley at which the dogcart has been left before the travellers attempt to descend while the landlord is endeavouring to make this discovery in his own way mr goodchild plunges his hand under his wet coat draws out a little red moroccocase opens it and displays to the view of his companions a neat pocketcompass  the north is found the point at which the farmhouse is situated is settled and the descent begins  after a little downward walking idle behind as usual sees his fellowtravellers turn aside sharplytries to follow themloses them in the mistis shouted after waited for recoveredand then finds that a halt has been ordered partly on his account partly for the purpose of again consulting the compass  the point in debate is settled as before between goodchild and the landlord and the expedition moves on not down the mountain but marching straight forward round the slope of it  the difficulty of following this new route is acutely felt by thomas idle  he finds the hardship of walking at all greatly increased by the fatigue of moving his feet straight forward along the side of a slope when their natural tendency at every step is to turn off at a right angle and go straight down the declivity  let the reader imagine himself to be walking along the roof of a barn instead of up or down it and he will have an exact idea of the pedestrian difficulty in which the travellers had now involved themselves  in ten minutes more idle was lost in the distance again was shouted for waited for recovered as before found goodchild repeating his observation of the compass and remonstrated warmly against the sideway route that his companions persisted in following  it appeared to the uninstructed mind of thomas that when three men want to get to the bottom of a mountain their business is to walk down it and he put this view of the case not only with emphasis but even with some irritability  he was answered from the scientific eminence of the compass on which his companions were mounted that there was a frightful chasm somewhere near the foot of carrock called the black arches into which the travellers were sure to march in the mist if they risked continuing the descent from the place where they had now halted  idle received this answer with the silent respect which was due to the commanders of the expedition and followed along the roof of the barn or rather the side of the mountain reflecting upon the assurance which he received on starting again that the object of the party was only to gain a certain point and this haven attained to continue the descent afterwards until the foot of carrock was reached though quite unexceptionable as an abstract form of expression the phrase a certain point has the disadvantage of sounding rather vaguely when it is pronounced on unknown ground under a canopy of mist much thicker than a london fog  nevertheless after the compass this phrase was all the clue the party had to hold by and idle clung to the extreme end of it as hopefully as he could  more sideway walking thicker and thicker mist all sorts of points reached except the certain point third loss of idle third shouts for him third recovery of him third consultation of compass  mr goodchild draws it tenderly from his pocket and prepares to adjust it on a stone  something falls on the turfit is the glass  something else drops immediately afterit is the needle  the compass is broken and the exploring party is lost  it is the practice of the english portion of the human race to receive all great disasters in dead silence  mr goodchild restored the useless compass to his pocket without saying a word mr idle looked at the landlord and the landlord looked at mr idle  there was nothing for it now but to go on blindfold and trust to the chapter of chances  accordingly the lost travellers moved forward still walking round the slope of the mountain still desperately resolved to avoid the black arches and to succeed in reaching the certain point  a quarter of an hour brought them to the brink of a ravine at the bottom of which there flowed a muddy little stream  here another halt was called and another consultation took place  the landlord still clinging pertinaciously to the idea of reaching the point voted for crossing the ravine and going on round the slope of the mountain  mr goodchild to the great relief of his fellowtraveller took another view of the case and backed mr idles proposal to descend carrock at once at any hazardthe rather as the running stream was a sure guide to follow from the mountain to the valley  accordingly the party descended to the rugged and stony banks of the stream and here again thomas lost ground sadly and fell far behind his travelling companions  not much more than six weeks had elapsed since he had sprained one of his ankles and he began to feel this same ankle getting rather weak when he found himself among the stones that were strewn about the running water  goodchild and the landlord were getting farther and farther ahead of him  he saw them cross the stream and disappear round a projection on its banks  he heard them shout the moment after as a signal that they had halted and were waiting for him  answering the shout he mended his pace crossed the stream where they had crossed it and was within one step of the opposite bank when his foot slipped on a wet stone his weak ankle gave a twist outwards a hot rending tearing pain ran through it at the same moment and down fell the idlest of the two idle apprentices crippled in an instant  the situation was now in plain terms one of absolute danger there lay mr idle writhing with pain there was the mist as thick as ever there was the landlord as completely lost as the strangers whom he was conducting and there was the compass broken in goodchilds pocket  to leave the wretched thomas on unknown ground was plainly impossible and to get him to walk with a badly sprained ankle seemed equally out of the question  however goodchild brought back by his cry for help bandaged the ankle with a pockethandkerchief and assisted by the landlord raised the crippled apprentice to his legs offered him a shoulder to lean on and exhorted him for the sake of the whole party to try if he could walk  thomas assisted by the shoulder on one side and a stick on the other did try with what pain and difficulty those only can imagine who have sprained an ankle and have had to tread on it afterwards  at a pace adapted to the feeble hobbling of a newlylamed man the lost party moved on perfectly ignorant whether they were on the right side of the mountain or the wrong and equally uncertain how long idle would be able to contend with the pain in his ankle before he gave in altogether and fell down again unable to stir another step  slowly and more slowly as the clog of crippled thomas weighed heavily and more heavily on the march of the expedition the lost travellers followed the windings of the stream till they came to a faintlymarked carttrack branching off nearly at right angles to the left  after a little consultation it was resolved to follow this dim vestige of a road in the hope that it might lead to some farm or cottage at which idle could be left in safety  it was now getting on towards the afternoon and it was fast becoming more than doubtful whether the party delayed in their progress as they now were might not be overtaken by the darkness before the right route was found and be condemned to pass the night on the mountain without bit or drop to comfort them in their wet clothes  the carttrack grew fainter and fainter until it was washed out altogether by another little stream dark turbulent and rapid the landlord suggested judging by the colour of the water that it must be flowing from one of the lead mines in the neighbourhood of carrock and the travellers accordingly kept by the stream for a little while in the hope of possibly wandering towards help in that way  after walking forward about two hundred yards they came upon a mine indeed but a mine exhausted and abandoned a dismal ruinous place with nothing but the wreck of its works and buildings left to speak for it  here there were a few sheep feeding  the landlord looked at them earnestly thought he recognised the marks on themthen thought he did notfinally gave up the sheep in despairand walked on just as ignorant of the whereabouts of the party as ever  the march in the dark literally as well as metaphorically in the dark had now been continued for threequarters of an hour from the time when the crippled apprentice had met with his accident  mr idle with all the will to conquer the pain in his ankle and to hobble on found the power rapidly failing him and felt that another ten minutes at most would find him at the end of his last physical resources  he had just made up his mind on this point and was about to communicate the dismal result of his reflections to his companions when the mist suddenly brightened and begun to lift straight ahead  in another minute the landlord who was in advance proclaimed that he saw a tree  before long other trees appearedthen a cottagethen a house beyond the cottage and a familiar line of road rising behind it  last of all carrock itself loomed darkly into view far away to the right hand  the party had not only got down the mountain without knowing how but had wandered away from it in the mist without knowing whyaway far down on the very moor by which they had approached the base of carrock that morning  the happy lifting of the mist and the still happier discovery that the travellers had groped their way though by a very roundabout direction to within a mile or so of the part of the valley in which the farmhouse was situated restored mr idles sinking spirits and reanimated his failing strength  while the landlord ran off to get the dogcart thomas was assisted by goodchild to the cottage which had been the first building seen when the darkness brightened and was propped up against the garden wall like an artists lay figure waiting to be forwarded until the dog cart should arrive from the farmhouse below  in due timeand a very long time it seemed to mr idlethe rattle of wheels was heard and the crippled apprentice was lifted into the seat  as the dogcart was driven back to the inn the landlord related an anecdote which he had just heard at the farmhouse of an unhappy man who had been lost like his two guests and himself on carrock who had passed the night there alone who had been found the next morning scared and starved and who never went out afterwards except on his way to the grave  mr idle heard this sad story and derived at least one useful impression from it  bad as the pain in his ankle was he contrived to bear it patiently for he felt grateful that a worse accident had not befallen him in the wilds of carrock    chapter ii    the dogcart with mr thomas idle and his ankle on the hanging seat behind mr francis goodchild and the innkeeper in front and the rain in spouts and splashes everywhere made the best of its way back to the little inn the broken moor country looking like miles upon miles of preadamite sop or the ruins of some enormous jorum of antediluvian toastandwater  the trees dripped the eaves of the scattered cottages dripped the barren stone walls dividing the land dripped the yelping dogs dripped carts and waggons under illroofed penthouses dripped melancholy cocks and hens perching on their shafts or seeking shelter underneath them dripped mr goodchild dripped thomas idle dripped the innkeeper dripped the mare dripped the vast curtains of mist and cloud passed before the shadowy forms of the hills streamed water as they were drawn across the landscape  down such steep pitches that the mare seemed to be trotting on her head and up such steep pitches that she seemed to have a supplementary leg in her tail the dogcart jolted and tilted back to the village  it was too wet for the women to look out it was too wet even for the children to look out all the doors and windows were closed and the only sign of life or motion was in the rainpunctured puddles  whiskey and oil to thomas idles ankle and whiskey without oil to francis goodchilds stomach produced an agreeable change in the systems of both soothing mr idles pain which was sharp before and sweetening mr goodchilds temper which was sweet before portmanteaus being then opened and clothes changed mr goodchild through having no change of outer garments but broadcloth and velvet suddenly became a magnificent portent in the innkeepers house a shining frontispiece to the fashions for the month and a frightful anomaly in the cumberland village  greatly ashamed of his splendid appearance the conscious goodchild quenched it as much as possible in the shadow of thomas idles ankle and in a corner of the little covered carriage that started with them for wigtona most desirable carriage for any country except for its having a flat roof and no sides which caused the plumps of rain accumulating on the roof to play vigorous games of bagatelle into the interior all the way and to score immensely it was comfortable to see how the people coming back in open carts from wigton market made no more of the rain than if it were sunshine how the wigton policeman taking a country walk of halfa dozen miles apparently for pleasure in resplendent uniform accepted saturation as his normal state how clerks and schoolmasters in black loitered along the road without umbrellas getting varnished at every step how the cumberland girls coming out to look after the cumberland cows shook the rain from their eyelashes and laughed it away and how the rain continued to fall upon all as it only does fall in hill countries  wigton market was over and its bare booths were smoking with rain all down the street  mr thomas idle melodramatically carried to the inns first floor and laid upon three chairs he should have had the sofa if there had been one mr goodchild went to the window to take an observation of wigton and report what he saw to his disabled companion  brother francis brother francis cried thomas idle what do you see from the turret  i see said brother francis what i hope and believe to be one of the most dismal places ever seen by eyes  i see the houses with their roofs of dull black their stained fronts and their dark rimmed windows looking as if they were all in mourning  as every little puff of wind comes down the street i see a perfect train of rain let off along the wooden stalls in the marketplace and exploded against me  i see a very big gas lamp in the centre which i know by a secret instinct will not be lighted tonight  i see a pump with a trivet underneath its spout whereon to stand the vessels that are brought to be filled with water  i see a man come to pump and he pumps very hard but no water follows and he strolls empty away  brother francis brother francis cried thomas idle what more do you see from the turret besides the man and the pump and the trivet and the houses all in mourning and the rain  i see said brother francis one two three four five linen drapers shops in front of me  i see a linendrapers shop next door to the rightand there are five more linendrapers shops down the corner to the left  eleven homicidal linendrapers shops within a short stones throw each with its hands at the throats of all the rest  over the small firstfloor of one of these linen drapers shops appears the wonderful inscription bank  brother francis brother francis cried thomas idle what more do you see from the turret besides the eleven homicidal linen drapers shops and the wonderful inscription bankon the small firstfloor and the man and the pump and the trivet and the houses all in mourning and the rain  i see said brother francis the depository for christian knowledge and through the dark vapour i think i again make out mr spurgeon looming heavily  her majesty the queen god bless her printed in colours i am sure i see  i see the illustrated london news of several years ago and i see a sweetmeat shopwhich the proprietor calls a salt warehousewith one small female child in a cotton bonnet looking in on tiptoe oblivious of rain  and i see a watchmakers with only three great pale watches of a dull metal hanging in his window each in a separate pane  brother francis brother francis cried thomas idle what more do you see of wigton besides these objects and the man and the pump and the trivet and the houses all in mourning and the rain  i see nothing more said brother francis and there is nothing more to see except the curlpaper bill of the theatre which was opened and shut last week the managers family played all the parts and the short square chinky omnibus that goes to the railway and leads too rattling a life over the stones to hold together long  o yes  now i see two men with their hands in their pockets and their backs towards me  brother francis brother francis cried thomas idle what do you make out from the turret of the expression of the two men with their hands in their pockets and their backs towards you  they are mysterious men said brother francis with inscrutable backs  they keep their backs towards me with persistency  if one turns an inch in any direction the other turns an inch in the same direction and no more  they turn very stiffly on a very little pivot in the middle of the marketplace  their appearance is partly of a mining partly of a ploughing partly of a stable character  they are looking at nothingvery hard  their backs are slouched and their legs are curved with much standing about their pockets are loose and dogseared on account of their hands being always in them  they stand to be rained upon without any movement of impatience or dissatisfaction and they keep so close together that an elbow of each jostles an elbow of the other but they never speak  they spit at times but speak not  i see it growing darker and darker and still i see them sole visible population of the place standing to be rained upon with their backs towards me and looking at nothing very hard  brother francis brother francis cried thomas idle before you draw down the blind of the turret and come in to have your head scorched by the hot gas see if you can and impart to me something of the expression of those two amazing men  the murky shadows said francis goodchild are gathering fast and the wings of evening and the wings of coal are folding over wigton  still they look at nothing very hard with their backs towards me  ah  now they turn and i see  brother francis brother francis cried thomas idle tell me quickly what you see of the two men of wigton  i see said francis goodchild that they have no expression at all  and now the town goes to sleep undazzled by the large unlighted lamp in the marketplace and let no man wake it  at the close of the next days journey mr thomas idles ankle became much swollen and inflamed  there are reasons which will presently explain themselves for not publicly indicating the exact direction in which that journey lay or the place in which it ended  it was a long days shaking of thomas idle over the rough roads and a long days getting out and going on before the horses and fagging up hills and scouring down hills on the part of mr goodchild who in the fatigues of such labours congratulated himself on attaining a high point of idleness  it was at a little town still in cumberland that they halted for the nighta very little town with the purple and brown moor close upon its one street a curious little ancient marketcross set up in the midst of it and the town itself looking much as if it were a collection of great stones piled on end by the druids long ago which a few recluse people had since hollowed out for habitations  is there a doctor here asked mr goodchild on his knee of the motherly landlady of the little inn  stopping in his examination of mr idles ankle with the aid of a candle  ey my word said the landlady glancing doubtfully at the ankle for herself theres doctor speddie  is he a good doctor  ey said the landlady i ca him so  a cooms efther nae doctor that i ken  mair nor which as just the doctor heer  do you think he is at home  her reply was gang awa jock and bring him  jock a whiteheaded boy who under pretence of stirring up some bay salt in a basin of water for the laving of this unfortunate ankle had greatly enjoyed himself for the last ten minutes in splashing the carpet set off promptly  a very few minutes had elapsed when he showed the doctor in by tumbling against the door before him and bursting it open with his head  gently jock gently said the doctor as he advanced with a quiet step  gentlemen a good evening  i am sorry that my presence is required here  a slight accident i hope  a slip and a fall yes yes yes  carrock indeed  hah  does that pain you sir no doubt it does  it is the great connecting ligament here you see that has been badly strained  time and rest sir  they are often the recipe in greater cases with a slight sigh and often the recipe in small  i can send a lotion to relieve you but we must leave the cure to time and rest  this he said holding idles foot on his knee between his two hands as he sat over against him  he had touched it tenderly and skilfully in explanation of what he said and when his careful examination was completed softly returned it to its former horizontal position on a chair  he spoke with a little irresolution whenever he began but afterwards fluently  he was a tall thin largeboned old gentleman with an appearance at first sight of being hard featured but at a second glance the mild expression of his face and some particular touches of sweetness and patience about his mouth corrected this impression and assigned his long professional rides by day and night in the bleak hillweather as the true cause of that appearance  he stooped very little though past seventy and very grey  his dress was more like that of a clergyman than a country doctor being a plain black suit and a plain white neckkerchief tied behind like a band  his black was the worse for wear and there were darns in his coat and his linen was a little frayed at the hems and edges  he might have been poorit was likely enough in that outoftheway spotor he might have been a little selfforgetful and eccentric  any one could have seen directly that he had neither wife nor child at home  he had a scholarly air with him and that kind of considerate humanity towards others which claimed a gentle consideration for himself mr goodchild made this study of him while he was examining the limb and as he laid it down  mr goodchild wishes to add that he considers it a very good likeness  it came out in the course of a little conversation that doctor speddie was acquainted with some friends of thomas idles and had when a young man passed some years in thomas idles birthplace on the other side of england  certain idle labours the fruit of mr goodchilds apprenticeship also happened to be well known to him the lazy travellers were thus placed on a more intimate footing with the doctor than the casual circumstances of the meeting would of themselves have established and when doctor speddie rose to go home remarking that he would send his assistant with the lotion francis goodchild said that was unnecessary for by the doctors leave he would accompany him and bring it back  having done nothing to fatigue himself for a full quarter of an hour francis began to fear that he was not in a state of idleness  doctor speddie politely assented to the proposition of francis goodchild as it would give him the pleasure of enjoying a few more minutes of mr goodchilds society than he could otherwise have hoped for and they went out together into the village street  the rain had nearly ceased the clouds had broken before a cool wind from the northeast and stars were shining from the peaceful heights beyond them  doctor speddies house was the last house in the place  beyond it lay the moor all dark and lonesome  the wind moaned in a low dull shivering manner round the little garden like a houseless creature that knew the winter was coming  it was exceedingly wild and solitary  roses said the doctor when goodchild touched some wet leaves overhanging the stone porch but they get cut to pieces  the doctor opened the door with a key he carried and led the way into a low but pretty ample hall with rooms on either side  the door of one of these stood open and the doctor entered it with a word of welcome to his guest  it too was a low room half surgery and half parlour with shelves of books and bottles against the walls which were of a very dark hue  there was a fire in the grate the night being damp and chill  leaning against the chimneypiece looking down into it stood the doctors assistant  a man of a most remarkable appearance  much older than mr goodchild had expected for he was at least twoandfifty but that was nothing  what was startling in him was his remarkable paleness  his large black eyes his sunken cheeks his long and heavy irongrey hair his wasted hands and even the attenuation of his figure were at first forgotten in his extraordinary pallor there was no vestige of colour in the man  when he turned his face francis goodchild started as if a stone figure had looked round at him  mr lorn said the doctor  mr goodchild  the assistant in a distraught wayas if he had forgotten somethingas if he had forgotten everything even to his own name and himselfacknowledged the visitors presence and stepped further back into the shadow of the wall behind him  but he was so pale that his face stood out in relief again the dark wall and really could not be hidden so  mr goodchilds friend has met with accident lorn said doctor speddie  we want the lotion for a bad sprain  a pause  my dear fellow you are more than usually absent tonight  the lotion for a bad sprain  ah yes  directly  he was evidently relieved to turn away and to take his white face and his wild eyes to a table in a recess among the bottles  but though he stood there compounding the lotion with his back towards them goodchild could not for many moments withdraw his gaze from the man  when he at length did so he found the doctor observing him with some trouble in his face  he is absent explained the doctor in a low voice  always absent  very absent  is he ill  no not ill  unhappy  i have my suspicions that he was assented the doctor once  francis goodchild could not but observe that the doctor accompanied these words with a benignant and protecting glance at their subject in which there was much of the expression with which an attached father might have looked at a heavily afflicted son  yet that they were not father and son must have been plain to most eyes  the assistant on the other hand turning presently to ask the doctor some question looked at him with a wan smile as if he were his whole reliance and sustainment in life  it was in vain for the doctor in his easychair to try to lead the mind of mr goodchild in the opposite easychair away from what was before him  let mr goodchild do what he would to follow the doctor his eyes and thoughts reverted to the assistant  the doctor soon perceived it and after falling silent and musing in a little perplexity said  lorn  my dear doctor  would you go to the inn and apply that lotion  you will show the best way of applying it far better than mr goodchild can  with pleasure  the assistant took his hat and passed like a shadow to the door  lorn said the doctor calling after him  he returned  mr goodchild will keep me company till you come home  dont hurry  excuse my calling you back  it is not said the assistant with his former smile the first time you have called me back dear doctor  with those words he went away  mr goodchild said doctor speddie in a low voice and with his former troubled expression of face i have seen that your attention has been concentrated on my friend  he fascinates me  i must apologise to you but he has quite bewildered and mastered me  i find that a lonely existence and a long secret said the doctor drawing his chair a little nearer to mr goodchilds become in the course of time very heavy  i will tell you something  you may make what use you will of it under fictitious names  i know i may trust you  i am the more inclined to confidence tonight through having been unexpectedly led back by the current of our conversation at the inn to scenes in my early life  will you please to draw a little nearer  mr goodchild drew a little nearer and the doctor went on thus speaking for the most part in so cautious a voice that the wind though it was far from high occasionally got the better of him  when this present nineteenth century was younger by a good many years than it is now a certain friend of mine named arthur holliday happened to arrive in the town of doncaster exactly in the middle of a raceweek or in other words in the middle of the month of september  he was one of those reckless rattlepated openhearted and openmouthed young gentlemen who possess the gift of familiarity in its highest perfection and who scramble carelessly along the journey of life making friends as the phrase is wherever they go  his father was a rich manufacturer and had bought landed property enough in one of the midland counties to make all the born squires in his neighbourhood thoroughly envious of him  arthur was his only son possessor in prospect of the great estate and the great business after his fathers death well supplied with money and not too rigidly looked after during his fathers lifetime  report or scandal whichever you please said that the old gentleman had been rather wild in his youthful days and that unlike most parents he was not disposed to be violently indignant when he found that his son took after him  this may be true or not  i myself only knew the elder mr holliday when he was getting on in years and then he was as quiet and as respectable a gentleman as ever i met with  well one september as i told you young arthur comes to doncaster having decided all of a sudden in his harebrained way that he would go to the races  he did not reach the town till towards the close of the evening and he went at once to see about his dinner and bed at the principal hotel  dinner they were ready enough to give him but as for a bed they laughed when he mentioned it  in the raceweek at doncaster it is no uncommon thing for visitors who have not bespoken apartments to pass the night in their carriages at the inn doors  as for the lower sort of strangers i myself have often seen them at that full time sleeping out on the doorsteps for want of a covered place to creep under  rich as he was arthurs chance of getting a nights lodging seeing that he had not written beforehand to secure one was more than doubtful  he tried the second hotel and the third hotel and two of the inferior inns after that and was met everywhere by the same form of answer  no accommodation for the night of any sort was left  all the bright golden sovereigns in his pocket would not buy him a bed at doncaster in the raceweek  to a young fellow of arthurs temperament the novelty of being turned away into the street like a penniless vagabond at every house where he asked for a lodging presented itself in the light of a new and highly amusing piece of experience  he went on with his carpetbag in his hand applying for a bed at every place of entertainment for travellers that he could find in doncaster until he wandered into the outskirts of the town  by this time the last glimmer of twilight had faded out the moon was rising dimly in a mist the wind was getting cold the clouds were gathering heavily and there was every prospect that it was soon going to rain  the look of the night had rather a lowering effect on young hollidays good spirits  he began to contemplate the houseless situation in which he was placed from the serious rather than the humorous point of view and he looked about him for another publichouse to inquire at with something very like downright anxiety in his mind on the subject of a lodging for the night  the suburban part of the town towards which he had now strayed was hardly lighted at all and he could see nothing of the houses as he passed them except that they got progressively smaller and dirtier the farther he went  down the winding road before him shone the dull gleam of an oil lamp the one faint lonely light that struggled ineffectually with the foggy darkness all round him he resolved to go on as far as this lamp and then if it showed him nothing in the shape of an inn to return to the central part of the town and to try if he could not at least secure a chair to sit down on through the night at one of the principal hotels  as he got near the lamp he heard voices and walking close under it found that it lighted the entrance to a narrow court on the wall of which was painted a long hand in faded fleshcolour pointing with a lean forefinger to this inscription   the two robins   arthur turned into the court without hesitation to see what the two robins could do for him  four or five men were standing together round the door of the house which was at the bottom of the court facing the entrance from the street  the men were all listening to one other man better dressed than the rest who was telling his audience something in a low voice in which they were apparently very much interested  on entering the passage arthur was passed by a stranger with a knapsack in his hand who was evidently leaving the house  no said the traveller with the knapsack turning round and addressing himself cheerfully to a fat slylooking baldheaded man with a dirty white apron on who had followed him down the passage  no mr landlord i am not easily scared by trifles but i dont mind confessing that i cant quite stand that  it occurred to young holliday the moment he heard these words that the stranger had been asked an exorbitant price for a bed at the two robins and that he was unable or unwilling to pay it  the moment his back was turned arthur comfortably conscious of his own wellfilled pockets addressed himself in a great hurry for fear any other benighted traveller should slip in and forestall him to the slylooking landlord with the dirty apron and the bald head  if you have got a bed to let he said and if that gentleman who has just gone out wont pay your price for it i will  the sly landlord looked hard at arthur  will you sir he asked in a meditative doubtful way  name your price said young holliday thinking that the landlords hesitation sprang from some boorish distrust of him name your price and ill give you the money at once if you like  are you game for five shillings inquired the landlord rubbing his stubbly double chin and looking up thoughtfully at the ceiling above him  arthur nearly laughed in the mans face but thinking it prudent to control himself offered the five shillings as seriously as he could  the sly landlord held out his hand then suddenly drew it back again  youre acting all fair and aboveboard by me he said  and before i take your money ill do the same by you  look here this is how it stands  you can have a bed all to yourself for five shillings but you cant have more than a halfshare of the room it stands in  do you see what i mean young gentleman  of course i do returned arthur a little irritably  you mean that it is a doublebedded room and that one of the beds is occupied  the landlord nodded his head and rubbed his double chin harder than ever  arthur hesitated and mechanically moved back a step or two towards the door  the idea of sleeping in the same room with a total stranger did not present an attractive prospect to him  he felt more than half inclined to drop his five shillings into his pocket and to go out into the street once more  is it yes or no asked the landlord  settle it as quick as you can because theres lots of people wanting a bed at doncaster to night besides you  arthur looked towards the court and heard the rain falling heavily in the street outside  he thought he would ask a question or two before he rashly decided on leaving the shelter of the two robins  what sort of a man is it who has got the other bed he inquired is he a gentleman  i mean is he a quiet wellbehaved person  the quietest man i ever came across said the landlord rubbing his fat hands stealthily one over the other  as sober as a judge and as regular as clockwork in his habits  it hasnt struck nine not ten minutes ago and hes in his bed already  i dont know whether that comes up to your notion of a quiet man  it goes a long way ahead of mine i can tell you  is he asleep do you think asked arthur  i know hes asleep returned the landlord  and whats more hes gone off so fast that ill warrant you dont wake him  this way sir said the landlord speaking over young hollidays shoulder as if he was addressing some new guest who was approaching the house  here you are said arthur determined to be beforehand with the stranger whoever he might be  ill take the bed  and he handed the five shillings to the landlord who nodded dropped the money carelessly into his waistcoatpocket and lighted the candle  come up and see the room said the host of the two robins leading the way to the staircase quite briskly considering how fat he was  they mounted to the secondfloor of the house  the landlord half opened a door fronting the landing then stopped and turned round to arthur  its a fair bargain mind on my side as well as on yours he said  you give me five shillings i give you in return a clean comfortable bed and i warrant beforehand that you wont be interfered with or annoyed in any way by the man who sleeps in the same room as you  saying those words he looked hard for a moment in young hollidays face and then led the way into the room  it was larger and cleaner than arthur had expected it would be the two beds stood parallel with each othera space of about six feet intervening between them  they were both of the same medium size and both had the same plain white curtains made to draw if necessary all round them  the occupied bed was the bed nearest the window  the curtains were all drawn round this except the half curtain at the bottom on the side of the bed farthest from the window  arthur saw the feet of the sleeping man raising the scanty clothes into a sharp little eminence as if he was lying flat on his back  he took the candle and advanced softly to draw the curtainstopped halfway and listened for a momentthen turned to the landlord  hes a very quiet sleeper said arthur  yes said the landlord very quiet  young holliday advanced with the candle and looked in at the man cautiously  how pale he is said arthur  yes returned the landlord pale enough isnt he  arthur looked closer at the man  the bedclothes were drawn up to his chin and they lay perfectly still over the region of his chest  surprised and vaguely startled as he noticed this arthur stooped down closer over the stranger looked at his ashy parted lips listened breathlessly for an instant looked again at the strangely still face and the motionless lips and chest and turned round suddenly on the landlord with his own cheeks as pale for the moment as the hollow cheeks of the man on the bed  come here he whispered under his breath  come here for gods sake  the mans not asleephe is dead  you have found that out sooner than i thought you would said the landlord composedly  yes hes dead sure enough  he died at five oclock today  how did he die  who is he asked arthur staggered for a moment by the audacious coolness of the answer  as to who is he rejoined the landlord i know no more about him than you do  there are his books and letters and things all sealed up in that brownpaper parcel for the coroners inquest to open tomorrow or next day  hes been here a week paying his way fairly enough and stopping indoors for the most part as if he was ailing  my girl brought him up his tea at five today and as he was pouring of it out he fell down in a faint or a fit or a compound of both for anything i know  we could not bring him to and i said he was dead  and the doctor couldnt bring him toand the doctor said he was dead  and there he is  and the coroners inquests coming as soon as it can  and thats as much as i know about it  arthur held the candle close to the mans lips  the flame still burnt straight up as steadily as before  there was a moment of silence and the rain pattered drearily through it against the panes of the window  if you havent got nothing more to say to me continued the landlord i suppose i may go  you dont expect your five shillings back do you  theres the bed i promised you clean and comfortable  theres the man i warranted not to disturb you quiet in this world for ever  if youre frightened to stop alone with him thats not my look out  ive kept my part of the bargain and i mean to keep the money  im not yorkshire myself young gentleman but ive lived long enough in these parts to have my wits sharpened and i shouldnt wonder if you found out the way to brighten up yours next time you come amongst us  with these words the landlord turned towards the door and laughed to himself softly in high satisfaction at his own sharpness  startled and shocked as he was arthur had by this time sufficiently recovered himself to feel indignant at the trick that had been played on him and at the insolent manner in which the landlord exulted in it  dont laugh he said sharply till you are quite sure you have got the laugh against me  you shant have the five shillings for nothing my man  ill keep the bed  will you said the landlord  then i wish you a goodnights rest  with that brief farewell he went out and shut the door after him  a good nights rest  the words had hardly been spoken the door had hardly been closed before arthur halfrepented the hasty words that had just escaped him  though not naturally oversensitive and not wanting in courage of the moral as well as the physical sort the presence of the dead man had an instantaneously chilling effect on his mind when he found himself alone in the roomalone and bound by his own rash words to stay there till the next morning  an older man would have thought nothing of those words and would have acted without reference to them as his calmer sense suggested  but arthur was too young to treat the ridicule even of his inferiors with contempttoo young not to fear the momentary humiliation of falsifying his own foolish boast more than he feared the trial of watching out the long night in the same chamber with the dead  it is but a few hours he thought to himself and i can get away the first thing in the morning  he was looking towards the occupied bed as that idea passed through his mind and the sharp angular eminence made in the clothes by the dead mans upturned feet again caught his eye  he advanced and drew the curtains purposely abstaining as he did so from looking at the face of the corpse lest he might unnerve himself at the outset by fastening some ghastly impression of it on his mind  he drew the curtain very gently and sighed involuntarily as he closed it  poor fellow he said almost as sadly as if he had known the man  ah poor fellow  he went next to the window  the night was black and he could see nothing from it  the rain still pattered heavily against the glass  he inferred from hearing it that the window was at the back of the house remembering that the front was sheltered from the weather by the court and the buildings over it  while he was still standing at the windowfor even the dreary rain was a relief because of the sound it made a relief also because it moved and had some faint suggestion in consequence of life and companionship in itwhile he was standing at the window and looking vacantly into the black darkness outside he heard a distant churchclock strike ten  only ten  how was he to pass the time till the house was astir the next morning  under any other circumstances he would have gone down to the publichouse parlour would have called for his grog and would have laughed and talked with the company assembled as familiarly as if he had known them all his life  but the very thought of whiling away the time in this manner was distasteful to him  the new situation in which he was placed seemed to have altered him to himself already  thus far his life had been the common trifling prosaic surfacelife of a prosperous young man with no troubles to conquer and no trials to face  he had lost no relation whom he loved no friend whom he treasured  till this night what share he had of the immortal inheritance that is divided amongst us all had laid dormant within him  till this night death and he had not once met even in thought  he took a few turns up and down the roomthen stopped  the noise made by his boots on the poorly carpeted floor jarred on his ear he hesitated a little and ended by taking the boots off and walking backwards and forwards noiselessly  all desire to sleep or to rest had left him  the bare thought of lying down on the unoccupied bed instantly drew the picture on his mind of a dreadful mimicry of the position of the dead man  who was he  what was the story of his past life  poor he must have been or he would not have stopped at such a place as the two robins innand weakened probably by long illness or he could hardly have died in the manner in which the landlord had described  poor ill lonely dead in a strange place dead with nobody but a stranger to pity him  a sad story  truly on the mere face of it a very sad story  while these thoughts were passing through his mind he had stopped insensibly at the window close to which stood the foot of the bed with the closed curtains  at first he looked at it absently then he became conscious that his eyes were fixed on it and then a perverse desire took possession of him to do the very thing which he had resolved not to do up to this timeto look at the dead man  he stretched out his hand towards the curtains but checked himself in the very act of undrawing them turned his back sharply on the bed and walked towards the chimneypiece to see what things were placed on it and to try if he could keep the dead man out of his mind in that way  there was a pewter inkstand on the chimneypiece with some mildewed remains of ink in the bottle  there were two coarse china ornaments of the commonest kind and there was a square of embossed card dirty and flyblown with a collection of wretched riddles printed on it in all sorts of zigzag directions and in variously coloured inks  he took the card and went away to read it to the table on which the candle was placed sitting down with his back resolutely turned to the curtained bed  he read the first riddle the second the third all in one corner of the cardthen turned it round impatiently to look at another before he could begin reading the riddles printed here the sound of the churchclock stopped him  eleven  he had got through an hour of the time in the room with the dead man  once more he looked at the card  it was not easy to make out the letters printed on it in consequence of the dimness of the light which the landlord had left hima common tallow candle furnished with a pair of heavy oldfashioned steel snuffers  up to this time his mind had been too much occupied to think of the light he had left the wick of the candle unsnuffed till it had risen higher than the flame and had burnt into an odd penthouse shape at the top from which morsels of the charred cotton fell off from time to time in little flakes  he took up the snuffers now and trimmed the wick  the light brightened directly and the room became less dismal  again he turned to the riddles reading them doggedly and resolutely now in one corner of the card now in another  all his efforts however could not fix his attention on them  he pursued his occupation mechanically deriving no sort of impression from what he was reading  it was as if a shadow from the curtained bed had got between his mind and the gaily printed lettersa shadow that nothing could dispel  at last he gave up the struggle and threw the card from him impatiently and took to walking softly up and down the room again  the dead man the dead man the hidden dead man on the bed  there was the one persistent idea still haunting him  hidden  was it only the body being there or was it the body being there concealed that was preying on his mind  he stopped at the window with that doubt in him once more listening to the pattering rain once more looking out into the black darkness  still the dead man  the darkness forced his mind back upon itself and set his memory at work reviving with a painfullyvivid distinctness the momentary impression it had received from the first sight of the corpse  before long the face seemed to be hovering out in the middle of the darkness confronting him through the window with the paleness whiter with the dreadful dull line of light between the imperfectlyclosed eyelids broader than he had seen itwith the parted lips slowly dropping farther and farther away from each otherwith the features growing larger and moving closer till they seemed to fill the window and to silence the rain and to shut out the night  the sound of a voice shouting belowstairs woke him suddenly from the dream of his own distempered fancy  he recognised it as the voice of the landlord  shut up at twelve ben he heard it say im off to bed  he wiped away the damp that had gathered on his forehead reasoned with himself for a little while and resolved to shake his mind free of the ghastly counterfeit which still clung to it by forcing himself to confront if it was only for a moment the solemn reality  without allowing himself an instant to hesitate he parted the curtains at the foot of the bed and looked through  there was a sad peaceful white face with the awful mystery of stillness on it laid back upon the pillow  no stir no change there  he only looked at it for a moment before he closed the curtains againbut that moment steadied him calmed him restored himmind and bodyto himself  he returned to his old occupation of walking up and down the room persevering in it this time till the clock struck again  twelve  as the sound of the clockbell died away it was succeeded by the confused noise downstairs of the drinkers in the taproom leaving the house  the next sound after an interval of silence was caused by the barring of the door and the closing of the shutters at the back of the inn  then the silence followed again and was disturbed no more  he was alone nowabsolutely utterly alone with the dead man till the next morning  the wick of the candle wanted trimming again  he took up the snuffersbut paused suddenly on the very point of using them and looked attentively at the candlethen back over his shoulder at the curtained bedthen again at the candle  it had been lighted for the first time to show him the way upstairs and three parts of it at least were already consumed  in another hour it would be burnt out  in another hourunless he called at once to the man who had shut up the inn for a fresh candlehe would be left in the dark  strongly as his mind had been affected since he had entered his room his unreasonable dread of encountering ridicule and of exposing his courage to suspicion had not altogether lost its influence over him even yet  he lingered irresolutely by the table waiting till he could prevail on himself to open the door and call from the landing to the man who had shut up the inn  in his present hesitating frame of mind it was a kind of relief to gain a few moments only by engaging in the trifling occupation of snuffing the candle  his hand trembled a little and the snuffers were heavy and awkward to use  when he closed them on the wick he closed them a hairs breadth too low  in an instant the candle was out and the room was plunged in pitch darkness  the one impression which the absence of light immediately produced on his mind was distrust of the curtained beddistrust which shaped itself into no distinct idea but which was powerful enough in its very vagueness to bind him down to his chair to make his heart beat fast and to set him listening intently  no sound stirred in the room but the familiar sound of the rain against the window louder and sharper now than he had heard it yet  still the vague distrust the inexpressible dread possessed him and kept him to his chair  he had put his carpetbag on the table when he first entered the room and he now took the key from his pocket reached out his hand softly opened the bag and groped in it for his travelling writingcase in which he knew that there was a small store of matches  when he had got one of the matches he waited before he struck it on the coarse wooden table and listened intently again without knowing why  still there was no sound in the room but the steady ceaseless rattling sound of the rain  he lighted the candle again without another moment of delay and on the instant of its burning up the first object in the room that his eyes sought for was the curtained bed  just before the light had been put out he had looked in that direction and had seen no change no disarrangement of any sort in the folds of the closelydrawn curtains  when he looked at the bed now he saw hanging over the side of it a long white hand  it lay perfectly motionless midway on the side of the bed where the curtain at the head and the curtain at the foot met  nothing more was visible  the clinging curtains hid everything but the long white hand  he stood looking at it unable to stir unable to call out feeling nothing knowing nothing every faculty he possessed gathered up and lost in the one seeing faculty  how long that first panic held him he never could tell afterwards  it might have been only for a moment it might have been for many minutes together  how he got to the bedwhether he ran to it headlong or whether he approached it slowlyhow he wrought himself up to unclose the curtains and look in he never has remembered and never will remember to his dying day  it is enough that he did go to the bed and that he did look inside the curtains  the man had moved  one of his arms was outside the clothes his face was turned a little on the pillow his eyelids were wide open changed as to position and as to one of the features the face was otherwise fearfully and wonderfully unaltered  the dead paleness and the dead quiet were on it still  one glance showed arthur thisone glance before he flew breathlessly to the door and alarmed the house  the man whom the landlord called ben was the first to appear on the stairs  in three words arthur told him what had happened and sent him for the nearest doctor  i who tell you this story was then staying with a medical friend of mine in practice at doncaster taking care of his patients for him during his absence in london and i for the time being was the nearest doctor  they had sent for me from the inn when the stranger was taken ill in the afternoon but i was not at home and medical assistance was sought for elsewhere  when the man from the two robins rang the nightbell i was just thinking of going to bed  naturally enough i did not believe a word of his story about a dead man who had come to life again  however i put on my hat armed myself with one or two bottles of restorative medicine and ran to the inn expecting to find nothing more remarkable when i got there than a patient in a fit  my surprise at finding that the man had spoken the literal truth was almost if not quite equalled by my astonishment at finding myself face to face with arthur holliday as soon as i entered the bedroom  it was no time then for giving or seeking explanations we just shook hands amazedly and then i ordered everybody but arthur out of the room and hurried to the man on the bed  the kitchen fire had not been long out  there was plenty of hot water in the boiler and plenty of flannel to be had  with these with my medicines and with such help as arthur could render under my direction i dragged the man literally out of the jaws of death  in less than an hour from the time when i had been called in he was alive and talking in the bed on which he had been laid out to wait for the coroners inquest  you will naturally ask me what had been the matter with him and i might treat you in reply to a long theory plentifully sprinkled with what the children call hard words  i prefer telling you that in this case cause and effect could not be satisfactorily joined together by any theory whatever  there are mysteries in life and the condition of it which human science has not fathomed yet and i candidly confess to you that in bringing that man back to existence i was morally speaking groping haphazard in the dark  i know from the testimony of the doctor who attended him in the afternoon that the vital machinery so far as its action is appreciable by our senses had in this case unquestionably stopped and i am equally certain seeing that i recovered him that the vital principle was not extinct  when i add that he had suffered from a long and complicated illness and that his whole nervous system was utterly deranged i have told you all i really know of the physical condition of my deadalive patient at the two robins inn  when he came to as the phrase goes he was a startling object to look at with his colourless face his sunken cheeks his wild black eyes and his long black hair  the first question he asked me about himself when he could speak made me suspect that i had been called in to a man in my own profession  i mentioned to him my surmise and he told me that i was right  he said he had come last from paris where he had been attached to a hospital  that he had lately returned to england on his way to edinburgh to continue his studies that he had been taken ill on the journey and that he had stopped to rest and recover himself at doncaster  he did not add a word about his name or who he was and of course i did not question him on the subject  all i inquired when he ceased speaking was what branch of the profession he intended to follow  any branch he said bitterly which will put bread into the mouth of a poor man  at this arthur who had been hitherto watching him in silent curiosity burst out impetuously in his usual goodhumoured way  my dear fellow everybody was my dear fellow with arthur now you have come to life again dont begin by being downhearted about your prospects  ill answer for it i can help you to some capital thing in the medical lineor if i cant i know my father can  the medical student looked at him steadily  thank you he said coldly  then added may i ask who your father is  hes well enough known all about this part of the country replied arthur  he is a great manufacturer and his name is holliday  my hand was on the mans wrist during this brief conversation  the instant the name of holliday was pronounced i felt the pulse under my fingers flutter stop go on suddenly with a bound and beat afterwards for a minute or two at the fever rate  how did you come here asked the stranger quickly excitably passionately almost  arthur related briefly what had happened from the time of his first taking the bed at the inn  i am indebted to mr hollidays son then for the help that has saved my life said the medical student speaking to himself with a singular sarcasm in his voice  come here  he held out as he spoke his long white bony right hand  with all my heart said arthur taking the handcordially  i may confess it now he continued laughing  upon my honour you almost frightened me out of my wits  the stranger did not seem to listen  his wild black eyes were fixed with a look of eager interest on arthurs face and his long bony fingers kept tight hold of arthurs hand  young holliday on his side returned the gaze amazed and puzzled by the medical students odd language and manners  the two faces were close together i looked at them and to my amazement i was suddenly impressed by the sense of a likeness between themnot in features or complexion but solely in expression  it must have been a strong likeness or i should certainly not have found it out for i am naturally slow at detecting resemblances between faces  you have saved my life said the strange man still looking hard in arthurs face still holding tightly by his hand  if you had been my own brother you could not have done more for me than that  he laid a singularly strong emphasis on those three words my own brother and a change passed over his face as he pronounced them a change that no language of mine is competent to describe  i hope i have not done being of service to you yet said arthur ill speak to my father as soon as i get home  you seem to be fond and proud of your father said the medical student  i suppose in return he is fond and proud of you  of course he is answered arthur laughing  is there anything wonderful in that  isnt your father fond  the stranger suddenly dropped young hollidays hand and turned his face away  i beg your pardon said arthur  i hope i have not unintentionally pained you  i hope you have not lost your father  i cant well lose what i have never had retorted the medical student with a harsh mocking laugh  what you have never had  the strange man suddenly caught arthurs hand again suddenly looked once more hard in his face  yes he said with a repetition of the bitter laugh  you have brought a poor devil back into the world who has no business there  do i astonish you  well  i have a fancy of my own for telling you what men in my situation generally keep a secret  i have no name and no father  the merciful law of society tells me i am nobodys son  ask your father if he will be my father too and help me on in life with the family name  arthur looked at me more puzzled than ever  i signed to him to say nothing and then laid my fingers again on the mans wrist no  in spite of the extraordinary speech that he had just made he was not as i had been disposed to suspect beginning to get light headed  his pulse by this time had fallen back to a quiet slow beat and his skin was moist and cool  not a symptom of fever or agitation about him  finding that neither of us answered him he turned to me and began talking of the extraordinary nature of his case and asking my advice about the future course of medical treatment to which he ought to subject himself  i said the matter required careful thinking over and suggested that i should submit certain prescriptions to him the next morning  he told me to write them at once as he would most likely be leaving doncaster in the morning before i was up  it was quite useless to represent to him the folly and danger of such a proceeding as this  he heard me politely and patiently but held to his resolution without offering any reasons or any explanations and repeated to me that if i wished to give him a chance of seeing my prescription i must write it at once  hearing this arthur volunteered the loan of a travelling writingcase which he said he had with him and bringing it to the bed shook the notepaper out of the pocket of the case forthwith in his usual careless way  with the paper there fell out on the counterpane of the bed a small packet of stickingplaster and a little watercolour drawing of a landscape  the medical student took up the drawing and looked at it  his eye fell on some initials neatly written in cypher in one corner  he started and trembled his pale face grew whiter than ever his wild black eyes turned on arthur and looked through and through him  a pretty drawing he said in a remarkably quiet tone of voice  ah and done by such a pretty girl said arthur  oh such a pretty girl  i wish it was not a landscapei wish it was a portrait of her  you admire her very much  arthur half in jest half in earnest kissed his hand for answer  love at first sight he said putting the drawing away again but the course of it doesnt run smooth  its the old story shes monopolised as usual  trammelled by a rash engagement to some poor man who is never likely to get money enough to marry her it was lucky i heard of it in time or i should certainly have risked a declaration when she gave me that drawing  here doctor here is pen ink and paper all ready for you  when she gave you that drawing  gave it  gave it  he repeated the words slowly to himself and suddenly closed his eyes  a momentary distortion passed across his face and i saw one of his hands clutch up the bedclothes and squeeze them hard  i thought he was going to be ill again and begged that there might be no more talking  he opened his eyes when i spoke fixed them once more searchingly on arthur and said slowly and distinctly you like her and she likes you  the poor man may die out of your way  who can tell that she may not give you herself as well as her drawing after all  before young holliday could answer he turned to me and said in a whisper now for the prescription  from that time though he spoke to arthur again he never looked at him more  when i had written the prescription he examined it approved of it and then astonished us both by abruptly wishing us good night i offered to sit up with him and he shook his head  arthur offered to sit up with him and he said shortly with his face turned away no  i insisted on having somebody left to watch him  he gave way when he found i was determined and said he would accept the services of the waiter at the inn  thank you both he said as we rose to go  i have one last favour to asknot of you doctor for i leave you to exercise your professional discretionbut of mr holliday  his eyes while he spoke still rested steadily on me and never once turned towards arthur  i beg that mr holliday will not mention to any one least of all to his fatherthe events that have occurred and the words that have passed in this room  i entreat him to bury me in his memory as but for him i might have been buried in my grave i cannot give my reasons for making this strange request  i can only implore him to grant it  his voice faltered for the first time and he hid his face on the pillow  arthur completely bewildered gave the required pledge i took young holliday away with me immediately afterwards to the house of my friend determining to go back to the inn and to see the medical student again before he had left in the morning  i returned to the inn at eight oclock purposely abstaining from waking arthur who was sleeping off the past nights excitement on one of my friends sofas  a suspicion had occurred to me as soon as i was alone in my bedroom which made me resolve that holliday and the stranger whose life he had saved should not meet again if i could prevent it  i have already alluded to certain reports or scandals which i knew of relating to the early life of arthurs father  while i was thinking in my bed of what had passed at the innof the change in the students pulse when he heard the name of holliday of the resemblance of expression that i had discovered between his face and arthurs of the emphasis he had laid on those three words my own brother and of his incomprehensible acknowledgment of his own illegitimacywhile i was thinking of these things the reports i have mentioned suddenly flew into my mind and linked themselves fast to the chain of my previous reflections  something within me whispered it is best that those two young men should not meet again  i felt it before i slept i felt it when i woke and i went as i told you alone to the inn the next morning  i had missed my only opportunity of seeing my nameless patient again  he had been gone nearly an hour when i inquired for him   i have now told you everything that i know for certain in relation to the man whom i brought back to life in the doublebedded room of the inn at doncaster  what i have next to add is matter for inference and surmise and is not strictly speaking matter of fact  i have to tell you first that the medical student turned out to be strangely and unaccountably right in assuming it as more than probable that arthur holliday would marry the young lady who had given him the watercolour drawing of the landscape  that marriage took place a little more than a year after the events occurred which i have just been relating  the young couple came to live in the neighbourhood in which i was then established in practice  i was present at the wedding and was rather surprised to find that arthur was singularly reserved with me both before and after his marriage on the subject of the young ladys prior engagement  he only referred to it once when we were alone merely telling me on that occasion that his wife had done all that honour and duty required of her in the matter and that the engagement had been broken off with the full approval of her parents  i never heard more from him than this  for three years he and his wife lived together happily  at the expiration of that time the symptoms of a serious illness first declared themselves in mrs arthur holliday  it turned out to be a long lingering hopeless malady i attended her throughout  we had been great friends when she was well and we became more attached to each other than ever when she was ill  i had many long and interesting conversations with her in the intervals when she suffered least  the result of one of these conversations i may briefly relate leaving you to draw any inferences from it that you please  the interview to which i refer occurred shortly before her death i called one evening as usual and found her alone with a look in her eyes which told me that she had been crying  she only informed me at first that she had been depressed in spirits but by little and little she became more communicative and confessed to me that she had been looking over some old letters which had been addressed to her before she had seen arthur by a man to whom she had been engaged to be married  i asked her how the engagement came to be broken off  she replied that it had not been broken off but that it had died out in a very mysterious way  the person to whom she was engagedher first love she called himwas very poor and there was no immediate prospect of their being married he followed my profession and went abroad to study  they had corresponded regularly until the time when as she believed he had returned to england  from that period she heard no more of him  he was of a fretful sensitive temperament and she feared that she might have inadvertently done or said something that offended him  however that might be he had never written to her again and after waiting a year she had married arthur  i asked when the first estrangement had begun and found that the time at which she ceased to hear anything of her first lover exactly corresponded with the time at which i had been called in to my mysterious patient at the two robins inn  a fortnight after that conversation she died  in course of time arthur married again  of late years he has lived principally in london and i have seen little or nothing of him  i have many years to pass over before i can approach to anything like a conclusion of this fragmentary narrative  and even when that later period is reached the little that i have to say will not occupy your attention for more than a few minutes  between six and seven years ago the gentleman to whom i introduced you in this room came to me with good professional recommendations to fill the position of my assistant  we met not like strangers but like friendsthe only difference between us being that i was very much surprised to see him and that he did not appear to be at all surprised to see me  if he was my son or my brother i believe he could not be fonder of me than he is but he has never volunteered any confidences since he has been here on the subject of his past life  i saw something that was familiar to me in his face when we first met and yet it was also something that suggested the idea of change  i had a notion once that my patient at the inn might be a natural son of mr hollidays i had another idea that he might also have been the man who was engaged to arthurs first wife and i have a third idea still clinging to me that mr lorn is the only man in england who could really enlighten me if he chose on both those doubtful points  his hair is not black now and his eyes are dimmer than the piercing eyes that i remember but for all that he is very like the nameless medical student of my young daysvery like him  and sometimes when i come home late at night and find him asleep and wake him he looks in coming to wonderfully like the stranger at doncaster as he raised himself in the bed on that memorable night  the doctor paused  mr goodchild who had been following every word that fell from his lips up to this time leaned forward eagerly to ask a question  before he could say a word the latch of the door was raised without any warning sound of footsteps in the passage outside  a long white bony hand appeared through the opening gently pushing the door which was prevented from working freely on its hinges by a fold in the carpet under it  that hand  look at that hand doctor said mr goodchild touching him  at the same moment the doctor looked at mr goodchild and whispered to him significantly  hush he has come back    chapter iii    the cumberland doctors mention of doncaster races inspired mr francis goodchild with the idea of going down to doncaster to see the races  doncaster being a good way off and quite out of the way of the idle apprentices if anything could be out of their way who had no way it necessarily followed that francis perceived doncaster in the raceweek to be of all possible idleness the particular idleness that would completely satisfy him  thomas with an enforced idleness grafted on the natural and voluntary power of his disposition was not of this mind objecting that a man compelled to lie on his back on a floor a sofa a table a line of chairs or anything he could get to lie upon was not in racing condition and that he desired nothing better than to lie where he was enjoying himself in looking at the flies on the ceiling  but francis goodchild who had been walking round his companion in a circuit of twelve miles for two days and had begun to doubt whether it was reserved for him ever to be idle in his life not only overpowered this objection but even converted thomas idle to a scheme he formed another idle inspiration of conveying the said thomas to the seacoast and putting his injured leg under a stream of saltwater  plunging into this happy conception headforemost mr goodchild immediately referred to the countymap and ardently discovered that the most delicious piece of seacoast to be found within the limits of england ireland scotland wales the isle of man and the channel islands all summed up together was allonby on the coast of cumberland  there was the coast of scotland opposite to allonby said mr goodchild with enthusiasm there was a fine scottish mountain on that scottish coast there were scottish lights to be seen shining across the glorious channel and at allonby itself there was every idle luxury no doubt that a wateringplace could offer to the heart of idle man  moreover said mr goodchild with his finger on the map this exquisite retreat was approached by a coachroad from a railwaystation called aspatriaa name in a manner suggestive of the departed glories of greece associated with one of the most engaging and most famous of greek women  on this point mr goodchild continued at intervals to breathe a vein of classic fancy and eloquence exceedingly irksome to mr idle until it appeared that the honest english pronunciation of that cumberland country shortened aspatria into spatter  after this supplementary discovery mr goodchild said no more about it  by way of spatter the crippled idle was carried hoisted pushed poked and packed into and out of carriages into and out of beds into and out of tavern restingplaces until he was brought at length within sniff of the sea  and now behold the apprentices gallantly riding into allonby in a onehorse fly bent upon staying in that peaceful marine valley until the turbulent doncaster time shall come round upon the wheel in its turn among what are in sporting registers called the fixtures for the month  do you see allonby asked thomas idle  i dont see it yet said francis looking out of window  it must be there said thomas idle  i dont see it returned francis  it must be there repeated thomas idle fretfully  lord bless me exclaimed francis drawing in his head i suppose this is it  a wateringplace retorted thomas idle with the pardonable sharpness of an invalid cant be five gentlemen in straw hats on a form on one side of a door and four ladies in hats and falls on a form on another side of a door and three geese in a dirty little brook before them and a boys legs hanging over a bridge with a boys body i suppose on the other side of the parapet and a donkey running away  what are you talking about  allonby gentlemen said the most comfortable of landladies as she opened one door of the carriage allonby gentlemen said the most attentive of landlords as he opened the other  thomas idle yielded his arm to the ready goodchild and descended from the vehicle  thomas now just able to grope his way along in a doubledup condition with the aid of two thick sticks was no bad embodiment of commodore trunnion or of one of those many gallant admirals of the stage who have all ample fortunes gout thick sticks tempers wards and nephews  with this distinguished naval appearance upon him thomas made a crablike progress up a clean little bulkheaded staircase into a clean little bulkheaded room where he slowly deposited himself on a sofa with a stick on either hand of him looking exceedingly grim  francis said thomas idle what do you think of this place  i think returned mr goodchild in a glowing way it is everything we expected  hah said thomas idle  there is the sea cried mr goodchild pointing out of window and here pointing to the lunch on the table are shrimps  let us here mr goodchild looked out of window as if in search of something and looked in againlet us eat em  the shrimps eaten and the dinner ordered mr goodchild went out to survey the wateringplace  as chorus of the drama without whom thomas could make nothing of the scenery he byandby returned to have the following report screwed out of him  in brief it was the most delightful place ever seen  but thomas idle asked where is it  its what you may call generally up and down the beach here and there said mr goodchild with a twist of his hand  proceed said thomas idle  it was mr goodchild went on to say in crossexamination what you might call a primitive place  large  no it was not large who ever expected it would be large  shape  what a question to ask  no shape  what sort of a street  why no street  shops yes of course quite indignant  how many  who ever went into a place to count the shops  ever so many  six  perhaps  a library  why of course indignant again  good collection of books  most likelycouldnt sayhad seen nothing in it but a pair of scales  any readingroom  of course there was a reading room  where  where why over there  where was over there  why there  let mr idle carry his eye to that bit of waste ground above highwater mark where the rank grass and loose stones were most in a litter and he would see a sort of long ruinous brick loft next door to a ruinous brick outhouse which loft had a ladder outside to get up by  that was the readingroom and if mr idle didnt like the idea of a weavers shuttle throbbing under a readingroom that was his look out  he was not to dictate mr goodchild supposed indignant again to the company  bytheby thomas idle observed the company  well mr goodchild went on to report very nice company  where were they  why there they were  mr idle could see the tops of their hats he supposed  what  those nine straw hats again five gentlemens and four ladies  yes to be sure  mr goodchild hoped the company were not to be expected to wear helmets to please mr idle  beginning to recover his temper at about this point mr goodchild voluntarily reported that if you wanted to be primitive you could be primitive here and that if you wanted to be idle you could be idle here  in the course of some days he added that there were three fishingboats but no rigging and that there were plenty of fishermen who never fished  that they got their living entirely by looking at the ocean  what nourishment they looked out of it to support their strength he couldnt say but he supposed it was some sort of iodine  the place was full of their children who were always upside down on the public buildings two small bridges over the brook and always hurting themselves or one another so that their wailings made more continual noise in the air than could have been got in a busy place  the houses people lodged in were nowhere in particular and were in capital accordance with the beach being all more or less cracked and damaged as its shells were and all emptyas its shells were  among them was an edifice of destitute appearance with a number of walleyed windows in it looking desperately out to scotland as if for help which said it was a bazaar and it ought to know and where you might buy anything you wantedsupposing what you wanted was a little campstool or a childs wheelbarrow  the brook crawled or stopped between the houses and the sea and the donkey was always running away and when he got into the brook he was pelted out with stones which never hit him and which always hit some of the children who were upside down on the public buildings and made their lamentations louder  this donkey was the public excitement of allonby and was probably supported at the public expense  the foregoing descriptions delivered in separate items on separate days of adventurous discovery mr goodchild severally wound up by looking out of window looking in again and saying but there is the sea and here are the shrimpslet us eat em  there were fine sunsets at allonby when the low flat beach with its pools of water and its dry patches changed into long bars of silver and gold in various states of burnishing and there were fine viewson fine daysof the scottish coast  but when it rained at allonby allonby thrown back upon its ragged self became a kind of place which the donkey seemed to have found out and to have his highly sagacious reasons for wishing to bolt from  thomas idle observed too that mr goodchild with a noble show of disinterestedness became every day more ready to walk to maryport and back for letters and suspicions began to harbour in the mind of thomas that his friend deceived him and that maryport was a preferable place  therefore thomas said to francis on a day when they had looked at the sea and eaten the shrimps my mind misgives me goodchild that you go to maryport like the boy in the storybook to ask it to be idle with you  judge then returned francis adopting the style of the story book with what success  i go to a region which is a bit of waterside bristol with a slice of wapping a seasoning of wolverhampton and a garnish of portsmouth and i say will you come and be idle with me  and it answers no for i am a great deal too vaporous and a great deal too rusty and a great deal too muddy and a great deal too dirty altogether and i have ships to load and pitch and tar to boil and iron to hammer and steam to get up and smoke to make and stone to quarry and fifty other disagreeable things to do and i cant be idle with you  then i go into jagged uphill and downhill streets where i am in the pastrycooks shop at one moment and next moment in savage fastnesses of moor and morass beyond the confines of civilisation and i say to those murky and blackdusty streets will you come and be idle with me  to which they reply no we cant indeed for we havent the spirits and we are startled by the echo of your feet on the sharp pavement and we have so many goods in our shop windows which nobody wants and we have so much to do for a limited public which never comes to us to be done for that we are altogether out of sorts and cant enjoy ourselves with any one so i go to the postoffice and knock at the shutter and i say to the postmaster will you come and be idle with me  to which he rejoins no i really cant for i live as you may see in such a very little postoffice and pass my life behind such a very little shutter that my hand when i put it out is as the hand of a giant crammed through the window of a dwarfs house at a fair and i am a mere postoffice anchorite in a cell much too small for him and i cant get out and i cant get in and i have no space to be idle in even if i would  so the boy said mr goodchild concluding the tale comes back with the letters after all and lives happy never afterwards  but it may not unreasonably be askedwhile francis goodchild was wandering hither and thither storing his mind with perpetual observation of men and things and sincerely believing himself to be the laziest creature in existence all the timehow did thomas idle crippled and confined to the house contrive to get through the hours of the day  prone on the sofa thomas made no attempt to get through the hours but passively allowed the hours to get through him  where other men in his situation would have read books and improved their minds thomas slept and rested his body  where other men would have pondered anxiously over their future prospects thomas dreamed lazily of his past life  the one solitary thing he did which most other people would have done in his place was to resolve on making certain alterations and improvements in his mode of existence as soon as the effects of the misfortune that had overtaken him had all passed away  remembering that the current of his life had hitherto oozed along in one smooth stream of laziness occasionally troubled on the surface by a slight passing ripple of industry his present ideas on the subject of selfreform inclined himnot as the reader may be disposed to imagine to project schemes for a new existence of enterprise and exertionbut on the contrary to resolve that he would never if he could possibly help it be active or industrious again throughout the whole of his future career  it is due to mr idle to relate that his mind sauntered towards this peculiar conclusion on distinct and logicallyproducible grounds  after reviewing quite at his ease and with many needful intervals of repose the generallyplacid spectacle of his past existence he arrived at the discovery that all the great disasters which had tried his patience and equanimity in early life had been caused by his having allowed himself to be deluded into imitating some pernicious example of activity and industry that had been set him by others  the trials to which he here alludes were three in number and may be thus reckoned up  first the disaster of being an unpopular and a thrashed boy at school secondly the disaster of falling seriously ill thirdly the disaster of becoming acquainted with a great bore  the first disaster occurred after thomas had been an idle and a popular boy at school for some happy years  one christmastime he was stimulated by the evil example of a companion whom he had always trusted and liked to be untrue to himself and to try for a prize at the ensuing halfyearly examination  he did try and he got a prizehow he did not distinctly know at the moment and cannot remember now  no sooner however had the bookmoral hints to the young on the value of timebeen placed in his hands than the first troubles of his life began  the idle boys deserted him as a traitor to their cause  the industrious boys avoided him as a dangerous interloper one of their number who had always won the prize on previous occasions expressing just resentment at the invasion of his privileges by calling thomas into the playground and then and there administering to him the first sound and genuine thrashing that he had ever received in his life  unpopular from that moment as a beaten boy who belonged to no side and was rejected by all parties young idle soon lost caste with his masters as he had previously lost caste with his schoolfellows he had forfeited the comfortable reputation of being the one lazy member of the youthful community whom it was quite hopeless to punish  never again did he hear the headmaster say reproachfully to an industrious boy who had committed a fault i might have expected this in thomas idle but it is inexcusable sir in you who know better  never more after winning that fatal prize did he escape the retributive imposition or the avenging birch  from that time the masters made him work and the boys would not let him play  from that time his social position steadily declined and his life at school became a perpetual burden to him  so again with the second disaster  while thomas was lazy he was a model of health  his first attempt at active exertion and his first suffering from severe illness are connected together by the intimate relations of cause and effect  shortly after leaving school he accompanied a party of friends to a cricketfield in his natural and appropriate character of spectator only  on the ground it was discovered that the players fell short of the required number and facile thomas was persuaded to assist in making up the complement  at a certain appointed time he was roused from peaceful slumber in a dry ditch and placed before three wickets with a bat in his hand  opposite to him behind three more wickets stood one of his bosom friends filling the situation as he was informed of bowler  no words can describe mr idles horror and amazement when he saw this young manon ordinary occasions the meekest and mildest of human beings suddenly contract his eyebrows compress his lips assume the aspect of an infuriated savage run back a few steps then run forward and without the slightest previous provocation hurl a detestably hard ball with all his might straight at thomass legs stimulated to preternatural activity of body and sharpness of eye by the instinct of selfpreservation mr idle contrived by jumping deftly aside at the right moment and by using his bat ridiculously narrow as it was for the purpose as a shield to preserve his life and limbs from the dastardly attack that had been made on both to leave the full force of the deadly missile to strike his wicket instead of his leg and to end the innings so far as his side was concerned by being immediately bowled out grateful for his escape he was about to return to the dry ditch when he was peremptorily stopped and told that the other side was going in and that he was expected to field  his conception of the whole art and mystery of fielding may be summed up in the three words of serious advice which he privately administered to himself on that trying occasionavoid the ball  fortified by this sound and salutary principle he took his own course impervious alike to ridicule and abuse  whenever the ball came near him he thought of his shins and got out of the way immediately  catch it  stop it  pitch it up were cries that passed by him like the idle wind that he regarded not  he ducked under it he jumped over it he whisked himself away from it on either side  never once through the whole innings did he and the ball come together on anything approaching to intimate terms  the unnatural activity of body which was necessarily called forth for the accomplishment of this result threw thomas idle for the first time in his life into a perspiration  the perspiration in consequence of his want of practice in the management of that particular result of bodily activity was suddenly checked the inevitable chill succeeded and that in its turn was followed by a fever  for the first time since his birth mr idle found himself confined to his bed for many weeks together wasted and worn by a long illness of which his own disastrous muscular exertion had been the sole first cause  the third occasion on which thomas found reason to reproach himself bitterly for the mistake of having attempted to be industrious was connected with his choice of a calling in life  having no interest in the church he appropriately selected the next best profession for a lazy man in englandthe bar  although the benchers of the inns of court have lately abandoned their good old principles and oblige their students to make some show of studying in mr idles time no such innovation as this existed  young men who aspired to the honourable title of barrister were very properly not asked to learn anything of the law but were merely required to eat a certain number of dinners at the table of their hall and to pay a certain sum of money and were called to the bar as soon as they could prove that they had sufficiently complied with these extremely sensible regulations  never did thomas move more harmoniously in concert with his elders and betters than when he was qualifying himself for admission among the barristers of his native country  never did he feel more deeply what real laziness was in all the serene majesty of its nature than on the memorable day when he was called to the bar after having carefully abstained from opening his lawbooks during his period of probation except to fall asleep over them  how he could ever again have become industrious even for the shortest period after that great reward conferred upon his idleness quite passes his comprehension  the kind benchers did everything they could to show him the folly of exerting himself  they wrote out his probationary exercise for him and never expected him even to take the trouble of reading it through when it was written  they invited him with seven other choice spirits as lazy as himself to come and be called to the bar while they were sitting over their wine and fruit after dinner  they put his oaths of allegiance and his dreadful official denunciations of the pope and the pretender so gently into his mouth that he hardly knew how the words got there  they wheeled all their chairs softly round from the table and sat surveying the young barristers with their backs to their bottles rather than stand up or adjourn to hear the exercises read  and when mr idle and the seven unlabouring neophytes ranged in order as a class with their backs considerately placed against a screen had begun in rotation to read the exercises which they had not written even then each bencher true to the great lazy principle of the whole proceeding stopped each neophyte before he had stammered through his first line and bowed to him and told him politely that he was a barrister from that moment  this was all the ceremony  it was followed by a social supper and by the presentation in accordance with ancient custom of a pound of sweetmeats and a bottle of madeira offered in the way of needful refreshment by each grateful neophyte to each beneficent bencher it may seem inconceivable that thomas should ever have forgotten the great donothing principle instilled by such a ceremony as this but it is nevertheless true that certain designing students of industrious habits found him out took advantage of his easy humour persuaded him that it was discreditable to be a barrister and to know nothing whatever about the law and lured him by the force of their own evil example into a conveyancers chambers to make up for lost time and to qualify himself for practice at the bar  after a fortnight of selfdelusion the curtain fell from his eyes he resumed his natural character and shut up his books  but the retribution which had hitherto always followed his little casual errors of industry followed them still he could get away from the conveyancers chambers but he could not get away from one of the pupils who had taken a fancy to hima tall serious rawboned hardworking disputatious pupil with ideas of his own about reforming the law of real property who has been the scourge of mr idles existence ever since the fatal day when he fell into the mistake of attempting to study the law before that time his friends were all sociable idlers like himself since that time the burden of bearing with a hardworking young man has become part of his lot in life  go where he will now he can never feel certain that the rawboned pupil is not affectionately waiting for him round a corner to tell him a little more about the law of real property  suffer as he may under the infliction he can never complain for he must always remember with unavailing regret that he has his own thoughtless industry to thank for first exposing him to the great social calamity of knowing a bore  these events of his past life with the significant results that they brought about pass drowsily through thomas idles memory while he lies alone on the sofa at allonby and elsewhere dreaming away the time which his fellowapprentice gets through so actively out of doors  remembering the lesson of laziness which his past disasters teach and bearing in mind also the fact that he is crippled in one leg because he exerted himself to go up a mountain when he ought to have known that his proper course of conduct was to stop at the bottom of it he holds now and will for the future firmly continue to hold by his new resolution never to be industrious again on any pretence whatever for the rest of his life  the physical results of his accident have been related in a previous chapter  the moral results now stand on record and with the enumeration of these that part of the present narrative which is occupied by the episode of the sprained ankle may now perhaps be considered in all its aspects as finished and complete  how do you propose that we get through this present afternoon and evening demanded thomas idle after two or three hours of the foregoing reflections at allonby  mr goodchild faltered looked out of window looked in again and said as he had so often said before there is the sea and here are the shrimpslet us eat em  but the wise donkey was at that moment in the act of bolting  not with the irresolution of his previous efforts which had been wanting in sustained force of character but with real vigour of purpose  shaking the dust off his mane and hindfeet at allonby and tearing away from it as if he had nobly made up his mind that he never would be taken alive  at sight of this inspiring spectacle which was visible from his sofa thomas idle stretched his neck and dwelt upon it rapturously  francis goodchild he then said turning to his companion with a solemn air this is a delightful little inn excellently kept by the most comfortable of landladies and the most attentive of landlords butthe donkeys right  the words there is the sea and here are the again trembled on the lips of goodchild unaccompanied however by any sound  let us instantly pack the portmanteaus said thomas idle pay the bill and order a fly out with instructions to the driver to follow the donkey  mr goodchild who had only wanted encouragement to disclose the real state of his feelings and who had been pining beneath his weary secret now burst into tears and confessed that he thought another day in the place would be the death of him  so the two idle apprentices followed the donkey until the night was far advanced  whether he was recaptured by the towncouncil or is bolting at this hour through the united kingdom they know not  they hope he may be still bolting if so their best wishes are with him  it entered mr idles head on the borders of cumberland that there could be no idler place to stay at except by snatches of a few minutes each than a railway station  an intermediate station on a linea junctionanything of that sort thomas suggested mr goodchild approved of the idea as eccentric and they journeyed on and on until they came to such a station where there was an inn  here said thomas we may be luxuriously lazy other people will travel for us as it were and we shall laugh at their folly  it was a junctionstation where the wooden razors before mentioned shaved the air very often and where the sharp electrictelegraph bell was in a very restless condition  all manner of crosslines of rails came zigzagging into it like a congress of iron vipers and a little way out of it a pointsman in an elevated signalbox was constantly going through the motions of drawing immense quantities of beer at a publichouse bar  in one direction confused perspectives of embankments and arches were to be seen from the platform in the other the rails soon disentangled themselves into two tracks and shot away under a bridge and curved round a corner  sidings were there in which empty luggagevans and cattleboxes often butted against each other as if they couldnt agree and warehouses were there in which great quantities of goods seemed to have taken the veil of the consistency of tarpaulin and to have retired from the world without any hope of getting back to it  refreshmentrooms were there one for the hungry and thirsty iron locomotives where their coke and water were ready and of good quality for they were dangerous to play tricks with the other for the hungry and thirsty human locomotives who might take what they could get and whose chief consolation was provided in the form of three terrific urns or vases of white metal containing nothing each forming a breastwork for a defiant and apparently muchinjured woman  established at this station mr thomas idle and mr francis goodchild resolved to enjoy it  but its contrasts were very violent and there was also an infection in it  first as to its contrasts  they were only two but they were lethargy and madness  the station was either totally unconscious or wildly raving  by day in its unconscious state it looked as if no life could come to itas if it were all rust dust and ashesas if the last train for ever had gone without issuing any returnticketsas if the last engine had uttered its last shriek and burst  one awkward shave of the air from the wooden razor and everything changed  tight officedoors flew open panels yielded books newspapers travellingcaps and wrappers broke out of brick walls money chinked conveyances oppressed by nightmares of luggage came careering into the yard porters started up from secret places ditto the muchinjured women the shining bell who lived in a little tray on stilts by himself flew into a mans hand and clamoured violently  the pointsman aloft in the signalbox made the motions of drawing with some difficulty hogsheads of beer  down train  more bear  up train  more beer  cross junction train  more beer  cattle train  more beer  goods train  simmering whistling trembling rumbling thundering trains on the whole confusion of intersecting rails crossing one another bumping one another hissing one another backing to go forward tearing into distance to come close  people frantic exiles seeking restoration to their native carriages and banished to remoter climes  more beer and more bell  then in a minute the station relapsed into stupor as the stoker of the cattle train the last to depart went gliding out of it wiping the long nose of his oilcan with a dirty pockethandkerchief  by night in its unconscious state the station was not so much as visible  something in the air like an enterprising chemists established in business on one of the boughs of jacks beanstalk was all that could be discerned of it under the stars  in a moment it would break out a constellation of gas  in another moment twenty rival chemists on twenty rival beanstalks came into existence  then the furies would be seen waving their lurid torches up and down the confused perspectives of embankments and archeswould be heard too wailing and shrieking  then the station would be full of palpitating trains as in the day with the heightening difference that they were not so clearly seen as in the day whereas the station walls starting forward under the gas like a hippopotamuss eyes dazzled the human locomotives with the saucebottle the cheap music the bedstead the distorted range of buildings where the patent safes are made the gentleman in the rain with the registered umbrella the lady returning from the ball with the registered respirator and all their other embellishments and now the human locomotives creased as to their countenances and purblind as to their eyes would swarm forth in a heap addressing themselves to the mysterious urns and the muchinjured women while the iron locomotives dripping fire and water shed their steam about plentifully making the dull oxen in their cages with heads depressed and foam hanging from their mouths as their red looks glanced fearfully at the surrounding terrors seem as though they had been drinking at halffrozen waters and were hung with icicles  through the same steam would be caught glimpses of their fellowtravellers the sheep getting their white kid faces together away from the bars and stuffing the interstices with trembling wool  also down among the wheels of the man with the sledgehammer ringing the axles of the fast nighttrain against whom the oxen have a misgiving that he is the man with the poleaxe who is to come byandby and so the nearest of them try to get back and get a purchase for a thrust at him through the bars suddenly the bell would ring the steam would stop with one hiss and a yell the chemists on the beanstalks would be busy the avenging furies would bestir themselves the fast nighttrain would melt from eye and ear the other trains going their ways more slowly would be heard faintly rattling in the distance like old fashioned watches running down the saucebottle and cheap music retired from view even the bedstead went to bed and there was no such visible thing as the station to vex the cool wind in its blowing or perhaps the autumn lightning as it found out the iron rails  the infection of the station was this when it was in its raving state the apprentices found it impossible to be there without labouring under the delusion that they were in a hurry  to mr goodchild whose ideas of idleness were so imperfect this was no unpleasant hallucination and accordingly that gentleman went through great exertions in yielding to it and running up and down the platform jostling everybody under the impression that he had a highly important mission somewhere and had not a moment to lose but to thomas idle this contagion was so very unacceptable an incident of the situation that he struck on the fourth day and requested to be moved  this place fills me with a dreadful sensation said thomas of having something to do  remove me francis  where would you like to go next was the question of the ever engaging goodchild  i have heard there is a good old inn at lancaster established in a fine old house  an inn where they give you bridecake every day after dinner said thomas idle  let us eat bridecake without the trouble of being married or of knowing anybody in that ridiculous dilemma  mr goodchild with a lovers sigh assented  they departed from the station in a violent hurry for which it is unnecessary to observe there was not the least occasion and were delivered at the fine old house at lancaster on the same night  it is mr goodchilds opinion that if a visitor on his arrival at lancaster could be accommodated with a pole which would push the opposite side of the street some yards farther off it would be better for all parties  protesting against being required to live in a trench and obliged to speculate all day upon what the people can possibly be doing within a mysterious opposite window which is a shopwindow to look at but not a shopwindow in respect of its offering nothing for sale and declining to give any account whatever of itself mr goodchild concedes lancaster to be a pleasant place  a place dropped in the midst of a charming landscape a place with a fine ancient fragment of castle a place of lovely walks a place possessing staid old houses richly fitted with old honduras mahogany which has grown so dark with time that it seems to have got something of a retrospective mirrorquality into itself and to show the visitor in the depth of its grain through all its polish the hue of the wretched slaves who groaned long ago under old lancaster merchants  and mr goodchild adds that the stones of lancaster do sometimes whisper even yet of rich men passed awayupon whose great prosperity some of these old doorways frowned sullen in the brightest weatherthat their slave gain turned to curses as the arabian wizards money turned to leaves and that no good ever came of it even unto the third and fourth generations until it was wasted and gone  it was a gallant sight to behold the sunday procession of the lancaster elders to churchall in black and looking fearfully like a funeral without the bodyunder the escort of three beadles  think said francis as he stood at the inn window admiring of being taken to the sacred edifice by three beadles  i have in my early time been taken out of it by one beadle but to be taken into it by three o thomas is a distinction i shall never enjoy    chapter iv    when mr goodchild had looked out of the lancaster inn window for two hours on end with great perseverance he begun to entertain a misgiving that he was growing industrious  he therefore set himself next to explore the country from the tops of all the steep hills in the neighbourhood  he came back at dinnertime red and glowing to tell thomas idle what he had seen  thomas on his back reading listened with great composure and asked him whether he really had gone up those hills and bothered himself with those views and walked all those miles  because i want to know added thomas what you would say of it if you were obliged to do it  it would be different then said francis  it would be work then now its play  play replied thomas idle utterly repudiating the reply  play here is a man goes systematically tearing himself to pieces and putting himself through an incessant course of training as if he were always under articles to fight a match for the champions belt and he calls it play  play exclaimed thomas idle scornfully contemplating his one boot in the air  you cant play you dont know what it is  you make work of everything  the bright goodchild amiably smiled  so you do said thomas  i mean it  to me you are an absolutely terrible fellow  you do nothing like another man  where another fellow would fall into a footbath of action or emotion you fall into a mine  where any other fellow would be a painted butterfly you are a fiery dragon  where another man would stake a sixpence you stake your existence  if you were to go up in a balloon you would make for heaven and if you were to dive into the depths of the earth nothing short of the other place would content you what a fellow you are francis  the cheerful goodchild laughed  its all very well to laugh but i wonder you dont feel it to be serious said idle  a man who can do nothing by halves appears to me to be a fearful man  tom tom returned goodchild if i can do nothing by halves and be nothing by halves its pretty clear that you must take me as a whole and make the best of me  with this philosophical rejoinder the airy goodchild clapped mr idle on the shoulder in a final manner and they sat down to dinner  bytheby said goodchild i have been over a lunatic asylum too since i have been out  he has been exclaimed thomas idle casting up his eyes over a lunatic asylum  not content with being as great an ass as captain barclay in the pedestrian way he makes a lunacy commissioner of himselffor nothing  an immense place said goodchild admirable offices very good arrangements very good attendants altogether a remarkable place  and what did you see there asked mr idle adapting hamlets advice to the occasion and assuming the virtue of interest though he had it not  the usual thing said francis goodchild with a sigh  long groves of blighted menandwomentrees interminable avenues of hopeless faces numbers without the slightest power of really combining for any earthly purpose a society of human creatures who have nothing in common but that they have all lost the power of being humanly social with one another  take a glass of wine with me said thomas idle and let us be social  in one gallery tom pursued francis goodchild which looked to me about the length of the long walk at windsor more or less  probably less observed thomas idle  in one gallery which was otherwise clear of patients for they were all out there was a poor little darkchinned meagre man with a perplexed brow and a pensive face stooping low over the matting on the floor and picking out with his thumb and forefinger the course of its fibres  the afternoon sun was slanting in at the large endwindow and there were cross patches of light and shade all down the vista made by the unseen windows and the open doors of the little sleepingcells on either side  in about the centre of the perspective under an arch regardless of the pleasant weather regardless of the solitude regardless of approaching footsteps was the poor little darkchinned meagre man poring over the matting  what are you doing there said my conductor when we came to him  he looked up and pointed to the matting  i wouldnt do that i think said my conductor kindly if i were you i would go and read or i would lie down if i felt tired but i wouldnt do that  the patient considered a moment and vacantly answered no sir i wont illill go and read and so he lamely shuffled away into one of the little rooms  i turned my head before we had gone many paces  he had already come out again and was again poring over the matting and tracking out its fibres with his thumb and forefinger  i stopped to look at him and it came into my mind that probably the course of those fibres as they plaited in and out over and under was the only course of things in the whole wide world that it was left to him to understandthat his darkening intellect had narrowed down to the small cleft of light which showed him this piece was twisted this way went in here passed under came out there was carried on away here to the right where i now put my finger on it and in this progress of events the thing was made and came to be here  then i wondered whether he looked into the matting next to see if it could show him anything of the process through which he came to be there so strangely poring over it  then i thought how all of us god help us in our different ways are poring over our bits of matting blindly enough and what confusions and mysteries we make in the pattern  i had a sadder fellowfeeling with the little dark chinned meagre man by that time and i came away  mr idle diverting the conversation to grouse custards and bride cake mr goodchild followed in the same direction  the bridecake was as bilious and indigestible as if a real bride had cut it and the dinner it completed was an admirable performance  the house was a genuine old house of a very quaint description teeming with old carvings and beams and panels and having an excellent old staircase with a gallery or upper staircase cut off from it by a curious fencework of old oak or of the old honduras mahogany wood  it was and is and will be for many a long year to come a remarkably picturesque house and a certain grave mystery lurking in the depth of the old mahogany panels as if they were so many deep pools of dark watersuch indeed as they had been much among when they were treesgave it a very mysterious character after nightfall  when mr goodchild and mr idle had first alighted at the door and stepped into the sombre handsome old hall they had been received by halfadozen noiseless old men in black all dressed exactly alike who glided up the stairs with the obliging landlord and waiterbut without appearing to get into their way or to mind whether they did or noand who had filed off to the right and left on the old staircase as the guests entered their sittingroom  it was then broad bright day  but mr goodchild had said when their door was shut who on earth are those old men  and afterwards both on going out and coming in he had noticed that there were no old men to be seen  neither had the old men or any one of the old men reappeared since  the two friends had passed a night in the house but had seen nothing more of the old men  mr goodchild in rambling about it had looked along passages and glanced in at doorways but had encountered no old men neither did it appear that any old men were by any member of the establishment missed or expected  another odd circumstance impressed itself on their attention  it was that the door of their sittingroom was never left untouched for a quarter of an hour  it was opened with hesitation opened with confidence opened a little way opened a good wayalways clappedto again without a word of explanation  they were reading they were writing they were eating they were drinking they were talking they were dozing the door was always opened at an unexpected moment and they looked towards it and it was clapped to again and nobody was to be seen  when this had happened fifty times or so mr goodchild had said to his companion jestingly i begin to think tom there was something wrong with those six old men  night had come again and they had been writing for two or three hours  writing in short a portion of the lazy notes from which these lazy sheets are taken  they had left off writing and glasses were on the table between them  the house was closed and quiet  around the head of thomas idle as he lay upon his sofa hovered light wreaths of fragrant smoke  the temples of francis goodchild as he leaned back in his chair with his two hands clasped behind his head and his legs crossed were similarly decorated  they had been discussing several idle subjects of speculation not omitting the strange old men and were still so occupied when mr goodchild abruptly changed his attitude to wind up his watch  they were just becoming drowsy enough to be stopped in their talk by any such slight check  thomas idle who was speaking at the moment paused and said how goes it  one said goodchild  as if he had ordered one old man and the order were promptly executed truly all orders were so in that excellent hotel the door opened and one old man stood there  he did not come in but stood with the door in his hand  one of the six tom at last said mr goodchild in a surprised whispersir your pleasure  sir your pleasure said the one old man  i didnt ring  the bell did said the one old man  he said bell in a deep strong way that would have expressed the church bell  i had the pleasure i believe of seeing you yesterday said goodchild  i cannot undertake to say for certain was the grim reply of the one old man  i think you saw me  did you not  saw you said the old man  o yes i saw you  but i see many who never see me  a chilled slow earthy fixed old man  a cadaverous old man of measured speech  an old man who seemed as unable to wink as if his eyelids had been nailed to his forehead  an old man whose eyestwo spots of firehad no more motion than if they had been connected with the back of his skull by screws driven through it and rivetted and bolted outside among his grey hair  the night had turned so cold to mr goodchilds sensations that he shivered  he remarked lightly and half apologetically i think somebody is walking over my grave  no said the weird old man there is no one there  mr goodchild looked at idle but idle lay with his head enwreathed in smoke  no one there said goodchild  there is no one at your grave i assure you said the old man  he had come in and shut the door and he now sat down  he did not bend himself to sit as other people do but seemed to sink bolt upright as if in water until the chair stopped him  my friend mr idle said goodchild extremely anxious to introduce a third person into the conversation  i am said the old man without looking at him at mr idles service  if you are an old inhabitant of this place francis goodchild resumed  yes  perhaps you can decide a point my friend and i were in doubt upon this morning  they hang condemned criminals at the castle i believe  i believe so said the old man  are their faces turned towards that noble prospect  your face is turned replied the old man to the castle wall when you are tied up you see its stones expanding and contracting violently and a similar expansion and contraction seem to take place in your own head and breast  then there is a rush of fire and an earthquake and the castle springs into the air and you tumble down a precipice  his cravat appeared to trouble him  he put his hand to his throat and moved his neck from side to side  he was an old man of a swollen character of face and his nose was immoveably hitched up on one side as if by a little hook inserted in that nostril  mr goodchild felt exceedingly uncomfortable and began to think the night was hot and not cold  a strong description sir he observed  a strong sensation the old man rejoined  again mr goodchild looked to mr thomas idle but thomas lay on his back with his face attentively turned towards the one old man and made no sign  at this time mr goodchild believed that he saw threads of fire stretch from the old mans eyes to his own and there attach themselves  mr  goodchild writes the present account of his experience and with the utmost solemnity protests that he had the strongest sensation upon him of being forced to look at the old man along those two fiery films from that moment  i must tell it to you said the old man with a ghastly and a stony stare  what asked francis goodchild  you know where it took place  yonder  whether he pointed to the room above or to the room below or to any room in that old house or to a room in some other old house in that old town mr goodchild was not nor is nor ever can be sure  he was confused by the circumstance that the right forefinger of the one old man seemed to dip itself in one of the threads of fire light itself and make a fiery start in the air as it pointed somewhere  having pointed somewhere it went out  you know she was a bride said the old man  i know they still send up bridecake mr goodchild faltered this is a very oppressive air  she was a bride said the old man  she was a fair flaxen haired largeeyed girl who had no character no purpose  a weak credulous incapable helpless nothing  not like her mother  no no  it was her father whose character she reflected  her mother had taken care to secure everything to herself for her own life when the father of this girl a child at that time died of sheer helplessness no other disorderand then he renewed the acquaintance that had once subsisted between the mother and him he had been put aside for the flaxenhaired largeeyed man or nonentity with money  he could overlook that for money  he wanted compensation in money  so he returned to the side of that woman the mother made love to her again danced attendance on her and submitted himself to her whims  she wreaked upon him every whim she had or could invent he bore it  and the more he bore the more he wanted compensation in money and the more he was resolved to have it  but lo  before he got it she cheated him  in one of her imperious states she froze and never thawed again  she put her hands to her head one night uttered a cry stiffened lay in that attitude certain hours and died  and he had got no compensation from her in money yet  blight and murrain on her  not a penny  he had hated her throughout that second pursuit and had longed for retaliation on her  he now counterfeited her signature to an instrument leaving all she had to leave to her daughterten years old thento whom the property passed absolutely and appointing himself the daughters guardian  when he slid it under the pillow of the bed on which she lay he bent down in the deaf ear of death and whispered  mistress pride i have determined a long time that dead or alive you must make me compensation in money  so now there were only two left  which two were he and the fair flaxenhaired largeeyed foolish daughter who afterwards became the bride  he put her to school  in a secret dark oppressive ancient house he put her to school with a watchful and unscrupulous woman my worthy lady he said here is a mind to be formed will you help me to form it  she accepted the trust  for which she too wanted compensation in money and had it  the girl was formed in the fear of him and in the conviction that there was no escape from him  she was taught from the first to regard him as her future husbandthe man who must marry her the destiny that overshadowed herthe appointed certainty that could never be evaded  the poor fool was soft white wax in their hands and took the impression that they put upon her  it hardened with time  it became a part of herself  inseparable from herself and only to be torn away from her by tearing life away from her  eleven years she had lived in the dark house and its gloomy garden  he was jealous of the very light and air getting to her and they kept her close  he stopped the wide chimneys shaded the little windows left the strongstemmed ivy to wander where it would over the housefront the moss to accumulate on the untrimmed fruittrees in the redwalled garden the weeds to overrun its green and yellow walks  he surrounded her with images of sorrow and desolation  he caused her to be filled with fears of the place and of the stories that were told of it and then on pretext of correcting them to be left in it in solitude or made to shrink about it in the dark  when her mind was most depressed and fullest of terrors then he would come out of one of the hidingplaces from which he overlooked her and present himself as her sole resource  thus by being from her childhood the one embodiment her life presented to her of power to coerce and power to relieve power to bind and power to loose the ascendency over her weakness was secured  she was twentyone years and twentyone days old when he brought her home to the gloomy house his halfwitted frightened and submissive bride of three weeks  he had dismissed the governess by that timewhat he had left to do he could best do aloneand they came back upon a rain night to the scene of her long preparation  she turned to him upon the threshold as the rain was dripping from the porch and said  o sir it is the deathwatch ticking for me  well he answered  and if it were  o sir she returned to him look kindly on me and be merciful to me  i beg your pardon  i will do anything you wish if you will only forgive me  that had become the poor fools constant song  i beg your pardon and forgive me  she was not worth hating he felt nothing but contempt for her but she had long been in the way and he had long been weary and the work was near its end and had to be worked out  you fool he said  go up the stairs  she obeyed very quickly murmuring i will do anything you wish when he came into the brides chamber having been a little retarded by the heavy fastenings of the great door for they were alone in the house and he had arranged that the people who attended on them should come and go in the day he found her withdrawn to the furthest corner and there standing pressed against the paneling as if she would have shrunk through it  her flaxen hair all wild about her face and her large eyes staring at him in vague terror  what are you afraid of  come and sit down by me  i will do anything you wish  i beg your pardon sir  forgive me  her monotonous tune as usual  ellen here is a writing that you must write out tomorrow in your own hand  you may as well be seen by others busily engaged upon it  when you have written it all fairly and corrected all mistakes call in any two people there may be about the house and sign your name to it before them  then put it in your bosom to keep it safe and when i sit here again tomorrow night give it to me  i will do it all with the greatest care  i will do anything you wish  dont shake and tremble then  i will try my utmost not to do itif you will only forgive me  next day she sat down at her desk and did as she had been told he often passed in and out of the room to observe her and always saw her slowly and laboriously writing  repeating to herself the words she copied in appearance quite mechanically and without caring or endeavouring to comprehend them so that she did her task  he saw her follow the directions she had received in all particulars and at night when they were alone again in the same brides chamber and he drew his chair to the hearth she timidly approached him from her distant seat took the paper from her bosom and gave it into his hand  it secured all her possessions to him in the event of her death he put her before him face to face that he might look at her steadily and he asked her in so many plain words neither fewer nor more did she know that  there were spots of ink upon the bosom of her white dress and they made her face look whiter and her eyes look larger as she nodded her head  there were spots of ink upon the hand with which she stood before him nervously plaiting and folding her white skirts  he took her by the arm and looked her yet more closely and steadily in the face  now die  i have done with you  she shrunk and uttered a low suppressed cry  i am not going to kill you  i will not endanger my life for yours  die  he sat before her in the gloomy brides chamber day after day night after night looking the word at her when he did not utter it  as often as her large unmeaning eyes were raised from the hands in which she rocked her head to the stern figure sitting with crossed arms and knitted forehead in the chair they read in it die  when she dropped asleep in exhaustion she was called back to shuddering consciousness by the whisper die  when she fell upon her old entreaty to be pardoned she was answered die when she had outwatched and outsuffered the long night and the rising sun flamed into the sombre room she heard it hailed with another day and not deaddie  shut up in the deserted mansion aloof from all mankind and engaged alone in such a struggle without any respite it came to thisthat either he must die or she  he knew it very well and concentrated his strength against her feebleness  hours upon hours he held her by the arm when her arm was black where he held it and bade her die  it was done upon a windy morning before sunrise  he computed the time to be halfpast four but his forgotten watch had run down and he could not be sure  she had broken away from him in the night with loud and sudden criesthe first of that kind to which she had given ventand he had had to put his hands over her mouth  since then she had been quiet in the corner of the paneling where she had sunk down and he had left her and had gone back with his folded arms and his knitted forehead to his chair  paler in the pale light more colourless than ever in the leaden dawn he saw her coming trailing herself along the floor towards hima white wreck of hair and dress and wild eyes pushing itself on by an irresolute and bending hand  o forgive me  i will do anything  o sir pray tell me i may live  die  are you so resolved  is there no hope for me  die  her large eyes strained themselves with wonder and fear wonder and fear changed to reproach reproach to blank nothing  it was done  he was not at first so sure it was done but that the morning sun was hanging jewels in her hairhe saw the diamond emerald and ruby glittering among it in little points as he stood looking down at herwhen he lifted her and laid her on her bed  she was soon laid in the ground  and now they were all gone and he had compensated himself well  he had a mind to travel  not that he meant to waste his money for he was a pinching man and liked his money dearly liked nothing else indeed but that he had grown tired of the desolate house and wished to turn his back upon it and have done with it  but the house was worth money and money must not be thrown away  he determined to sell it before he went  that it might look the less wretched and bring a better price he hired some labourers to work in the overgrown garden to cut out the dead wood trim the ivy that drooped in heavy masses over the windows and gables and clear the walks in which the weeds were growing midleg high  he worked himself along with them  he worked later than they did and one evening at dusk was left working alone with his billhook in his hand  one autumn evening when the bride was five weeks dead  it grows too dark to work longer he said to himself i must give over for the night  he detested the house and was loath to enter it  he looked at the dark porch waiting for him like a tomb and felt that it was an accursed house  near to the porch and near to where he stood was a tree whose branches waved before the old baywindow of the brides chamber where it had been done  the tree swung suddenly and made him start  it swung again although the night was still looking up into it he saw a figure among the branches  it was the figure of a young man  the face looked down as his looked up the branches cracked and swayed the figure rapidly descended and slid upon its feet before him  a slender youth of about her age with long light brown hair  what thief are you he said seizing the youth by the collar  the young man in shaking himself free swung him a blow with his arm across the face and throat  they closed but the young man got from him and stepped back crying with great eagerness and horror dont touch me  i would as lieve be touched by the devil  he stood still with his billhook in his hand looking at the young man  for the young mans look was the counterpart of her last look and he had not expected ever to see that again  i am no thief  even if i were i would not have a coin of your wealth if it would buy me the indies  you murderer  what  i climbed it said the young man pointing up into the tree for the first time nigh four years ago  i climbed it to look at her  i saw her  i spoke to her  i have climbed it many a time to watch and listen for her  i was a boy hidden among its leaves when from that baywindow she gave me this  he showed a tress of flaxen hair tied with a mourning ribbon  her life said the young man was a life of mourning  she gave me this as a token of it and a sign that she was dead to every one but you  if i had been older if i had seen her sooner i might have saved her from you  but she was fast in the web when i first climbed the tree and what could i do then to break it  in saying those words he burst into a fit of sobbing and crying weakly at first then passionately  murderer  i climbed the tree on the night when you brought her back  i heard her from the tree speak of the deathwatch at the door  i was three times in the tree while you were shut up with her slowly killing her  i saw her from the tree lie dead upon her bed  i have watched you from the tree for proofs and traces of your guilt  the manner of it is a mystery to me yet but i will pursue you until you have rendered up your life to the hangman  you shall never until then be rid of me  i loved her i can know no relenting towards you  murderer i loved her  the youth was bareheaded his hat having fluttered away in his descent from the tree  he moved towards the gate  he had to pass himto get to it  there was breadth for two oldfashioned carriages abreast and the youths abhorrence openly expressed in every feature of his face and limb of his body and very hard to bear had verge enough to keep itself at a distance in  he by which i mean the other had not stirred hand or foot since he had stood still to look at the boy  he faced round now to follow him with his eyes  as the back of the bare lightbrown head was turned to him he saw a red curve stretch from his hand to it  he knew before he threw the billhook where it had alightedi say had alighted and not would alight for to his clear perception the thing was done before he did it  it cleft the head and it remained there and the boy lay on his face  he buried the body in the night at the foot of the tree  as soon as it was light in the morning he worked at turning up all the ground near the tree and hacking and hewing at the neighbouring bushes and undergrowth  when the labourers came there was nothing suspicious and nothing suspected  but he had in a moment defeated all his precautions and destroyed the triumph of the scheme he had so long concerted and so successfully worked out  he had got rid of the bride and had acquired her fortune without endangering his life but now for a death by which he had gained nothing he had evermore to live with a rope around his neck  beyond this he was chained to the house of gloom and horror which he could not endure  being afraid to sell it or to quit it lest discovery should be made he was forced to live in it  he hired two old people man and wife for his servants and dwelt in it and dreaded it  his great difficulty for a long time was the garden  whether he should keep it trim whether he should suffer it to fall into its former state of neglect what would be the least likely way of attracting attention to it  he took the middle course of gardening himself in his evening leisure and of then calling the old servingman to help him but of never letting him work there alone  and he made himself an arbour over against the tree where he could sit and see that it was safe  as the seasons changed and the tree changed his mind perceived dangers that were always changing  in the leafy time he perceived that the upper boughs were growing into the form of the young man that they made the shape of him exactly sitting in a forked branch swinging in the wind  in the time of the falling leaves he perceived that they came down from the tree forming telltale letters on the path or that they had a tendency to heap themselves into a churchyard mound above the grave  in the winter when the tree was bare he perceived that the boughs swung at him the ghost of the blow the young man had given and that they threatened him openly  in the spring when the sap was mounting in the trunk he asked himself were the driedup particles of blood mounting with it  to make out more obviously this year than last the leaf screened figure of the young man swinging in the wind  however he turned his money over and over and still over  he was in the dark trade the golddust trade and most secret trades that yielded great returns  in ten years he had turned his money over so many times that the traders and shippers who had dealings with him absolutely did not liefor oncewhen they declared that he had increased his fortune twelve hundred per cent  he possessed his riches one hundred years ago when people could be lost easily  he had heard who the youth was from hearing of the search that was made after him but it died away and the youth was forgotten  the annual round of changes in the tree had been repeated ten times since the night of the burial at its foot when there was a great thunderstorm over this place  it broke at midnight and roared until morning  the first intelligence he heard from his old servingman that morning was that the tree had been struck by lightning  it had been riven down the stem in a very surprising manner and the stem lay in two blighted shafts  one resting against the house and one against a portion of the old red gardenwall in which its fall had made a gap  the fissure went down the tree to a little above the earth and there stopped  there was great curiosity to see the tree and with most of his former fears revived he sat in his arbourgrown quite an old manwatching the people who came to see it  they quickly began to come in such dangerous numbers that he closed his gardengate and refused to admit any more  but there were certain men of science who travelled from a distance to examine the tree and in an evil hour he let them inblight and murrain on them let them in  they wanted to dig up the ruin by the roots and closely examine it and the earth about it  never while he lived  they offered money for it  they  men of science whom he could have bought by the gross with a scratch of his pen  he showed them the garden gate again and locked and barred it  but they were bent on doing what they wanted to do and they bribed the old servingmana thankless wretch who regularly complained when he received his wages of being underpaidand they stole into the garden by night with their lanterns picks and shovels and fell to at the tree  he was lying in a turretroom on the other side of the house the brides chamber had been unoccupied ever since but he soon dreamed of picks and shovels and got up  he came to an upper window on that side whence he could see their lanterns and them and the loose earth in a heap which he had himself disturbed and put back when it was last turned to the air it was found  they had that minute lighted on it  they were all bending over it  one of them said the skull is fractured and another see here the bones and another see here the clothes and then the first struck in again and said a rusty billhook  he became sensible next day that he was already put under a strict watch and that he could go nowhere without being followed before a week was out he was taken and laid in hold  the circumstances were gradually pieced together against him with a desperate malignity and an appalling ingenuity  but see the justice of men and how it was extended to him  he was further accused of having poisoned that girl in the brides chamber  he who had carefully and expressly avoided imperilling a hair of his head for her and who had seen her die of her own incapacity  there was doubt for which of the two murders he should be first tried but the real one was chosen and he was found guilty and cast for death  bloodthirsty wretches  they would have made him guilty of anything so set they were upon having his life  his money could do nothing to save him and he was hanged  i am he and i was hanged at lancaster castle with my face to the wall a hundred years ago   at this terrific announcement mr goodchild tried to rise and cry out  but the two fiery lines extending from the old mans eyes to his own kept him down and he could not utter a sound  his sense of hearing however was acute and he could hear the clock strike two  no sooner had he heard the clock strike two than he saw before him two old men  two  the eyes of each connected with his eyes by two films of fire each exactly like the other  each addressing him at precisely one and the same instant  each gnashing the same teeth in the same head with the same twitched nostril above them and the same suffused expression around it  two old men  differing in nothing equally distinct to the sight the copy no fainter than the original the second as real as the first  at what time said the two old men did you arrive at the door below  at six  and there were six old men upon the stairs  mr goodchild having wiped the perspiration from his brow or tried to do it the two old men proceeded in one voice and in the singular number  i had been anatomised but had not yet had my skeleton put together and rehung on an iron hook when it began to be whispered that the brides chamber was haunted  it was haunted and i was there  we were there  she and i were there  i in the chair upon the hearth she a white wreck again trailing itself towards me on the floor  but i was the speaker no more and the one word that she said to me from midnight until dawn was live  the youth was there likewise  in the tree outside the window coming and going in the moonlight as the tree bent and gave  he has ever since been there peeping in at me in my torment revealing to me by snatches in the pale lights and slatey shadows where he comes and goes bareheadeda billhook standing edgewise in his hair  in the brides chamber every night from midnight until dawnone month in the year excepted as i am going to tell youhe hides in the tree and she comes towards me on the floor always approaching never coming nearer always visible as if by moon light whether the moon shines or no always saying from midnight until dawn her one word live  but in the month wherein i was forced out of this lifethis present month of thirty daysthe brides chamber is empty and quiet  not so my old dungeon  not so the rooms where i was restless and afraid ten years  both are fitfully haunted then at one in the morning  i am what you saw me when the clock struck that hourone old man  at two in the morning i am two old men at three i am three  by twelve at noon i am twelve old men one for every hundred per cent of old gain  every one of the twelve with twelve times my old power of suffering and agony  from that hour until twelve at night i twelve old men in anguish and fearful foreboding wait for the coming of the executioner  at twelve at night i twelve old men turned off swing invisible outside lancaster castle with twelve faces to the wall  when the brides chamber was first haunted it was known to me that this punishment would never cease until i could make its nature and my story known to two living men together  i waited for the coming of two living men together into the brides chamber years upon years  it was infused into my knowledge of the means i am ignorant that if two living men with their eyes open could be in the brides chamber at one in the morning they would see me sitting in my chair  at length the whispers that the room was spiritually troubled brought two men to try the adventure  i was scarcely struck upon the hearth at midnight i come there as if the lightning blasted me into being when i heard them ascending the stairs  next i saw them enter  one of them was a bold gay active man in the prime of life some five and forty years of age the other a dozen years younger  they brought provisions with them in a basket and bottles  a young woman accompanied them with wood and coals for the lighting of the fire  when she had lighted it the bold gay active man accompanied her along the gallery outside the room to see her safely down the staircase and came back laughing  he locked the door examined the chamber put out the contents of the basket on the table before the firelittle recking of me in my appointed station on the hearth close to himand filled the glasses and ate and drank  his companion did the same and was as cheerful and confident as he  though he was the leader  when they had supped they laid pistols on the table turned to the fire and began to smoke their pipes of foreign make  they had travelled together and had been much together and had an abundance of subjects in common  in the midst of their talking and laughing the younger man made a reference to the leaders being always ready for any adventure that one or any other  he replied in these words  not quite so dick if i am afraid of nothing else i am afraid of myself  his companion seeming to grow a little dull asked him in what sense  how  why thus he returned  here is a ghost to be disproved well  i cannot answer for what my fancy might do if i were alone here or what tricks my senses might play with me if they had me to themselves  but in company with another man and especially with dick i would consent to outface all the ghosts that were ever of in the universe  i had not the vanity to suppose that i was of so much importance tonight said the other  of so much rejoined the leader more seriously than he had spoken yet that i would for the reason i have given on no account have undertaken to pass the night here alone  it was within a few minutes of one  the head of the younger man had drooped when he made his last remark and it drooped lower now  keep awake dick said the leader gaily  the small hours are the worst  he tried but his head drooped again  dick urged the leader  keep awake  i cant he indistinctly muttered  i dont know what strange influence is stealing over me  i cant  his companion looked at him with a sudden horror and i in my different way felt a new horror also for it was on the stroke of one and i felt that the second watcher was yielding to me and that the curse was upon me that i must send him to sleep  get up and walk dick cried the leader  try  it was in vain to go behind the slumbers chair and shake him one oclock sounded and i was present to the elder man and he stood transfixed before me  to him alone i was obliged to relate my story without hope of benefit  to him alone i was an awful phantom making a quite useless confession  i foresee it will ever be the same  the two living men together will never come to release me  when i appear the senses of one of the two will be locked in sleep he will neither see nor hear me my communication will ever be made to a solitary listener and will ever be unserviceable  woe  woe woe  as the two old men with these words wrung their hands it shot into mr goodchilds mind that he was in the terrible situation of being virtually alone with the spectre and that mr idles immoveability was explained by his having been charmed asleep at one oclock  in the terror of this sudden discovery which produced an indescribable dread he struggled so hard to get free from the four fiery threads that he snapped them after he had pulled them out to a great width  being then out of bonds he caught up mr idle from the sofa and rushed downstairs with him   what are you about francis demanded mr idle  my bedroom is not down here  what the deuce are you carrying me at all for  i can walk with a stick now  i dont want to be carried  put me down  mr goodchild put him down in the old hall and looked about him wildly  what are you doing  idiotically plunging at your own sex and rescuing them or perishing in the attempt asked mr idle in a highly petulant state  the one old man cried mr goodchild distractedlyand the two old men  mr idle deigned no other reply than the one old woman i think you mean as he began hobbling his way back up the staircase with the assistance of its broad balustrade  i assure you tom began mr goodchild attending at his side that since you fell asleep  come i like that said thomas idle i havent closed an eye  with the peculiar sensitiveness on the subject of the disgraceful action of going to sleep out of bed which is the lot of all mankind mr idle persisted in this declaration  the same peculiar sensitiveness impelled mr goodchild on being taxed with the same crime to repudiate it with honourable resentment  the settlement of the question of the one old man and the two old men was thus presently complicated and soon made quite impracticable  mr idle said it was all bridecake and fragments newly arranged of things seen and thought about in the day  mr goodchild said how could that be when he hadnt been asleep and what right could mr idle have to say so who had been asleep  mr idle said he had never been asleep and never did go to sleep and that mr goodchild as a general rule was always asleep  they consequently parted for the rest of the night at their bedroom doors a little ruffled  mr goodchilds last words were that he had had in that real and tangible old sittingroom of that real and tangible old inn he supposed mr idle denied its existence every sensation and experience the present record of which is now within a line or two of completion and that he would write it out and print it every word  mr idle returned that he might if he likedand he did like and has now done it    chapter v    two of the many passengers by a certain late sunday evening train mr thomas idle and mr francis goodchild yielded up their tickets at a little rotten platform converted into artificial touchwood by smoke and ashes deep in the manufacturing bosom of yorkshire  a mysterious bosom it appeared upon a damp dark sunday night dashed through in the train to the music of the whirling wheels the panting of the engine and the partsinging of hundreds of thirdclass excursionists whose vocal efforts bobbed arayound from sacred to profane from hymns to our transatlantic sisters the yankee gal and mairy anne in a remarkable way  there seemed to have been some large vocal gathering near to every lonely station on the line  no town was visible no village was visible no light was visible but a multitude got out singing and a multitude got in singing and the second multitude took up the hymns and adopted our transatlantic sisters and sang of their own egregious wickedness and of their bobbing arayound and of how the ship it was ready and the wind it was fair and they were bayound for the sea mairy anne until they in their turn became a getting out multitude and were replaced by another gettingin multitude who did the same  and at every station the gettingin multitude with an artistic reference to the completeness of their chorus incessantly cried as with one voice while scuffling into the carriages we mun aa gang toogither  the singing and the multitudes had trailed off as the lonely places were left and the great towns were neared and the way had lain as silently as a trains way ever can over the vague black streets of the great gulfs of towns and among their branchless woods of vague black chimneys  these towns looked in the cinderous wet as though they had one and all been on fire and were just put outa dreary and quenched panorama many miles long  thus thomas and francis got to leeds of which enterprising and important commercial centre it may be observed with delicacy that you must either like it very much or not at all  next day the first of the raceweek they took train to doncaster  and instantly the character both of travellers and of luggage entirely changed and no other business than racebusiness any longer existed on the face of the earth  the talk was all of horses and john scott  guards whispered behind their hands to stationmasters of horses and john scott  men in cutaway coats and speckled cravats fastened with peculiar pins and with the large bones of their legs developed under tight trousers so that they should look as much as possible like horses legs paced up and down by twos at junctionstations speaking low and moodily of horses and john scott

present blessed race week and all of them making up their bettingbooks in the lamp room or somewhere else and none of them to come and touch the luggage  travellers disgorged into an open space a

and not grand but all at grand prices ranging from ten pounds to twenty for the grand raceweek  rendered giddy enough by these things messieurs idle and goodchild repaired to the quarters they had secured beforehand and mr goodchild looked down from the window into the surging street  by heaven tom cried he after contemplating it i am in the lunatic asylum again and these are all mad people under the charge of a body of designing keepers  all through the raceweek mr goodchild never divested himself of this idea  every day he looked out of window with something of the dread of lemuel gulliver looking down at men after he returned home from the horsecountry and every day he saw the lunatics horsemad bettingmad drunkenmad vicemad and the designing keepers always after them  the idea pervaded like the second colour in shotsilk the whole of mr goodchilds impressions they were much as follows  monday midday  races not to begin until tomorrow but all the moblunatics out crowding the pavements of the one main street of pretty and pleasant doncaster crowding the road particularly crowding the outside of the betting rooms whooping and shouting loudly after all passing vehicles  frightened lunatic horses occasionally running away with infinite clatter  all degrees of men from peers to paupers betting incessantly  keepers very watchful and taking all good chances  an awful family likeness among the keepers to mr palmer and mr thurtell  with some knowledge of expression and some acquaintance with heads thus writes mr goodchild i never have seen anywhere so many repetitions of one class of countenance and one character of head both evil as in this street at this time  cunning covetousness secrecy cold calculation hard callousness and dire insensibility are the uniform keeper characteristics  mr palmer passes me five times in five minutes and so i go down the street the back of mr thurtells skull is always going on before me  monday evening  town lighted up more lunatics out than ever a complete choke and stoppage of the thoroughfare outside the betting rooms  keepers having dined pervade the betting rooms and sharply snap at the moneyed lunatics  some keepers flushed with drink and some not but all close and calculating  a vague echoing roar of tharses and traces always rising in the air until midnight at about which period it dies away in occasional drunken songs and straggling yells  but all night some unmannerly drinkinghouse in the neighbourhood opens its mouth at intervals and spits out a man too drunk to be retained  who thereupon makes what uproarious protest may be left in him and either falls asleep where he tumbles or is carried off in custody  tuesday morning at daybreak  a sudden rising as it were out of the earth of all the obscene creatures who sell correct cards of the races  they may have been coiled in corners or sleeping on doorsteps and having all passed the night under the same set of circumstances may all want to circulate their blood at the same time but however that may be they spring into existence all at once and together as though a new cadmus had sown a racehorses teeth  there is nobody up to buy the cards but the cards are madly cried  there is no patronage to quarrel for but they madly quarrel and fight  conspicuous among these hyaenas as breakfast time discloses is a fearful creature in the general semblance of a man  shaken off his nexttono legs by drink and devilry bare headed and barefooted with a great shock of hair like a horrible broom and nothing on him but a ragged pair of trousers and a pink glazedcalico coatmade on himso very tight that it is as evident that he could never take it off as that he never does this hideous apparition inconceivably drunk has a terrible power of making a gonglike imitation of the braying of an ass  which feat requires that he should lay his right jaw in his begrimed right paw double himself up and shake his bray out of himself with

streets and there is no one left in them but francis goodchild  francis goodchild will not be left in them long for he too is on his way traces  a most beautiful sight francis goodchild finds traces to be when he has left fair doncaster behind him and comes out on the free course with its agreeable prospect its quaint red house oddly changing and turning as francis turns its green grass and fresh heath  a free course and an easy one where francis can roll smoothly where he will and can choose between the start or the comingin or the turn behind the brow of the hill or any outof theway point where he lists to see the throbbing horses straining every nerve and making the sympathetic earth throb as they come by  francis much delights to be not in the grand stand but where he can see it rising against the sky with its vast tiers of little white dots of faces and its last high rows and corners of people looking like pins stuck into an enormous pincushionnot quite so symmetrically as his orderly eye could wish when people change or go away  when the race is nearly run out it is as good as the race to him to see the flutter among the pins and the change in them from dark to light as hats are taken off and waved  not less full of interest the loud anticipation of the winners name the swelling and the final roar then the quick dropping of all the pins out of their places the revelation of the shape of the bare pincushion and the closingin of the whole host of lunatics and keepers in the rear of the three horses with brightcoloured riders who have not yet quite subdued their gallop though the contest is over  mr goodchild would appear to have been by no means free from lunacy himself at traces though not of the prevalent kind  he is suspected by mr idle to have fallen into a dreadful state concerning a pair of little lilac gloves and a little bonnet that he saw there  mr idle asserts that he did afterwards repeat at the angel with an appearance of being lunatically seized some rhapsody to the following effect  o little lilac gloves  and o winning little bonnet making in conjunction with her golden hair quite a glory in the sunlight round the pretty head why anything in the world but you and me  why may not this days runningof horses to all the rest  of precious sands of life to mebe prolonged through an everlasting autumnsunshine without a

drinkinghouse expectoration gongdonkey and correct cards symptoms of yesterdays gains in the way of drink and of yesterdays losses in the way of money abundant  moneylosses very great  as usual nobody seems to have won but large losses and many losers are unquestionable facts  both lunatics and keepers in general very low  several of both kinds look in at the chemists while mr goodchild is making a purchase there to be picked up  one redeyed lunatic flushed faded and disordered enters hurriedly and cries savagely hond us a gloss of sal volatile in wather or soom dommed thing o thot sart  faces at the betting rooms very long and a tendency to bite nails observable  keepers likewise given this morning to standing about solitary with their hands in their pockets looking down at their boots as they fit them into cracks of the pavement and then looking up whistling and walking away  grand alliance circus out in procession buxom ladymember of grand alliance in crimson ridinghabit fresher to look at even in her paint under the day sky than the cheeks of lunatics or keepers  spanish cavalier appears to have lost yesterday and jingles his bossed bridle with disgust as if he were paying  reaction also apparent at the guildhall opposite whence certain pickpockets come out handcuffed together with that peculiar walk which is never seen under any other circumstancesa walk expressive of going to jail game but still of jails being in bad taste and arbitrary and how would you like it if it was you instead of me as it ought to be  midday town filled as yesterday but not so full and emptied as yesterday but not so empty  in the evening angel ordinary where every lunatic and keeper has his modest daily meal of turtle venison and wine not so crowded as yesterday and not so noisy at night the theatre  more abstracted faces in it than one ever sees at public assemblies such faces wearing an expression which strongly reminds mr goodchild of the boys at school who were going up next with their arithmetic or mathematics  these boys are no doubt going up tomorrow with their sums and figures  mr palmer and mr thurtell in the boxes o p  mr thurtell and mr palmer in the boxes p s  the firm of thurtell palmer and thurtell in the boxes centre  a most odious tendency observable in these distinguished gentlemen to put vile constructions on sufficiently innocent phrases in the play and then to applaud them in a satyrlike manner  behind mr goodchild with a party of other lunatics and one keeper the express incarnation of the thing called a gent  a gentleman born a gent manufactured  a something with a scarf round its neck and a slipshod speech issuing from behind the scarf more depraved more foolish more ignorant more unable to believe in any noble or good thing of any kind than the stupidest bosjesman  the thing is but a boy in years and is addled with drink  to do its company justice even its company is ashamed of it as it drawls its slang criticisms on the representation and inflames mr goodchild with a burning ardour to fling it into the pit  its remarks are so horrible that mr goodchild for the moment even doubts whether that is a wholesome art which sets women apart on a high floor before such a thing as this though as good as its own sisters or its own motherwhom heaven forgive for bringing it into the world  but the consideration that a low nature must make a low world of its own to live in whatever the real materials or it could no more exist than any of us could without the sense of touch brings mr goodchild to reason  the rather because the thing soon drops its downy chin upon its scarf and slobbers itself asleep  friday morning  early fights  gongdonkey and correct cards again a great set towards the races though not so great a set as on wednesday  much packing going on too upstairs at the gun smiths the waxchandlers and the serious stationers for there will be a heavy drift of lunatics and keepers to london by the afternoon train  the course as pretty as ever the great pincushion as like a pincushion but not nearly so full of pins whole rows of pins wanting  on the great event of the day both lunatics and keepers become inspired with rage and there is a violent scuffling and a rushing at the losing jockey and an emergence of the said jockey from a swaying and menacing crowd protected by friends and looking the worse for wear which is a rough proceeding though animating to see from a pleasant distance after the great event rills begin to flow from the pincushion towards the railroad the rills swell into rivers the rivers soon unite into a lake  the lake floats mr goodchild into doncaster past the itinerant personage in black by the wayside telling him from the vantage ground of a legibly printed placard on a pole that for all these things the lord will bring him to judgment  no turtle and venison ordinary this evening that is all over  no betting at the rooms nothing there but the plants in pots which have all the week been stood about the entry to give it an innocent appearance and which have sorely sickened by this time  saturday  mr idle wishes to know at breakfast what were those dreadful groanings in his bedroom doorway in the night  mr goodchild answers nightmare  mr idle repels the calumny and calls the waiter  the angel is very sorryhad intended to explain but you see gentlemen there was a gentleman dined down stairs with two more and he had lost a deal of money and he would drink a deal of wine and in the night he took the horrors and got up and as his friends could do nothing with him he laid himself down and groaned at mr idles door  and he did groan there mr idle says and you will please to imagine me inside taking the horrors too   so far the picture of doncaster on the occasion of its great sporting anniversary offers probably a general representation of the social condition of the town in the past as well as in the present time  the sole local phenomenon of the current year which may be considered as entirely unprecedented in its way and which certainly claims on that account some slight share of notice consists in the actual existence of one remarkable individual who is sojourning in doncaster and who neither directly nor indirectly has anything at all to do in any capacity whatever with the racing amusements of the week  ranging throughout the entire crowd that fills the town and including the inhabitants as well as the visitors nobody is to be found altogether disconnected with the business of the day excepting this one unparalleled man he does not bet on the races like the sporting men  he does not assist the races like the jockeys starters judges and grooms he does not look on at the races like mr goodchild and his fellowspectators  he does not profit by the races like the hotelkeepers and the tradespeople  he does not minister to the necessities of the races like the boothkeepers the postilions the waiters and the hawkers of lists  he does not assist the attractions of the races like the actors at the theatre the riders at the circus or the posturers at the poses plastiques absolutely and literally he is the only individual in doncaster who stands by the brink of the fullflowing racestream and is not swept away by it in common with all the rest of his species  who is this modern hermit this recluse of the st legerweek this inscrutably ungregarious being who lives apart from the amusements and activities of his fellowcreatures  surely there is little difficulty in guessing that clearest and easiest of all riddles who could he be but mr thomas idle  thomas had suffered himself to be taken to doncaster just as he would have suffered himself to be taken to any other place in the habitable globe which would guarantee him the temporary possession of a comfortable sofa to rest his ankle on  once established at the hotel with his leg on one cushion and his back against another he formally declined taking the slightest interest in any circumstance whatever connected with the races or with the people who were assembled to see them  francis goodchild anxious that the hours should pass by his crippled travellingcompanion as lightly as possible suggested that his sofa should be moved to the window and that he should amuse himself by looking out at the moving panorama of humanity which the view from it of the principal street presented  thomas however steadily declined profiting by the suggestion  the farther i am from the window he said the better brother francis i shall be pleased  i have nothing in common with the one prevalent idea of all those people who are passing in the street why should i care to look at them  i hope i have nothing in common with the prevalent idea of a great many of them either answered goodchild thinking of the sporting gentlemen whom he had met in the course of his wanderings about doncaster  but surely among all the people who are walking by the house at this very moment you may find  not one living creature interposed thomas who is not in one way or another interested in horses and who is not in a greater or less degree an admirer of them  now i hold opinions in reference to these particular members of the quadruped creation which may lay claim as i believe to the disastrous distinction of being unpartaken by any other human being civilised or savage over the whole surface of the earth  taking the horse as an animal in the abstract francis i cordially despise him from every point of view  thomas said goodchild confinement to the house has begun to affect your biliary secretions  i shall go to the chemists and get you some physic  i object continued thomas quietly possessing himself of his friends hat which stood on a table near himi object first to the personal appearance of the horse  i protest against the conventional idea of beauty as attached to that animal  i think his nose too long his forehead too low and his legs except in the case of the carthorse ridiculously thin by comparison with the size of his body  again considering how big an animal he is i object to the contemptible delicacy of his constitution  is he not the sickliest creature in creation  does any child catch cold as easily as a horse  does he not sprain his fetlock for all his appearance of superior strength as easily as i sprained my ankle furthermore to take him from another point of view what a helpless wretch he is  no fine lady requires more constant waitingon than a horse  other animals can make their own toilette  he must have a groom  you will tell me that this is because we want to make his coat artificially glossy  glossy come home with me and see my catmy clever cat who can groom herself  look at your own dog see how the intelligent creature currycombs himself with his own honest teeth  then again what a fool the horse is what a poor nervous fool  he will start at a piece of white paper in the road as if it was a lion  his one idea when he hears a noise that he is not accustomed to is to run away from it  what do you say to those two common instances of the sense and courage of this absurdly overpraised animal  i might multiply them to two hundred if i chose to exert my mind and waste my breath which i never do  i prefer coming at once to my last charge against the horse which is the most serious of all because it affects his moral character  i accuse him boldly in his capacity of servant to man of slyness and treachery  i brand him publicly no matter how mild he may look about the eyes or how sleek he may be about the coat as a systematic betrayer whenever he can get the chance of the confidence reposed in him  what do you mean by laughing and shaking your head at me  oh thomas thomas said goodchild  you had better give me my hat you had better let me get you that physic  i will let you get anything you like including a composing draught for yourself said thomas irritably alluding to his fellowapprentices inexhaustible activity if you will only sit quiet for five minutes longer and hear me out  i say again the horse is a betrayer of the confidence reposed in him and that opinion let me add is drawn from my own personal experience and is not based on any fanciful theory whatever  you shall have two instances two overwhelming instances  let me start the first of these by asking what is the distinguishing quality which the shetland pony has arrogated to himself and is still perpetually trumpeting through the world by means of popular report and books on natural history  i see the answer in your face  it is the quality of being surefooted  he professes to have other virtues such as hardiness and strength which you may discover on trial but the one thing which he insists on your believing when you get on his back is that he may be safely depended on not to tumble down with you  very good  some years ago i was in shetland with a party of friends  they insisted on taking me with them to the top of a precipice that overhung the sea  it was a great distance off but they all determined to walk to it except me  i was wiser then than i was with you at carrock and i determined to be carried to the precipice  there was no carriageroad in the island and nobody offered in consequence as i suppose of the imperfectly civilised state of the country to bring me a sedanchair which is naturally what i should have liked best  a shetland pony was produced instead  i remembered my natural history i recalled popular report and i got on the little beasts back as any other man would have done in my position placing implicit confidence in the sureness of his feet  and how did he repay that confidence brother francis carry your mind on from morning to noon  picture to yourself a howling wilderness of grass and bog bounded by low stony hills  pick out one particular spot in that imaginary scene and sketch me in it with outstretched arms curved back and heels in the air plunging headforemost into a black patch of water and mud  place just behind me the legs the body and the head of a surefooted shetland pony all stretched flat on the ground and you will have produced an accurate representation of a very lamentable fact  and the moral device francis of this picture will be to testify that when gentlemen put confidence in the legs of shetland ponies they will find to their cost that they are leaning on nothing but broken reeds  there is my first instance and what have you got to say to that  nothing but that i want my hat answered goodchild starting up and walking restlessly about the room  you shall have it in a minute rejoined thomas  my second instancegoodchild groaned and sat down againmy second instance is more appropriate to the present time and place for it refers to a racehorse  two years ago an excellent friend of mine who was desirous of prevailing on me to take regular exercise and who was well enough acquainted with the weakness of my legs to expect no very active compliance with his wishes on their part offered to make me a present of one of his horses  hearing that the animal in question had started in life on the turf i declined accepting the gift with many thanks adding by way of explanation that i looked on a racehorse as a kind of embodied hurricane upon which no sane man of my character and habits could be expected to seat himself  my friend replied that however appropriate my metaphor might be as applied to racehorses in general it was singularly unsuitable as applied to the particular horse which he proposed to give me  from a foal upwards this remarkable animal had been the idlest and most sluggish of his race  whatever capacities for speed he might possess he had kept so strictly to himself that no amount of training had ever brought them out  he had been found hopelessly slow as a racer and hopelessly lazy as a hunter and was fit for nothing but a quiet easy life of it with an old gentleman or an invalid  when i heard this account of the horse i dont mind confessing that my heart warmed to him visions of thomas idle ambling serenely on the back of a steed as lazy as himself presenting to a restless world the soothing and composite spectacle of a kind of sluggardly centaur too peaceable in his habits to alarm anybody swam attractively before my eyes i went to look at the horse in the stable  nice fellow he was fast asleep with a kitten on his back  i saw him taken out for an airing by the groom  if he had had trousers on his legs i should not have known them from my own so deliberately were they lifted up so gently were they put down so slowly did they get over the ground  from that moment i gratefully accepted my friends offer i went home the horse followed meby a slow train  oh francis how devoutly i believed in that horse i how carefully i looked after all his little comforts  i had never gone the length of hiring a manservant to wait on myself but i went to the expense of hiring one to wait upon him  if i thought a little of myself when i bought the softest saddle that could be had for money i thought also of my horse  when the man at the shop afterwards offered me spurs and a whip i turned from him with horror  when i sallied out for my first ride i went purposely unarmed with the means of hurrying my steed  he proceeded at his own pace every step of the way and when he stopped at last and blew out both his sides with a heavy sigh and turned his sleepy head and looked behind him i took him home again as i might take home an artless child who said to me if you please sir i am tired  for a week this complete harmony between me and my horse lasted undisturbed at the end of that time when he had made quite sure of my friendly confidence in his laziness when he had thoroughly acquainted himself with all the little weaknesses of my seat and their name is legion the smouldering treachery and ingratitude of the equine nature blazed out in an instant  without the slightest provocation from me with nothing passing him at the time but a ponychaise driven by an old lady he started in one instant from a state of sluggish depression to a state of frantic high spirits  he kicked he plunged he shied he pranced he capered fearfully  i sat on him as long as i could and when i could sit no longer i fell off no francis this is not a circumstance to be laughed at but to be wept over  what would be said of a man who had requited my kindness in that way  range over all the rest of the animal creation and where will you find me an instance of treachery so black as this  the cow that kicks down the milkingpail may have some reason for it she may think herself taxed too heavily to contribute to the dilution of human tea and the greasing of human bread  the tiger who springs out on me unawares has the excuse of being hungry at the time to say nothing of the further justification of being a total stranger to me  the very flea who surprises me in my sleep may defend his act of assassination on the ground that i in my turn am always ready to murder him when i am awake  i defy the whole body of natural historians to move me logically off the ground that i have taken in regard to the horse receive back your hat brother francis and go to the chemists if you please for i have now done  ask me to take anything you like except an interest in the doncaster races  ask me to look at anything you like except an assemblage of people all animated by feelings of a friendly and admiring nature towards the horse  you are a remarkably wellinformed man and you have heard of hermits look upon me as a member of that ancient fraternity and you will sensibly add to the many obligations which thomas idle is proud to owe to francis goodchild  here fatigued by the effort of excessive talking disputatious thomas waved one hand languidly laid his head back on the sofa pillow and calmly closed his eyes  at a later period mr goodchild assailed his travelling companion boldly from the impregnable fortress of common sense  but thomas though tamed in body by drastic discipline was still as mentally unapproachable as ever on the subject of his favourite delusion   the view from the window after saturdays breakfast is altogether changed  the tradesmens families have all come back again  the serious stationers young woman of all work is shaking a duster out of the window of the combination breakfastroom a child is playing with a doll where mr thurtells hair was brushed a sanitary scrubbing is in progress on the spot where mr palmers braces were put on  no signs of the races are in the streets but the tramps and the tumbledowncarts and trucks laden with drinkingforms and tables and remnants of booths that are making their way out of the town as fast as they can  the angel which has been cleared for action all the week already begins restoring every neat and comfortable article of furniture to its own neat and comfortable place  the angels daughters pleasanter angels mr idle and mr goodchild never saw nor more quietly expert in their business nor more superior to the common vice of being above it have a little time to rest and to air their cheerful faces among the flowers in the yard  it is marketday  the market looks unusually natural comfortable and wholesome the marketpeople too  the town seems quite restored when hark a metallic braythe gongdonkey  the wretched animal has not cleared off with the rest but is here under the window  how much more inconceivably drunk now how much more begrimed of paw how much more tight of calico hide how much more stained and daubed and dirty and dunghilly from his horrible broom to his tender toes who shall say  he cannot even shake the bray out of himself now without laying his cheek so near to the mud of the street that he pitches over after delivering it  now prone in the mud and now backing himself up against shopwindows the owners of which come out in terror to remove him now in the drinkingshop and now in the tobacconists where he goes to buy tobacco and makes his way into the parlour and where he gets a cigar which in halfaminute he forgets to smoke now dancing now dozing now cursing and now complimenting my lord the colonel the noble captain and your honourable worship the gongdonkey kicks up his heels occasionally braying until suddenly he beholds the dearest friend he has in the world coming down the street  the dearest friend the gongdonkey has in the world is a sort of jackall in a dull mangy black hide of such small pieces that it looks as if it were made of blacking bottles turned inside out and cobbled together  the dearest friend in the world inconceivably drunk too advances at the gongdonkey with a hand on each thigh in a series of humorous springs and stops wagging his head as he comes  the gongdonkey regarding him with attention and with the warmest affection suddenly perceives that he is the greatest enemy he has in the world and hits him hard in the countenance  the astonished jackall closes with the donkey and they roll over and over in the mud pummelling one another  a police inspector supernaturally endowed with patience who has long been looking on from the guildhallsteps says to a myrmidon lock em up  bring em in  appropriate finish to the grand raceweek  the gongdonkey captive and last trace of it conveyed into limbo where they cannot do better than keep him until next raceweek  the jackall is wanted too and is much looked for over the way and up and down  but having had the good fortune to be undermost at the time of the capture he has vanished into air  on saturday afternoon mr goodchild walks out and looks at the course  it is quite deserted heaps of broken crockery and bottles are raised to its memory and correct cards and other fragments of paper are blowing about it as the regulation little paperbooks carried by the french soldiers in their breasts were seen soon after the battle was fought blowing idly about the plains of waterloo  where will these present idle leaves be blown by the idle winds and where will the last of them be one day lost and forgotten  an idle question and an idle thought and with it mr idle fitly makes his bow and mr goodchild his and thus ends the lazy tour of two idle apprentices
