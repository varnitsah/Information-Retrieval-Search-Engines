socialists always held his weekly receptions that night his cosmopolitan refugee friends were all at liberty his french disciples could pour in from the little lanes and courts in soho where since the  commune they had plied their peaceful trades as engravers pictureframers artistscolourmen models pointers and so forthfor most of them were hangerson in one way or another of the artistic world his german adherents could stroll round pipe in mouth from their printinghouses their hamandbeef shops or their naturalists chambers where they stuffed birds or set up exotic butterflies in little cabinetsfor most of them were more or less literary or scientific in their pursuits and his few english sympathisers  chiefly dissatisfied philosophical radicals of the upper classes could drop in casually for a chat and a smoke on their way home from the churches to which they had been dutifully escorting their unemancipated wives and sisters max schurz kept open house for all on sunday evenings and there was not a drawingroom in london better filled than his with the very advanced and not undistinguished set who alone had the muchprized entrée of his exclusive salon  the salon itself did not form any component part of max schurzs own private residence in any way the great socialist the man whose mandates shook the thrones of russia and austria whose movements spread terror in paris and berlin whose dictates were even obeyed in kerry and in chicago occupied for his own use two small rooms at the top of a shabby composite tenement in a doubtful district of marylebone the little parlour where he carried on his trade of a microscopelens grinder would not have sufficed to hold onetenth of the eager halfwashed crowd that pressed itself enthusiastically upon him every sunday but a large room on the ground floor of the tenement opening towards the main street was used during the week by one of his french refugee friends as a dancingsaloon and in this room on every sunday evening the uncrowned king of the proletariate  socialists was permitted to hold his royal levees thither all that was best and truest in the socially rebellions classes domiciled in london used to make its way and there men calmly talked over the ultimate chances of social revolutions which would have made the hair of respectable philistine marylebone stand stiffly on end had it only known the rank political heresies that were quietly hatching in its unconscious midst  while max schurzs hall was rapidly filling with the polyglot crowd of democratic solidarists ernest le breton and his brother were waiting in the chilly little drawingroom at epsilon terrrace bayswater for the expected arrival of harry oswald ernest had promised to introduce oswald to max schurzs reception and it was now past eight oclock getting rather a late hour for those simpleminded earlyrising communists im afraid herbert said ernest to his brother he forgets that max is a workingman who has to be at his trade again punctually by seven oclock tomorrow he thinks hes going out to a regular society at home where ten oclocks considered just the beginning of the evening max wont at all like his turning up so late it smells of nonproductivity  if herr schurz wants to convert the world herbert answered chillily rolling himself a tiny cigarette he must convince the unproductive as well as the proletariate before he can set things fairly on the roll for better arrangement  the proletariates all very well in its way no doubt but the unproductive happen to hold the key of the situation one convert like you or me is worth a thousand ignorant eastend labourers with nothing but their hands and their votes to count upon  but you are not a convert herbert  i didnt say i was im a critic theres no necessity to throw oneself openarmed into the embrace of either party the wise man can wait and watch the progress of the game backing the winner for the time being at all the critical moments and hedging if necessary when the chances turn momentarily against the favourite theres a ring at the bell thats oswald lets go down to the door to meet him  ernest ran down the stairs rapidly as was his wont herbert followed in a more leisurely fashion still rolling the cigarette between his delicate finger and thumb  goodness gracious oswald ernest exclaimed as his friend stepped in why youve actually come in evening dress  a white tie and all what on earth will max say hell be perfectly scandalised at such a shocking and unprecedented  outrage this will never do you must dissemble somehow or other  oswald laughed i had no idea he said herr schurz was such a truculent sansculotte as that comes to as it was an evening reception i thought of course one ought to turn up in evening clothes  evening clothes my dear fellow how on earth do you suppose a set of poor leicester square outlaws are going to get themselves correctly set up in black broadcloth coats and trousers they might wash their white ties  themselves to be sure they mostly do their own washing i believe in their own basins and not much at that either put in herbert parenthetically but as to evening clothes why theyd as soon think of arraying themselves for dinner in full court dress as of putting on an obscurantist swallowtail its the badge of a class a distinct aristocratic outrage we must alter it at once i assure you oswald  at any rate said oswald laughing ive had the pleasure of finding myself accused for the first time in the course of my existence of being aristocratic its quite worth while going to max schurzs once in ones life if it were only for the sake of that single new sensation  well my dear fellow we must rectify you anyhow before you go let me see luckily youve got your dustcoat on and you neednt take that off itll do splendidly to hide your coat and waistcoat ill lend you a blue tie which will at once transform your upper man entirely but you show the cloven hoof below the trousers will surely betray you theyre absolutely inadmissible under any circumstances whatsoever as the court circular says and you must positively wear a coloured pair of herberts instead of them run upstairs quickly theres a good fellow and get rid of the mark of the beast as fast as you can  oswald did as he was told without demur and in about a minute more presented himself again with the mark of the beast certainly most effectually obliterated at least so far as outer appearance went his blue tie light dustcoat and borrowed grey trousers made up an ensemble much more like an omnibus conductor out for a holiday than a gentleman  of the period in correct evening dress now mind ernest said seriously as he opened the door whatever you do oswald if you stew to death for itand schurzs rooms are often very close and hot i can assure youdont for heavens sake go and unbutton your dustcoat if you do theyll see at once youre a wolf in sheeps clothing and i shouldnt be at all surprised if they were to turn and rend you at least im sure max would be very much annoyed with me for unsocially introducing a plutocratic traitor into the bosom of the fold  they walked along briskly in the direction of marylebone  and stopped at last at a dull yellowwashed house which bore on its door a very dingy brass plate inscribed in red letters m et mdlle tirard salon de danse ernest opened the door without ringing and turned down the passage towards the salon remember he said turning to harry oswald by way of a last warning with his hand on the inner doorhandle coûte que coûte my dear fellow dont on any account open your dustcoat no antisocial opinions and please bear in mind that max is in his own way a potentate  the big hall badly lighted by a few contribution candles for the whole colony subscribed to the best of its ability for the support of the weekly entertainment was all alive with eager figures and the mingled busy hum of earnest conversation  a few chairs ranged round the wall were mostly occupied by mdlle tirard and the other ladies of the socialist party but the mass of the guests were men and they were almost all smoking in utter indifference to the scanty presence of the fair sex not that they were  intentionally rude or boorish that they never were except where an emperor or an aristocrat is concerned there is no being on earth more courteous kindly and considerate for the feelings of others than your exiled socialist he has suffered much himself in his own time and so miseris  succurrere discit emperors he mentally classes with cobras tarantulas and scorpions as outside the pale of humanitarian sympathies altogether but with this slight political exception he is the broadest and tenderest and most catholic in his feelings of all living breathing creatures however the ladies of his party have all been brought up from their  childhood onward in a mingled atmosphere of smoke and  democracy so that he no more thinks of abstaining from tobacco in their presence than he thinks of commiserating the poor fish for being so dreadfully wet or the unfortunate mole for his unpleasantly slimy diet of live earthworms  herr schurz said ernest singling out the great leader in the gloom immediately ive brought my brother herbert here whom you know already to see you as well as another oxford friend of mind mr harry oswald fellow and lecturer  of oriel hes almost one of us at heart im happy to say and at any rate im sure youll be glad to make his acquaintance  the little spare wizenedup grey man in the threadbare brown velveteen jacket who stood in the middle of the hall caught ernests hand warmly and held it for a moment fettered in his iron grip there was an honesty in that grip and in those hazy bluespectacled eyes that nobody could for a second misunderstand if an emperor had been introduced to max schurz he might have felt a little abashed one minute at the old socialists royal disdain but he could not have failed to say to himself as he looked at him from head to foot here at least is a true man so harry oswald felt as the spare grey thinker took his hand in his and grasped it firmly with a kindly pressure but less friendly than that with which he had greeted his known admirer ernest le breton as for herbert he merely bowed to him politely from a little distance and herbert who had picked up at once with a polish exile in a corner returned the bow frigidly without coming up to the host himself at all for a moments welcome  im always pleased to meet friends of the cause from oxford herr schurz said in almost perfect english we want recruits most of all among the thinking classes if we are ever to make headway against the banded monopoliesagainst the placeholders the landgrabbers the labourtaxers the robbers of the poorwe must first secure the perfect undivided confidence of the brainworkers the thinkers and the writers at present everything is against us we are but a little leaven trying vainly in our helpless fashion to leaven the whole lump the capitalist journals carry off all the writing talent in the world they are timid as capital must always be they tremble for their tens of thousands a year and their vast circulations among the  propertied classes we cannot get at the heart of the people save by the archimedean lever of the thinking world for that reason my dear le breton i am always glad to muster here your oxford neophytes  and yet herr schurz said ernest gently you know we must not after all despair look at the history of your own people when the cause of jehovah seemed most hopeless there were still seven thousand left in israel who had not bowed the knee to baal we are gaining strength every day while they are losing it  ah yes my friend i know that too the old man answered with a solemn shake of the head but the wheels move slowly they move slowlyvery surely but oh so slowly you are young friend ernest and i am growing old you look forward to the future with hope i look back to the past with regret so many years gone so little so very little done it will come it will come as surely as the next glacial period but i shall not live to see it i stand like moses on pisgah i see the promised land before me i look down upon the equally allotted vineyards and the glebe flowing with milk and honey in the distance but i shall not lead you into it i shall not even lead you against the canaanites another than i must lead you in but i am an old man mr oswald an old man now and i am talking all about myselfan antisocial trick we have inherited from our fathers what is your friends special line at oxford did you say ernest  oswald is a mathematician sir said ernest perhaps the greatest mathematician among the younger men in the whole university  ah that is well we want exact science we want clear and definite thinking biologists and physicists and mathematicians those are our best recruits you may depend upon it we need logic not mere gas our french friends and our irish friendsi have nothing in the world to say against them they are useful men ardent men full of fire full of enthusiasm ready to do and dare anythingbut they lack ballast you cant take the kingdom of heaven by storm the social revolution is not to be accomplished by violence it is not even to be carried by the most vivid  eloquence the victory will be in the end to the clearest brain and the subtlest intellect the orthodox political economists are clever sophists they mask and confuse the truth very speciously we must have keen eyes and sharp noses to spy out and scent out their tortuous fallacies im glad youre a mathematician mr oswald and so you have thought on social problems  i have read gold and the proletariate oswald answered modestly and i learned much from it and thought more i wont say you have quite converted me herr schurz but you have given me plenty of food for future reflection  that is well said the old man passing one skinny brown hand gently up and down over the other that is well  theres no hurry dont make up your mind too fast dont jump at conclusions its intellectual dishonesty to do that  wait till you have convinced yourself spell out your  problems slowly they are not easy ones try to see how the present complex system works try to probe its inequalities and injustices try to compare it with the ideal commonwealth  and youll find the light in the end youll find the light  as he spoke herbert le breton lounged up quietly from his farther corner towards the little group ah your brother ernest said max schurz drawing himself up a little more stiffly he has found the light already i believe but he neglects it still he is not with us and he that is not with us is against us you hold aloof always mr herbert is it not so  well not quite aloof herr schurz im certain but not on your side exactly either i like to look on and hold the balance evenly not to throw my own weight too lightly into either stale the objective attitude of the mere spectator is after all the right one for an impartial philosopher to take up  ah mr herbert this philosophy of your oxford contemplative radicals is only another name for a kind of social selfishness i fancy said the old man solemnly it seems to me your head is with us but your heart your heart is elsewhere  herbert le breton played a moment quietly with the roman aureus of domitian on his watchchain then he said slowly in his clear cold voice there may be something in that no doubt herr schurz for each of us has his own game to play and while the world remains unreformed he must play it on his own gambit to a great extent without reference to the independent game of others we all agree that the board is too full of counters and as each counter is not responsible for its own presence and position on the board having been put there without previous consultation by the players we must each do the best we can for ourselves in our own fashion my sympathies as you say are on your side but perhaps my interests lie the other way and after all till you start your millennium we must all rattle along as well as we can in the box together jarring against one another in our old ugly round of competition and supply and demand and survival of the fittest and mutual accommodation  and all the rest of it to the end of the chapter every man for himself and god for us all you know you have the logic to be sure herr schurz but the monopolists have the law and the money  ah yes said the old socialist grimly demas demas he and his silver mine you remember your bunyan dont you well all faiths and systems have their demases the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches hes bursar of his college isnt he ernest i thought so he had the bag and bare what was put therein a dangerous office isnt it mr oswald a very dangerous office you cant touch pitch or property without being defiled  you at least sir said ernest reverentially have kept yourself unspotted from the world  the old man sighed and turned for a moment to speak in french to a tall bigbearded newcomer who advanced to meet him impossible he said quickly i am truly distressed to hear it it is very imprudent very  unnecessary  what is the news asked ernest also in french  the newcomer answered him with a marked south russian accent there has been another attempt on the life of alexander nicolaiovitch  you dont mean to say so cried ernest in surprise  yes i do replied the russian and it has nearly succeeded too  an attempt on whom asked oswald who was new to the peculiar vocabulary of the socialists and not particularly accustomed to following spoken french  on alexander nicolaiovitch answered the redbearded stranger  not the czar oswald inquired of ernest  yes the one whom you call czar said the stranger quickly in tolerable english the confusion of tongues seemed to be treated as a small matter at max schurzs receptions for everybody appeared to speak all languages at once in the true spirit of solidarity as though babel had never been  oswald did not attempt to conceal a slight gesture of horror the tall russian looked down upon him commiseratingly  he is of the few he asked of ernest that being the slang of the initiated for a member of the  aristocratic and capitalist oligarchy  not exactly ernest answered with a smile but he has not entirely learned the way we here regard these penal measures his sympathies are onesided as to alexander no doubt he thinks merely of the hunted wretched life the man bears about with him and he forgets poor bleeding groaning downtrodden longsuffering russia it is the common way of englishmen they do not realise siberia and poland and the third section and all the rest of it they think only of alexander as of the benevolent despot who freed the serf and befriended the bulgarian they never remember that they have all the freedom and privileges themselves which you poor russians ask for in vain they do not bear in mind that he has only to sign his name to a  constitution a very little constitution and he might walk abroad as lighthearted in st petersburg tomorrow as you and i walk in regent street today we are mostly lopsided we english but you must bear with us in our obliquity we have had freedom ourselves so long that we hardly know how to make due allowance for those unfortunate folks who are still in search of it  if you had an alexander yourselves for half a day the russian said fiercely turning to oswald you would soon see the difference you would forget your virtuous indignation against nihilist assassins in the white heat of your anger against unendurable tyranny you had a king charles in england oncethe mere shadow of a russian czarand you were not so very ceremonious with him you orderloving english after all  it is a foolish thing borodinsky said max schurz looking up from the long telegram the other had handed him and i told toroloff as much a fortnight ago when he spoke to me about the matter you can do no good by these constant attacks and you only rouse the minds of the oligarchy against you by your importunity bloodshed will avail us nothing the world cannot be regenerated by a baptism like that every peasant won over every student enrolled every mother engaged to feed her little ones on the gospel of socialism together with her own milk is worth a thousand times more to us and to the people than a dead czar if your friends had really blown him up what then  you would have had another czar and another third section and another reign of terror and another raid and massacre and we should have lost twenty good men from our poor little side for ever we must not waste the salt of the earth in that reckless fashion besides i dont like this dynamite its a bad argument it smacks too much of the old royal and repressive method you know the motto louis quatorze used to cast on his bronze cannonultima ratio regum well we socialists ought to be able to find better logic for our opponents than that oughtnt we  but in russia cried the bearded man hotly in poor strickendown groaning russia what other argument have they left us are we to be hunted to death without real law or trial tortured into sham confessions deluded with mock pardons arraigned before hypocritical tribunals  ensnared by all the chicanery and lying and treachery and ferreting of the false bureaucracy with its spies and its bloodhounds and its knoutbearing policeagents and then are we not to make war the only way we canopen war mind you with fair declaration and due formalities and proper warning beforehandagainst the irresponsible autocrat  and his wirepulled officepuppets who kill us off  mercilessly you are too hard upon us herr schurz even you yourself have no sympathy at all for unhappy russia  the old man looked up at him tenderly and regretfully  my poor borodinsky he said in a gentle tremulous voice i have indeed sympathy and pity in abundance for you i do not blame you you will have enough and to spare to do that even here in free england i would not say a harsh word against you or your terrible methods for all the world  you have been harddriven and you stand at bay like tigers  but i think you are going to work the wrong way not using your energies to the best possible advantage for the proletariate what we have really got to do is to gain over every man woman and child of the workingclasses individually and to array on our side all the learning and intellect and economical science of the thinking classes individually and then we can present such a grand united front to the banded monopolists that for very shame they will not dare to  gainsay us indeed if it comes to that we can leave them quietly alone till for pure hunger they will come and beg our assistance when we have enticed away all the workmen  from their masters to our cooperative factories the masters may keep their rusty empty mills and looms and engines to themselves as long as they like but they must come to us in the end and ask us to give them the bread they used to refuse us for my part i would kill no man and rob no man but i would let no man kill or rob another either  and how about alexander nicolaiovitch then persisted  the russian eagerly has he killed none in his loathsome prisons and in his siberian quicksilver mines  has he robbed none of their own hardly got earnings by his poisoned vodki and his autocratically imposed taxes and imposts who gave him an absolute hereditary right to put us to death to throw us in prison to take our money from us against our will and without our leave to treat us as if we existed body and soul and wives and children only as chattels for the greater glory of his own orthodox imperial majesty if we may justly slay the highway robber who meets us arms in hand in the outskirts of the city and demands of us our money or our life may we not justly slay alexander nicolaiovitch who comes to our homes in the person of his taxgatherers to take the bread out of our childrens mouths and to help himself to whatever he chooses by the divine right of his romanoff heirship i tell you herr max we may blamelessly lie in wait for him wherever we find him and whoso says us nay is siding with the wolf against the lambs with the robber and the slayer against the honest representative of right and justice  i never met a nihilist before said oswald to ernest in a halfundertone and it never struck me to think what they might have to say for themselves from their own side of the question  thats one of the uses of coming here to herr schurzs ernest answered quickly you may not agree with all you hear but at least you learn to see others as they see  themselves whereas if you mix always in english society and read only english papers you will see them only as we english see them  but just fancy oswald went on as they both stood back a little to make way for others who wished for interviews  with the great man just fancy that this borodinsky or whatever his name may be has himself very likely helped in dynamite plots or manufactured nitroglycerine cartridges  to blow up the czar and yet we stand here talking with him as coolly as if he were an ordinary respectable innocent englishman  what of that ernest answered smiling didnt we meet prince strelinoffsky at oriel last term and didnt we talk with him too as if he was an honest hardworking breadearning christian and yet we knew he was a member of the st petersburg office clique and at the bottom of half the trouble in poland for the last ten years or so grant even that borodinsky is quite wrong in his way of dealing with noxious autocrats and yet which do you think is the worst criminal of the twohe with his little honest glaziers shop in a back slum of paddington or strelinoffsky with his jewelled fingers calmly signing accursed warrants to send childing polish women to die of cold and hunger and illtreatment on the way to siberia  well really le breton you know im a passably good radical but youre positively just one stage too radical even for me  come here oftener answered ernest and perhaps youll begin to think a little differently about some things  an hour later in the evening max schurz found ernest alone in a quiet corner one moment my dear le breton he said you know i always like to find out all about peoples political antecedents it helps one to fathom the potentialities of their characters from what social stratum now do we get your clever friend mr oswald  his fathers a petty tradesman in a country town in devonshire i believe ernest answered and he himself is a good general democrat without any very pronounced socialistic colouring  a petty tradesman hum i thought so he has rather the mental bearing and equipment of a man from the petite bourgeoisie i have been talking to him and drawing him out clever very and with good instincts but not wholly and entirely sound a fibre wrong somewhere socially speaking a false note suspected in his ideas of life too much acquiescence in the thing that is and too little faith or enthusiasm for the thing that ought to be but we shall make something of him yet he has read gold and understands it that is already a beginning bring him again i shall always be glad to see him here  i will said ernest and i believe the more you know him herr max the better you will like him  and what did you think of the sons of the prophets asked herbert le breton of oswald as they left the salon at the close of the reception  frankly speaking answered oswald looking half aside at ernest i didnt quite care for all of themthe nihilists and communards took my breath away at first but as to max schurz himself i think there can be only one opinion possible about him  and that is  that hes a magnificent old man with a genuine apostolic inspiration i dont care twopence whether he is right or wrong but hes a perfectly splendid old fellow as honest and transparent as the days long he believes in it all and would give his life for it freely if he thought he could forward the cause a single inch by doing it  youre quite right said herbert calmly hes an elijah thrown blankly upon these prosaic latter days and whats more his gospels all true but it doesnt matter a sou to you or me for it will never come about in our time no nor for a century after post nos millennium so what on earths the good of our troubling our poor overworked heads about it  hes the only really great man i ever knew said ernest enthusiastically and i consider that his friendships the one thing in my life that has been really and truly worth living for if a pessimist were to ask me what was the use of human existence i should give him a card of introduction to go to max schurzs  excuse my interrupting your rhapsody ernest herbert put in blandly but will you have your own trousers  tonight oswald or will you wear mine back to your lodgings now and ill send one of the servants round with yours for them in the morning  thanks said harry oswald slapping the sides of the unopened dustcoat i think ill go home as i am at present and ill recover the marks of the beast again tomorrow  you see i didnt betray my evening waistcoat after all now did i  and they parted at the corner each of them going his own way in his own mood and manner    chapter ii  the coasts of the gentiles   the decayed and disfranchised borough of calcombe pomeroy or calcombeonthesea is one of the prettiest and quietest little outoftheway wateringplaces in the whole smiling southern slope of the county of devon  thank heaven the great western railway when planning its organised devastations along the beautiful rural region of the south hams left poor little calcombe out in the cold and the consequence is that those few people who still love to linger in the uncontaminated rustic england of our wiser forefathers can here find a beach unspoiled by goatcarriages or blackfaced minstrels a tiny parade uninvaded by stucco terraces or german brass bands and an ancient stone pier off which swimmers may take a header direct in the early morning before the sumptuary edicts of his worship the mayor compel them to resort to the use of bathingmachines and the decent covering of an approved costume between the hours of eight and eight a board beside the mouth of the harbour signed by a secretary of state to his late majesty king william the fourth still announces to a heedless  world the tolls to be paid for entry by the ships that never arrive and a superannuated official in a wooden leg and a gold capband retains the honourable sinecure of a harbourmastership with a hypothetical salary nominally payable from the nonexistent fees and port dues the little river cale at the bottom of whose combe the wee town nestles snugly has cut itself a deep valley in the soft  sandstone hills and the gap in the cliffs formed by its mouth gives room for the few hundred yards of level on which the antiquated little parade is warmly ensconced on either hand tall bluffs of brilliant red marl raise their honeycombed faces fronting the sea and in the distance the sheeny grey rocks of the harder devonian promontories gleam like watered satin in the slant rays of the afternoon sun altogether  a very sleepy little oldworld place is calcombe pomeroy specially reserved by the overruling chance of the universe to be a summer retreat for quiet peaceloving oldworld people  the londoner who escapes for a while from the great teeming human anthill with its dark foggy lanes and solid firmament of hanging smoke to draw in a little unadulterated atmosphere at calcombe pomeroy finds himself landed by the plymouth slow train at calcombe road station twelve miles by crosscountry highway from his final destination  the little grey box described in the timetables as a  commodious omnibus which takes him on for the rest of his journey crawls slowly up the first six miles to the summit of the intervening range at the cross foxes inn and jolts swiftly down the other six miles with red hot drag creaking and groaning lugubriously till it seems to topple over sheer into the sea at the clambering high street of the old borough  as you turn to descend the seaward slope at the cross foxes you appear to leave modern industrial england and the  nineteenth century well behind you on the north and you go down into a little isolated primaeval dale cut off from all the outer world by the high ridge that girds it round on every side and turned only on the southern front towards the open channel and the backing sun halfway down the steep cobblepaved high street just after you pass the big dull russet church a small shop on the lefthand side bears a signboard with the painted legend oswald family grocer and provision dealer in the front bay window of that  redbrick house built out just over the shop harry oswald fellow and lecturer of oriel college oxford kept his big oak writingdesk and at that desk he might be seen reading or writing on most mornings during the long vacation after the end of his three weeks stay at a london westend  lodginghouse from which he had paid his first visit to max schurzs sunday evening receptions  two pounds of best black tea good qualityyours is generally atrocious mrs oswaldthats the next thing on the list said poor trembling shaky miss luttrell the squires sister a palsied old lady with a quavering  querulous rasping voice two pounds of best black tea and mind you dont send it all dust as you usually do no good tea to be got nowadays since they took the duties off and ruined the country and i see a tall young man lounging about the place sometimes and never touching his hat to me as he ought to do young people have no manners in these times mrs oswald as they used to have when you and i were young your son i suppose come home from sea or something hes in the fishcuring line isnt he i think ive heard you say  i dont rightly know who ee may mean miss luttrell replied the mother proudly by a young man lounging about the place but my sons at home from oxford at present for his vacations and he isnt in the fishcuring line at all maam but hes a fellow of his college as ive told ee more than once already but youre getting old i see miss luttrell and your memory isnt just what it had used to be dost know  oh at oxford is he miss luttrell chimed on vacantly wagging her wrinkled old head in solemn deprecation of tke evil omen she knew it as well as mrs oswald herself did having heard the fact at least a thousand times before but she made it a matter of principle never to encourage these upstart pretensions on the part of the lower orders and just to keep them rigorously at their proper level she always made a feint of forgetting any steps in advance which they might have been bold enough to take without humbly obtaining  her previous permission out of their original and natural obscurity fellow of his college is he really  fellow of a college dear me how completely oxford is going to the dogs admitting all kinds of odd people into the university i understand why my second brotherthe  archdeacon you knowwas a fellow of magdalen for some time in his younger days you surprise me quite fellow of a college youre perfectly sure he isnt a national schoolmaster at oxford instead and that you and his father havent got the two things mixed up together in your heads mrs oswald  no maam wein perfectly sure of it and we havent got the things mixed up in our heads at all no more nor you have miss luttrell he was a scholar of trinity first and now hes got a fellowship at oriel you must mind hearing all about it at the time only youre getting so forgetful like now with years and such like mrs oswald knew there was nothing that annoyed the old lady so much as any allusion to her increasing age or infirmities and she took her revenge out of her in that simple retributive fashion  a scholar of trinity was he ah yes patronage will do a great deal in these days for certain the rector took a wonderful interest in your boy i think mrs oswald he went to plymouth grammar school i remember now with a nomination no doubt and there i dare say he attracted some attention being a decent hardworking lad and got sent to oxford with a sizarship or something of the sort there are all kinds of arrangements like that at the universities  i believe to encourage poor young men of respectable character they become missionaries or ushers in the end and often get very good salaries considering everything im told  there youre wrong again maam put in mrs oswald stoutly my husband he sent harry to plymouth school at our own expense and after that he got an exhibition from the school and an open scholarship i think they call it at the college and hes been no more beholden to patronage maam than your brother the archdeacon was nor for the matter o that not so much neither for ive aways understood the old squire sent him first to the charterhouse and afterwards he got a living through lord modburys influence as the squire voted regular with the modbury people for the borough and county but george was always independent miss luttrell and beholden to neither luttrells nor modburies  and that i tell ee to your face maam and no shame of it either  well well mrs oswald said the old lady shaking her head more violently than ever at this direct discomfiture i dont want to argue with you about the matter i dare say your sons a very worthy young man and has worked his way up into a position he wasnt intended for by providence  but its no business of mine thank heaven its no business of mine for im not responsible for all the vagaries of all the tradespeople on my brothers estate nor dont want to be  theres mrs figgins now the bakers wife her daughter has just chosen to get married to a bank clerk in london and i said to her this morning well mrs figgins so youve let your polly go and pick up with some young fellow from town that youve never seen before havent you and thats the way of all you people you marry your girls to bank clerks without a reference for the sake of getting em off your hands and whats the consequence they rob their employers to keep up a pretty household for their wives as if they were fine ladies and then at last the things discovered there comes a smash they run away to america and you have your daughters and their children thrown back again penniless upon your hands thats what i said to her mrs oswald  and hows your daughter by the wayjemima i think you call her hows she eh tell me  i beg your pardon miss luttrell but her names not jemima its edith  oh edith is it well to be sure the grand names girls have dangling about with them nowadays my names plain catherine and its good enough for me thank  goodness but these young ladies of the new style must be ediths and eleanors and ophelias and all that heathenish kind of thing as if they were princesses of the blood or  playactresses instead of being good christian susans and janes and betties like their grandmothers were before them and miss edith now what is she doing  shes doing nothing in particular at this moment miss luttrell leastways not so far as i know of but shes going up to oxford part of this term on a visit to her brother  going up to oxford my good woman why heaven bless the girl shed much better stop at home and learn her catechism she should try to do her duty in that station of life to which it has pleased providence to call her instead of running after young gentlemen above her own rank and place in society at oxford tell her so from me mrs  oswald and mind you dont send the tea dusty two pounds of your best if you please as soon as you can send it goodmorning and miss luttrell having discovered the absolute truth of the shocking rumour which had reached her about ediths projected visit the confirmation of which was the sole object of her colloquy wagged her way out of the shop again successfully and was duly assisted by the pageboy into her shambling little palsied donkeychair  that was all the old cat came about you warrnt you muttered mr oswald himself from behind his biscuitboxes  must have heard it from the rectors wife and wanted to find out if it was true to go and tell mrs walters o such a bit o turble presumptiousness  meanwhile in the little study with the bowwindow over the shop harry and edie oswald were busily discussing the necessary preparations for edies longpromised visit to the university  i hope youve got everything nice in the way of dress you know edie said harry youll want a decent dinner dress of course for youll be asked out to dine at least once or twice and i want you to have everything exceedingly proper and pretty  i think ive got all i need in that way harry ive my dark poplin cut square in the bodice for one dinner dress and my high black silk to fall back upon for another worn open in front with a lace handkerchief and a locket it does really very nicely then ive got three afternoon dresses the grey you gave me the sagegreeny aesthetic one and the peacockblue with the satin boxpleats its a charming dress the peacockblue it looks as if it might have stepped straight out of a genuine titian it came home from miss wellss this morning wait five minutes like a dear boy and ill run and put it on and let you see me in it  thats a good girl do im so anxious you should have all your clothes the exact pink of perfection popsy though im afraid im a very poor critic in that matterif you were only a problem in space of four dimensions now yet after all every man or woman is more of a problem than anything in x square plus y square you can possibly set yourself  edie ran lightly up into her own room and soon reappeared  clad resplendent in the new peacockblue dress with hat and parasol to match and a little creamy lambswool scarf thrown with artful carelessness around her pretty neck and shoulders harry looked at her with unfeigned admiration  indeed you would not easily find many lighter or more fairlylike little girls than edie oswald even in the beautiful halfceltic south hams of devon in figure she was rather small than short for though she was but a wee thing her form was so exactly and delicately modelled that she might have looked tall if she stood alone at a little distance  she never walked but seemed to dance about from place to place so buoyant and light that harry doubted whether in her case gravitation could really vary as the square of the distanceit seemed in fact to be almost diminished in the proportions of the cube her hair and eyessuch big bright eyeswere dark but her complexion was scarcely brunette and the colour in her cheeks was rich and peachlike after the true devonian type she was dimpled whenever she smiled and she smiled often her full lips giving a peculiar ripe look to her laughing mouth that suited admirably with her light and delicate style of beauty perhaps some people might have thought them too full certainly they irresistibly suggested to a critical eye the distinct notion of kissability  as she stood there faintly blushing waiting to be admired by her brother in her neatly fitting dainty blue dress her lips half parted and her arms held carelessly at her side she looked about as much like a fairy picture as it is given to mere human flesh and blood to look  its delicious edie said harry surveying her from head to foot with a smile of satisfaction which made her blush deepen its simply delicious where on earth did you get the idea of it  well its partly the present style said edie but i took the notion of the bodice partly too from that vandyck you know in the palazzo bossi at genoa  i remember i remember harry answered contemplating  her with an admiring eye now just turn round and show me how it sits behind edie you recollect théophile gautier says the one great advantage which a beautiful woman possesses over a beautiful statue is this that while a man has to walk round the beautiful statue in order to see it from every side he can ask the beautiful woman to turn herself round and let him see her without requiring to take that trouble  théophile gautier was a horrid man and if anybody but my brother quoted such a thing as that to me i should be very angry with him indeed  théophile gautier was quite as horrid as you consider him to be and if you were anybody but my sister it isnt probable i should have quoted him to you but if there is any statue on earth prettier or more graceful than you are in that dress at this moment edie then the venus of milo ought immediately to be pulverised to ultimate atoms for a rank artistic impostor  thank you harry for the compliment what pretty things you must be capable of saying to somebody elses sister when youre so polite and courtly to your own  on the contrary popsy when it comes to somebody elses sister im much too nervous and funky to say anything of the kind but you must at least do gautier the justice to observe that if i had described a circle round you instead of allowing you to revolve once on your own axis i shouldnt have been able to get the gloss on the satin in the sunlight as i do now that you turn the panniers toward the window  that you must admit is a very important aesthetic consideration  oh of course its essentially a sunshiny dress said edie smiling its meant to be worn out of doors on a fine afternoon when the light is falling slantwise you know just as it does now through the low window thats the light painters always choose for doing satin in  its certainly very pretty harry went on musing but im afraid le breton would say it was a serious piece of economic hubris  piece of what asked edie quickly  piece of hubrisan economical outrage dont you see a gross antisocial and individualist demonstration hubris you know is greek for insolence at least not quite  insolence but a sort of pride and overweening rebelliousness against the gods the kind of arrogance that brings nemesis after it you understand it was hubris in agamemnon and xerxes to go swelling about and ruffling themselves like turkeycocks because they were great conquerors and all that sort of thing and it was their nemesis to get murdered by clytemnestra or jolly well beaten by the athenians at salamis well le breton always uses the word for  anything that he thinks socially wrongand he thinks a good many things socially wrong i can tell youanything that partakes of the nature of a class distinction or a mere vulgar ostentation of wealth or a useless waste of good serviceable labourgotten material he would call it hubris to have silver spoons when electroplate would do just as well or to keep a valet for your own personal attendant making one man into the mere bodily appanage of another or to buy anything you didnt really need causing somebody else to do work for you which might otherwise have been avoided  which mr le bretonthe elder or the younger one  oh the youngerernest as for herbert the fellow of st aldates hes not troubled with any such scruples he takes the world as he finds it  theyve both gone in for their degrees havent they  yes herbert has got a fellowship ernests up in residence still looking about for one   its ernest that would think my dress a piece of whatyoumaycallit  yes ernest  then im sure i shant like him i should insist upon every womans natural right to wear the dress or hat or bonnet that suits her complexion best  you cant tell edie till youve met him hes a very good fellow and of one thing im certain whatever he thinks right he does and sticks to it  but do you think harry i oughtnt to wear a new peacockblue camelhair dress on my first visit up to oxford  well edie dear i dont quite know what my own opinions are exactly upon that matter im not an economist you see im a man of science when i look at you standing there so pretty in that pretty dress i feel inclined to say to myself every woman ought to do her best to make herself look as beautiful as she can for the common delectation of all humanity your beauty a greek would have said is a gift from the gods to us all and we ought all gratefully to make the most of it im sure i do  thank you harry again youre in your politest humour this afternoon  but then on the other hand i know if le breton were here hed soon argue me over to the other side he has the enthusiasm of humanity so strong upon him that you cant help agreeing with him as long as hes talking to you  then if he were here youd probably make me put away the peacockblue for fear of hubris and nemesis and so forth and go up to oxford a perfect fright in my shabby old indian tussore  i dont know that i should do that even then edie  in the first place nothing on earth could make you look a perfect fright or anything like one popsy dear and in the second place i dont know that im socialist enough myself ever to have the courage of my opinions as le breton has  certainly i should never attempt to force them unwillingly upon others you must remember edie its one thing for le breton to be so communistic as all that comes to and quite another thing for you and me le bretons father was a general and a knight you see and people will never forget that his mothers lady le breton still whatever he does  he may do what he likes in the way of social eccentricities and the world will only say hes such a very strange advanced young fellow but if i were to take you up to oxford badly dressed or out of the fashion or looking peculiar in any way the world wouldnt put it down to our political beliefs but would say we were mere country tradespeople by birth and didnt know any better that makes a lot of difference you know  youre quite right harry and yet do you know i think there must be something too in sticking to ones own opinions like mr le breton i should stick to mine im sure and wear whatever dress i liked in spite of anybody  its a sweet thing really isnt it and she turned herself round craning over her shoulder to look at the effect in a vain attempt to assume an objective attitude towards her own back  im glad im going to oxford at last harry she said after a short pause i have so longed to go all these years while you were an undergraduate and im dying to have got there now the chance has really come at last after all  i shall glory in the place im certain and itll be so nice to make the acquaintance of all your clever friends  well edie said her brother smiling gently at the light joyous tremulous little figure i think ive done right in putting it off till now its just as well you havent gone up to oxford till after your trip on the continent with me  that three months in paris and switzerland and venice and florence did you a lot of good you see improved you and gave you tone and supplied you with things to talk about  why you oughtnt to think i needed any improvement at all sir edie answered pouting and as to talking im not aware i had ever any dearth of subjects for conversation even before i went on the continent there are things enough to be said about heaven and earth in england surely without one having to hurry through france and italy like cooks excursionists just to hunt up something fresh to chatter about its my belief that a person who cant find anything new to say about the everyday world around her wont discover much suggestive matter for conversation in a continental bradshaw its like that feeble watery lady i met at the table dhote at geneva from something she said i gathered shed been in india and i asked her how she liked it oh she said its very hot i told her i had heard so before presently she said something casually about having been in brazil i asked her what sort of place brazil was oh she said its dreadfully hot i told her id heard that too byandby she began to talk again about barbadoes what did you think of the west indies i said oh said she theyre terribly hot really i told her i had gathered as much from previous travellers  and that was positively all in the end i ever got out of her for all her travels  my dear edie ive always admitted that you were simply perfect harry said glancing at her with visible admiration and i dont think anything on earth could  possibly improve youexcept perhaps a judicious course of differential and integral calculus which might possibly serve to tone down slightly your exuberant and excessive vitality  still you know from the point of view of society which is a force we have always to reckon witha constant in fact that we may call pithere can be no doubt in the world that to have been on the continent is a differentiating factor in ones social position it doesnt matter in the least what your own private evaluation of pi may be if you dont happen to know the particular things and places that pi knows pis evaluation of you will be approximately a  minimum of that you may be certain  well for my part i dont care twopence about pi as you call it said edie tossing her pretty little head  contemptuously but im very glad indeed to have been on the continent for my own sake because of the pictures and palaces and mountains and waterfalls weve seen and not because of pis opinion of me for having seen them i would have been the same person really whether id seen them or not but im so much the richer myself for that view from the top of the col de balme and for that murillooh do you remember the flood of light on that murilloin the far corner of that delicious gallery at bologna why mother darling what on earth has been vexing you  nothing at all edie dear leastways that is nothing to speak of said her mother coming up from the shop hot and flurried from her desperate encounter with the redoubtable miss luttrell  oh i know just what it is darling cried the girl putting her arm around her mothers waist caressingly and drawing her down to kiss her face half a dozen times over in her outburst of sympathy that horrid old miss catherine has been here again im sure for i saw her going out of the shop just now and shes been saying something or other spiteful as she always does to vex my dearie what did she say to you today now do tell us duckie mother  well there said mrs oswald half laughing and half crying i cant tell ee exactly what she did say but it was just the kind of thing that she mostly does impudent like just to hurt a bodys feelings she said youd better not go to oxford edie but stop at home and learn your catechism  you might have pointed out to her mother dear said the young man smoothing her hair softly with his hand and kissing her forehead that in the most advanced intellectual centres the church catechism is perhaps no longer regarded as the absolute ultimatum of the highest and deepest economical wisdom  bless your heart harry whatd be the good of talking that way to the likes of she she wouldnt understand a single word of what you were driving at it must be all plain sailing with her without its in the way of spite and then she sees her chance to tack round the hardest corner with half a wind in her sails only as soon as look at it her sharpness goes all off toward illnature that it do why she said youd got on at oxford by good patronage  there you see edie cried harry demonstratively thats an infinitesimal fraction of pi thats a minute decimal of this great sneering ugly aggregate society that we have to deal with whether we will or no and that rends us and grinds us to powder if only it can once get in the thin end of a chance take shaky bitter old miss catherine for your unit multiply her to the nth and there you see the irreducible power we have to fight against all ones political economy is very well in its way but the practical master of the situation is pi sitting autocratically in manyheaded judgment on our poor solitary little individualities and crushing us irretrievably with the dead weight of its inexorable cumulative nothingness and to think that that quivering old mass of perambulating jealousythat living incarnation of envy hatred malice and all  uncharitablenessshould be able to make you uncomfortable for a single moment mother darling with her petty dribbling doddering venom why its simply unendurable  there now harry said mrs oswald relenting you mustnt be too hard neither on poor old miss catherine  shes a bit soured you see by disappointments and one thing and another she doesnt mean it really but its just her nature folks cant be blamed for their nature now can they  it occurs to me said harry quietly that vipers only sting because its their nature and dr watts has made a similar observation with regard to the growling and fighting of bears and lions but im not aware that anybody has yet proposed to get up a society for the protection of those muchmisunderstood creatures on the ground that they are not really responsible for their own inherited dispositions  mr william sikes had a nature no doubt congenital which impelled him to beat his wifeim not sure that she was even his wife at all now i come to think of it but thats a mere detailand to kick his familiar acquaintances casually about the head we on the other hand have natures which impel us when we catch mr william sikes indulging in these innate idiosyncrasies by way of recreation to clap him promptly into prison and even under certain aggravating conditions to cause him to be hanged by the neck till he be dead this may be a regrettable incident of our own peculiar  dispositions mother dear but it has at least the same justification as mr sikess or the bears and lions that tis our nature to and i feel pretty much the same way about old miss luttrell  well there said his mother kissing him gently youre a bad rebellious boy to be calling names like a chattermag and i wont listen to you any longer how pretty edie do look in her new dress to be sure harry  ill warrnt there wont be a prettier girl in oxford next week than what she is no nor a better one and a sweeter one neither  harry put his arms round both their waists at once with an affectionate pressure and they went down to their oldfashioned tea together in the little parlour behind the shop looking out over the garden and the beach and the great cliffs beyond on either hand to the very farthest edge of the distant clearcut blue horizon    chapter iii  magdalen quad   the reverend arthur collingham berkeley curate of st  fredegonds lounged lazily in his own neatly padded wickerwork easychair opposite the large latticepaned windows of his pretty little firstfloor rooms in the front quad of magdalen  theres a great deal to be said le breton in favour of october term he observed in his soft musical voice as he gazed pensively across the central grassplot to the crimson drapery of the founders tower just look at that magnificent  virginia creeper over there now just look at the way the red on it melts imperceptibly into tyrian purple and cloth of gold isnt that in itself argument enough to fling at hartmanns head if he ventured to come here sprinkling about his heresies with his affected little sprayshooter in the midst of a drowsy oxford autumn the cardinal never saw virginia creeper i suppose a man of his taste wouldnt have been guilty of committing such a gross practical anachronism as that any more than he would have smoked a cigarette before tobacco was invented but if only he could have seen the october effect on that tower yonder hed have acknowledged that his own hat and robe were positively nowhere in the running for colour wouldnt he  well answered herbert putting down the venetian glass goblet he had been examining closely with due care into its niche in the overmantel ive no doubt wolsey had too much historical sense ever to step entirely out of his own century like my brother ernest for instance but ive never heard his opinion on the subject of colourharmonies and i should suspect it of having been distinctly tinged with nascent symptoms of renaissance vulgarity this is a lovely bit of venetian really berkeley how the dickens do you manage to pick up all these pretty things i wonder why cant i afford them now  what a question for the endowed and established to put to a poor starving devil of a curate like me said berkeley lightly you an incarnate sinecure and vested interest a creature revelling in an unearned income of fabulous oriental magnificencei dare say putting one thing with another fully as much as five hundred a yearto ask me the  unbeneficed and insignificant with my wretched pittance of eighty pounds per annum and my three passmen a term for classical mods how i scrape together the few miserable hoarded hapence which i grudgingly invest in my pots and pipkins i save them from my dinner mr bursari save them if the church only recognised modest merit as it ought to doif the bishops only listened with due attention to the sound and scholarly exegesis of my sunday evening discourses at st fredegondsthen indeed i might be disposed to regard things through a more satisfied medium the medium of a nice fat juicy country living but for you le bretonyou sir a pluralist and a sanguisorb of the deepest dyeto reproach me with my franciscan povertyoh its too cruel  im an abuse i know herbert answered smiling and waving his hand gracefully i at once admit it abuses exist unhappily and while they continue do so isnt it better they should envisage themselves as me than as some other and probably less deserving fellow  no its not decidedly i should much prefer that one of them envisaged itself as me  ah of course from your own strictly subjective point of view thats very natural i also look at the question abstractly from the side of the empirical ego and correctly deduce a corresponding conclusion only then you see the terms of the minor premiss are luckily reversed  well my dear fellow said the curate the fact about the teathings is this you eat up your income devour your substance in riotous living i prefer to feast my eyes and ears to my grosser senses you dine at high table and fare sumptuously every day i take a commons of cold beef for lunch and have tea off an egg and roll in my own rooms at seven you drink st emilion or still hock i drink water from the well or the cup that cheers but not obfuscates  the difference goes to pay for the crockery do likewise and with your untold wealth you might play aunt sally at oriental blue and take cockshots with a bootjack at hawthornpattern vases  at any rate berkeley you always manage to get your moneys worth of amusement out of your money  of course because i lay myself out to do it buy a bottle of champagne drink it off and there you have to show for your total permanent investment on the transaction the memory of a noisy evening and a headache the next morning buy a flute or a book of poems or a little picture or a palissy platter and you have something to turn to with delight and admiration for half a lifetime  ah but it isnt everybody who can isolate himself so utterly from the workaday world and live so completely in his own little paradise of art as you can my dear fellow  non omnia possumus omnes you seem to be always up in the aesthetic clouds with your own music automatically laid on and no need of cherubim or seraphim to chant continually  for your gratification play me something of your own on your flute now like a good fellow  no i wont because the spirit doesnt move me its treachery to the divine gift to play when you dont want to  besides whats the use of playing before you when youre not the dean of a musical cathedral david was wiser he played only before saul who had of course all the livings in his own gift no doubt ive got a new thing running in my head this very minute that you shall hear though all the same as soon as ive hammered it into shapea sort of villanette in music a little whiff of country freshness suggested by the new ethereal acquisition little miss butterfly have you seen miss butterfly yet  not by that name at any rate who is she  oh the names my own invention mademoiselle volauvent  i meanthe little bit of whirligig thistledown from devonshire oswalds sister you know of oriel  ah that one yes just caught a glimpse of her in the high on thursday very pretty certainly and as airy as a hummingbird  thats her shes coming here to lunch this morning  if youre a good boy and will promise not to say anything naughty you may stop and meet her shes a nice little thing but rather timid at seeing so many fresh faces you mustnt frighten her by discussing the absolute and the  unconditioned or bore her by talking about aristotles politics or the revolutions in corcyra for you know my dear le breton if you have a fault it is that youre such a consummate and irrepressible prig now arent you really  im hardly a fair judge on that subject i suppose berkeley but if you have a rudimentary glimmering of a virtue it is that youre such a deliciously frank and yet  considerate critic ill pocket your rudeness though and eat your lunch in spite of it is miss butterfly as you call her as standoff as her brother  not at all shes accueillante to the last degree  very restricted i supposea country girl of the first water horizon absolutely bounded by the high hedges of her native parish  oh dear no anything but that shes like her brother naturally quick and adaptive  oswalds an excellent fellow in his way said herbert buttonholing his own waistcoat but hes spoilt by two bad traits in the first place hes so dreadfully conscious of the fact that he has risen from a lower position and then again hes so engrossingly and pervadingly mathematical  x square seems to have seized upon him bodily and to have wormed its fatal way into his very marrow  ah you must remember hes true to his first love  culture came to him first while yet he abode in philistia under the playful disguise of a conic section he scaled his way out of gath by means of a treatise on elementary  trigonometry and evaded askelon on the wings of an undulatory theory of light it is different with us you know who have emerged from the land of darkness by the regular classical and literary highway we feed upon rabelais and burton he flits carelessly from flower to flower of the theory of quantics if he were an idealist painter like rossetti he would paint great allegorical pictures for us representing an asymptotic curve appearing to him in a dream and introducing  that blushing maiden hyperbola to his affectionate consideration  as berkeley spoke a rap sounded on the oak and ernest le breton entered the room  what you here herbert he said with a shade of  displeasure in his tone are you too of the bidden  berkeley has asked me to stop and lunch with him if thats what you mean  we shall be quite a party said ernest seating himself and looking abstractedly round the room why berkeley as his eye fell upon the venetian vase youve positively got some more gewgaws here this ones new isnt it eh  yes i picked it up for a song this long at a stranded village in the apennines literally for a song for it cost me just what i got from fradelli for that last little piece of mine its very pretty isnt it  very exquisite really the blending of the tones is so perfect i wish i knew what to think about these things  i cant make up my mind about them sometimes i think its all right to make them and buy them sometimes i think its all wrong  oh if thats your difficulty said berkeley pulling his white tie straight at the tiny round lookingglass i can easily reassure you do you think a hundred and eighty pounds a year an excessive sum for one person to spend upon his own entire living  it doesnt seem so as expenses go amongst us said ernest seriously though i dare say it would look like shocking extravagance to a working man with a wife and family  very well thats the very outside i ever spend upon myself in any one year for the excellent reason that its all i ever get to spend in any way now why shouldnt i spend it on the things that please me best and are joys for ever instead of on the things that disappear at once and perish in the using  ah but thats not the whole question ernest answered looking at the curate fixedly what right have you and i to spend so much when others are wanting for bread and what right have you or i to make other people work at producing  these useless trinkets for our sole selfish gratification  well now le breton said the parson assuming a more serious tone you know youre a reasonable creature so i dont mind discussing this question with you youve got an ethical foundation to your nature and you want to see things done on decent grounds of distributive justice there i am one with you but youve also got an aesthetic side to your nature which makes you worth arguing with upon the matter i wont argue with your vulgar materialised socialist who would break up the frieze of the parthenon for road metal or pull down giottos frescoes because they represent scenes in the fabulous lives of saints and martyrs  you know what a work of art is when you see it and therefore  youre worth arguing with which your vulgar continental  socialist really isnt the one cogent argument for him is the whiff of grapeshot  i recognise said ernest that the works of art of poetry or of music which we possess are a grand inheritance from the past and i would do all i could to preserve them intact for those that come after us  im sure you would no restoration or tinkering in you im certain well then would you give anything for a world which hadnt got this aesthetic side to its corporate existence would you give anything for a world which didnt care at all for painting sculpture music poetry i wouldnt i dont want such a world i wont countenance such a world ill do nothing to further or advance such a world its utterly repugnant to me and i banish it as themistocles banished the athenians  but consider said ernest we live in a world where men and women are actually starving how can we reconcile  to our consciences the spending of one penny on one useless thing when others are dying of sheer want and cold and nakedness thats the great question thats always oppressing my poor dissatisfied conscience  so it does everybodysexcept herberts he explains it all on biological grounds as the beautiful discriminative action of natural selection simple but not consolatory  still look at the other side of the question suppose you and everybody else were to give up all superfluities and confine all your energies to the unlimited production of bare necessaries suppose you occupy every acre of land with your cornfields or your piggeries and sweep away all the parks and woods and heaths and moorlands in england suppose you keep on letting your population multiply as fast as it choosesand it will multiply you know in that ugly reckless antimalthusian fashion of its owntill every rood of ground maintains its man and only just maintains him and what will you have got then  a dead level of abject pauperism put in herbert blandly a reductio ad absurdum of all your visionary schurzian philosophy my dear ernest look at it another way now and just consider which really and truly matters most to you and me a great work of art or a highly respectable hornyhanded son of toil whose acquaintance we have never had the pleasure of personally making suppose you read in the times that the respectable hornyhanded one has fallen off a scaffolding and broken his neck and that the dresden madonna has been burnt by an unexpected accident which of the two items of intelligence affects you the most acutely my dear fellow you may push your humanitarian enthusiasm as far as ever you like but in your heart of hearts you know as well as i do that youll deeply regret the loss of the madonna and youll never think again about the fate of the respectable hornyhanded his wife or children  ernests answer if he had any to make was effectually nipped in the bud by the entrance of the scout who came in to announce mr and miss oswald and mrs martindale  edie wore the grey dress her brothers present and flitted into the room after her joyous fashion full of her first fresh delight at the cloistered quad of magdalen  what a delicious college mr berkeley she said holding  out her hand to him brightly goodmorning mr le breton this is your brother i know by the likeness i thought new college very beautiful but nothing ive seen is quite as beautiful as magdalen what a privilege to live always in such a place and what an exquisite view from your window here  yes said berkeley moving a few musicbooks from the seat in the windowsill come and sit by it miss oswald  mrs martindale wont you put your shawl down hows the professor today so sorry he couldnt come  ah he had to go to sit on one of his boards said the old lady seating herself but you know im quite accustomed  to going out without him  arthur berkeley knew as much indeed being a person of minute strategical intellect he had purposely looked out a day on which the professor had to attend a meeting of the delegates of something or other so as to secure mrs martindales  services without the supplementary drawback of that prodigious bore not that he was particularly anxious for mrs martindales own society which was of the most strictly negative character but he didnt wish edie to be the one lady in a party of four men and he invited the professors wife as an excellent neutral figurehead to keep her in countenance ladies were scarcer then in oxford than they are nowadays the married fellow was still a tentative problematical experiment in those years and the invasion of the parks by young couples had hardly yet begun in earnest  so female society was still at a considerable local premium and berkeley was glad enough to secure even colourless old mrs martindale to square his party at any price  and how do you like oxford miss oswald asked ernest making his way towards the window  my dear le breton what a question to put to her said berkeley smiling as if oxford were a place to be appraised offhand on three days acquaintance you remind me of the american who went to look at niagara and made an approving note in his memorandum book to say that he found it really a very elegant cataract  oh but you must form some opinion of it at least at first sight cried edie you cant help having an impression of a place from the first moment even if you havent a  judgment on it can you now i think it really surpasses my expectations mr le breton which is always a pleasant surprise venice fell below them florence just came up to them but oxford i think really surpasses them  we have three beautiful towns in britain berkeley said as if he were a welsh triad suggested herbert le breton parenthetically torquay oxford edinburgh  torquay is all nature spoilt by what i wont call art oxford is all art superimposed on a swamp that i wont call nature edinburgh is both nature and art working pretty harmoniously together to make up a unique and exquisite picture  just like naples venice and heidelberg said edie half to herself but berkeley caught at the words quickly as she said them yes he answered a very good parallel only oxford has a trifle more nature about it than venice  the lagoon without the palaces would be simply hideous the oseney flats without the colleges would be nothing worse than merely dull  we owe a great deal said ernest gazing out towards the quadrangle to the forgotten mass of labouring humanity who piled all those blocks of shapeless stone into beautiful forms for us who come after to admire and worship i often wonder when i sit here in berkeleys windowseat and look across the quad to the carved pinnacles on the founders tower there whether any of us can ever hope to leave behind to our successors any legacy at all comparable to the one left us by those nameless old mediaeval masons its a very saddening thought that we for whom all these beautiful things have been put togetherwe whom labouring humanity has pampered and petted from our cradles upward feeding us on its whitest bread and toiling for us with all its weary sinewsthat we probably will never do anything at all for it and for the world in return but will simply eat our way through life aimlessly and die forgotten in the end like the beasts that perish it ought to make us as a class terribly ashamed of our own utter and abject inutility  edie looked at him with a sort of hushed surprise she was accustomed to hear harry talk radical talk enough after his own fashion but radicalism of this particular pensive tinge she was not accustomed to it interested her and made her wonder what sort of man mr le breton might really be  well you know mr le breton said old mrs martindale complacently we must remember that providence has wisely ordained that we shouldnt all of us be masons or  carpenters some of us are clergymen now and look what a useful valuable life a clergymans is after all isnt it mr  berkeley berkeley smiled a faint smile of amusement but said nothing others are squires and landed gentry and im sure the landed gentry are very desirable in keeping up the tone of the country districts and setting a pattern of virtue and refinement to their poorer neighbours what would the country villages be for example if it werent for the centres of culture afforded by the rectory and the hall eh miss oswald edith thought of quavering old miss catherine luttrell gossiping with the rectors wife and held her peace you may depend upon it providence has ordained these distinctions of classes for its own wise  purposes and we neednt trouble our heads at all about trying to alter them  ive always observed said harry oswald that providence  is supposed to have ordained the existing order for the time being whatever it may be but not the order that is at that exact moment endeavouring to supplant it if i were to visit central africa i should confidently expect to be told by the raindoctors that providence had ordained the absolute power of the chief and the custom of massacring his wives and slaves at his open grave side i believe in russia its usually allowed that providence has placed the orthodox czar at the head of the nation and that any attempt to obtain a constitution  from him is simply flat rebellion and flying in the face of providence in england we had a king john once and we extracted a constitution out of him and sundry other kings by main force and here its acquiescence in the present limited aristocratic government that makes up  obedience to the providential arrangement of things apparently  but how about america eh mrs martindale did providence  ordain that george washington was to rebel against his most sacred majesty king george iii or did it not  and did it ordain that george washington was to knock his most sacred majestys troops into a cocked hat or did it not and did it ordain that abraham lincoln was to free the slaves or did it not what i want to know is this can it be said that providence has ordained every class distinction in the whole world from dahomey to san  francisco and has it ordained every government past and present from the chinese empire to the french convention  did it ordain for example the revolution of 89 thats the question i should like to have answered  dear me mr oswald said the old lady meekly taken aback by harrys voluble vehemence i suppose providence permits some things and ordains others  and does it permit american democracy or ordain it asked the merciless harry  dont you see mrs martindale put in berkeley coming gently to her rescue your principle amounts in effect to saying that whatever is is right  exactly said the old lady forgetting at once all about dahomey or the convention and coming back mentally to her squires and rectors the existing order is wisely arranged by providence and we mustnt try to set ourselves up against it  but if whatever is is right edie said laughing then mr le bretons socialism must be right too you see because it exists in him no doubt for some wise purpose of providence and if he and those who think with him can succeed in changing  things generally according to their own pattern then the new system that they introduce will be the one that providence  has shown by the result to be the favoured one  in short said ernest musingly mrs martindales principle sanctifies success its the old theory of treason never prosperswhats the reason because wheneer it prospers tis not treason if we could only introduce a socialist republic then it would be the reactionaries who would be setting themselves up against constituted authority and so flying in the face of providence  fancy lecturing a recalcitrant archbishop and a remonstrant cidevant duchess cried berkeley lightly upon the moral guilt and religious sinfulness of rebellion against the constituted authority of a communist phalanstery it would be simply charming i can imagine myself composing a dignified exhortation to deliver to his grace entirely  compiled out of his own printed pastorals on the duty of  submission and the danger of harbouring an insubordinate spirit  do make me chaplaininordinary to your house of correction for irreclaimable aristocrats le breton as soon as you once get your coming socialist republic fairly under way  luncheon is on the table sir said the scout breaking in unceremoniously upon their discussion  if arthur berkeley lunched by himself upon a solitary commons of cold beef he certainly did not treat his friends and guests in corresponding fashion his little entertainment  was of the daintiest and airiest character so airy that as edie herself observed afterwards to harry it took away all the sense of meat and drink altogether and left one only a pleased consciousness of full artistic gratification even ernest though he had his scruples about the aspic jelly might eat the famous magdalen chicken cutlets his brother said with a distinct feeling of exalted gratitude to the arduous culinary evolution of collective humanity  consider said herbert balancing neatly a little pyramid  of whip cream and apricot jam upon his fork consider what ages of slow endeavour must have gone to the development  of such a complex mixture as this ernest and thank your stars that you were born in this nineteenth century of soyer and francatelli instead of being condemned to devour a homeric feast with the unsophisticated aid of your own five fingers  but do tell me mr le breton asked edie with one of her pretty smiles what will this socialist republic of yours be like when it actually comes about im dying to know all about it  really miss oswald ernest answered in a halfembarrassed tone i dont quite know how to reply to such a very wide and indefinite question i havent got any  cutanddried constitutional scheme of my own for reorganising the whole system of society any distinct panacea to cure all the ills that collective flesh is heir to i leave the details of the future order to your brother harry the thing that troubles me is not so much how to reform the world at large as how to shape ones own individual course aright in the actual midst of it as a single unit of the whole i want rather guidance for my private conduct than a scheme for redressing the universal dislocation of things in general it seems to me every mans first duty is to see that he himself is in the right attitude towards society and afterwards he may proceed to enquire whether society is in the right  attitude towards him and all its other members but if we were all to begin by redressing ourselves there would be nothing left to redress i imagine when we turned to attack the second half of our problem the great difficulty i myself  experience is this that i cant discover any adequate social justification for my own personal existence but i really oughtnt to bore other people with my private  embarrassments upon that head  you see said herbert le breton carelessly my brother represents the ethical element in the socialist  movement miss oswald while harry represents the political element each is valuable in its way but oswalds is the more practical you can move great masses into demanding their rights you cant so easily move them into cordially recognising their duties hammer hammer hammer at the most obvious abuses thats the way all the political victories are finally won if i were a radical at all i should go with you oswald but happily im not one i prefer the calm philosophic attitude of perfectly objective neutrality  and if i were a radical said berkeley with a tinge of sadness in his voice as he poured himself out a glass of hock i should go with le breton but unfortunately im not one miss oswald im only a parson    chapter iv  a little music   after lunch herbert le breton went off for his afternoon ridea grave social misdemeanour ernest thought itand arthur berkeley took edie round to show her about the college and the shady gardens ernest would have liked to walk with her himself for there was something in her that began to interest him somewhat and besides she was so pretty and so graceful and so sympathetic but he felt he must not take her away from her host for the time being who had a sort of proprietary right in the pleasing duty of acting as showman to her over his own college so he dropped behind with harry oswald and old mrs martindale  and endeavoured to simulate a polite interest in the old ladys scraps of conversation upon the heads of houses their wives and families  this is addisons walk miss oswald said berkeley taking her through the gate into the wooded path beside the cherwell so called because the ingenious mr addison is said to have specially patronised it as he was an undergraduate  of this college and a singularly lazy person its very probable that he really did so every other undergraduate certainly does for its the nearest walk an idle man can get without ever taking the trouble to go outside the grounds of magdalen  the ingenious mr addison was quite right then edie answered smiling for he couldnt have chosen a lovelier place on earth to stroll in how exquisite it looks just now with the mellow light falling down upon the path through this beautiful autumnal foliage its just a natural cathedral aisle with a lot of pale strawcoloured glass in the painted windows like that splendid one we went to see the other day at merton chapel  yes there are certainly tones in that window i never saw in any other berkeley said and the walk today is very much the same in its delicate colouring youre fond of colour i should think miss oswald from what you say  oh nobody could help being struck by the autumn colouring of the thames valley i should fancy said edie blushing we noticed it all the way up as we came in the train from reading a perfect glow of crimson and orange at pangbourne goring mapledurham and nuneham i always thought the dart in october the loveliest blaze of warm reds and yellows i had ever seen anywhere in nature but the thames valley beats it hollow as harry says this walk today is just ones ideal picture of miltons vallombrosa  ah yes i always look forward to the first days of october term said berkeley slowly as one of the greatest and purest treats in the whole round workaday twelvemonth  when the creeper on the founders tower first begins to redden and crimson in the autumn i could sit all day long by my open window and just look at that glorious sight alone instead of having my dinner but im very fond of these walks in full summer time too i often stop up alone all through the long being tied to my curacy here permanently you know and then i have the run of the place entirely to myself sometimes i take my flute out and sit under the shade here and compose some of my little pieces  i can easily understand that they were composed here said edie quickly theyve caught exactly the flavour of the placeespecially your exquisite little penseroso  ah you know my music then miss oswald  oh yes harry always brings me home all your pieces whenever he comes back at the end of term i can play every one of them without the notes but the penseroso is my special favourite  its mine too im so glad you like it but im working  away at a little thing now which you shall hear as soon as ive finished it something lighter and daintier than  anything else ive ever attempted i shall call it the butterfly canzonet  why dont you publish your music under your own name mr berkeley  oh because it would never do im a parson now and i must keep up the dignity of the cloth by fighting shy of any aesthetic heterodoxies it would be professional suicide for me to be suspected of artistic leanings all very well in an archdeacon you know to cultivate his tastes for chants and anthems but for a simple curateand secular songs toowhy it would be sheer contumacy his chances of a living would shrink at once to what your brother would call a vanishing quantity  well you cant imagine how much i admire your songs and airs mr berkeley i was so pleased when you invited us to think i was going to lunch with a real composer  theres no music i love so much as yours  im very glad to hear it miss oswald i assure you  but im only a beginner and a trifler yet some day i mean to produce something that will be worth listening to only do you remember what some french novelist once saida poets sweetest poem is always the one he has never been able to compose i often think thats true of music too  away up in the higher stories of ones brain somewhere theres a tune floating about or rather a whole oratorio full of them that one can never catch and fix upon ruled paper the ideas there such a beautiful and vague idea so familiar to one but so utterly unrealisable on any known instrumenta sort of musical ariel flitting before one and tantalising one for ever but never allowing one to come up with it and see its real features im always dissatisfied with what ive actually written and longing to crystallise into a score the imaginary airs i can never catch except in this last piece of mine thats the only thing ive ever done that thoroughly and completely pleases me come and see me next week and ill play it over to you  they walked all round the meadows and back again beside the arches of the beautiful bridge and then returned to berkeleys rooms once more for a cup of afternoon tea and an air or two of berkeleys own composing edie  enjoyed the walk and the talk immensely she enjoyed the music even more in a way it was all so new to her for though she had always seen much of harry and though harry who was the kindest and proudest of brothers had always instinctively kept her up to his own level of thought and conversation still she wasnt used to seeing so many intelligent and educated young men together and the novelty of their society was delightfully exhilarating to her eager little mind to a bright girl of nineteen wherever she may come from the atmosphere of oxford has a wonderfully cheering and stimulating effect to a country tradesmans  daughter from a tiny westcountry village it is like a little paradise on earth with a ceaseless round of intensely enjoyable breakfasts luncheons dinners and waterparties  ernest for his part was not so well pleased he wanted to have a little conversation with oswalds sister and he was compelled by politeness to give her up in favour of arthur berkeley however he made up for it when he returned and monopolised the pretty little visitor himself for almost the entire teahour  as soon as they had gone arthur berkeley sported his oak and sat down by himself in his comfortable  crimsoncovered basket chair i wont let anybody come and disturb me this evening he said to himself moodily i wont let any of these noisy magdalen men come with their racket and riot to cut off the memory of that bright little dream no desecration after she has gone little miss butterfly what a pretty airy dainty delicate little morsel it is how she flits and sips and natters about every possible subject just touching the tip of it so gracefully with her tiny white fingers and blushing so unfeignedly when she thinks shes paid you a compliment or youve paid her one how she blushed when she said she liked my music how she blushed when i said she had a splendid ear for minute discrimination  somehow if i were a fallinginlove sort of fellow i half fancy i could manage to fall in love with her on the spot  or rather if i were a good analytical psychologist perhaps i ought more correctly to say i am in love with her already  he sat down idly at the piano and played a few bars softly to himselfa beautiful airy sort of melody as it shaped itself vaguely in his head at the moment with a little of the new wine of first love running like a trill through the midst of its fastflowing quavers and dainty undulations  that will do he said to himself approvingly that will do very well thats little miss butterfly here she flits flits flits flickers sip sip sip at her honeyed flowers twirl away whirl away off in the sunshinethere you go miss butterfly eddying and circling with your painted mate  flirt flirt flirt coquetting and curvetting in your pretty rhythmical aërial quadrille down again down to the harebell on the hill side sip at it sip at it sip at it sweet little honeydrops clear little honeydrops bright little honeydrops oh for a song to be set to the melody tralala trololo up again butterfly little silk handkerchief little lace neckerchief fluttering fluttering feathery wings of her bright little eyes of her flit flit flicker now she blushes blushes blushes deep crimson oh what a colour  paint it painter now she speaks oh what laughter  silvery silvery treble treble treble trill away trill away silvery treble musical beautiful beautiful musical little miss butterflyflyflyfly away and he brought his fingers down upon the gamut at last with a hasty flickering touch that seemed really as delicate as edies own  i can never get words for it in english he said again half speaking with his parted lips its too dactylic in rhythm for english verse to go to it béranger might have written a lilt for it as far as mere syllables go but béranger to write about miss butterflypho no frenchman could possibly catch it swinburne could fit the metres i dare say but he couldnt fit the feeling it shall be a song without words unless i write some italian lines for it myself animula blandula vagulathats the sort of ring for it but latins mostly too heavy io hymen hymenae io io hymen hymenae whats that a wedding song of catullusabsit omen i must be in love with her indeed he got up from the piano and paced quickly and feverishly up and down the room  and yet he went on if only i werent bound down so by this unprofitable trade of parson a curate on eighty pounds a year and a few pupils the presumptuousness of the man in venturing to think of falling in love as if he were actually one of the beneficed clergy what are deacons coming to i wonder and yet hath not a deacon eyes hath not a deacon hands organs dimensions senses affections passions  if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh and if you show us a little miss butterfly beautiful to the fingerends do we not fall in love with her at least as unaffectedly as if we were canons residentiary or rural deans fancy little miss butterfly a rural deaness  the notions too ridiculous fly away little miss butterfly fly away sweet little frolicsome laughsome creature i wont try to tie you down to a man in a black clerical coat with a very distant hypothetical reversionary prospect of a dull and dingy country parsonage flit elsewhere little miss butterfly  flit elsewhere and find yourself a gayer gaudiercoloured mate  he sat down again and strummed a few more bars of his halfcomposed halfextemporised melody then he leant back on the musicstool and said gently to himself once more still if it were possible how happy i should try to make her bright little miss butterfly i would try never to let a cold cloud pass chillily over your sunshiny head i would live for you and work for you and write songs for your sake all full of you you you and so all full of life and grace and thrilling music whats my life good for to me or to the world a clergymans life is such a useful one that amiable old conventionality gurgled out this morning whats the good of mine as it stands now to its owner or to anybody else i should like to know except the dear old progenitor a mere bit of cracked blue china a fanciful air from a comic opera masquerading in black and white as a piece of sacred music what good am i to anyone on earth but the progenitor god bless him and when hes gone dear old fellow what on earth shall i have left to live for a selfish blank thats all but with her ah how different with her to live for and to cherish with an object to set before oneself as worth ones consideration what mightnt i do at last make her happyafter all thats the great thing make her fond of my music that music that floats and evades me now but would harden into scores as if by magic with her to help one to spell it outi know it would at last i know it would ah well perhaps some day i may be able perhaps some day the dream will realise itself till then work work work let me try to work towards making it possible a living or a livelihood no matter which  but not a breath of it to you meanwhile miss butterfly flit about freely and joyously while you may i would not spoil your untrammelled flight for worlds by trying to tether it too soon around the fixed centre of my own poor doubtful diaconal destinies  at the same moment while arthur berkeley was thus garrulously conversing with his heated fancy harry and edie oswald were strolling lazily down the high to edies lodgings  well what do you think now of berkeley and le breton edie asked her brother which of them do you like the best  i like them both immensely harry i really cant choose between them when mr berkeley plays he almost makes me fall in love with him and when mr le breton talks he almost makes me transfer my affections to him instead but mr berkeley plays divinely and mr le breton talks beautifully you know ive never seen such clever men beforeexcept you of course harry dear for youre cleverer and nicer than anybody oh do let me look at those lovely silks over there and she danced across the road before he could answer her like a tripping sylph in a painters dreamland  mr le bretons very nice she went on after she had duly examined and classified the silks but i dont exactly understand what it is hes got on his conscience  nothing whatsoever except the fact of his own existence harry answered with a laugh he has conscientious scruples against the existence of idle people in the communitydonothings and eatallsand therefore he has conscientious scruples against himself for not immediately committing suicide i believe if he did exactly what he thought was abstractly right hed go away and cut his own throat incontinently for an unprofitable unproductive useless citizen  oh dear i hope hell do nothing of the sort cried edie hastily i think i shall really ask him not to for my sake if not for anybody elses  hed be very much flattered indeed by your interposition on his behalf no doubt popsy but im afraid it wouldnt produce much effect upon his ultimate decision  tell me harry is mr berkeley high church  oh dear no i shouldnt say so i dont suppose he ever gave the subject a single moments consideration  but st fredegonds is very high church im told  ah yes but berkeleys curate of st fredegonds not in virtue of his theologyi never heard hed got any to speak ofbut in virtue of his musical talents he went into the church i suppose on purely aesthetic grounds he liked a musical service and it seemed natural to him to take part in one just as it seemed natural to a mediaeval italian with artistic tendencies to paint madonnas and st sebastians  theres nothing more in his clerical coat than that i fancy edie he probably never thought twice about it on theological grounds  oh but thats very wrong of him harry i dont mean having no particular theological beliefs of course one  expects that nowadays but going into the church without them  well you see edie you mustnt judge berkeley in quite the same way as youd judge other people in his mind the aesthetic side is always uppermost the logical side is comparatively in abeyance questions of creed questions of philosophical belief questions of science dont interest him at all he looks at all of them from the point of view of the impression alone what he sees in the church is not a body of dogmas like the high churchmen nor a set of opinions like the low churchmen but a close  corporation of educated and cultivated gentlemen charged with the duty of caring for a number of beautiful mediaeval  architectural monuments and of carrying on a set of grand and impressive musical or oral services to him a cathedral is a magnificent historical heritage a sermon is a sort of  ingenious literary exercise and a hymn is a capital vehicle for very solemn emotional music thats all and we can hardly blame him for not seeing these things as we should see them  well harry i dont know i like them both immensely  mr berkeleys very nice but perhaps i like mr  le breton the best of the two    chapter v  askelon villa gath   number 28 epsilon terrace bayswater was one of the very smallest houses that a person with any pretensions to move in that society which habitually spells itself with a capital initial could ever possibly have dreamt of condescending  to inhabit indeed if dame eleanor relict of the late sir owen le breton knight had consulted merely the length of her purse and the interests of her personal comfort she would doubtless have found for the same rental a far more convenient and roomy cottage in upper clapton or stoke newington but lady le breton was a thoroughly and conscientiously religious woman who in all things  consulted first and foremost the esoteric interests of her  ingrained creed it was a prime article of this cherished social faith that nobody with any shadow of personal  selfrespect could endure to live under any other postal letter than w or sw better not to be at all than to drag out a miserable existence in the painful obscurity of n or se happily for people situated like lady le breton the metropolitan housecontractor it would be gross flattery to describe  him as a builder has divined with his usual practical sagacity the necessity for supplying this felt want for eligible family residences at once comparatively cheap and relatively fashionable by driving little culsdesac and reentrant alleys at the back of his larger rows of shoddy mansions he is enabled to run up a smaller terrace or crescent or place as the case may be composed of tiny shallow cottages with the narrowest possible frontage and the tallest possible elevation which will yet entitle their occupiers to feel themselves within the sacred pale of social salvation in the blest security of the mystic w narrowest shallowest and tallest of these marginal society residences is the little block of blankfaced stuccofronted porticoed rabbithutches which blazons itself forth in the court guide under the imposing designation of epsilon terrace bayswater  the interior of no 28 in this eminently respectable back alley was quite of a piece it must be confessed with the vacant philistinism of its naked exterior mother has really an immense amount of taste herbert le breton used to say blandly and all of it of the most atrocious description she picked it up i believe when my poor father was quartered at lahore a station absolutely fatal to the aesthetic faculties and she will never get rid of it again as long as she lives indeed when once lady le breton got anything whatsoever into her head it was not easy for anybody else to get it out again you might much more readily expect to draw one of her double teeth than to eliminate one of her pet opinions not that she was a stupid or a nearsighted womanthe mother of clever sons never isbut she was a perfectly immovable rock of social and political orthodoxy the three le breton boysfor there was a third at homewould gladly have reformed the terrors of that awful drawingroom if they had dared but they knew it was as much as their places were worth herbert said to attempt a remonstrance and they wisely left it alone and said nothing  of course the house was not vulgarly furnished at least in the conventional sense of the word lady le breton was far too rigid in her social orthodoxy to have admitted into her rooms anything that savoured of what she considered bad form according to her lights it was only vulgar with the underlying vulgarity of mere tasteless fashionable uniformity there was nothing in it that any wellbred footman  could object to nothing that anybody with one grain of genuine originality could possibly tolerate the little occasional chairs and tables set casually about the room were of the strictest négligé belgravian type a sort of studied protest against the formal stiffness of the ordinary unused middleclass drawingroom the portrait of the late sir owen in the wee library presented by his brotherofficers was painted by that distinguished r a sir francis thomson a light of the middle of this century and an excellent work of art it was too in its own solemn academic kind the diningroom tiny as it was possessed that inevitable canaletti without which no gentlemans diningroom in england is ever considered to be complete everything spoke at once the stereotyped society style of a dozen years ago before mr morris had reformed the outer aspect of the west end entirely free from anything so startling or indecorous as a gleam of spontaneity in the possessors mind to be sure it was very far indeed from the centre roundtable and brilliantfloweredtablecover style of the utter unregenerate philistine household but it was further still from the simple natural taste acd graceful fancy of edie oswalds cosy little back parlour behind the village grocers shop at calcombepomeroy  the portrait and the canaletti were relics of lady le bretons best days when sir owen was alive and the boys were still in their first babyhood sir owen was an indian officer of the old school a simpleminded gentle brave man very religious after his own fashion and an excellent soldier with the true angloindian faculty for administration and organisation it was partly from him no doubt that the boys inherited their marked intelligence and it was wholly from him beyond any doubt at all that ernest and his younger brother ronald inherited their moral or religious sincerityfor that was an element in which poor formally orthodox lady le breton was wholly deficient the good general had been brought up in the strictest doctrines of the clapham sect he had gone to india young as a cadet from haileybury and he had applied his intellect all his life long rather to the arduous task of extending the blessings of british rule to sikhs and ghoorkas than to those abstract ethical or theological questions which agitated the souls of a later generation if a new district had to be assimilated in settlement to the established model of the british raj if a tribe of hillsavages had to be conciliated by gentler means than rifles or bayonets if a difficult bit of diplomatic duty had to be performed on the debateable frontiers sir owen le breton was always the person chosen to undertake it  an earnest honest godfearing man he remained to the end impressed by a profound sense of duty as he understood  it and a firm conviction that his true business in life consisted in serving his queen and country and in bringing more and more of the native populations within the pale of the companys empire and the future evangelisation that was ultimately to follow but during the great upheaval of the mutiny he fell at the head of his own unrevolted regiment in one of the hottest battles of that terrible time and my lady le breton found herself left alone with three young children on little more than the scanty pension of a general officers widow on the late companys establishment  happily enough remained to bring up the boys with the aid of their terminable annuities which fell in on their attaining their majority in decent respect for the feelings and demands of exacting society and as the two elder were decidedly clever boys they managed to get scholarships  at oxford which enabled them to tide over the dangerous  intermediate period as far as their degree herbert then stepped at once into a fellowship and sundry other good things of like sort and ernest was even now trying to follow in his brothers steps in this particular only the youngest boy ronald still remained quite unprovided for  ronald was a tall pale gentle weakly enthusiastic young fellow of nineteen with so marked a predisposition to lung disease that it had not been thought well to let him run the chance of overreading himself and so he had to be content with remaining at home in the uncongenial atmosphere of epsilon terrace instead of joining his two elder brothers at the university uncongenial because ronald alone followed sir owen in the religious half of his nature and found the worldliness and conventionality of his unflinching mother a serious bar to his enjoyment of home society  ronald said my lady at the breakfasttable on the very morning of arthur berkeleys little luncheon party heres a letter for you from mackenzie and anderson no doubt your aunt sarahs will has been recovered and proved at last and i hope itll turn out satisfactory as we wish it  for my part i really almost hope it wont mother said ronald turning it over for i dont want to be  compelled to profit by ernests excessive generosity hes too good to me just because he thinks me the weaker vessel but though we must bear one anothers burdens you know we should each bear his own cross as well shouldnt we mother  well it cant be much in any case said his mother a little testily whoever gets it open the envelope at once my boy and dont stand looking at it like a goose in that abstracted way  oh mother she was my fathers only sister and im not in such a hurry to find out how she has disposed of her mere perishing worldly goods answered ronald gravely  it seems to me a terrible thing that before poor dear good aunt sarah is cold in her grave almost we should be  speculating and conjecturing as to what she has done with her poor little trifle of earthly riches  its always usual to read the will immediately after the funeral said lady le breton firmly to whom the ordinary usage of society formed an absolutely unanswerable  argument and how you ronald who havent even the common decency to wear a bit of crape around your arm for hera thing that ernest himself with all his nonsensical theories consents to docan talk in that absurd way about whats quite right and proper to be done i for my part really cant imagine  ah but you know mother i object to wearing crape on the ground that it isnt allowable for us to sorrow as them that have no hope and im sure im paying no disrespect  to dear aunt sarahs memory in this matter for she was always the first herself you remember to wish that i should follow the dictates of my own conscience  i remember she always upheld you in acts of opposition to your own mother ronald lady le breton said coldly and i suppose youre going to do honour to her religious precepts now by not opening that letter when your mother tells you to do so in my bible sir i find a place for the fourth commandment  ronald looked at her gently and unreprovingly but though a quiet smile played involuntarily around the corners of his mouth he resisted the natural inclination to correct her mistake and to suggest blandly that she probably alluded to the fifth he knew he must turn his left cheek alsoa christian virtue which he had abundant opportunities  of practising in that household and he felt that to score off his mother for such a verbal mistake as the one she had just made would not be in keeping with the spirit of the commandment to which no doubt she meant to refer him so without another word he opened the envelope and glanced rapidly at the contents of the letter it enclosed  theyve found the second will he said after a moment with a rather husky voice and theyre taking steps to get it confirmed whatever that may be  broad scotch for getting probate i believe said lady le breton in a slight tone of irony for to her mind any departure from the laws or language she was herself  accustomed to use assumed at once the guise of a rank and offensive provincialism your poor aunt would go and marry a scotchman and he a scotch business man too so of course we must expect to put up with all kinds of  ridiculous technicalities and edinburgh jargon accordingly all laws bad enough in the way of odd words but commend me to scotch law for utter and meaningless incomprehensibility  well and what does the second will say ronald  there mother cried ronald flinging the letter down hurriedly with a burst of tears read it yourself if you will for i cant poor dear aunt sarah and dear good unselfish ernest it makes me cry even to think of them  lady le breton took the paper up from the table without a word and read it carefully through i am very glad to hear it she said very glad indeed to hear it and in order to guard against any misinterpretation of my reasons for making this disposition of my property your aunt says i wish to put it on record that i had previously drawn up another will bequeathing my effects to be divided between my two nephews ernest and ronald le breton equally that i communicated the contents of that willa horrid scotticismto my nephew ernest and that at his express desire i have now revoked it and drawn up this present testament leaving the share intended for him to his brother ronald why she never even mentions dear herbert  she knew that herbert had provided for himself ronald answered raising his head from his hands while ernest and i were unprovided for but ernest said he could fight the world for himself while i couldnt and that unearned wealth ought only to be accepted in trust for those who were incapacitated by nature or misfortune from earning  their own bread i dont always quite agree with all ernests theories any more than you do but we must both admit that at least he always conscientiously acts up to them himself mother mustnt we  its a very extraordinary thing lady le breton went on that aunt sarah invariably encouraged both you boys in all your absurdities and quixotisms she was quixotic herself at heart thats the truth of it just like your poor dear father i remember once when we were quartered at meean meer in the punjaub poor dear sir owen nearly got into disgrace with the colonelhe was only a sub in those daysbecause he wanted to go trying to convert his syces which was a most imprudent thing to do and directly opposed to the companys orders aunt sarah was just the same herberts the only one of you three who has never given me one moments anxiety and of course poor herbert must be passed over in absolute silence however im very glad shes left the money to you ronald as you need it the most and mackenzie and anderson say itll come to about a hundred and sixty a year  one can do a great deal of good with that much money said ronald meditatively i mean after arranging with you mother for the expenses of my maintenance at home which of course i shall do as soon as the pension ceases and after meeting ones own necessary expenditure in the way of clothing and so forth its more than any one christian man ought to spend upon himself im sure  its not at all too much for a young man in your position in society ronald but therei know youll want to spend half of it on indiscriminate charity however therell be time enough to talk about that when youve actually got it thank goodness  ronald murmured a few words softly to himself of which lady le breton only caught the last echolaid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need  just like ernests communistic notions she murmured in return half audibly i do declare between them both a plain woman hardly knows whether shes standing on her head or on her heels i live in daily fear that one or other of them will be taken up by the police for being implicated in some dynamite plot or other to blow up the queen or destroy the houses of parliament ronald smiled again gently but answered nothing theres another letter for you there though with the exmoor coronet upon it why dont you open it i hope its an invitation for you to go down and stop at dunbude for a week or two nothing on earth would do you so much good as to get away for a while from your ranters and canters and mix occasionally in a little decent and rational society  ronald took up the second letter with a sigh he feared as much himself and had doleful visions of a painful fortnight to be spent in a big country house where the conversation would be all concerning the slaughter of pheasants and the torture of foxes which his soul loathed to listen to its from lady hilda he said glancing through it and it isnt an invitation after all he could hardly keep down a faint tone of gratification as he discovered this reprieve heres what she says  dear mr le bretonmamma wishes me to write and tell you that lynmouths tutor mr walsh is going to leave us at christmas and she thinks it just possible that one of your two brothers at oxford might like to come down to dunbude and give us their kind aid in taking charge of lynmouth hes a dreadful pickle as you know but we are very anxious to get somebody to look after him in whom mamma can have perfect confidence we dont know your brothers addresses or we would have written to them direct about it perhaps you will kindly let them hear this  suggestion and if they think the matter worth while we might afterwards arrange details as to business and so forth with kind regards to lady le breton believe me  yours very sincerely  hilda tregellis  my dear ronald said lady le breton much more warmly than before this is really quite providential are they at dunbude now  no mother she writes from wilton place theyre up in town for lord exmoors gout i know i heard they were on sunday  then i shall go and see lady exmoor this very morning about it its exactly the right place for ernest a little good society will get rid of all his nonsensical notions in a month or two hes lived too exclusively among his radical set at oxford and then itll be such a capital thing for him to be in the house continually with hilda shes a girl of such excellent tone i fancyim not quite sure but i fancythat ernest has a decided taste for the company of people and even of young girls who are not in society hes so fond of that young man oswald who herbert tells me is positively the son of a groceryes im sure he said a grocerand it seems from what herbert writes me that this oswald has brought a sister of his up this term from behind the counter on purpose to set her cap at ernest  now you boys have unfortunately no sisters and therefore you havent seen as much of girls of a good stampnot daily and domestically i meanas is desirable for you from the point of view of society but if ernest can only be induced to take this tutorship at the exmoors hell have an  opportunity of meeting daily with a really nice girl like hilda and though of course it isnt likely that hilda would take a fancy to her brothers tutorthe exmoors are such very  conservative people in matters of rank and wealth and family and so forthquite unchristianly so i consideryet it cant fail to improve ernests tone a great deal and raise his standard of female society generally its really a very distressing thought to me ronald that all my boys except dear herbert should show such a marked preference for low and vulgar companionship it seems to me you both positively prefer as far as possible the society of your natural inferiors theres ernest must go and take up with the friendship of that snuffy old german socialist glasscutter while you are always running after your plymouth brethren and your bible christians and your other ignorant fanatical people instead of going with me respectably to st alpheges to hear the dear archdeacon its very discouraging to a mother really very discouraging    chapter vi  down the river   berkeley couldnt come today le breton its thursday of course i forgot about it altogether oswald said on the barge at salters you know he pays a mysterious flying visit to town every thursday afternoonto see an imprisoned ladylove i always tell him  its very late in the season for taking ladies on the water miss oswald said ernest putting his oar into the rowlock and secretly congratulating himself on the deliverance  but better go now than not see iffley church and nuneham woods at all you ought to have come up in summer term and let us have the pleasure of showing you over the place when it was in its full leafy glory mays decidedly the time to see oxford to the greatest advantage  so harry tells me and he wanted me to come up then but it wasnt convenient for them at home to spare me just at that moment so i was obliged to put it off till late in the autumn i have to help my mother a good deal in the house you know and i cant always go dancing about the world whenever i should like to which string must i pull harry to make her turn into the middle of the river she always seems to twist round the exact way i dont want her to  right right hard right cried harry irom the bowthey were in a tub pair bound down the river for iffley  keep to the oxfordshire shore as far as the willows then cross over to the berkshire le bretonll tell you when and where to change sides he knows the river as well as i do  thatll do splendidly for the present ernest said looking ahead over his shoulder mind the flags there dont go too near the corner you certainly ought to see these meadows in early spring when the fritillaries are all out over the spongy places miss oswald has your brother ever sent you any of the fritillaries  what snakeheads oh boxes full of them theyre lovely flowers but not lovelier than our own devonshire daffodils you should see a devonshire watermeadow in april why dont you come down some time to calcombe pomeroy its the dearest little peaceful seaside corner in all england  harry bit his lip for he was not overfond of bringing people down to spy out his domestic sanctities but ernest answered cordially i should like it above everything in the world miss oswald if you will let me i certainly shall as soon as possible mind quick get out of the way of that practising eight or we shall foul her left as hard as you can thatll do the cox was getting as red as a salamander till he saw it was a lady steering when coxes catch a man fouling them their language is apt to be highly unparliamentaryyes i shall try to get away to calcombe as soon as ever i can manage to leave oxford it wouldnt surprise me if i were to run down and spend christmas there  youd find it as dull as ditchwater at christmas le breton said harry much better wait till next summer  im sure i dont think so harry dear edie interrupted with that telltale blush of hers if mr le breton wants to come then i believe hed really find it quite delightful  of course he wouldnt expect theatres or dances or anything  like that in a country village and were dreadfully busy just about christmas day itself sending out orders and all that sort of thingharry bit his lip againbut if you dont mind a very quiet place and a very quiet time mr le breton i dont think myself our cliffs ever look grander or our sea more impressive than in stormy winter weather  i wish to goodness she wasnt so transparently candid and guileless thought harry to himself i never can teach her duly to respect the prejudices of pi not that it matters twopence to le breton of course but if she talks that way to any of the other men here theyll be laughing in every commonroom in oxford over my christmas raisins and pounds of sugarcommonplace cynics that they are i must tell her about it the moment we get home again and adjure her by all thats holy not to repeat the indiscretion  a penny for your thoughts harry cried edie seeing by his look that she had somehow vexed him what are you thinking of  thinking that all oxford men are horrid cynics said harry boldly shaming the devil  why are they edie asked  i suppose because its an inexpensive substitute for wit or intellect harry answered indeed im a bit of a cynic myself i believe for the same reason and on strictly  economical principles it saves one the trouble of having any intelligible or original opinion of ones own upon any subject  below iffley lock they landed for half an hour in order to give edie time for a pencil sketch of the famous old norman churchtower with its quaint variations on the dogtooth ornament and its ancient cross and mouldering yewtree behind harry sat below in the boat propped on the cushions reading the last number of the nineteenth century  ernest and edie took their seat upon the bank above and had a first chance of an unbroken têteàtête  how delicious to live in oxford always said edie sketching in the first outline of the great round arches i would give anything to have the opportunity of settling here for life some day i shall make harry set up house and bring me up here as his housekeeperi mean she added with a blush thinking of harrys warning look just before as soon as they can spare me from home she purposely avoided saying when they retire from business the first phrase that sprang naturally to her simple little lips let me see mr le breton you havent got any permanent appointment here yourself have you  oh no ernest answered no appointment of any sort at all miss oswald im loitering up casually on the  lookout for a fellowship ive been in for two or three already but havent got them  why didnt you asked edie with a look of candid surprise  i suppose i wasnt clever enough ernest answered simply not so clever i mean as the men who actually got them  oh but you must be edie replied confidently and a great deal cleverer too im sure i know you must because harry told me you were one of the very cleverest men in the whole varsity and besides i see you are myself and harry says most of the men who get fellowships are really great donkeys  harry must have been talking in one of those cynical moods he told us about said ernest laughing at any rate the examiners didnt feel satisfied with my papers and ive never got a fellowship yet perhaps they thought my political economy just a trifle too advanced for them  you may depend upon it thats it said edie jumping at the conclusion with the easy omniscience of a girl of nineteen next time make your political economy a little more moderate you know without any sacrifice of principle just to suit them what fellowship are you going in for now  pembroke in november  oh i do hope youll get it  thank you very much so do i it would be very nice to have one  but of course it wont matter so much to you as it did to harry your family are such very great people arent they  ernest smiled a broad smile at her delicious simplicity  if by very great people you mean rich he said we couldnt very well be poorerfor people of our sort i mean my mother lives almost entirely on her pension and we boys have only been able to come up to oxford just as harry was by the aid of our scholarships if we hadnt saved in our first two years while we had our government allowances we shouldnt have been able to stop up for our degrees at all  so if i dont get a fellowship i shall have to take to schoolmastering  or something of the sort for a livelihood indeed this at pembroke will be my very last chance for i cant hold on much longer  and if you got a fellowship you could never marry could you asked edie going on with her work  not while i held it certainly but i wouldnt hold it long i regard it only as a makeshift for a time unhappily i dont know how to earn my own bread by the labour of my hands as i think we ought all to do in a wellconstituted society so unless i choose to starve about the rightfulness of which i dont feel quite certain i must manage somehow to get over the interval but as soon as i could i would try to find some useful work to do in which i could repay society the debt i owe it for my bringing up you see ive been fed and educated by a government grant which of course came out of the taxesyour people have had to help whether they would or not in paying for my board and lodgingand i feel that i owe it as a duty to the world to look out some employment in which i could really repay it for the cost of my maintenance  how funnily you do look at everything mr le breton said edie it would never have struck me to think of a pension from the army in that light and yet of course its the right light only we dont most of us take the trouble to go to the bottom of things as you do but what will you do if you dont get the fellowship  in that case ive just heard from my mother that she would like me to take a tutorship at lord exmoors ernest answered lynmouth their eldest son was my junior at school by six or seven years and now hes going to prepare for christ church i dont quite know whether its a right place for me to accept or not but i shall ask max schurz about it if i dont get pembroke i always take herr maxs advice in all questions of conscience for im quite sure whatever he approves of is the thing one ought to do for the greatest good of humanity  harry told me about herr schurz edie said filling in the details of the doorway he thinks him a very earnest selfconvinced good old man but a terrible revolutionist  for my part i believe i rather like revolutionists provided of course they dont cut off peoples heads harry made me read carlyle and i positively fell in love with camille desmoulins only i dont really think he ought to have approved of quite so much guillotining do you but why shouldnt you take the tutorship at the exmoors  oh because it isnt a very useful work in the world to prepare a young hereditary loafer like lynmouth for going to christ church lynmouth will be just like his father when he grows upan amiable wholesale partridgeslayer and i dont see that the world at large will be any the better or the worse off for his being able to grope his way somehow through two plays of sophocles and the first six books of euclid if only one were a shoemaker now what a delightful thing to sit down at the end of a day and say to oneself i have made two pairs of good honest boots for a fellowmortal this week and now i deserve to have my supper still itll be better anyway than doing nothing at all and living off my mother  if you went to dunbude when would you go  after the christmas vacation i suppose from what lady hilda says  lady hilda oh so theres a sister is there  yes a very pretty girl about twenty i should say and rather clever too i believe my mother knows them a little  poor little edie what made her heart jump so at the mere mention of lady hilda and what made the last few strokes at the top of the broken yewtree look so very weak and shaky how absurd of herself she thought to feel so much moved at hearing that there was another girl in the world whom ernest might possibly fall in love with and yet she had never even seen ernest only ten days ago  lady hilda what a grand name to be sure and what a grand person she must be and then ernest himself belonged  by birth to the same class for in poor little edies mind innocent as she was of the nice distinctions of the peerage lady soandso was lady soandso still whoever she might be from the wife of a premier marquis to the wife of the latest created knight bachelor to her lady hilda tregellis and lady le breton were both ladies of title and the difference between their positions which seemed so immense to ernest seemed nothing at all to the merry little country girl who sat sketching beside him after all how could she ever have even vaguely fancied that such a young man as ernest in spite of all his socialistic whims would ever dream of caring for a girl of the people like her no doubt he would go to the exmoors fall naturally in love with lady hilda and marry decorously in what edie considered  his own proper sphere of life she went on with the finishing touches of her little picture in silence and folded it up into the tiny portfolio at last with a halfuttered sigh  so her poor wee castle in the air was knocked down before she had begun to build it up in any real seriousness and she turned to join harry in the boat almost without speaking  i hope youll get the pembroke fellowship she said again a little later as they rowed onward down the river to nuneham but in any case mr le breton you mustnt forget youve half promised to come and look us up at calcombe pomeroy in the christmas vacation  ernest smiled and nodded acquiescence  meanwhile on that same thursday afternoon arthur berkeley had gone up from oxford by the fast train to  paddington as was his weekly wont and had dived quickly down one of the small lanes that open out from the lefthand side of praed street he walked along it for a little way humming an air to himself as he went and then stopped at last in front of a small decent brick house with a clean muslin blind across the window clean muslin forms a notable object in most london back streets and a printed card hanging from the central pane bearing the inscription g berkeley working shoemakerthe trade supplied with readyclosed uppers at the window a beaming face was watching for his appearance and arthur said to himself as he saw it through the curtain the dear old progenitors looking better again this week god bless him in a moment he had opened the door and greeted his father in the old boyish fashion with an honest kiss on either cheek they had kissed one another so whenever they met  from arthurs childhood upward and the oxford curate had never felt himself grown too much of a man to keep up a habit which seemed to him by far the most sacred thing in his whole existence  well father dear i neednt ask you how you are today said arthur seating himself comfortably in the second easychair of the trim little workshop parlour i can see at once youre a good deal better any more pain in the head and eyes eh or any trouble about the forehead  the old shoemaker passed his hand over his big bulging brow bent outward as it is so often in men of his trade by the constant habit of stooping over their work and said briskly no artie my boy not a sign of it this weeknot a single sign of it ive been taking a bit of holiday you see and its done me a lot of good i can tell youmade me feel another man entirely ive been playing my violin till the neighbours began to complain of it and if i hadnt asked them to come and hear me tune up a bit i really believe theyd have been having me up before the magistrate for a public nuisance  thats right daddy dear im always glad when youve been having a little music it does you more good than anything and the jellyi hope youve eaten the jelly  oh ive eaten it right enough artie thank your dear heart and the soup too dearie came by a boy from walterss every day addressed to berkeley esquire 42 whalley street and the boy wouldnt leave it the first day because he thought there must have been a mistake about the address his contention was that a journeyman shoemaker wasnt an esquire and my contention was that the berkeley was essential and the esquire accidental  which was beyond his logic bless you artie for ive often noticed my son that your errandboy is a naturally illogical and contradictory creature now shoemakers arent you know ive always taken a just pride in the profession and ive always asserted that it develops logic it develops logic artie or else why are all cobblers good liberals i should like to know eh can you tell me that with all your oxford training sir can you tell me that  it develops logic beyond the possibility of a doubt  daddy and it develops a good kind heart as well said arthur smiling and it develops musical taste and literary talent and a marked predilection for the beautiful in art and nature in fact whenever i meet a good man of any sort anywhere i always begin now by inquiring which of his immediate ancestors can have been a journeyman shoemaker  depend upon it daddy theres nothing like leather  there you are poking fun at your poor old progenitor again said the old cobbler with a merry twinkle in the corner of his eye if it werent for the jelly and the natural affections always engendered by shoemaking i think i should almost feel inclined to cut you off with a shilling artie my boyto cut you off with a shilling well artie im quite convalescent now dont you call it im afraid of my long shoemakers words before you nowadays youve grown so literary for i suppose parsons are more literary than even shoemakers im quite convalescent now and i think my boy i must get to work again this week and have no more of your expensive soups and jellies if i didnt keep a sharp lookout upon you artie lad i believe youd starve yourself outright up there at oxford to pamper your poor old useless father here with luxuries hes never been accustomed to in his whole life  my dear simple old progenitor you dont know how utterly youre mistaken cried arthur eagerly i believe im really the most selfish and unnatural son in all christendom  im positively rolling in wealth up there at magdalen ive had my room papered again since you saw it last long vacation and i live like a prince absolutely like a russian prince upon my present income i assure you on my solemn word of honour father that i eat meat for lunchthats my dinnerevery day and an egg for tea as regular as clockwork i often think when i look around my palatial rooms in college what a shame it is that i should let you who are worth ten of me any day live any longer in a back street up here in london and i wont allow it daddy i really wont allow it from this day forth im determined  ive come up especially to speak to you about it this  afternoon for ive made up my mind that this abnormal state of things cant continuevery good word abnormal  murmured his fatherand ive also made up my mind arthur said almost firmly for him that you shall come up and live at oxford i cant bear having you so far away from me now that youre weaker than you used to be father dear and so often ailing  the old shoemaker laughed aloud oh no artie my boy he said cheerily shaking his head with a continuous series of merry chuckles it wont do at all it wont do i assure you i may be a terrible freethinker and all that kind of thing as the neighbours say i ampoor bodies they never read a word of modern criticism in their lives heaven bless emstragglers from the march of intellect mere stragglersbut ive too much respect for the cloth to bring a curate of st fredegonds into such disgrace as that would mean for you artie you shant have your career at oxford spoiled by its being said of you that your father was a  working shoemaker what with the readyclosed uppers and what with your ten shillings a week and what with all the presents you give me and what with the hire of the piano im as comfortable as ever i want to be growing into a gentleman in my old age artie and i even begin to have my doubts as to whether its quite consistent in me as a good radical to continue my own acquaintance with myselfim getting to be such a regular idle donothing aristocrat go to oxford and mend shoes indeed with you living there as a fullfledged parson in your own rooms at magdalen no no i wont hear of it ill come up for a day or two in long vacation my boy as ive always done hitherto and take a room in holywell and look in upon you a bit accidentally so as not to shame you before the scouts who are a servile set of flunkeys incapable of understanding the elevated  feelings of a journeyman shoemaker but i wouldnt dream of going to live in the place any more than id dream of asking to be presented at court on the occasion of my receiving a commission for a pair of evening shoes for the queens head footman  father said arthur smiling youre absolutely incorrigible  such a dreadful old rebel against all constituted authority human and divine i never did meet in the course of my existence i believe youre really capable of arguing a point of theology against an archbishop but i dont want you to come up to oxford as a shoemaker i mean you to come up and live with me in rooms of our own out of college whenever i think of you dear fatheryou who are so infinitely nobler and better and truer and more really a gentleman than any other than i ever knew in my lifewhenever i think of you coming secretly up to oxford as if you were ashamed of yourself and visiting your own son by stealth in his rooms in college as if you were a dun coming to ask him for money instead of the person whom he delights to honourwhenever i think of it father it makes my cheeks burn with shame and i loathe myself for ever allowing you so to bemean your own frank true noble nature i oughtnt to permit it father i oughtnt to permit it and i wont permit it any longer  well you never would have permitted it artie if i hadnt compelled you for ive got all the prudence and common sense of the family bottled up here in my own forehead said the old man tapping his bulging brow significantly i dont deny that oxford may be an excellent school for greek and latin and philosophy and so forth but if you want prudence and sagacity and commonsense its a wellknown fact that theres nothing like the practice of making readyclosed uppers sir to develop em if id taken your advice my boy id have come up to visit you when you were an undergraduate and ruined your prospects at the very outset no no artie i shall stop here and stick to my last my dear boy stick to my last to the end of all things  you shall do nothing of the sort daddy that im determined upon arthur cried vehemently im not going to let you do any more shoemaking the time has come when you must retire and devote all your undivided energies to the constant study of modern criticism whether you come to oxford or stop in london ive made up my mind that you shant do another stroke of work as long as you live look here dear old daddy im getting to be a perfect millionaire i assure you do you see this fiver  well i got that for knocking out that last trashy little song for fradelli and it cost me no more trouble to compose it than to sit down and write the score out on a sheet of ruled paper im as rich as croesusmade a hundred and eighty pounds last year and expect to make over two hundred this one now if a man with that perfectly prodigious fortune cant afford to keep his own father in comfort and affluence what an absolute sybarite and gourmand of a fellow he must be himself  its a lot of money certainly artie said the old  shoemaker turning it over thoughtfully two hundred pounds is a lot of money but i doubt very much whether its more than enough to keep you up to the standard of your own society up there at oxford as john stuart mill says these things are all comparative to the standard of comfort of your class now artie i believe you have to stint yourself of things that everybody else about you has at oxford to keep me in luxuries i was never used to  my dear dad its only of the nature of a repayment cried arthur earnestly you slaved and sacrificed and denied yourself when i was a boy to send me to school without which i would never have got to oxford at all and you taught me music in your spare hours when you had any and i owe everything i have or am or ever will be to your unceasing and indefatigable kindness so now youve got to take repayment whether you will or not for i insist upon it and if you wont come up to oxford which perhaps would be an uncongenial place for you in many ways ill tell you what ill do daddy ill look out for a curacy  somewhere in london and well take a little house together and ill furnish it nicely and there we shall live sir whatever you say so not another word about it and now i want you to listen to the very best thing ive ever composed and tell me what you think of it  he sat down to the little hired cottage piano that occupied the corner of the neat small room and began to run his deft fingers lightly over the keys it was the butterfly fantasia  the father sat back in his red easychair listening with all his ears first critically then admiringly at last  enthusiastically as arthurs closing notes died away softly towards the end the old shoemakers delight could be restrained no longer artie he cried gloating over it thats music thats real music youre quite right my boy thats far and away the best thing youve ever written  its exquisiteso light so airy so unearthlike but artie theres more than that in it theres soul in it and i know what it means you dont deceive your poor old progenitor in a matter of musical inspiration i can tell you i know where you got that fantasia from as well as if id seen you getting it you got it out of your own heart my boy out of your own heart and the thing it says to me as plain as language is just thisyoure in love youre in love artie and theres no good denying it if any man ever wrote that fantasia without being in love at the timefirst loveecstasytremortiptoe of expectationwhy then i tell you music hasnt got such a thing as a tongue or a meaning in it  arthur looked at him gently and smiled but said nothing  will you tell me about her artie asked the old man caressingly laying his hand upon his sons arm  not now father not just now please some other time perhaps but not now i hardly know about it myself yet it may be somethingit may be nothing but at any rate it was peg enough to hang a fantasia upon youve surprised my little secret father and i dare say its no real secret at all but just a passing whiff of fancy if it ever comes to anything you shall know first of all the world about it now take out your violin theres a dear old dad and give me a tune upon it  the father took the precious instrument from its carefully covered case with a sort of loving reverence and began to play a piece of arthurs own composition from the moment the bow touched the chords it was easy enough to see whence the son got his musical instincts old george berkeley was a born musician and he could make his violin discourse to him with rare power of execution there they sat playing and talking at intervals till nearly eight when arthur went out hurriedly to catch the last train to oxford and left the old shoemaker once more to his weeks solitude not for much longer the curate whispered to himself as he got into his thirdclass carriage quickly not for much longer if i can help it a curacy in or near londons the only right thing for me to look out for    chapter vii  ghostly counsel   november came and with it came the pembroke fellowship examination ernest went in manfully and tried hard to do his best for somehow in spite of the immorality of fellowships he had a sort of floating notion in his head that he would like to get one because he was beginning to paint himself a little fancy picture of a home that was to be with a little fairy edie flitting through it and brightening it all delightfully with her dainty airy presence so he even went so far as to mitigate considerably the native truculence of his political economy paper after edies advicenot of course by making any suggestion of opinions he did not hold but by suppressing the tooprominent expression of those he actually believed in max schurzs name was not once mentioned throughout the whole ten or twelve pages of closely written foolscap gold and the proletariate was utterly ignored and in place of the strong meat served out for men by the apostles of socialism in the marylebone dancingsaloon ernest dished up for his examiners edification  merely such watery milk for babes as he had extracted from the eminently orthodox economical pages of fawcett mill and thorold rogers he went back to his rooms satisfied that he had done himself full justice and anxiously waited for the result to be duly announced on the saturday morning  was it that piece of latin prose too obviously modelled upon the annals of tacitus while the senior tutor was a confirmed ciceronian with the second philippic constitutionally  on the brain was it the greek verse containing one senarius with a long syllable before the caesura in the fifth foot as herbert pointed out to his brother on the very evening when that hideous oversightsay rather crimehad been openly perpetrated in plain black and white on a virgin sheet of innocent paper was it some faint ineffaceable savour of the schurzian economics peeping through in spite of all disguises like the garlic in an italian ragout from under the sedulous cloak of ricardos theory of rent  was it some flying rumour extraofficial and unconnected with the examination in any way to the effect that young le breton was a person of very dubious religious political and social orthodoxy or was it merely that fortunate  dispensation of providence whereby oxford almost invariably manages to let her best men slip unobserved through her fingers and so insures a decent crop of them to fill up her share of the passing vacancies in politics literature science and art heaven or the pembroke examiners alone can answer these abstruse and difficult questions but this much at least is certain that when ernest le breton went into the pembroke porters lodge on the predestined saturday he found another name than his placarded upon the notice board and turned back sick at heart and disappointed to his lonely lodgings there he spent an unhappy hour or two hewing down what remained of his little aerial castle offhand and then he went out for a solitary row upon the upper river endeavouring to work off his disappointment like a man with a good hard spell of muscular labour  edie had already returned to calcombepomeroy so in the evening he went to tell his misfortune to harry oswald  harry was really sorry to hear it for ernest was his best friend in oxford and he had hoped to have him settled close by youll stop up and try again for christ church in february wont you le breton he asked  no said ernest shaking his head a little gloomily i dont think i will its clear im not up to the oxford standard for a fellowship and i couldnt spend another term in residence without coming down upon my mother to pay my expensesa thing she cant easily afford to do so i suppose i must fall back for the present upon the exmoor tutorship thatll give me time to look about me till i can get something else to do and after all it isnt a bit more immoral than a fellowship when one comes to look it fairly in the face however i shall go first and ask herr maxs opinion upon the matter  im going to spend a fortnight in town in the christmas vac said oswald and i should like to go with you to maxs again if i may  ernest coloured up a little for he would have liked to invite oswald to his mothers house and yet he felt there were two reasons why he should not do so he must himself be dependent this time upon his mothers hospitality and he didnt think lady le breton would be perfectly cordial in her welcome to harry oswald  in the end however it was arranged that harry should engage rooms at his former lodgings in london and that ernest should take him once more to call upon the old socialist when he went to consult him on the question of conscience  for my part ernest said lady le breton to her son the morning after his return from oxford im not altogether sorry you didnt get this pembroke fellowship it would have kept you among the same set you are at present mixing in for an indefinite period of course now youll accept lady exmoors kind proposal i saw her about it the same morning  we got hildas letter and she offers 200l a year which of course is mere pocket money as your board and lodging are all found for you so to speak and youll have nothing to do but to dress and amuse yourself  well mother i shall see about it im going to consult herr schurz upon the subject this morning  herr schurz said lady le breton in her bitterest tone of irony it appears to me you make that snuffy old german microscope man your father confessor its very disagreeable to a mother to find that her sons instead of taking her advice about what is most material to their own interests should invariably go to confer with communist refugees and ignorant ranters ronald what is your programme if you please for this mornings annoyance  ronald with the fear of the fifth commandment steadily before his eyes took no notice of the last word and answered calmly you know mother this is the regular day for the missionhouse prayermeeting  the missionhouse prayermeeting i know nothing of the sort i assure you i dont keep a perfect calendar in my mind of all your meetings and your religious engagements  then i suppose i must go alone to the waltons to see mr  waltons watercolours  ill give up the prayermeeting if you wish it ronald answered with his unvarying meekness only im afraid i must walk very slowly my coughs rather bad this morning  no no ernest put in you mustnt dream of going ronald i couldnt allow you to walk so far on any account  ill put off my engagement with oswald who was going with me to herr schurzs and ill take you round to the waltons mother whenever you like  dear me dear me moaned lady le breton piteously pretending to wring her hands in ladylike and mitigated despair i cant do anything without its being made the opportunity for a scene it seems i shall not go to the waltons and i shall leave you both to follow your own  particular devices to your hearts content im sorry i proposed anything whatsoever im sure and i shall take care never to do such an imprudent thing again and her ladyship walked in her stateliest and most chilly manner out of the freezing little diningroom  its a great cross living always with poor mother ernest said ronald his eyes filling with tears as he spoke but we must try to bear with her you know for after all she leads a very lonely life herself because shes so very unsympathetic ernest took the spare white hand in his and smoothed it compassionately my dear dear ronald he said i know its hard for you i must try the best i can to make it a little easier  they walked together as far as the missionhouse arm in arm for though in some things the two young le bretons were wide apart as the poles in others they were fundamentally  at one in inmost spirit and even ronald in spite of his occasional little narrow sectarianisms felt the underlying unity of purpose no less than ernest he was one of those enthusiastic ethereal natures which care little for outer forms or ceremonies and nothing at all for churches and organisations  but love to commune as pure spirit with pure spirit living every day a life of ecstatic spirituality and never troubling themselves one whit about theological controversy or established religious constitutions as long as ronald le breton could read his greek testament every morning and talk face to face in their own tongue with the paul of first corinthians or the john of the epistles in the solitude of his own bedroom he was supremely indifferent about the serious question of freewill and foreknowledge or about the important question of apostolical succession or even about that other burning question of eternal punishment which was just then setting his own little sect of apostolic christian missioners roundly by the ears these things seemed to his enthusiastic mind mere fading echoes of an alien language all that he himself really cared for in religion was the constant sense of essential personal communion with that higher power which spoke directly to his soul all day long and always or the equally constant sense of moral exaltation which he drew from the reading of the written word in its own original language he had never become an apostolic christian he had grown up to be one unconsciously to himself  your son ronalds religion my dear lady le breton archdeacon  luttrell used often to say is i fear too purely emotional he cannot be made to feel sufficiently the necessity for a sound practical grasp of doctrinal christianity to ronald himself he might as well have talked about the necessity for a sound practical grasp of doctrinal buddhism and if ronald had really met a devout buddhist he would doubtless have found after half an hours conversation that they were at one in everything save the petty matter of dialect and vocabulary  at oswalds lodging ernest found his friend ready and waiting for him they went on together to the same street in marylebone as before and mounted the stair till they reached herr schurzs gloomy little workroom on the third floor the old apostle was seated at his small table by the halfopen window grinding the edges of a lens to fit the brass mounting at his side while his daughter uta a still goodlooking quiet broadfaced south german woman about forty or a little more sat close by busily translating a scientific book into english by alternate reading and  consultation with her father harry saw the title on her page was researches into the embryology of the isopodal  crustaceans and conceived at once an immense respect for the learning and wisdom of the communist exiles daughter  herr schurz hardly stopped a moment from his workhe never allowed his numerous visitors to interfere in any way with his daily dutiesbut motioned them both to seats on the bare bench beside him and waited to bear the nature of their particular business it was an understood thing that no one came to see the socialist leader on week days except for a good and sufficient reason  the talk at first was general and desultory but after a little time ernest brought conversation round to its proper focus and placed his case of conscience fairly before his father confessor was it allowable for a consistent socialist to accept the place of tutor to the son of a peer and a landowner  for my part herr schurz oswald said confidently i dont see any reason on earth from the point of view of any political economy whatsoever why ernest shouldnt take the position the question isnt how the exmoors have come by their money even allowing that private property in land is in itself utterly indefensible which is a proposition i dont myself feel inclined unreservedly to admit though i know you and le breton do the real questions thissince theyve got this money into their hands to distribute and since in any case they will have the distribution of it isnt it better that some of it should go into le bretons pocket than that it should go into any other persons thats the way i for my part look at the matter  what do you say to that friend ernest asked the old german smiling and waiting to see whether ernest would detect what from their own standpoint he regarded as the ethical fallacy of harry oswalds argument  well to tell you the truth herr schurz answered ernest in his deliberate quiet way i dont think ive  envisaged the subject to myself from quite the same point of view as oswald has done i have rather asked myself whether it was right of a man to accept a function in which he would really be doing nothing worthy for humanity in return for his daily board and lodging it isnt so much a question who exactly is to get certain sums out of the exmoors pockets which ought no doubt never to have been in them its more a question whether a man has any right to live off the collective labour of the world and do nothing of any good to the world on his own part by way of repayment  thats it friend ernest cried the old man with a pleased nod of his big grey head the socialistic iliad in a nutshell thats the very root of the question dont be deceived by capitalist sophisms so long as we go on each of us trying to get as much as we can individually out of the world instead of asking what the world is getting out of us in return there will be no revolution and no millennium  we must make sure that were doing some good ourselves instead of sponging upon the people perpetually to feed us for nothing whats the first gospel given to man at the creation in your popular cosmogonies why that in the sweat of his face shall he eat bread and till the ground from which he was taken thats the native gospel of the toiling many always your doctrines of fair exchange and honest livelihoods and free contract and all the rest of it are only the artificial gospel of the political economists and of the bourgeoisie and the aristocrats into whose hands they playthe rascals  then you think i oughtnt to take the post asked ernest a little ruefully  i dont say that le bretoni dont say that said herr schurz more quietly than before still grinding away at his lens the questions a broad one and it has many aspects  the best work a man can do is undoubtedly the most useful workthe work that conduces most to the general happiness  but we of the proletariate cant take our choice always as your english proverb plainly puts it with your true english bluntness beggars mustnt be choosers we must each in his place do the work thats set before us by the privileged classes its impossible for us to go nicely discriminating between work thats useful for the community work thats merely harmless and work thats positively detrimental  how can we insure it a mans a printer say theres a generally useful trade in which on the whole he labours for the good and enlightenment of the worldfor he may print scientific books good books useful books and most printing on the average is useful but hows he to know what sort of thing hes printing he may be printing gold and the proletariate or he may be printing obscurantist and retrogressive treatises by the enemies of humanity look at my own trade again youd say at first sight mr oswald that to make microscopes must be a good thing in the end for the world at large and so it is no doubt but half of themay more than half of themare thrown away mere wasted labour a good workmans time and skill lavished needlessly on some foolish rich mans caprices and amusement often enough now i make a good instrumentan instrument with all its fittings worth fifty or a hundred pounds that takes a long time to make and im a skilled workman and the instrument may fall into the hands of a scientific man wholl use it in discovery in verification in promoting knowledge in lessening disease and mitigating human suffering thats the good side of my trade but mark you now and the old man wiped his forehead rapidly with his sleeve it has its bad side too as often as not i know some rich man will buy that machine that cost me so much time and trouble to make and will buy a few dozen stock slides with it and will bring it out once in a moon to show his children or a few idle visitors the scales on a butterflys wing or the hairs on the leg of a common flea uta sets those things up by the thousand for the dealers to sell to indolent dilettanti the appetite of the world at large for the common flea is simply insatiable and its for that perhaps that im spoiling my eyesight now grinding and grinding and grinding at this very lens and fitting the thing to an accurate fraction of a  millimetre as we always fit these thingswe who are careful and honest workmento show an idle mans friends the hairs on a fleas foreleg if that isnt enough to make a man ashamed of our present wasteful and chaotic organisation i should think he must be a survival from the preglacial epochas indeed most of us actually are  but after all herr schurz said harry expostulating you get paid for your labour and the rich man is doing better by encouraging your skill than by encouraging the less useful skill of other workmen  ah yes cried herr schurz warmly thats the doctrine  of the oneeyed economists thats the capitalist way of looking at it but it isnt our wayit isnt ours is it nothing think you that all that toil of mineof a sensible mansgoes to waste to gratify the senseless passing whim of a wealthy nobody is it nothing that he uselessly monopolises the valuable product of my labour which in other and abler hands might be bringing forth good fruit for the bettering and furthering  of universal humanity i tell you mr oswald half the best books half the best apparatus half the best appliances in all europe are locked up idle in rich mens cabinets effecting  no good begetting no discoveries bringing forth no interest  doing nothing but foster the antisocial pride of their wealthy possessors but that isnt what friend ernest wants to ask me about today he wants to know about his own course in a difficult case and instead of answering him here am i maundering away like an old man that i am into the generalised platitudes of gold and the proletariate well le breton what i should say in your particular instance is this a man with the fear of right before his eyes may under existing circumstances lawfully accept any work that will keep him alive provided he sees no better and more useful work equally open to him he may take the job the capitalists impose if he can get nothing worthier to do  elsewhere now if you dont teach this young tregellis what alternative have you why to become a master in a schooleton perhaps or rugby or marlboroughand teach other equally useless members of prospective aristocratic society that being so i think you ought to do whats best for yourself and your family for the presentfor the presenttill the time of deliverance comes you see there is one member of your family to whom the matter is of immediate importance  ronald said ernest interrupting him  yes ronald a good boy a socialist too though he doesnt know itone of us born of us and only apart from us in bare externals well would it be most comfortable for poor ronald that you should go to these exmoor people or that you should take a mastership get rooms somewhere and let him live with you hes not very happy with your mother you say wouldnt he be happier with you what think you charity begins at home you know a good proverba good sound sensible narrowminded practical english proverb  ive thought of that ernest said and ill ask him about it whichever he prefers then id better decide upon had i  do so herr max answered with a nod other things equal our first duty is to those nearest to us  what herr max said was law to his disciples and ernest went his way contented  mr oswald seems a very nice young man uta schurz said looking up from the microscope slides she had begun to mount at the moment her regular translating work was  interrupted by their sudden entry she had been taking quiet glances at harry all the while in her unobtrusive fashion for uta had learned always to be personally unobtrusivethe prophets donkey those irreverent french exiles used to call herand she had come to the conclusion that he was a decidedly handsome and manly fellow  which do you like best utaoswald or le breton asked her father  personally uta answered i should prefer mr oswald  to live always with mr le breton would be like living with an abstraction no woman would ever care for him she might just as well marry spinozas ethics or the ten commandments hes a perfect model of a socialist and nothing else mr oswald has some human nature in him as well  there are two kinds of socialists said herr max bending  once more over his glasses the one kind is always thinking most of its rights the other kind is always  thinking most of its duties oswald belongs to the first le breton to the second ive often observed it so among men of their two sorts the best socialists never come from the bourgeoisie nor even from the proletariate they come from among the voluntarily déclassés aristocrats your workman or your bourgeois who has risen and who interests himself in social or political questions is always thinking why shouldnt i have as many rights and privileges as these other people have the aristocrat who descends is always thinking  why shouldnt these other people have as many rights and privileges as i have the one type begets aggressive selfassertion the other type begets a certain gentle spirit of selfeffacement you dont often find men of the aristocratic class with any ethical element in themtheir hereditary  antecedents their breeding their environment are all hostile to it but when you do find them mark my words uta they make the truest and most earnest friends of the popular cause of any their sympathy and interest in it is all unselfish  and yet uta answered firmly i still prefer mr oswald  and if you care for my opinion i should say that the aristocrat does all the dreaming but the bourgeois does all the fighting and thats the most important thing practically after all  an hour later ernest was talking his future plans over with his brother ronald would it be best for ronald that he should take a mastership and both should live together or that he should go for the present to the exmoors and leave the question of ronalds home arrangements still unsettled  its so good of you to think of me in the matter ernest ronald said pressing his hand gently but i dont think i ought to go away from mother before im twentyone to tell you the truth ernest i hardly flatter myself shed be really sorry to get rid of me im afraid im a dreadful thorn in her side at present she doesnt understand my ways and perhaps i dont sympathise enough with hers but still if i were to propose to go i feel sure shed be very much annoyed  and treat it as a serious act of insubordination on my part while im a minor at least i ought to remain with her the apostle tells us to obey our parents in the lord and as long as she requires nothing from me that doesnt involve a dereliction of principle i think i must bear with it though i acknowledge its a cross a heavy cross thank you so much for thinking of it dearest ernest and his eyes filled once more with tears as he spoke  so it was finally arranged that for the present at least ernest should accept lady exmoors offer and that as soon as ronald was twentyone he should look about for a suitable mastership in order for the two brothers to go immediately into rooms together lady le breton was surprised at the decision but as it was in her favour she wisely abstained from gratifying her natural desire to make some more  uncomplimentary references to the snuffy old german socialist  sufficient unto the day was the triumph thereof and she had no doubt in her own mind that if once ernest could be induced to live for a while in really good society the wellknown charms and graces of that society must finally tame his rugged breast and wean him away from his unaccountable  devotion to those horrid continental communists    chapter viii  in the camp of the philistines   dunbude castle lord exmoors family seat stands on the last spurs of the great north devon uplands overlooking the steep glen of a little boulderencumbered stream and commanding a distant view of the severn sea and the dim outlines of the blue welsh hills beyond it behind the house a castle only by courtesy on the same principle as that by which every bishop lives in a palace rises the jagged summit of the cleave a great weatherworn granite hill sculptured on top by wind and rain into those fantastic lichencovered pillars and tora and logans in which antiquarian  fancy used so long to find the visible monuments of druidical worship all around a wide brown waste of heather undulates and tosses wildly to the sky and on the summit of the rolling moor where it rises and swells in one of its many rounded bosses the antlered heads and shoulders of the red deer may often be seen etched in bold relief against the clear skyline to the west on sunny autumn evenings but the castle itself and the surrounding grounds are not planned to harmonise with the rough moorland english scenery into whose midst they were unceremoniously pitchforked by the second earl that distinguished man of taste a light of the artistic world in his own day had brought back from his grand tour his own ideal of a strictly classical domestic building formed by impartially compounding  a palladian palace a doric temple and a square redbrick english manorhouse after pulling down the original fourteenthcentury castle he had induced an eminent architect of the time to conspire with him in giving solid and permanent reality to this his awful imagining and when he had completed it all from portico to attic he had extorted even the critical praise of horace walpole who described it in one of his letters as a singular triumph of classical taste and architectural ingenuity it still remains unrivalled in its kind the ugliest great countryseat in the county of devonsome respectable authorities even say in the whole of england  in front of the house an italian garden with balustrades of very doubtful marble leads down by successive terraces and broad flights of steps to an artificial octagonal pool formed by carefully destroying the whole natural beauty of the wild and rocky little english glen beneath to feed it by fitting a conduit the mossgrown boulders that strew the bed of the torrent above and below have been carefully removed  and the unwilling stream as it runs into the pool has been coerced into a long straight channel bordered on either side by bedded turf and planed off at measured intervals so as to produce a series of eminently regular and classical cascades even lord exmoor himself who was a hunting man without any pretence to that stupid rubbish about taste did not care for the hopeless exterior of dunbude castle he frankly admitted that the place was altogether too doosid artificial for the line of country if theyd only left it alone he said in its own native condition it would have been really pretty but as theyd doctored it and spoilt it why there was nothing on earth to be done but just put up with it and whistle over it what with the hounds and the mortgages and the settlements and the red deer and goodwood the estate couldnt possibly afford any money for making alterations down in the gardens  the dogcart was in waiting at the station to carry ernest up to the castle and as he reached the front door lady hilda tregellis strolled up the broad flight of steps from the garden to meet him lady hilda was tall and decidedly handsome as ernest had rightly told edie but not pretty and she was also just twenty there was a free careless bold look in her face that showed her at once a girl of spirit indeed if she had not been born a tregellis it was quite clear that she would have been predestined to turn out a strongminded woman there was nothing particularly delicate in lady hildas features they were wellmodelled but neither regular nor cold nor with that peculiar stamp of artificial breeding which is so often found in the faces of english ladies on the contrary she looked like a perfectly selfconfident handsome actress too selfconfident to be selfconscious and accustomed to admiration wherever she turned as ernest jumped down from the dogcart she advanced quickly to shake hands with him and look him over critically from head to foot like a schoolboy taking stock of a new fellow  im so glad youve come mr le breton she said with an open smile upon her frank face i was dreadfully afraid you wouldnt care for our proposition dunbudes the dullest hole in england and we want somebody here to brighten it up sadly did you ever see such an ugly monstrosity before anywhere  the country abouts lovely ernest answered but the house itself is certainly rather ugly  ugly its hideous and its as dull as its big said hilda vehemently you cant think what a time we have of it here half the year im always longing for the season to come papa fills the house here with hunting men and shooting menpeople without two ideas in their heads you know just like himself and even they go out all day and leave us women from morning till night to the society of their wives and daughters who are exactly like them mr  walshthats lynmouths last tutorhe was a perfect stick a cambridge man cambridge men always are sticks i believe youre oxford of course arent you i thought so  still even mr walsh was a little society for i assure you if it hadnt been for him i should never have seen anybody to talk to from years end to years end so when mr  walsh was going to leave us i said to mamma why not ask one of the mr le bretons i wanted to have somebody  sensible here and so i got her to let me write to your brother ronald about the tutorship did he send you the letter i hope you didnt think it was mine mamma dictated it for i dont write such formal letters as that on my own account i can tell you i hate conventionality of any sort at dunbude were all conventional except me but i wont be come up into the billiardroom here and sit down awhile william will see about your portmanteau and things papas out of course and sos lynmouth and mammas somewhere or other i dont know where and so theres nobody in particular at home for you to report  yourself to you may as well come in here while i ring for them to get you some lunch ready nobody ever gets anything  ready beforehand in this house we lunched ourselves an hour ago  ernest smiled at her volubility and followed her quickly into the big bare billiardroom he walked over to the fire and began to warm himself while hilda took down a cue and made stray shots in extraordinary angles at impossible cannons all the time as she went on talking to him was it very cold on the way down she asked  yes fairly im not sorry to see the fire again why youre quite an accomplished player  theres nothing else to do at dunbude thats why i practise about half my lifetime so i wrote to your brother ronald as i was telling you from mammas dictation and when i heard you were really coming i was quite delighted about it do you remember i met you twice last year once at the dolburys and once somewhere else and i thought youd be a very good sort of person for dunbude you know and about as much use to lynmouth as anybody could be which isnt saying much of course for hes a dreadful pickle i insisted on putting in my letter that he was a dreadful pickle thats a good stroke off the red just enough side on though mamma didnt want me to because i thought you ought to know about it beforehand but you remember him at marlborough of course he was only a little fellow then but still a pickle he always was and he always will be hes out shooting now with papa and youll never get him to settle down to anything as long as theres a snipe or a plover banging about on the moor  anywhere hes quite incorrigible do you play at all wont you take a cue till your lunchs ready  no i dont play ernest answered half hesitating or at least very little  oh then youll learn here because youll find nothing else to do do you shoot  oh no never i dont think it right  ah yes i remember how delightful lady le breton told me all about it youve got notions havent you youre a nihilist or a fenian or something of that sort and you dont shoot anything but czars and grand dukes do you i believe you want to cut all our heads off and have a red republic well im sure thats very refreshing  for down here were all as dull as sticks together tories every one of us to a man perfect unanimity no differences of opinion all as conventional and proper as the vicars sermons now to have somebody who wants to cut your head off in the house is really delightful i love originality not that ive ever seen anybody original in all my life for i havent but im sure it would be delightful if i did one reads about original people in novels you know dickens and that sort of thing and i often think i should like to meet some of them good stroke again legs legs legs if you pleaseno it hasnt legs enough but here or for the matter of that in town either we never see anybody but the same eternal round of algies and monties and berties and hughsall very nice young men no doubt exceedingly proper nothing against them good shots capital partners excellent families everything on earth that anybody could desire except a single atom of personal originality i assure you if they were all shaken up in a bag together and well mixed in evening clothes so as not to tell them apart by the tweeds you know their own mothers wouldnt be able to separate them afterwards but if you dont shoot and dont play billiards im sure i dont know what youll ever find to do with yourself here at dunbude  dont you think ernest said quietly taking down a cue one ought to have something better to do with ones time than shooting and playing billiards in a world where so many labouring people are toiling and slaving in poverty and misery on our behalf dont you think we should be trying to do something or other in return for universal humanity to whom we owe so much for our board and lodging and clothing and amusement  well now thats just what i mean said hilda ecstatically  with a neat shot off the cushion against the red and into the middle pocket thats such a delightfully original way of looking at things you see we all of us here talk always about the partridges and the red deer and the turnips  and the church and dear lady this and that odious lady that and the growing insolence of the farmers and the shocking insubordination of the lower classes and the difficulty of getting really good servants and the dreadful way those horrid irish are shooting their kindhearted  indulgent landlords or else we talkthe women especiallyabout how awfully bored we are lawntennis you know and dinners and what a bad match ethel thingumbob has made but you talk another kind of slang i dare say it doesnt mean much you know youre not working at anything  very much more serious than we are still its a novelty when we go to a coursing meeting were all on the hounds but youre on the hare and thats so delightfully original  i havent the least doubt that if we were to talk about the irish youd say you thought they ought to shoot their  landlords i remember you shocked mamma by saying something like it at the dolburys now of course it doesnt matter to me a bit which is right you say the poor tenants are starving and papa says the poor landlords cant get in their rents and actually have to give up their hounds poor fellows and i dont know which of you is the most to be believed only what papa says is just the same thing that everybody says and what you say has a certain charming freshness and variety about it its so funny to be told that one ought really to take the tenants into consideration exactly like your brother ronalds notions about servants  your lunch is ready in the diningroom sir said a voice at the door  come back here when youve finished mr le breton hilda called after him ill teach you how to make that cannon you missed just now if you mean to exist at dunbude at all its absolutely necessary for you to learn billiards  ernest turned in to lunch with an uncomfortable misgiving  on his mind already that dunbude was not exactly the right place for such a man as he to live in  during the afternoon he saw nothing more of the family save lady hilda and it was not till the party assembled in the drawingroom before dinner that he met lord and lady exmoor and his future pupil lynmouth had grown into a tall handsome manlylooking boy since ernest last saw him but he certainly looked exactly what hilda had called hima pickle a few minutes introductory conversation sufficed to show ernest that whatever mind he possessed was wholly given over to horses dogs and partridges and that the post of tutor at dunbude castle was not likely to prove a bed of roses  seen the paper connemara lord exmoor asked of one of his guests as they sat down to dinner i havent had a moment myself to snatch a look at the times yet this evening im really too busy almost even to read the daily papers anything fresh from ireland  havent seen it either lord connemara answered glancing towards lady hilda perhaps somebody else has looked at the papers  nobody answered so ernest ventured to remark that the irish news was rather worse again two bailiffs had been murdered near castlebar  thats bad lord exmoor said turning towards ernest  im afraid theres a deal of distress in the west  a great deal ernest answered positive starvation i believe in some parts of county galway  well not quite so bad as that lord exmoor replied a little startled i dont think any of the landlords are actually starving yet though ive no doubt many of them are put to very great straits indeed by their inability to get in their rents  ernest couldnt forbear gently smiling to himself at the misapprehension oh i didnt mean the landlords he said quickly i meant among the poor people as he spoke he was aware that lady hildas eyes were fixed keenly upon him and that she was immensely delighted at the temerity and originality displayed in the notion of his publicly taking irish tenants into consideration at her fathers table  ah the poor people lord exmoor answered with a slight sigh of relief as who should say that their condition didnt much matter to a philosophic mind yes to be sure ive no doubt some of them are very badly off poor souls but then theyre such an idle improvident lot why dont they emigrate now i should like to know  ernest reflected silently that the inmates of dunbude castle did not exactly set them a model of patient industry and that lady hildas numerous allusions during the afternoon  to the fact that the dunbude estates were mortgaged  up to the eyelids a condition of affairs to which she always alluded as though it were rather a subject of pride and congratulation than otherwise did not speak very highly for their provident economy either but even ernest le breton had a solitary grain of worldly wisdom laid up  somewhere in a corner of his brain and he didnt think it  advisable to give them the benefit of his own views upon the subject  theres a great deal of rubbish talked in england about irish affairs you know exmoor said lord connemara confidently people never understand ireland im sure until theyve actually lived there would you believe it now the correspondent of one of the london papers was quite indignant the other day because my agent had to evict a man for three years rent at ballynamara and the man unfortunately went and died a week later on the public roadside we produced medical evidence to show that he had suffered for years from heart disease and would have died in any case wherever he had been but the editor fellow wanted to make political capital out of it and kicked up quite a fuss about my agents shocking inhumanity  as if we could possibly help ourselves in the matter people must get their rents in somehow mustnt they  people must get their rents in somehow of course lord exmoor assented sympathetically and i know all you men who are unlucky enough to own property in ireland have a lot of trouble about it nowadays upon my word what with fenians and what with nihilists and what with communards i really dont know what the world is coming to  most unchristian conduct i call it said lady exmoor who went in for being mildly and decorously religious i really cant understand how people can believe such wicked doctrines as these communistic notions that are coming over people in these latter days  no better than downright robbery lord connemara answered shaking the very foundations of society i think it all done so recklessly too without any care or any consideration  ernest thought of old max schurz with his lifelong economical studies and wondered when lord connemara had found time to turn his own attention from foxes and fishing to economical problems but by a perfect miracle he said nothing  you wouldnt believe the straits were put to lady exmoor the irish earl went on through this horrid norent business absolute poverty i assure youabsolute downright poverty ive had to sell the maid of garunda this week you know and three others of the best horses in my stable just to raise money for immediate necessities  wanted to buy a most interesting missal quite unique in its way offered me by menotti and cicolari dirt cheap for three thousand guineas its quite a gem of late miniaturist artvellum folio with borders and headpieces by giulio clovio a marvellous bargain  giulio clovio said lord exmoor doubtfully who was he never heard of him in my life before  never heard of giulio clovio cried lord connemara seizing the opportunity with wellaffected surprise you really astonish me he was a croatian i believe or an illyriani forget whichand he studied at rome under giulio romano wonderful draughtsman in the nude and fine colourist took hints from raphael and michael angelo so much he had picked up from menotti and cicolari and being a distinguished connoisseur had made a mental note of the facts at once for future reproduction upon a fitting occasion well this missal was executed for cardinal farnese as a companion volume to the famous vita christi in the towneley collection you know it of course lady exmoor  of course lady exmoor answered faintly with a devout hope that lord connemara wouldnt question her any further upon the subject in which case she thought it would probably be the safest guess to say that she had seen it at the british museum or in the hamilton library  but lord connemara luckily didnt care to press his advantage the towneley volume you see he went on fluentlyhe was primed to the muzzle with information on that subjectwas given by the cardinal to the pope of that timepaul the third wasnt it mr le bretonand so got into the possession of old christopher towneley the antiquary but this companion folio it seems the cardinal  wouldnt let go out of his own possession and so its been handed down in his own family with a bar sinister of course exmooryou remember the story of beatrice malatesta to the present time its very existence wasnt suspected till cicolariwonderfully smart fellow cicolariunearthed it the other day from a descendant of the malatestas in a little village in the campagna he offered it to me quite as an act of friendship for three thousand guineas indeed he begged me not to let menotti know how cheap he was selling it for fear he might interfere and ask a higher price for it well i naturally couldnt let such a chance slip mefor the credit of the family it ought to be in the collectionand the consequence was though i was awfully sorry to part with her i was absolutely obliged to sell the maid for pocketmoney lady hildai assure you for pocketmoney my tenants wont pay up and nothing will make them theyve got the cash actually in the bank but they keep it there waiting for a set of sentimentalists in the house of commons to interfere between us and make them a present of my property rolling in money some of them are i can tell you one man i know as a positive fact sold a pig last week and yet pretends he cant pay me  all the fault of these horrid communists that you were speaking of lady exmoorall the fault of these horrid communists  youre rather a communist yourself arent you mr le breton asked lady hilda boldly from across the table  i remember you told me something once about cutting the throats of all the landlords  lady exmoor looked as though a bombshell had dropped into the drawingroom my dear hilda she said im sure you must have misunderstood mr le breton you cant have meant anything so dreadful as that mr le breton can you  certainly not ernest answered with a clear conscience  lady hilda has put her own interpretation upon my casual words i havent the least desire to cut  anybodys throat even metaphorically  hilda looked a little disappointed she had hoped for a good rattling discussion in which ernest was to shock the whole tableit does people such a lot of good you know to have a nice round shocking but ernest was evidently not inclined to show fight for her sole gratification and so she proceeded to her alternative amusement of getting lord connemara to display the full force of his own inanity  this was an easy and unending source of innocent enjoyment to lady hilda enhanced by the fact that she knew her father and mother were anxious to see her countess of connemara and that they would be annoyed by her public exposition of that eligible young mans intense selfishness and emptyheadedness  altogether ernest did not enjoy his first week at the exmoors nor did he enjoy the second or the third or the fourth week much better the society was profoundly distasteful to him the world was not his world nor the talk his talk and he grew so sick of the perpetual discussion of horses dogs pheasants dances and lawn tennis with occasional digressions on giulio clovio and the connemara gallery that he found even a chat with lady hilda who knew and cared for nothing but liked to chat with him because he was so original a pleasant relief by comparison from the eternal round of lord exmoors anecdotes about famous racers or celebrated actresses but worst of all he did not like his work he felt that useless as he considered it he was not successfully performing even the useless function  he was paid to fulfil lynmouth couldnt learn wouldnt learn and wasnt going to learn ernest might as well have tried to din the necessary three plays of euripides into the nearest lamppost nobody encouraged him to learn in any way indeed lord exmoor remembered that he himself had scraped through somehow at christ church with the aid of a private tutor and the magic of his title and he hadnt the least doubt that lynmouth would scrape through in his turn in like manner and so though most young men would have found the dunbude tutorship the very acme of their wishesplenty of amusements and nothing to do for themernest le breton found it to the last degree irksome and unsatisfactory not that he had ever to complain of any unkindliness on the part of the exmoor family they were really in their own way very kindhearted friendly sort of peoplethat is to say towards all members of their own circle and as they considered ernest one of themselves in virtue of their acquaintance with his mother they really did their best to make him as happy and comfortable as was in their power but then he was such a very strange young man  for what on earth can you do as lord exmoor justly asked with a young fellow who wont shoot and who wont fish and who wont hunt and who wont even play lansquenet such a case was clearly hopeless he would have liked to see more of miss merivale little lady sybils governess for there were three children in the family but miss merivale was a timid sensitive girl and she did not often encourage his advances lest my lady should say she was setting her cap at the tutor the consequence was that he was necessarily thrown much upon lady hildas society and as lady hilda was laudably eager to instruct him in billiards lawn tennis and sketching he rapidly grew to be quite an adept at those relatively moral and innocuous amusements under her constant instruction and supervision  it seems to me said that acute observer lord lynmouth  to his special friend and confidante the ladysmaid that hilda makes a doocid sight too free with that fellow le breton dont you think so euphemia  i should hope my lord euphemia answered demurely that lady hilda would know her own place too well to demean herself with such as your lordships tutor if i didnt feel sure of that i should have to mention the matter seriously to my lady  nevertheless the ladysmaid immediately stored up a mental note on the subject in the lasting tablets of her memory and did not fail gently to insinuate her views upon the question to lady exmoor as she arranged the pearls in the false plaits for dinner that very evening    chapter ix  the women of the land   mr le breton mr le breton papa says lynmouth may go out troutfishing with him this afternoon come up with me to the clatter im going to sketch there  very well lady hilda if you want my criticism i dont mind if i do let me carry your things its rather a pull up even for you with your box and easel  hilda gave him her sketchbook and colours and they turned together up the cleave behind the castle  a clatter is a peculiar devonshire feature composed of long loose tumbled granite blocks piled in wild disorder along the narrow summit of a saddlebacked hill it differs from a tor in being less high and castellated as well as in its longer and narrower contour ernest and hilda followed the rough path up through the gorse and heather to the top of the ridge and then scrambled over the grey lichencovered rooks together to the big loganstone whose evenlypoised and tilted mass crowned the actual summit the granite blocks were very high and rather slippery in places for it was rainy april weather so that ernest had to take his companions hand more than once in his to help her over the tallest boulders it was a small delicate hand though hilda was a tall wellgrown woman ungloved too for the sake of the sketching and hilda didnt seem by any means unwilling to accept ernests proffered help though if it had been lord connemara who was with her instead she would have scorned assistance and scaled the great mossy masses by herself like a mountain antelope lightfooted and lithe of limb was lady hilda as befitted a devonshire lass accustomed  to following the exmoor staghounds across their wild country on her own hunter yet she seemed to find a great deal of difficulty in clambering up the clatter on that  particular april morning and move than once ernest half fancied to himself that she leaned on his arm longer than was absolutely  necessary for support or assistance over the stiffest places  here by the logan mr le breton she said motioning him where to put her campstool and papers thats a good point of view for the rocks yonder you can lie down on the rug and give me the benefit of your advice and assistance  my advice is not worth taking said ernest im a regular duffer at painting and sketching you should ask lord connemara he knows all about art and that sort of thing  lord connemara echoed hilda contemptuously he has a lot of pictures in his gallery at home and hes been told by sensible men whats the right thing for him to say about them but he knows no more about art really than he knows about fiddlesticks  doesnt he indeed ernest answered languidly not feeling any burning desire to discuss lord connemaras artistic attainments or deficiencies  no he doesnt hilda went on rather defiantly as though ernest had been lady exmoor and most of these people that come here dont either they have galleries and they get artists and people who understand about pictures to talk with them and so they learn whats  considered the proper thing to say of each of them but as to saying anything spontaneous or original of their own about a picture or any other earthly thingwhy you know mr le breton they couldnt possibly do it to save their lives  well there i should think you do them as a class a great injustice said ernest quietly youre evidently prejudiced against your own people i should think that if theres any subject on which our old families really do know anything its art look at their great advantages  nonsense hilda answered decisively fiddlesticks for their advantages whats the good of advantages without  a head on your shoulders i should like to know and they havent got heads on their shoulders mr le breton you know they havent  why surely said ernest in his simple fashion looking  the question straight in the face as a matter of abstract truth there must be a great deal of ability among peers and peers sons all history shows it and it would be absurd if it werent so for the mass of peers have got their peerages by conspicuous abilities of one sort or another as barristers or soldiers or politicians or diplomatists and they would naturally hand on their powers to their different descendants  oh yes there are some of them with brains i suppose hilda answered as one who makes a great concession  theres herbert alderney whos member for somewhere or otherchurch stretton i thinkand makes speeches in the house hes clever they say but such a conceited fellow to talk to and theres wilfrid faunthorp who writes poems and gets them printed in the magazines too because he knows the editors and theres randolph hastings who goes in for painting and has little red and blue daubs at the grosvenor by special invitation of the director  but somehow they none of them strike me as being really original whenever i meet anybody worth talking to anywherein a railway train or so oni feel sure at once hes an ordinary commoner not even honourable and he is invariably you may depend upon it  that would naturally happen on the average of instances ernest put in smiling considering the relative frequency of peers and commoners in this realm of england peers you know or even honourables are not common objects of the country numerically speaking  they are to me unfortunately hilda replied looking at him inquiringly i hardly ever meet anybody else you know and im positively bored to death by them and thats the truth really its most unlucky under the circumstances  that i should happen to be the daughter of one peer and be offered promiscuously as wife to the highest bidder among half a dozen others if only i would have them but i wont mr le breton i really wont im not going to marry a fool just to please my mother nothing on earth would induce me to marry lord connemara for example  ernest looked at her and smiled but said nothing  lady hilda put in a stroke or two more to her pencil outline  and then continued her unsolicited confidences do you know mr le breton she went on theres a conspiracythe usual conspiracy but still a regular conspiracy i call itbetween papa and mamma to make me marry that stick of a connemara what is there in him i should like to know to make any girl admire or love him and yet half the girls in london would be glad to get him for all his absurdity its monstrous its incomprehensible its abominable but its the fact for my part i must say i do like a little originality and whenever i hear papa and uncle sussex and lord connemara talking at dinner it does seem to me too ridiculously absurd that they should each have a separate voice in parliament and that you shouldnt even have a fraction of a vote for a county member what sort of superiority has lord connemara over you i wonder and she looked at ernest again with a searching glance to see whether he was to be moved by such a personal and emphatic way of putting the matter  ernest looked back at her curiously in his serious simplicity and only answered there are a great many queer inequalities and absurdities in all our existing political systems lady hilda  hilda smiled to herselfa quiet smile half of  disappointment half of complacent feminine superiority  what a stupid fellow he was in some ways after all even that silly lord connemara would have guessed what she was driving at with only a quarter as much encouragement  but ernest must be too much afraid of the social barrier clearly so she began again this time upon a slightly different but equally obvious tack  yes there are absurd inequalities really mr le breton very absurd inequalities youd get rid of them all i know you told me that about cutting all the landlords  heads off im sure though you said when i spoke about it before mamma the night you first came here that you didnt mean it i remember it perfectly well because i recollect thinking at the time the idea was so charmingly and deliciously original  you must be quite mistaken lady hilda ernest answered calmly you misunderstood my meaning i said i would get rid of landlordsby which i meant to say get rid of them as landlords not as individuals i dont even know that id take away the land from them all at once you know though i dont think its justly theirs id  deprive them of it tentatively and gradually  well i cant see the justice of that im sure hilda answered carelessly either the lands ours by right or it isnt ours if its ours you ought to leave it to us for ever and if it isnt ours you ought to take it away from us at once and make it over to the people to whom it properly belongs why on earth should you keep them a day longer out of their own  ernest laughed heartily at this vehement and uncompromising sansculottism youre a vigorous convert anyhow  he said with some amusement i see youve profited by my instruction youve put the question very plump and straightforward but in practice it would be better no doubt gradually to educate out the landlords rather than to dispossess them at one blow of what they honestly though wrongly imagine to be their own let all existing holders keep the land during their own lifetime and their heirs and resume it for the nation after their lives allowing for the rights of all children born of marriages between people now living  not at all hilda answered in a tone of supreme conviction  im in favour of simply cutting our heads off once for all and making our families pay all arrears of rent from the very beginning that or nothing put the case another way suppose mr le breton there was somebody who had got a grant from a king a long time ago allowing him to hang any three persons he chose annually well suppose this person and his descendants went on for a great many generations extorting money out of other people by threatening  to kill them and letting them off on payment of a ransom  suppose too they always killed three a year some time or other pour encourager les autresjust to show that they really meant it well then if one day the people grew wise enough to inquire into the right of these licensed  extortioners to their black mail would you say dont deprive them of it too unexpectedly let them keep it during their own lifetime let their children hang three of us annually after them but let us get rid of this fine old national custom in the third generation would that be fair to the people who would be hanged for the sake of old prescription in the interval do you think  ernest laughed again at the serious sincerity with which ehe was ready to acquiesce in his economical heresies  youre quite right he said the land is the peoples and theres no reason on earth why they should starve a minute longer in order to let lord connemara pay three thousand guineas for spurious copies of early italian manuscripts  and yet it would be difficult to get most people to see it i fancy lady hilda you must really be rather cleverer than most people  i score one thought hilda to herself and whatever happens whether i marry a peer or a revolutionist i certainly wont marry a fool im glad you think so she went on aloud because i know your opinions worth having i should like to be clever mr le breton and i should like to know all about everything but what chance has one at dunbude do you know till you came here i never got any sensible  conversation with anybody and she sighed gently as she put her head on one side to take a good view of her sketchy little picture lady hildas profile was certainly very handsome and she showed it to excellent advantage when she put her head on one side ernest looked at her and thought so to himself and lady hildas quick eye glancing sideways for a second from the paper noted immediately that he thought so  mr le breton she began again more confidentially than ever one thing ive quite made up my mind to i wont be tied for life to a stick like lord connemara in fact i wont marry a man in that position at all i shall choose for myself and marry a man for the worth thats in him i assure you its a positive fact ive been proposed to by no fewer than six assorted algies and berties and monties in a single season besides which some of them follow me even down here to dunbude papa and mamma are dreadfully  angry because i wont have any of them but i wont  i mean to wait and marry whoever i choose as soon as i find a man i can really love and honour  she paused and looked hard at ernest i cant speak much plainer than that she thought to herself and really he must be stupider than the algies and the monties  themselves if he doesnt see i want him to propose to me i suppose all women would say its awfully unwomanly of me to lead up to his cards in this waythrowing myself at his head theyd call it but what does that matter i wont marry a fool and i will marry a man of some originality  thats the only thing in the world worth troubling ones head about why on earth doesnt he take my hand i wonder what further can he be waiting for lady hilda was perfectly accustomed to the usual preliminaries of a  declaration and only awaited ernests first step to proceed in due order to the second strange to say her heart was actually beating a little by anticipation it never even occurred to herthe belle of three seasonsthat possibly ernest mightnt wish to marry her so she sat looking pensively at her picture and sighed again quietly  but ernest wholly unsuspicious only answered you will do quite right lady hilda to marry the man of your own choice irrespective of wealth or station  hilda glanced up at him curiously with a halfdisdainful smile and was just on the point of saying but suppose the man of my own choice wont propose to me however as the words rose to her lips she felt there was a point at which even she should yield to convention and there were plenty of opportunities still before her without displaying her whole hand too boldly and immediately so she merely turned with another sigh this time a genuine one to her halfsketched outline i shall bring him round in time she said to herself blushing a little at her unexpected  discomfiture i shall bring him round in time i shall make him propose to me i dont care if i have to live in a lodging with him and wash up my own teathings i shall marry him that im resolved upon hes as mad as a march hare about his communism and his theories and things but i dont care for that i could live with him in comfort and i couldnt live in comfort with the algies and monties in fact i believein a sort of wayi believe im almost in love with him i have a kind of jumpy feeling in my heart when im talking with him that i never feel when im talking with other young men even the nicest of them  hes not nice hes a bear and yet somehow i should like to marry him  mr le breton she said aloud the suns all wrong for sketching today and besides its too chilly i must run about a bit among the rocks at least i shall take his hand to help me she thought blushing come and walk with me its no use trying to draw with ones hands freezing  and she crumpled up the unfinished sketch hastily between her fingers ernest jumped up to follow her and they spent the next hour scrambling up and down the clatter and talking on less dangerous subjects than lady hildas matrimonial aspirations  still i shall make him ask me yet lady hilda thought to herself as she parted from him to go up and dress for dinner i shall manage to marry him somehow or if i dont marry him at any rate ill marry somebody like him for it was really the principle not the person that lady hilda specially insisted upon    chapter x  the daughters of canaan   may beautiful may had brought the golden flowers and the trees in the valley behind the sleepy old town of calcombe pomeroy were decking themselves in the first wan green of their early spring foliage the ragged robins were hanging out pinky red from the hedgerows the cuckoo was calling from the copse beside the mill stream and the merry wee hedgewarblers were singing lustily from the topmost sprays of hawthorn with their full throats bursting tremulously in the broad sunshine and ernest le breton too filled with the season had come down from dunbude for a fortnights holiday on his premised visit to his friend oswald or to say the truth more plainly to oswalds pretty little sister edie  for ernest had fully made up his mind by this time what it was he had come for and he took the earliest possible  opportunity of taking a walk with edie alone through the tiny glen behind the town where the wee stream tumbles lazily upon the big slowturning vanes of the overshot millwheel  let us sit down a bit on the bank here miss oswald he said to his airy little companion as they reached the old stone bridge that crosses the stream just below the millhouse its such a lovely day one feels loath to miss any of it and the scenery here looks so bright and cheerful after the endless brown heather and russet bracken about dunbude  not that exmoor isnt beautiful in its way tooall devonshire is beautiful alike for that matter but then its more sombre and woody in the north and much less  springlike than this lovely quiet south devon country  im so glad you like calcombe edie said with one of her unfailing blushes at the indirect flattery to herself  implied in praise of her native county and you think it prettier than dunbude then do you  prettier in its own way yes though not so grand of course everything here is on a smaller scale dunbude you know is almost mountainous  and the castle edie asked bringing round the conversation  to her own quarter is that very fine at all like warwick or our dear old arlingford  oh it isnt a castle at all really ernest answered only a very big and ugly house as architecture its atrocious though its comfortable enough inside for a place of the sort  and the exmoors are they nice people what kind of girl is lady hilda now poor little edie she asked the question shyly but with a certain deep beating in her heart for she had often canvassed with herself the vague possibility that ernest might actually fall in love with lady hilda had he fallen in love with her already or had he not she knew she would be able to guess the truth by his voice and manner the moment he answered her no man can hide that secret from a woman who loves him yet it was not without a thrill and a flutter that she asked him for she thought to herself what must she seem to him after all the grand people he had been mixing with so lately at dunbude  was it possible he could see anything in her a little country village girl coming to her fresh from the great ladies of that unknown and vaguely terrible society  lady hilda ernest answered laughingand as he said the words edie knew in her heart that her question was answered and blushed once more in her bewitching fashion  lady hilda oh shes a very queer girl indeed shes not at all clever really but she has the one virtue of girls of her classtheir perfect frankness shes frank all overno  reserve or reticence at all about her whatever she thinks she says without the slightest idea that youll see anything to laugh at or to find fault with in it in matters of  knowledge shes frankly ignorant in matters of taste shes frankly barbaric in matters of religion shes frankly heathen and in matters of ethics shes frankly immoralor rather extramoral he added quickly correcting himself for the misleading expression  i shouldnt think from your description she can be a very nice person edie said greatly relieved and pulling a few tall grasses at her side by way of hiding her interest in the subject she cant be a really nice girl if shes extramoral as you call it  oh i dont mean shed cut ones throat or pick ones pocket you know ernest went on quickly with a gentle smile shes got a due respect for the ordinary conventional moralities like other people no doubt but in her case theyre only social prejudices not genuine ethical principles  i dont suppose she ever seriously asked herself whether  anything was right or wrong or not in her whole lifetime in fact im sure she never did and if anybody else were to do so shed be immensely surprised and delighted at the startling  originality and novelty of thought displayed in such a view of the question  but shes very handsome isnt she edie asked following  up her inquiry with due diligence  handsome oh yes in a bold sort of actress fashion  very handsome but not to me at least pleasing i believe most men admire her a great deal but she lacks a feminine touch dreadfully she dashes away through everything as if she was hunting and she does hunt too which i think bad enough in anybody and horrible in a woman  then you havent fallen in love with her mr le breton i half imagined you would you know as im told shes so very attractive  fallen in love with her miss oswald fallen in love with hilda tregellis what an absurd notion heaven forbid it  why so please  why in the first place what would be the use of it  fancy lady exmoors horror at the bare idea of her sons tutor falling in love with lady hilda i assure you miss oswald she would evaporate at the very mention of such an unheardof enormity a man must be if not an earl at least a baronet with five thousand a year before he dare face the inexpressible indignation of lady exmoor with an offer of marriage for lady hilda  but people dont always fall in love by tables of precedence edie put in simply its quite possible i suppose for a man who isnt a duke himself to fall in love with a dukes daughter even though the duke her papa maynt personally happen to approve of the match however you dont seem to think lady hilda herself a pleasant girl even apart from the question of lady exmoors requirements  miss oswald ernest said looking at her suddenly as she sat half hiding her face with her parasol and twitching more violently than ever at the tall grasses miss oswald to tell you the truth i havent been thinking much about hilda tregellis or any of the other girls ive met at dunbude and for a very sufficient reason because ive had my mind too much preoccupied by somebody else elsewhere  edie blushed even more prettily than before and held her peace half raising her eyes for a second in an enquiring glance at his and then dropping them hastily as they met in modest trepidation at that moment ernest had never seen anything so beautiful or so engaging as edie oswald  edie he said beginning again more boldly and taking her little gloved hand almost unresistingly in his edie you know my secret i love you can you love me  edie looked up at him shyly the tears glistening and trembling a little in the corner of her big bright eyes and for a moment she answered nothing then she drew away her hand hastily and said with a sigh mr le breton we oughtnt to be talking so we mustnt dont let us take me home please at once and dont say anything more about it but her heart beat within her bosom with a violence that was not all unpleasing and her looks half belied her words to ernests keen glance even as she spoke them  why not edie he said drawing her down again gently by her little hand as she tried to rise hesitatingly  why not tell me ive looked into your face and though i can hardly dare to hope it or believe it i do believe i read in it that you really might love me  oh mr le breton edie answered a tear now quivering  visibly on either eyelash dont ask me please dont ask me i wish you wouldnt take me home wont you  ernest dropped her hand quietly with a little show of despondency that was hardly quite genuine for his eyes had already told him better then you cant love me miss oswald he said looking at her closely im sorry for it very sorry for it but im grieved if i have seemed presumptuous  in asking you  this time the two tears trickled slowly down edies cheeknot very sad tears eitherand she answered hurriedly oh i dont mean that mr le breton i dont mean that  you misunderstand me im sure you misunderstand me  ernest caught up the trembling little hand again then you can love me edie he said eagerly you can love me  edie answered never a word but bowed her head and cried a little silently ernest took the dainty wee gloved hand between his own two hands and pressed it tenderly  he felt in return a faint pressure  then why wont you let me love you edie he asked looking at the blushing girl once more  oh mr le breton edie said rising and moving away from the path a little under the shade of the big elmtree its very wrong of me to let you talk so i mustnt think of marrying you and you mustnt think of marrying me  consider the difference in our positions  is that all ernest answered gaily oh edie if thats all it isnt a very difficult matter to settle my positions exactly nothing for ive got no money and no prospects and if i ask you to marry me it must be in the most strictly speculative fashion with no date and no certainty the only question is will you consent to wait for me till im able to offer you a home to live in its asking you a great deal i know and youve made me only too happy and too grateful already but if youll wait for me till we can marry i shall live all my life through to repay you for your sacrifice  but mr le breton edie said turning towards the path and drying her eyes quickly i really dont think you ought to marry me the difference in station is so greateven harry would allow the difference in station your father was a great man and a general and a knight you know and though my dear father is the best and kindest of men he isnt anything of that sort of course  a slight shade of pain passed across ernests face edie he said please dont talk about thatplease dont my father was a just and good man whom i loved and honoured deeply if theres anything good in any of us boys it comes to us from my dear father but please dont speak to me about his profession its one of the griefs and troubles of my life he was a soldier and an indian soldier too and if theres anything more certain to me than the principle that all fighting is very wrong and indefensible its the principle that our rule in india is utterly unjust and wicked so instead of being proud of my fathers profession much as i respected him im profoundly ashamed of it and it has been a great question to me always how far i was justified at all in living upon the pension given me for his indian services  edie looked at him half surprised and half puzzled it was to her such an odd and unexpected point of view but she felt instinctively that ernest really and deeply meant what he said and she knew she must not allude to the subject again i beg your pardon she said simply if ive put it wrong yet you know i cant help feeling the great disparity in our two situations  edie said ernest looking at her again with all his eyesim going to call you edie always now so thats understood between us well i shall tell you exactly how i feel about this matter from the first moment i saw you i felt drawn towards you i felt that i couldnt help admiring you and sympathising with you and loving you if i dared i would have spoken to you that day at iffley but i said to myself she will not care for me and besides it would be wrong of me to ask her just yet i had nothing to live upon and i oughtnt to ask you to wait for meyou who are so pretty and sweet and good and cleveri ought to leave you free to your natural prospect of marrying some better man who would make you happier than i can ever hope to do so i tried to put the impulse aside i waited saying to myself that if you really cared for me a little bit you would still care for me when i came to calcombe pomeroy  but then my natural selfishness overcame meyou can forgive me for it edie how could i help it when i had once seen you i began to be afraid some other man would be beforehand with you and i liked you so much i couldnt bear to think of the chance that you might be taken away from me before i asked you all day long as ive been walking alone on those high grey moors at dunbude ive been thinking of you and at last i made up my mind that i must come and ask you to be my wifesome timewhenever we could afford to marry i know im asking you to make a great sacrifice for me its more than i have any right to ask you im ashamed of myself for asking it i can only make you a poor mans wife and how long i may have to wait even for that i cant say but if youll only consent to wait for me edie ill do the best that lies in me to make you as happy and to love you as well as any man on earth could ever do  edie turned her face towards his and said softly mr  le breton i will wait for you as long as ever you wish and im so happy oh so happy  there was a pause for a few moments and then as they walked homeward down the green glen edie said with something more of her usual archness so after all you havent fallen in love with lady hilda do you know mr le breton i rather fancied at oxford you liked me just a little tiny bit but when i heard you were going to dunbude i said to myself ah now hell never care for a quiet country girl like me and when i knew you were coming down here to calcombe straight from all those grand ladies at dunbude i felt sure youd be disenchanted as soon as you saw me and never think anything more about me  then you liked me edie ernest asked eagerly  you wanted me really to come to calcombe to see you  of course i did mr le breton ive liked you from the first moment i saw you  im so glad ernest went on quickly i believe all real love is love at first sight i wouldnt care myself to be loved in any other way and you thought i might fall in love with lady hilda  well you know she is sure to be so handsome and so accomplished and to have had so many advantages that i have never had i was afraid i should seem so very simple to you after lady hilda  oh edie cried ernest stopping a moment and gazing at the little light airy figure i only wish you could know the difference coming from dunbude to calcombe is like coming from darkness into light up there one meets with nobody but essentially vulgarminded selfish peoplepeople whose whole life is passed in thinking and talking about nothing but dogs and horses and partridges and salmon racing and hunting and billiards and wines amusements amusements amusements all of them coarse and most of them cruel all day long their talk is just like the talk of grooms and gamekeepers in a publichouse parlour only a little improved by better english and more money will soandso win the derby what a splendid run we had with the west somerset on wednesday were you in at the death of that big fox at coulsons corner ought the new vintages of madeira to be bottled direct or sent round the cape like the old ones capital burlesque at the gaiety but very slow at the lyceum who will go to the duchess of dorsetshires dance on the twentiethand so forth for ever their own petty round of selfish pleasures from weeks end to weeks endno thought of anybody else no thought of the world at large no thought even of any higher interest in their own personalities their politics are just a selfish calculation of their own prospectsland church capital privilege their religion when they have any is just a selfish regard for their own personal future welfare from the time i went to dunbude to this day ive never heard a single word about any higher thought of any sorti dont mean only about the troubles or the aspirations of other people but even about books about science about art about natural beauty they live in a world of amusing oneself and of amusing oneself in vulgar fashionsas a born clown would do if he came suddenly into a large fortune the women are just as bad as the men only in a different waynot always even that for most of them think only of the fourinhand club and the pigeonshooting at hurlinghamthings to sicken one now ive known selfish people before but not selfish people utterly without any tincture of culture i come away from dunbude and come down here to calcombe and the difference in the atmosphere makes ones very breath come and go freer and i look at you edie and think of you beside lady hilda tregellis and i laugh in my heart at the difference that artificial rules have made between you  i wish you knew how immeasurably her superior you are in every way the fact is its a comfort to escape from dunbude for a while and get down here to feel oneself once more in the only true sense of the word in a little good society  while these things were happening in the bourne close palsied old miss luttrell mumbling and grumbling inarticulately  to herself was slowly tottering down the steep high street of calcombe pomeroy on her way to the village grocers she shambled in tremulously to mrs oswalds counter and seating herself on a high stool as was her wont laid herself out distinctly for a list of purchases and a good deliberate illnatured gossip  two pounds of coffee if you please mrs oswald she began with a quaver coffee mind i say not chicory your stuff always has the smallest possible amount of flavour in it it seems to me for the largest possible amount of quantity all chicory all chicoryno decent coffee to be had now in calcombe pomeroy so your sons at home this week is he out of work i suppose i saw him lounging about on the beach idling away his time yesterday pity he wasnt at some decent trade instead of hanging about and doing nothing as if he was a gentleman five pounds of lump sugar too good lump sugar though i expect i shall get nothing but beetroot its all beetroot now my brother tells me theyve ruined the west indies with their emancipation  fads and their differential duties and the lord knows whatwe had estates in the west indies ourselves all given up to our negroes nowadaysand now i believe they have to pay the french a bounty or something of the sort to induce them to make sugar out of beetroot because the negroes wont work without whipping so i understand thats what comes in the end of your radical fallal notions well five pounds of lump and five pounds of moist though the ones as bad as the other really a great pity about your son i hope hell get a place again soon it must be a trial to you to have him so idle  well no maam its not mrs oswald answered with such selfrestraint as she could command its not much of a trial to his father and me for were glad to let him have a little rest after working so hard at oxford he works too hard maam but he gets compensation for it dont ee see miss luttrell for hes just been made a fellow of the royal societyfor his mathematical eminence the times saysa fellow of the royal society  even this staggering blow did not completely crush old miss luttrell fellow of the royal society she muttered feebly through her remaining teeth must be some mistake somewhere mrs oswaldquite impossible a very meritorious  young man your son doubtless but a national schoolmasters hardly likely to be made a fellow of the royal society oh i remember you told me hes not a national schoolmaster but has something to do at one of the oxford colleges yes yes i see what it isfellow of the royal geographical society you subscribe a guinea and get made a fellow by subscription just for the sake of writing frgs after your name it gives a young man a look of importance  no miss luttrell it isnt that its the royal society and if youll wait a moment maam ill fetch you the  presidents letter and the diploma to let you see it  oh no occasion to trouble yourself mrs oswald the old lady put in almost with alacrity for she had herself seen the announcement of harry oswalds election in the times a few days before no occasion to trouble yourself im sure i daresay you may be right and at any rate its no business of mine thank heaven i never want to poke my nose into anybody elses business well talking of oxford mrs oswald theres a very nice young man down here at present i wonder if you know where hes lodging i want to ask him to dinner hes a young mr le bretonone of the cheshire le bretons you know his father was sir owen le breton a general in the indian armybrother officer of major standish luttrells and very nice people in every way lady le bretons a great friend of the archdeacons  so i should like to show her son some little attention  hes had a very distinguished career at oxfordyour boy may have heard his name perhapsand now hes acting as tutor to lord lynmouth the eldest son of lord exmoor you know lady exmoor was a second cousin of my brothers wife very nice people all of them the le bretons are a really good family you see and the archdeacons exceedingly fond of them so i thought if you could tell me where this young man is lodgingyou shoppeople pick up all the gossip in the place alwaysid ask him to dinner to meet the rector and colonel turnbull and my nephew who would probably be able to offer him a little shooting  theres no partridges about in may miss luttrell said mrs oswald quietly smiling to herself at the fancy picture of ernest seated in congenial converse with the rector colonel turnbull and young luttrell but as to mr le breton i do happen to know where hes stopping though its not often that i know any calcombe gossip save and except what youre good enough to tell me when you drop in maam for mr le bretons stopping here in this house with us maam this very minute  in this house mrs oswald the old lady cried with a start wagging her unsteady old head this time in genuine surprise why i didnt know you let lodgings i thought you and your daughter were too much of fine ladies for that really im glad to hear it ill leave a note for him  no miss luttrell we dont let lodgings maam and we dont need to mrs oswald answered proudly mr le bretons stopping here as my sons guest they were friends at oxford together and now that mr le breton has got his holiday like harrys asked him down to spend a fortnight  at calcombe pomeroy and if youll leave a note ill be very happy to give it to him as soon as he comes in for hes out walking now with harry and edith  old miss luttrell sat for half a minute in unwonted silence revolving in her poor puzzled head what line of tactics she ought to adopt under such a very singular and annoying  combination of circumstances stopping at the village grocersthis was really too atrocious the le bretons were all as mad as hatters that she knew well all except the mother who was a sensible person and quite rational  but old sir owen was a man with the most absurd religious fanciestook an interest in the souls of the soldiers quite right and proper of course in a chaplain but really too ridiculous in a regular field officer no doubt ernest le breton had taken up some equally extraordinary notionsliberty equality fraternity and a general massacre  probably and he had picked up harry oswald as a suitable companion in his revolutionary schemes and fancies there was no knowing what stone wall one of those mad le bretons might choose to run his head against still the practical difficulty remainedhow could she extricate herself from this awkward dilemma in such a way as to cover herself with glory and inflict another bitter humiliation on poor mrs oswald if only she had known sooner that ernest was stopping at the oswalds she wouldnt have been so loud in praise of the le breton family she would in that case have dexterously insinuated that lady le breton was only a halfpay officers widow living on her pension and that her boys had got promotion at oxford as poor scholars through the archdeacons benevolent influence it was too late now however to adopt that line of defence and she fell back accordingly upon the secondary position afforded her by the chance of taking down mrs oswalds intolerable insolence in another fashion  oh hes out walking with your daughter is he she said maliciously out walking with your daughter mrs  oswald not with your son i saw her passing down the meadows half an hour ago with a strange young man and her brother stopped behind near the millpond a strange young man yes i noticed particularly that he looked like a gentleman and i was quite surprised that you should let her walk out with him in that extraordinary manner  depend upon it mrs oswald when young gentlemen in mr le bretons position go out walking with young women in your daughters position they mean no good by itthey mean no good by it take my advice mrs oswald and dont permit it mr le bretons a very nice young man and well brought up no doubti know his mothers a woman of principlestill young men will be young men and if your son goes bringing down his fine oxford acquaintances to calcombe pomeroy and you and your husband go flinging miss jemimaher names jemima i thinkat the young mens heads why then of course you must take the consequencesyou must take the consequences  and with this telling parthian shot discharged carefully from the shadow of the doorway accompanied by a running comment of shrugs nods and facial distortions old miss luttrell successfully shuffled herself out of the shop her list unfinished leaving poor mrs oswald alone and absolutely speechless with indignation ernest le breton never got a note of invitation from the squires sister but before nightfall all that was visitable in calcombe pomeroy had heard at full length of the horrid conspiracy by which those pushing upstart oswalds had inveigled a son of poor lady le bretons down to stop with them and were now trying to ruin his prospects by getting him to marry their brazenfaced hussey jemima edith  when edie returned from her walk that afternoon mrs  oswald went up into her bedroom to see her daughter she knew at once from edies radiant blushing face and moist eyes what had taken place and she kissed the pretty shrinking  girl tenderly on her forehead edie darling i hope you will be happy she whispered significantly  then you guess it all mother dear asked edie relieved that she need not tell her story in set words  yes darling said the mother kissing her again and you said yes  edie coloured once more i said yes mother for i love him dearly  hes a dear fellow the mother answered gently and im sure hell do his best to make you happy  later on in the day harry came up and knocked at edies door his mother had told him all about it and so had ernest popsy he said kissing her also i  congratulate you im so glad about it le bretons the best fellow i know and i couldnt wish you a better or a kinder husband youll have to wait for him but hes worth waiting for hes a good fellow and a clever fellow and an affectionate fellow and his family are everything that could be desired itll be a splendid thing for you to be able to talk in future about my motherin law lady le breton depend upon it edie dear that always counts for something in society  edie blushed again but this time with a certain tinge of shame and disappointment she had never thought of that herself and she was hurt that harry should think and speak of it at such a moment she felt with a sigh it was unworthy  of him and unworthy of the occasion truly the iron of pi and its evaluations had entered deeply into his soul    chapter xi  culture and culture   i wonder berkeley said herbert le breton examining a coin curiously what on earth can ever have induced you with your ideas and feelings to become a parson  my dear le breton your taste like good wine improves with age answered berkeley coldly there are many reasons any one of which may easily induce a sensible man to go into the church for example he may feel a  disinterested desire to minister to the souls of his poorer neighbours or he may be first cousin to a bishop or he may be attracted by an ancient and honourable national institution or he may possess a marked inclination for albs and chasubles or he may reflect upon the distinct social advantages of a good living or he may have nothing else in particular to do or he may simply desire to rouse the impertinent curiosity of all the indolent quidnuncs of his acquaintance without the remotest intention of ever gratifying their underbred paul pry proclivities  herbert le breton winced a littlehe felt he had fairly laid himself open to this unmitigated rebuffbut he did not retire immediately from his untenable position i suppose he said quietly there are still people who really do take a practical interest in other peoples soulsmy brother ronald does for onebut the idea is positively too ridiculous  whenever i read any argument upon immortality it always seems to me remarkably cogent if the souls in question were your soul and my soul but just consider the transparent absurdity of supposing that every hodge chawbacon and every rheumatic  old betty martin has got a soul too that must go on enduring for all eternity the notions absolutely ludicrous what an infinite monotony of existence for the poor old creatures to endure for everbeing bored by their own inane personalities for a million aeons its simply appalling to think of  but berkeley wasnt going to be drawn into a theological discussionthat was a field which he always sedulously and successfully avoided the immortality of the soul he said quietly is a platonic dogma too frequently confounded even by moderately instructed persons like yourself le breton with the churchs very different doctrine of the resurrection of the body upon this latter subject my dear fellow about which you dont seem to be quite clear or perfectly sound in your views youll find some excellent  remarks in bishop pearson on the creeda valuable work which i had the pleasure of studying intimately for my ordination examination  really berkeley youre the most incomprehensible and mysterious person i ever met in my whole lifetime said herbert dryly i believe you take a positive delight in deceiving and mystifying one do you seriously mean to tell me you feel any interest at the present time of day in books written by bishops  a modern bishop berkeley answered calmly is an unpicturesque but otherwise estimable member of a very distinguished ecclesiastical order who ought not lightly to be brought into ridicule by lewd or lay persons on that ground i have always been in favour myself of gradually reforming his hat his apron and even his gaiters which doubtless serve to render him at least conspicuous if not positively absurd in the irreverent eyes of a ribald generation but as to criticising his literary or theological productions my dear fellow that would be conduct eminently unbecoming in a simple curate and savouring of insubordination even in the person of an elderly archdeacon i decline therefore to discuss the subject especially with a layman on whose orthodoxy i have painful doubtswheres oswald is he up yet  no hes down in devonshire my brother ernest writes me  what at dunbude whats oswald doing there  oh dear no not at dunbude the peerage hasnt yet adopted himat a place called calcombe pomeroy where it seems he lives ernest has gone down there from exmoor for a fortnights holiday you remember oswald has a pretty sisteri met her here in your rooms last october in factand i apprehend she may possibly form a measurable portion of the local attractions a pretty face goes a long way with some people  berkeley drew a deep breath and looked uneasily out of the window this was dangerous news indeed what little miss butterfly has the boy with the gauze net caught sight of you already will he trap you and imprison you so soon in his little gilded matrimonial cage enticing you thereinto with soft words and sugared compliments to suit your dainty delicate palate and must i who have meant to chase you for the chief ornament of my own small cabinet be only in time to see you pinioned and cabined in your white lace veils and other pretty disguised entanglements for his special and particular delectation this must be looked into miss butterfly this must be prevented off to calcombe pomeroy then or other parts unknown this very next tomorrow and let us fight out the possession of little miss butterfly with our two gauze nets in oppositionmine tricked as prettily as i can trick it with tags and ends of artallurements and hummed to in a delicate tunebefore this interloping anticipating le breton has had time to secure you absolutely for himself too austere for you little miss butterfly good in his way and kindly meaning but too austere better come and sun yourself in the modest wee palace of art that i mean to build myself some day in some green sunny sloping valley where your flittings will not be rudely disturbed by breath of poverty nor your pretty feathery wings ruthlessly  clipped with a pair of doctrinaire ethicosocialistic scissors to calcombe then to calcombeand not a days delay before i get there so much of thought in his own quaint indefinite fashion flitted like lightning through arthur berkeleys perturbed mind as he stood gazing wistfully for one second out of his pretty latticed creeperclad window  then he remembered himself quickly with a short little sigh and turned to answer herbert le bretons last halfsneering innuendo  something more than a pretty face merely he said surveying herbert coldly from head to foot a heart too and a mind for all her flitting not wholly unfurnished with good sensible solid mahogany english furniture you may be sure harry oswalds sister isnt likely to be wanting in wits at any rate  oswalds a curious fellow herbert went on changing the venue as he always did when he saw berkeley was really in earnest hes very clever certainly but he can never outlive his bourgeois origin the smell of tea sticks about him somehow to the end of the chapter dont you know berkeley there are some fellows whose clothes seem to have been born with them they fit so perfectly and impede their movement so little while there are other fellows whose clothes look at once as if theyd been made for them by a highly respectable but imperfectly successful tailor  thats just what i always think about harry oswald in the matter of culture hes got a great deal of culture the very best culture from the very best shopoxford in factdressed himself up in the finest suit of clothes from the most fashionable mental tailor but it doesnt seem to fit him naturally he moves about in it uneasily like a man unaccustomed to be clothed by a good workman he looks in his mental upholstery like a greengrocer in evening dress  now theres all the difference in the world between that sort of puton culture and culture in the grain isnt there you may train up a grocers son to read dante and to play mendelssohns lieder and to admire fra angelico but you cant train him up to wear these things lightly and gracefully upon him as you and i do who come by them naturally  we are born to the sphere he rises to it  you think so le breton asked the curate with a quiet and suppressed smile as he thought silently of the placid old shoemaker  think so my dear fellow im sure of it i can spot a man of birth from a man of mere exterior polish any day anywhere talk as much nonsense as you like about all men being born free and equaltheyre not theyre born with natural inequalities in their very nerve and muscle  when i was an undergraduate i startled one of the tutors of that time by beginning my english essay once all men are by nature born free and unequal i stick to it still its the truth they say it takes three generations to make a gentleman nonsense utterly it takes at least a dozen you cant work out the common fibre in such a ridiculous hurry  that results as a simple piece of deductive reasoning from all modern theories of heredity and variation  i agree with you in part le breton the parson said eyeing him closely in part but not altogether what you say about oswalds very largely true his culture sits upon him like a suit made to order not like a skin in which he was born but dont you think thats due more to the individual man than to the class he happens to belong to it seems to me there are other men who come from the same class as oswald or even from lower classes but whose culture is just as much ingrained as say my dear fellow yours is they were born no doubt of naturally cultivated parents and thats how your rule about the dozen generations that go to make a gentleman comes really true i believe myself it takes a good many generations but then none of them need have been gentlemen in the ordinary sense of the word before him a gentleman if im to use the expression as implying the good qualities conventionally supposed to be associated with it a gentleman may be the final outcome and efflorescence of many past generations of quiet unobtrusive workingman culturedont you think so  herbert le breton smiled incredulously i dont know that i do quite he answered languidly i confess i attach more importance than you do to the mere question of race and family a thoroughbred differs from a carthorse and a greyhound from a vulgar mongrel in mind and character  as well as in body oswald seems to me in all essentials a bourgeois at heart even now  but remember berkeley said rather warmly for him the bourgeois class in england is just the class which must necessarily find it hardest to throw off the ingrained traces of its early origin it has intermarried for a long timelong enough to have produced a distinct racial type like those you speak of among dogs and horsesthe philistine type in factand when it tries to emerge it must necessarily fight hard against the innate philistinism of which it is conscious in its own constitution no class has had its inequality with others its natural inferiority so constantly and cruelly thrust in its face certainly the workingman has not the workingman who makes efforts to improve himself is encouraged the workingman who rises is taken by the hand the workingman whatever he does is never sneered at but its very different with the shopkeeper naturally a little prone to servilitythat comes from the very necessities of the situationand laudably anxious to attain the level of those he considers his superiors he gets laughed at on every hand being the next class below society society is always engaged in trying to keep him out and keep him down on the other hand he naturally forms his ideal of what is fine and worth imitating from the example of the class above him and therefore considering what that class is he has unworthy aims and snobbish desires either in his own person or in the persons of his near relations the wholesale merchant and the manufacturerall bourgeois alikehe supplies the mass of nouveaux riches who are the pet laughingstock of all our playwrights and novelists and comic papers so the bourgeois who really knows he has something in him like harry oswald feels from the beginning  painfully conscious of the instability of his position and of the fact that men like you are cutting jokes behind his back about the smell of tea that still clings to him thats a horrible drag to hold a man backthe sense that he must always be criticised as one of his own classand that a class with many recognised failings it makes him selfconscious and i believe selfconsciousness is really at the root of that slight social awkwardness you think you notice in harry oswald a workingmans son need never feel that i feel sure there are workingmens sons who go through the world as gentlemen mixing with gentlemen and never give the matter of their birth one moments serious consideration  their position never troubles them and it never need trouble them put it to yourself now le breton suppose i were to tell you my father was a working shoemaker for example or a working carpenter youd never think anything more about it but if i were to tell you he was a grocer or a baker or a confectioner or an ironmonger youd feel a certain indefinable class barrier set up between us two  immediately and ever after isnt it so now  perhaps it is herbert answered dubitatively but as hes probably neither the one nor the other the hypothesis isnt worth seriously discussing i must go off now ive got a lecture at twelve goodbye dont forget the tickets for thursdays concert  arthur berkeley looked after him with a contemptuous smile the outcome of a race himself he thought and not the best side of that race either i was half tempted in the heat of argument to blurt out to him the whole truth about the dear gentle old progenitor but im glad i didnt now  after all its no use to cast your pearls before swine for herberts essentially a piga selfish selfcentred pig no doubt a very refined and cultivated specimen of pigdomthe best breed but still a most emphatic and consummate pig for all that not the same stuff in him that there is in ernesta fibre or two wanting somewhere but i mustnt praise ernesta rival a rival its war to the death between us two now and no quarter hes a good fellow and i like him dearly but alls fair in love and war and i must go down to calcombe tomorrow morning and forestall him immediately dear little miss butterfly tis for your sake you shall not be pinched and cramped to suit the  procrustean measure of ernest le bretons communistic fancies  you shall fly free in the open air and flash your bright silken wings decked out bravely in scales of many hues not toned down to too sober and quakerlike a suit of drab and dovecolour you were meant by nature for the sunshine and the summer you shall not be worried and chilled and killed with doses of heterodox political economy and  controversial ethics better even a country rectory though with a bad late perpendicular church and flowers and picnics and lawntennis and village smalltalk and the squires dinnerparties than bread and cheese and virtuous poverty in a london lodging with ernest le breton romance lives again the beautiful maiden is about to be devoured by a goggleeyed monster labelled on the back experimental socialism the red cross knight flies to her aid and drives away the monster by his magic music lance in rest lyre at side third class railway ticket in pocket a berkeley to the rescue and there you have it and as he spoke he tilted with his pen at an imaginary dragon supposed to be seated in the crimson rockingchair by the wainscotted fireplace  yes i must certainly go down to calcombe no use putting it off any longer ive arranged to go next summer to london to keep house for the dear old progenitor the music is getting asked for two requests for more this very morning trade is looking up i shall throw the curacy business overboard what chance for modest merit that isnt first cousin to a bishop in the church as at present constituted and take to composing entirely for a livelihood i wouldnt ask miss butterfly before because i didnt wish to tie her pretty wings prematurely but a rival thats quite a different matter what right has he to go poaching on my preserves i should like to know and trying to catch the little gold fish i want to entice for my own private and  particular fishpond an interloper to be turned out  unmercifully so off to calcombe and that quickly  he sat down to his desk and taking out some sheets of blank musicpaper began writing down the score of a little song at which he had been working so he continued till lunchtime and then turning to the table when the scout called him took his solitary lunch of bread and butter with a volume of petrarch set open before him as he eat he was lazily englishing the soft lines of the original into such verse as suited his fastidious ear when the scout came in suddenly once more bringing in his hand the midday letters one of them bore the calcombe postmark strange berkeley said to himself at the very moment when i was thinking of going there an invitation perhaps the age of miracles is not yet pastdont they see spirits in a conjurors room in regent streetfrom oswald too by jove it must be an invitation and he ran his eye down the page rapidly to see if there was any mention of little miss butterfly yes there was her name on the second sheet what could her brother have to say to him about her  we have ernest le breton down here now oswald wrote on a holiday from the exmoors and you may be surprised to hear that i shall probably have him sooner or later for a brotherinlaw he has proposed to and been accepted by my sister edith and though it is likely as things stand at present to be a rather long engagement for le breton has nothing to marry upon we are all very much pleased about it here at calcombe he is just the exact man i should wish my sister to marry so pleasant and good and clever and so very well connected felicitate us my dear berkeley  arthur berkeley laid the letter down with a quiet sigh and folded his hands despondently before him he hadnt seen very much of edie yet the disappointment was to him a very bitter one it had been a pleasant daydream truly and he was both to part with it so unexpectedly poor little miss butterfly he said to himself tenderly and  compassionately poor airy flitting brighteyed little miss butterfly i must give you up must i and ernest le breton must take you for better for worse must he la reyne le veult it seems and her word is law im afraid hes hardly the man to make you happy little lady kindhearted wellmeaning but too much in earnest too much absorbed in his ideas of right for a world where rights impossible and every man for himself is the wretched sordid rule of existence  he will overshadow and darken your bright little life i fear me not intentionallyhe couldnt do thatbut by his quixotic fads and fancies good fads honest fads but fads wholly impracticable in this jarring universe of clashing interests where he who would swim must keep his own head steadily above water and he who minds his neighbour must sink like lead to the unfathomable bottom he will sink i doubt not poor little miss butterfly he will sink inevitably and drag you down with him down down down to immeasurable depths of poverty and despair oh my poor little butterfly im sorry for you and sorry for myself  it was a pretty dream and i loved it dearly i had made you a queen in my fancy and throned you in my heart and now i have to dethrone you again me miserable and have my poor lonely heart bare and queenless  the piano was open and he went over to it instinctively strumming a few wild bars out of his own head made up hastily on the spur of the moment no not dethrone you he went on leaning back on the musicstool and letting his hand wander aimlessly over the keys not dethrone you i shall never never be able to do that little miss butterfly your image is stamped there too deep for dethronement stamped there for ever indelibly ineffaceably not to be washed out by tears or laughter  ernest le breton may take you and keep you you are his you have chosen him and you have chosen in most things not unwisely for hes a good fellow and true let me be generous in the hour of disappointment even to the rival the goggleeyed impracticable dragon monstrosity but you are mine too for i wont give you up i cant give you up i must live for you still even if you know it not  little woman i will work for you and i will watch over you i will be your earthly providence i will try to  extricate you from the quagmires into which the wellmeaning shortsighted dragon will infallibly lead you dear little bright soul my heart aches for you i know the trouble you are bringing upon yourself but la reyne le veult and it is not your humble servitors business to interfere with your royal pleasure still you are mine for i am yours yours body and soul what else have i to live for the dear old progenitor cant be with us many years longer and when he is gone there will be nothing left me but to watch over little miss butterfly and her don quixote of a future  husband a man cant work and slave and compose sonatas for himself alonethe ideas disgusting piggish worthy only of herbert le breton i must do what i can for the little queen and for her balloonnavigating utopian ernest  thank heaven no law prevents you from loving in your own heart the one woman whom you have once loved no matter who may chance to marry her go daydream fly vanish evaporate the solid core remains stillmy heart and little miss butterfly i have loved her once and i shall love her i shall love her for ever  he crumpled the letter up in his fingers and flung it half angrily into the wastepaper basket as though it were the embodied daydream he was mentally apostrophising it was sermonday and he had to write his discourse that very afternoon a quaint idea seized him aha he said almost gaily in his volatile irresponsible fashion i have my text ready the hour brings it to me unsought a quip a quip i shall preach on the pool of bethesda while i am coming another steppeth down before me the verse seems as if it were made on purpose for me what a pity nobody else will understand it and he smiled quietly at the conceit as he got the scented sheets of sermonpaper out of his little sandalwood davenport for arthur berkeley was one of those curiously compounded natures which can hardly ever be perfectly serious and which can enjoy a quaintness or a neat literary allusion even at a moment of the bitterest personal disappointment he could solace himself  for a minute for the loss of edie by choosing a text for his sundays sermon with a prettilyturned epigram on his own position    chapter xii  the more excellent way   at the very top of the winding footpath cut deeply into the sandstone side of the east cliff hill at hastings a wooden seat set a little back from the road invites the panting climber to rest for five minutes after his steep ascent from the primitive fisher village of old hastings which nestles warmly in the narrow sunsmitten gulley at his feet on this seat one bright july morning herbert le breton lay at half length basking in the brilliant open sunshine and evidently waiting for somebody whom he expected to arrive by the side path from the all saints valley even the old coastguardsman plodding his daily round over to ecclesbourne noticed the obvious expectation implied in his attentive attitude and ventured to remark in his cheery familiar fashion she wont be long acomin now sir you may depend upon it the gals is sure to be out early of a fine mornin like this ere herbert stuck his double eyeglass gingerly upon the tip of his nose and surveyed the bluff old sailor through it with a stony british stare of mingled surprise and indignation which drove the poor man hastily off with a few muttered observations about some people being so confounded stuck up that they didnt even understand the point of a little goodnatured seafarin banter  as the coastguardsman disappeared round the corner of the flagstaff a young girl came suddenly into sight by the jutting edge of sandstone bluff near the high wickham and herbert jumping up at once from his reclining posture raised his bat to her with stately politeness and moved forward in his courtly graceful manner to meet her as she approached well selah he said taking her hand a little warmly judged at least by herbert le bretons usual standard so youve come at last ive been waiting  here for you for fully half an hour you see ive come down to hastings again as i promised the very first  moment i could possibly get away from my pressing duties at oxford  the girl withdrew her hand from his blushing deeply but looking into his face with evident pleasure and admiration  she was tall and handsome with a certain dashing air of queenliness about her too and she was dressed in a brave outspoken sort of finery which though cheap enough in its way was neither common nor wholly wanting in a touch of native good taste and even bold refinement of contrast and harmony its very kind of you to come mr walters she answered in a firm but delicate voice  im so sorry ive kept you waiting i got your letter and tried to come in time but father hes been more aggravating than usual almost this morning and kept saying hed like to know what on earth a young woman could want to go out walking for instead of stopping at home at her work and minding her bible like a proper christian in his time young women usent to be allowed to go walking except on sundays and then only to chapel or bible class so ive not been able to get away till this very minute with all this bundle of tracts too to give to the excursionists on the way father feels a most incomprehensible interest somehow in the future happiness of the sunday excursionists  i wish hed feel a little more interest in the present happiness of his own daughter herbert said smiling  but it hasnt mattered your keeping me waiting here selah of course id have enjoyed it all far better in your societyi dont think i need tell you that now dearbut the sunshine and the sea breeze and the song of the larks and the plash of the waves below and the shouts of the fishermen down there on the beach mending their nets and putting out their smacks have all been so delightful after our humdrum round of daily life at oxford that i only wanted your  presence here to make it all into a perfect paradisewhy selah how pretty you look in that sweet print it suits your complexion admirably i never saw you wear anything before so perfectly becoming  selah drew herself up with the conscious pride of an unaffected pretty girl im so glad you think so mr  walters she said playing nervously with the handle of her darkblue parasol you always say such very flattering things  no not flattering herbert answered smiling not flattering selah simply truthful you always extort the truth from me with your sweet face selah nobody can look at it and not forget the stupid conventions of ordinary society but please dear dont call me mr walters call me herbert you always do you know when you write to me  but its so much harder to do it to your face mr  walters selah said again blushing every time you go away i say to myself i shall call him herbert as soon as ever he comes back again and every time you come back i feel too much afraid of you the moment i see you ever to do it and yet of course i ought to you know for when were married why naturally then i shall have to learn to call you herbert shant i  you will i suppose herbert answered rather chillily but that subject is one upon which we shall be able to form a better opinion when the time comes for actually deciding it meanwhile i want you to call me herbert if you please as a personal favour and a mark of confidence  suppose i were to go on calling you miss briggs all the time a pretty sort of thing that would be what inference would you draw as to the depth of my affection well now selah how have these dreadful home authorities of yours been treating you my dear girl all the time since i last saw you  much the same as usual mr waltersherbert i mean selah answered hastily correcting herself the regular round prayers clean the shop breakfast with a chapter serve in the shop all morning dinner with a chapter serve in the shop all afternoon tea with a chapter prayer meeting in the evening supper with a chapter exhortation and go to bed sick of it all to get up next morning and repeat the entire performance da capo as they always say in the music to the hymnbooks  occasional relaxationssunday at chapel three times and wednesday evening bible class mothers assembly dorcas society missionary meeting lecture on the holy land  dissolving views of jerusalem and primitive methodist district conference in the mahanaim jubilee meeting hall salvation privileges every day and all the year round till im ready to drop with it and begin to wish id only been lucky enough to have been born one of those happy benighted little pagans in a heathen land where they dont know the value of the precious sabbath and havent yet been taught to build primitive methodist district chapels for crushing the lives out of their sons and daughters  herbert smiled a gentle smile of calm superiority at this vehement outburst of natural irreligion you must certainly  be bored to death with it all selah he said laughingly  what a funny sort of creed it really is after all for rational beings who on earth could believe that the religion these people use to render your life so absolutely miserable is meant for the same thing as the one that makes my poor dear brother ronald so perfectly and inexpressibly serene and happy the formalism of lower natures like your fathers has turned it into a machine for crushing all the spontaneity out of your existence what a régime for a highspirited girl like you to be compelled to live under selah  it is it is selah answered vehemently i wish you could only see the way father goes on at me all the time about chapel and so on mr walherbert i mean you wouldnt wonder if you were to hear him at my being anxious for the time to come when you can leave oxford and we can get comfortably married what between the drudgery  of the shop and the drudgery of the chapel my lifes positively getting almost worn out of me  herbert took her hand in his quietly it was not a very small hand but it was prettily though cheaply gloved and the plain silver bracelet that encircled the wrist though simple and inexpensive was not wanting in rough tastefulness  youre a bad philosopher selah he said turning with her along the path towards ecclesbourne youre always anxious to hurry on too fast the lagging wheels of an unknown future after all how do you know whether we should be any the happier if we were really and truly married dont you know what swinburne says in doloresyouve read it in the poems and ballads i gave you       time turns the old days to derision       our loves into corpses or wives     and marriage and death and division       make barren our lives   ive read it selah answered carelessly and i thought it all very pretty of course swinburne always is very pretty but im sure i never try to discover what on earth he means by it i suppose father would say i dont read him tearfully and prayerfullyat any rate im quite sure i never understand what hes driving at  and yet hes worth understanding herbert answered in his clear musical voicewell worth understanding selah especially for you dearest if in imitation of obsolete fashions you wished to read a few verses of some improving  volume every night and morning as a sort of becoming religious exercise in the elements of selfculture i dont know that i could recommend you a better book to begin upon than the poems and ballads dont you see the moral of those four lines ive just quoted to you why should we wish to change from anything so free and delightful and poetical as lovers into anything so fettered and commonplace and  prosaic and banal as wives and husbands why should we wish to give up the fanciful paradise of fluttering hope and expectation for the dreary reality of housekeeping and cold mutton on mondays why should we not be satisfied with the real pleasure of the passing moment without for ever torturing our souls about the imaginary but delusive pleasure of the unrealisable impossible future  but we must get married some time or other herbert selah said turning her big eyes full upon him with a doubtful  look of interrogation we cant go on courting in this way for ever and ever without coming to any definite  conclusion we must get married byandby now mustnt we  je nen vois pas la nécessité moi herbert answered with just a trace of cynicism in his curling lip i dont see any must about it that is to say in english selah the fact is you see im above all things a philosopher youre a philosopher too but only an instinctive one and i want to make your instinctive philosophy assume a rather more rational and extrinsic shape why should we really be in any hurry to go and get married do the actual married people of our acquaintance as a matter of fact seem so very much more ethereally happywith their eight children to be washed and dressed and schooled daily for examplethan the lovers like you and me who walk arminarm out here in the sunshine and havent yet got over their delicious first illusions depend upon it the longer you can keep your illusions the better you havent read aristotle in all  probability but as aristotle would put it it isnt the end that is anything in lovemaking its the energy the active pursuit the momentary enjoyment of it i suppose we shall have to get married some day selah though i dont know when but i confess to you i dont look forward to the day quite so rapturously as you do shall we feel more the thrill of possession do you think than i feel it now when i hold your hand in mine so and catch the beating of your pulse in your veins even through the fingers of your pretty little glove shall we look deeper into one anothers eyes and hearts than i look now into the very inmost depths of yours  shall we drink in more fully the essence of love than when i touch your lips hereone moment selah the gorse is very deep herenow dont be foolishah there whats the use of philosophising tell me by the side of that come over here to the bench selah by the edge of the cliff look down yonder into ecclesbourne glen hear the waves dashing on the shore below and your own heart beating against your bosom withinand then ask yourself whats the good of living in any moment in any moment but the present  selah turned her great eyes admiringly upon him once more oh herbert she said looking at him with a clever uneducated girls unfeigned and undisguised admiration for any cultivated gentleman who takes the trouble to draw out her higher self oh herbert how can you talk so beautifully  to me and then ask me why it is im longing for the day to come when i can be really and truly married to you  do you think i dont feel the difference between spending my life with such a man as you and spending it for years and years together with a ranting canting primitive methodist  herbert smiled to himself a quiet unobtrusive selfsatisfied smile she appreciates me he thought silently in his own heart she appreciates me at my true worth and after all thats a great thing well selah he went on aloud toying unreproved with her pretty little silver bracelet let us be practical you belong to a business family and you know the necessity for being practical theres a great deal to be said in favour of my hanging on at oxford a little longer i must get a situation somewhere else as soon as possible in which i can get married but i cant give up my fellowship without having found something else to do which would enable me to put my wife in the position i should like her to occupy  a very small income would do for me with you herbert selah put in eagerly you see ive been brought up economically enough heaven knows and i could live extremely well on very little  but i could not selah herbert answered in his colder tone pardon me but i could not ive been accustomed to a certain amount of comfort not to say luxury which i couldnt readily do without and then you know dear he added seeing a certain cloud gathering dimly on selahs forehead i want to make my wife a real lady  selah looked at him tenderly and gave the hand she hold in hers a faint pressure and then herbert began to talk about the waves and the cliffs and the sun and the great red sails and to quote shelley and swinburne and the  conversation glided off into more ordinary everyday topics  they sat for a couple of hours together on the edge of the cliff talking to one another about such and other subjects till at last selah asked the time hurriedly and declared she must go off at once or fatherd be in a tearing passion  herbert walked back with her through the green lanes in the golden mass of gorse till he reached the brow of the hill by the fisher village then selah said lightly not any nearer herbertyou see i can say herbert quite naturally nowthe neighbours will go talking about it if they see me standing  here with a strange gentleman goodbye goodbye till friday herbert held her face up to his in his hands and kissed her twice over in spite of a faint resistance then they each went their own way selah to the little greengrocers shop in a back street of the redbrick fisher village and herbert to his big fashionable hotel on the marine parade in the noisy stuccoed modern watering place  its an awkward sort of muddle to have got oneself into he thought to himself as he walked along the asphalte  pavement in front of the seawall a most confoundedly  awkward fix to have got oneself into with a pretty girl of the lower classes shes beautiful certainly that theres no  denying the handsomest woman on the whole i ever remember to have seen at any time anywhere and when im actually by her sidethough its a weakness to confess itim really not quite sure that im not positively quite in love with her  shed make a grand sort of messalina without a doubt a model for a painter with her frank imperious face and her splendid voluptuous figure a faustina a catherine of russia an ann boleynto be fitly painted only by a rubens or a gustave courbet yet how i can ever have been such a particular fool as to go and get myself entangled with her i cant imagine heredity heredity it must run in the family for certain theres ernest has gone and handed himself over bodily to this grocer person somewhere down in devonshire and i myself who perfectly see the folly of his absurd proceeding have independently put  myself into this very similar awkward fix with selah briggs here selah briggs indeed the very name reeks with commingled dissent vulgarity and greengrocery her fathers deacon of his chapel and goes out at night when theres no missionary meeting on to wait at serious dinner parties or rather i suppose hed desert the most enticing missionary to earn a casual halfcrown at even an ungodly champagnedrinking dinner then thats the difference between me and ernest ernests selfish incurably and radically selfish because this oswald girl happens to take his passing fancy and to fit in with his impossible schurzian notions hell actually go and marry her not only will he have no consideration for motherwho really is a very decent sort of body in her own fashion if you dont rub her up the wrong way or expect too much from herbut hell also interfere without a thought with my prospects and my advancement now that i call really selfish and selfishness is a vulgar piggish vice that i thoroughly abominate i dont deny that im a trifle selfish myself of course in a refined and cultivated manneri flatter myself in fact that  introspective analysis is one of my strong points and i dont conceal my own failings from my own consciousness with any weak girlish prevarications but after all as hobbes very well showed though our shallow modern philosophers pretend to laugh at him selfishness in one form or another is at the very base of all human motives the difference really is between sympathetic and unsympathetic selfishnessbetween piggishness and cultivated feelings now i will not give way to the foolish and selfish impulses which would lead me to marry selah briggs i will put a curb upon my inclinations and do what is really best in the end for all the persons concernedand for myself especially  he strolled down on to the beach and began throwing pebbles carelessly into the plashing water yes he went on in his internal colloquy i can only account for my  incredible stupidity in this matter by supposing that it depends somehow upon some incomprehensible hereditary leaning in the le breton family idiosyncrasy its awfully unlike me i will do myself the justice to say to have got myself into such a silly dilemma all for nothing it was all very well a few years ago when i first met selah i was an undergraduate  in those days and even if somebody had caught me walking with a young lady of unknown antecedents and doubtful aspirates on the east cliff at hastings it really wouldnt have much mattered she was beautiful even thenthough not so beautiful as now for she grows handsomer every day and it was natural enough i should have taken to going harmless walks about the place with her she attracted me by her social rebelliousnessanother family trait in me passive not active contemplative not personal but she certainly attracted me she attracts me still a man must have some outlet for the natural and instinctive emotions of our common humanity and if a monastic oxford community imposes celibacy upon one with mediaeval absurditywhy selah briggs is for the time being the only possible sort of outlet one neednt marry her in the end but for the moment it is certainly very excellent fooling  not unsentimental eitherfor my part i could never care for mere coarse commonplace venal wretches indeed when i spoke to her just now about my wishing to make my wife a lady upon my word at the time i almost think i was just then quite in earnest the idea flitted across my mind vaguelywhy not send her for a year or two to be polished up at paris or somewhere and really marry her afterwards for good and always but on second thoughts it wont hold water shes magnificent shes undeniable shes admirable but she isnt possible the name alones enough to condemn her fancy marrying somebody with a christian name out of the hundred and somethingth psalm  its too atrocious i really couldnt inflict her for a moment on poor suffering innocent society  he paused awhile watching the great russet sails of the fishing vessels flapping idly in the breeze as the men raised them to catch the faint breath of wind and then he thought once more but how to get rid of her thats the question  every time i come here now she goes on more and more about the necessity of our getting soon marriedand i dont wonder at it either for she has a perfect purgatory of a life with that snivelling methodistical father of hers one may be sure of it it would be awfully awkward if any oxford people were to catch me here walking with her on the cliff over yondersome sniggering fellow of jesus or worcester for example or worse than all some prying young pecksniff of a thirdyear undergraduate somehow she seems to fascinate me and i cant get away from her but i must really do it and be done with it its no use going on this way much longer i must stop here for a few days more only and then tell her that im called away on important college business say to yorkshire or worcestershire or  somewhere i neednt tell her in person face to face i can write hastily at the last moment to the usual name at the post officeto be left till called for and as a matter of fact i wont go to yorkshire eithervery awkward and undignified though these petty prevarications when a man once begins lowering himself by making love to a girl in an inferior position he lets himself in for all kinds of disagreeable necessities afterwardsi shall go to switzerland yes no place better after the bother of running away like a coward from selah in the alps one would forget all petty human degradations i shall go to switzerland of course i wont break off with her altogetherthat would be cruel and i really like her upon my word even when she isnt by up to her own level i really like her but ill let the thing die a natural death of inanition as they always put it in the newspapers with their stereotyped phraseology a gradual coldness shall intervene between us thatll be the best and only way out of it  and if i go to switzerland why not ask oswald of oriel to go with me that i fancy wouldnt be a bad stroke of social policy ernest will marry this oswald girl unfortunately  hes as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the nile and as hes going to drag her inevitably into the family i may as well put the best possible face upon the  disagreeable matter lets make a virtue of necessity the father and mother are old theyll die soon and be gathered to their fathers if they had any and the world will straightway forget all about them but oswald will always be there en évidence and the safest thing to do will be to take him as much as possible into the world and let the sister rest upon his reputation for her place in society its quite one thing to say that ernest has married the daughter of a country grocer down in devonshire and quite another thing to say that he has married the sister of oswald of oriel the  distinguished mathematician and fellow of the royal society  how beautifully that warm brown sail stands out in a curve against the cold grey line of the horizona bulging curve just like the swell of selahs neck when she throws her head back so and lets you see the contour of her throat her beautiful rounded throatah thats not giving her up now is itwhat a confounded fool i am to be sure anybody would say if they could only have read my thoughts that moment that i was really in love with this girl selah    chapter xiii  ye mountains of gilboa   the old englischer hof at pontresina looked decidedly sleepy and misty at five oclock on an august morning when two sturdy british holidayseekers in knickerbockers and regular alpine climbing rig sat drinking their parting cup of coffee in the salleàmanger before starting to make the ascent of the piz margatsch one of the tallest and by far the most difficult among the peaks of the bernina range there are few prettier villages in the engadine than pontresina and few better hotels in all switzerland than the old ivycovered englischer hof yet on this particular morning and at that particular hour it certainly did look just a trifle cold and cheerless he never makes very warm in the engadine carlo the waiter observed with a shudder in his best english to one of the two early risers and he makes colder on an august morning here than he makes at nice in full december for poor carlo was one of those cosmopolitan  waiters who follow the cosmopolitan tourist clientèle round all the spas health resorts kurs and winter quarters of fashionable europe in january he and his brother as charles and henri handed round absinthes and cigarettes at the cercle nautique at nice in april as carlo and enrico they turned up again with water ices and wafer cakes in the caffè manzoni at milan and in august the observant traveller might recognise them once more under the disguise of karl and heinrich laying the table dhôte in the long and narrow oldfashioned diningroom of the englischer hof at pontresina though their native tongue was the patois of the canton ticino they spoke all the civilised languages of the world and also german with perfect fluency and without the slightest attempt at either grammar or idiomatic accuracy and they both profoundly believed in their hearts that the rank wealth youth beauty and fashion of all other nations were wisely ordained by the inscrutable designs of providence for a single purpose to enrich and reward the active intelligent and industrious natives of the canton ticino  are the guides come yet asked harry oswald of the waiter in somewhat feeble and hesitating german he made it a point to speak german to the waiters because he regarded it as the only proper and national language of the universal teutonic swiss people  they await the gentlemans in the corridor answered carlo in his own peculiar and racy english for he on his side resented the imputation that any traveller need ever converse with him in any but that travellers own tongue provided only it was one of the recognised and civilised languages of the world or even german they are a barbarous  and disgusting race those tedeschi look you well signor they address you as though you were the dust in the piazza yet even from them a polite and attentive person may confidently look for a modest a very modest but still a welcome trinkgeld  then wed better hurry up oswald said herbert le breton for guides are the most tyrannical set of people on the entire face of this planet i shall have another cup of coffee before i go though if the guides swear at me roundly in the best roumansch for it anyhow  your acquaintance with the roumansch dialect being probably limited harry oswald answered the difference between their swearing and their blessing would doubtless be reduced to a vanishing point though ive noticed that swearing is really a form of human speech everywhere readily understanded of the people in spite of all differences of race or language one touch of nature you see and swearing after all is extremely natural  are you ready asked herbert having tossed off his coffee yes then come along at once i can feel the guides frowning at us through the partition  they turned out into the street with its greenshuttered windows all still closed in the pale grey of early morning and walked along with the three guides by the high road which leads through rocks and firtrees up to the beginning of the steep path to the piz margatsch passing the clear emeraldgreen waterfall that rushes from under the lower melting end of the morteratsch glacier they took at once to the narrow track by the moraine along the edge of the ice and then to the glacier itself which is easy enough climbing as glaciers go for a good pedestrian herbert le breton the older mountaineer of the two got over the big blocks readily enough but harry less accustomed to swiss expeditions  lagged and loitered behind a little and required more assistance from the guides every now and again than his sturdy companion  im getting rather blown at starting harry called out at last to herbert some yards in front of him do you think the despotic guide would let us sit down and rest a bit if we asked him very prettily  offer him a cigar first herbert shouted back and then after a short and decent interval prefer your request humbly in your politest french the savage potentate always expects to be propitiated by gifts as a preliminary to answering the petitions of his humble subjects  i see harry said laughing supply before grievances not grievances before supply and he halted a moment to light a cigar and to offer one to each of the two guides who were helping him along on either side  thus mollified the senior guide grudgingly allowed ten minutes halt and a drink of water at the bend by the corner of the glacier they sat down upon the great translucent seagreen blocks and began talking with the taciturn chief guide  is this glacier dangerous harry asked  dangerous monsieur oh no not as one counts glaciers it is very safe there are seldom accidents  but there have been some  some naturally you dont climb mountains always without accidents there was one the first time anyone ever made the ascent of the piz margatsch that was fifty years ago my uncle was killed in it  killed in it harry echoed how did it all happen and where  yonder monsieur in a crevasse that was then situated near the bend at the corner just where the great crevasse you see before you now stands that was fifty years ago since then the glacier has moved much its substance in effect has changed entirely  tell us all about it herbert put in carelessly he knew the guide wouldnt go on again till he had finished his whole story  its a strange tale the guide answered taking a puff or two at his cigar pensively and then removing it altogether for his set narrativehe had told the tale before a hundred times and he had the very words of it now regularly by heart it was the first time anyone ever tried to climb the piz margatsch at that time nobody in the valley knew the best path it is my father who afterwards discovered it  two english gentlemen came to pontresina one morning one might say you two gentlemen but in those days there were not many tourists in the engadine the exploitation of the tourist had not yet begun to be developed my father and my uncle were then the only two guides at pontresina  the english gentlemen asked them to try with them the scaling of the piz margatsch my uncle was afraid of it but my father laughed down his fears so they started my uncle was dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons and a pair of brown velvet breeches ah heaven i can see him yet his white corpse in the blue coat and the brown velvet breeches  but you cant be fifty yourself harry said looking at the tall longlimbed man attentively no nor forty nor thirty either  no monsieur i am twentyseven the chief guide answered taking another puff at his cigar very deliberately and this was fifty years ago yet i have seen his corpse just as the accident happened you shall hear all about it  it is a tale from the dead it is worth hearing  this begins to grow mysterious said herbert in english  hammering impatiently at the ice with the shod end of his alpenstock sounds for all the world just like the introduction to a christmas number  a young girl in the village loved my uncle the guide went on imperturhably and she begged him not to go on this expedition she was betrothed to him but he wouldnt listen and they all started together for the top of the piz margatsch after many trials my father and my uncle and the two tourists reached the summit so you see andreas said my father your fears were all folly halfway through the forest said my uncle one is not yet safe from the wolf then they began to descend again they got down past all the dangerous places and on to this glacier so well known so familiar and then my uncle began indeed to get careless he laughed at his own fears cathrein was all wrong he said to my father we shall get down again safely with our ladys assistance so they reached at last the great crevasse my father and one of the englishmen got over without difficulty but the other englishman slipped his footing failed him and he was sinking sinking down down down slipping quickly into the deep dark green abyss below my uncle stretched out his hand over the edge the englishman caught it and then my uncle missed his foothold they both fell together and were lost to sight at once completely in the invisible depths of the great glacier  well herbert le breton said as the man paused a moment is that all  no the guide answered with a tone of deep solemnity  that is not all the glacier went on moving moving slowly slowly but always downward for years and years  yet no one ever heard anything more of the two lost bodies  at last one day when i was seven years old i went out playing with my brother among the pinewoods near the waterfall that rushes below there from under the glacier we saw something lying in the icecold water just beneath the bottom of the icesheet we climbed over the moraine and there oh heaven we could see two dead bodies they were drowned just drowned we thought it might have been yesterday one of them was short and thickset with the face of an englishman he was closeshaven and what seemed odd to us he had on clothes which though we were but children we knew at once for the clothes of a long past fashionin fact a suit of the louis dixhuit style tha other was a tall and handsome man dressed in the unchangeable blue coat and brown velvet breeches of our own canton of the graubunden we were very frightened about it and so we ran away trembling and told an old woman who lived close by her name was cathrein and her  grandchildren used to play with us though she herself was about the age of my father for my father married very late old cathrein came out with us to look and the moment she saw the bodies she cried out with a great cry it is he it is andreas it is my betrothed who was lost on the very day week when i was to be married i should know him at once among ten thousand it is many many years now but i have not forgotten his faceah my god that face i know it well and she took his hand in hers that fair white young hand in her own old brown withered one and kissed it gently and yet she said he is five years older than me this fair young man here five years older than me we were frightened to hear her talk so for we said to ourselves she must be mad so we ran home and brought our father he looked at the dead bodies and at old cathrein and he said it is indeed true he is my brother ah monsieur you would not have forgotten it if you had seen those two old people standing there beside the fresh corpses they had not seen for all those winters they themselves had meanwhile grown old and grey and wrinkled but the ice of the glacier had kept those others young and fresh and fair and beautiful as on the day they were first engulfed in it it was terrible to look at  a most ghastly story indeed herbert le breton said yawning and now i think wed better be getting under way again hadnt we oswald  harry oswald rose from his seat on the block of ice unwillingly and proceeded on his road up the mountain with a distinct and decided feeling of nervousness was it the guides story that made his knees tremble slightly was it his own inexperience in climbing or was it the cold and the fatigue of the first ascent of the season to a man not yet in full pedestrian alpine training he did not feel at all sure about it in his own mind but this much he knew with perfect certainty that his footing was not nearly so secure under him as it had been during the earlier part of the climb over the lower end of the glacier  byandby they reached the long sheer snowy slope near the three brothers this slope is liable to slip and requires careful walking so the guides began roping them together  the stout monsieur in front next after me said the chief guide knotting the rope soundly round herbert le breton then kaspar then you monsieur to harry oswald and finally paolo to bring up the rear the thin monsieur is nervous i think its best to place him most in the middle  if you really are nervous oswald herbert said not unkindly youd better stop behind i think and let me go on with two of the guides the really hard work you know has scarcely begun yet  oh dear no harry answered lightly he didnt care to confess his timidity before herbert le breton of all men in the world i do feel just a little groggy about the knees i admit but its not nervousness its only want of training  i havent got accustomed to glacierwork yet and the best way to overcome it is by constant practice solvitur ambulando you know as aldrich says about achilles and the tortoise  very good herbert answered drily only mind whatever you do for heavens sake dont go and stumble and pull me down on the top of you its the clear duty of a good citizen to respect the lives of the other men who are roped together with him on the side of a mountain  they set to work again in single file with cautious steps planted firmly on the treacherous snow to scale the great white slope that stretched so temptingly before them harry felt his knees becoming at every step more and more ungovernable  while herbert didnt improve matters by calling out to him from time to time now then look out for a hard bit here or mind that loose piece of ice there or be very careful how you put your foot down by the yielding edge yonder and so forth at last they had almost reached the top of the slope and were just above the bare gulley on the side when harrys insecure footing on a stray scrap of ice gave way suddenly and he begain to slip rapidly down the sheer slope of the mountain in a second he had knocked against paolo and paolo had begun to slip too so that both were pulling with all their weight against kaspar and the others in front for heavens sake man herbert cried hastily dig your alpenstock deep into the snow at the same instant the chief guide shouted in roumansch to the same effect to kaspar but even as they spoke kaspar pushing his feet hard against the snow began to give way too and the whole party seemed about to slip together down over the sheer rocky precipice of the great gulley on the right it was a moment of supreme anxiety but herbert le breton looking back with blood almost unstirred and calmly observant eye saw at once the full scope of the threatening danger theres only one chance he said to himself quietly oswald is lost already unless the rope breaks we are all lost together at that very second harry oswald throwing his arms up wildly had reached the edge of the terrible precipice he went over with a piercing cry into the abyss with the last guide beside him and kaspar following him close in mute terror then herbert le breton felt the rope straining straining straining upon the sharp frozen edge of the rock for an inappreciable point of time it strained and crackled one loud snap and it was gone for ever herbert and the chief guide almost upset by the sudden release from the heavy pull that was steadily dragging them over threw themselves flat on their faces in the drifted snow and checked their fall by a powerful muscular effort the rope was broken and their lives were saved but what had become of the three others  they crept cautiously on hands and knees to the most practicable spot at the edge of the precipice and the guide peered over into the great white blank below with eager eyes of horrid premonition as he did so he recoiled with awe and made a rapid gesture with his hands half prayer half speechless terror what do you see asked herbert not daring himself to look down upon the blank beneath him lest he should be tempted to throw himself over in a giddy moment  jesu maria cried the guide crossing himself instinctively over and over again they have all fallen to the very foot of the second precipice they are lying all three huddled together on the ledge there just above the great glacier they are dead quite dead dead before they reached the ground even great god it is too terrible  herbert le breton looked at the whitefaced guide with just the faintest suspicion of a sneering curl upon his handsome features the excitement of the danger was over now and he had at once recovered his usual philosophic equanimity quite dead he said in french quite dead are they then we cant be of any further use to them  but i suppose we must go down again at once to help recover the dead bodies  the guide gazed at him blankly with simple openmouthed undisguised amazement naturally he said in a very quiet voice of utter disgust and loathing you wouldnt leave them lying there alone on the cold snow would you  this is really most annoying thought herbert le breton to himself in his rational philosophic fashion here we are almost at the summit and now we shall have to turn back again from the very threshold of our goal without having seen the view for which weve climbed up and risked our lives tooall for a purely sentimental reason because we wont leave those three dead men alone on the snow for an hour or two longer its a very short climb to the top now and i could manage it by myself in twenty minutes if only the chief guide had slid over with the others i should have gone on alone and had the view at least for my trouble i could have pretended the accident happened on the way down again as it is i shall have to turn back ingloriously re infecta the guide will tell everybody at pontresina that i went on in spite of the accident and then it would get into the english papers and all the world would say that i was so dreadfully cruel and heartless people are always so irrational in their ethical judgments oswalds quite dead thats certain nobody could fall over such a precipice as that without being killed a dozen times over before he even reached the bottom a very painless and easy death too i couldnt myself wish for a better one  we cant do them the slightest good by picking up their lifeless bodies and yet a foolishly sentimental public opinion positively compels one to do it poor oswald upon my soul im sorry for him and for that pretty little sister of his too but whats the use of bothering about it the things done and nothing that i can do or say will ever make it any better  so they turned once more in single file down by the great glacier and retraced their way to pontresina without exchanging another word to say the truth the chief guide felt appalled and frightened by the presence of this impassive unemotional british traveller and did not even care to conceal his feelings but then he wasnt an educated philosopher and man of culture like herbert le breton  late that evening a party of twelve villagers brought back three stiff and mangled corpses on loose cattle hurdles into the village of pontresina two of them were the bodies of two local swiss guides and the third with its delicate face unscathed by the fall and turned calmly upwards to the clear moonlight was the body of harry oswald alas alas gilboa the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places    chapter xiv  what do these hebrews here   from calcombe pomeroy ernest had returned not to dunbude but to meet the exmoor party in london there he had managed somehowhe hardly knew how himselfto live through a whole season without an explosion in his employers family that an explosion must come sooner or later he felt pretty sure in his own mind for several reasons his whole existence there was a mistake and an anomaly and he could no more mix in the end with the exmoor family than oil can mix with vinegar or vice versâ the round of dances and dinners to which he had to accompany his pupil was utterly distasteful to him lynmouth never learnt anything so ernest felt his own function in the household a perfectly useless one and he was always on the eve of a declaration that he couldnt any longer put up with this that or the other gross immorality in which lynmouth was actively or passively encouraged by his father and mother still there were two things which indefinitely postponed the smouldering outbreak in the first place ernest wrote to and heard from edie every day and he believed he ought for edies sake to give the situation a fair trial as long as he was able or at least till he saw some other opening which might make it possible within some reasonable period to marry her in the second place lady hilda had perceived with her intuitive quickness the probability  that a cause of dispute might arise between her father and ernest and had made up her mind as far as in her lay to prevent its ever coming to a head she didnt wish ernest to leave his post in the householdso much originality  was hardly again to be secured in a hurryand therefore  she laid herself out with all her ingenuity to smooth over all the possible openings for a difference of opinion whenever they occurred if ernests scruples were getting the upper hand of his calmer judgment lady hilda read the change in his face at once and managed dexterously to draw off lynmouth or to talk over her mother quietly to acquiesce in ernests view of the question if lord exmoor was beginning to think that this young mans confounded fads were really getting quite unbearable lady hilda  interposed some casual remark about how much better lynmouth was kept out of the way now than he used to be in mr  walshs time ernest himself never even suspected this unobtrusive diplomatist and peacemaker but as a matter of fact it was mainly owing to lady hildas constant interposition  that he contrived to stop in wilton place through all that dreary and penitential london season  at last to ernests intense joy the season began to show premonitory symptoms of collapsing from inanition the twelfth of august was drawing nigh and the comingofage of grouse that most important of annual events in the orthodox british social calendar would soon set free lord exmoor and his brother hereditary legislators from their arduous duty of acting as constitutional drag on the general advance of a great tolerant and easygoing nation soon the family would be off again to dunbude or away to its other moors in scotland and among the rocks and the heather ernest felt he could endure lord exmoor and lord lynmouth a little more resignedly than among the reiterated polite platitudes and monotonous gaieties of the vacuous london drawingrooms  lady hilda too was longing in her own way for the season to be over she had gone through another of them thank goodness she said to herself at times with a rare tinge of pensiveness only to discover that the hughs and the guys and the algies and the montys were just as fatuously inane as ever and were just as anxious as before to make her share their fatuous inanity for a whole lifetime only fancy living with an unadulterated monty from the time you were twenty to the time you were seventyfiveat which latter date he being doubtless some five years older than oneself to begin with would probably drop off quietly with suppressed gout and leave you a mourning widow to deplore his untimely and lamented extinction for the rest of your existence why long before that time you would have got to know his very thoughts by heart if he had any poor fellow and would be able to finish all his sentences and eke out all his stories for him the moment he began them much better marry a respectable porkbutcher outright and have at least the healthful exercise of chopping sausagemeat to fill up the stray gaps in the conversation in that condition of life they say people are at any rate perfectly safe from the terrors of ennui however the season was over at last thank heaven and in a week or so more they would be at dear old ugly dunbude again for the whole winter there hilda would go sketching once more on the moorland and if this time she didnt make that stupid fellow ernest see what she was driving at why then her name certainly wasnt hilda tregellis  a day or two before the legal period fixed for the beginning  of the general grouseslaughter ernest was sitting reading in the breakfast room at wilton place when  lynmouth burst unexpectedly into the room in his usual boisterous fashion  oh i say mr le breton he began holding the door in his hand like one in a hurry i want leave to miss work this morning gerald talfourd has called for me in his dogcart and wants me to go out with him now immediately  not today lynmouth ernest answered quietly  you were out twice last week you know and you hardly ever get your full hours for work at all since we came to london  oh but look here you know mr le breton i really must go today because talfourd has made an appointment for me its awful funhes going to have some pigeonshooting  ernests countenance fell a little and he answered in a graver voice than before if thats what you want to go for lynmouth i certainly cant let you go you shall never have leave from me to go pigeonshooting  why not lynmouth asked still holding the doorhandle at the most significant angle  because its a cruel and brutal sport ernest replied looking him in the face steadily and as long as youre under my charge i cant allow you to take part in it  oh you cant said lynmouth mischievously with a gentle touch of satire in his tone you cant cant you  very well then never mind about it and he shut the door after him with a bang and ran off upstairs without further remonstrance  its time for study lynmouth ernest called out opening the door and speaking to him as he retreated  come down again at once please will you  but lynmouth made no answer and went straight off upstairs to the drawingroom in a few minutes more he came back and said in a tone of suppressed triumph well mr le breton im going with talfourd ive been up to papa and he says i may if i like to  ernest bit his lip in a moments hesitation if it had been any ordinary question he would have pocketed the contradiction of his authorityafter all if it didnt matter to them it didnt matter to himand let lynmouth go wherever they allowed him but the pigeonshooting was a question of principle as long as the boy was still nominally his pupil he couldnt allow him to take any part in any such wicked and brutal amusement as he thought it so he answered back quietly no lynmouth you are not to go  i dont think your father can have understood that i had forbidden you  oh lynmouth said again without a word of remonstrance  and went up a second time to the drawingroom  in a few minutes a servant came down and spoke to ernest my lord would like to see you upstairs for a few minutes if you please sir  ernest followed the man up with a vague foreboding that the deferred explosion was at last about to take place lord exmoor was sitting on the sofa oh i say le breton he began in his goodhumoured way whats this that lynmouths been telling me about the pigeonshooting he says you wont let him go out with gerald talfourd  yes ernest answered he wanted to miss his mornings  work and i told him i couldnt allow him to do so  but i said he might if he liked le breton young talfourd has called for him to go pigeonshooting and now lynmouth tells me you refuse to let him go after ive given him leave is that so  certainly said ernest i said he couldnt go because before he asked you i had refused him permission and i supposed you didnt know he was asking you to reverse my decision  oh of course lord exmoor answered for he was not an unreasonable man after his lights youre quite right le breton quite right certainly disciplines discipline we all know and must be kept up under any circumstances  you should have told me lynmouth that mr le breton had forbidden you to go however as young talfourd has made the engagement i suppose you dont mind letting him have a holiday now at my request le breton do you  here was a dilemma indeed for ernest he hardly knew what to answer he looked by chance at lady hilda seated on the ottoman in the corner and lady hilda catching his eye pursed up her lips visibly into the one word do but ernest was inexorable if he could possibly prevent it he would not let those innocent pigeons be mangled and slaughtered for a lazy boys cruel gratification that was the one clear duty before him and whether he offended lord exmoor or not he had no choice save to pursue it  no lord exmoor he said resolutely after a long pause i should have no objection to giving him a holiday but i cant allow him to go pigeonshooting  why not asked lord exmoor warmly  ernest did not answer  he says its a cruel brutal sport papa lynmouth put in parenthetically in spite of an angry glance from hilda and he wont let me go while im his pupil  lord exmoors face grew very red indeed and he rose from the sofa angrily so thats it mr le breton he said in a short sharp fashion you think pigeonshooting cruel and brutal do you will you have the goodness to tell me sir do you know that i myself am in the habit of shooting pigeons at matches  yes ernest answered without flinching a muscle  yes cried lord exmoor growing redder and redder  you knew that mr le breton and yet you told my son you considered the practice brutal and cruel is that the way you teach him to honour his parents who are you sir that you dare set yourself up as a judge of me and my conduct how dare you speak to him of his father in that manner how dare you stir him up to disobedience and insubordination against his elders how dare you sir how dare you  ernests face began to get red in return and he answered with unwonted heat how dare you address me so yourself lord exmoor how dare you speak to me in that imperious  manner youre forgetting yourself i think and i had better leave you for the present till you remember how to be more careful in your language but lynmouth is not to go pigeonshooting i object to his going because the sport is a cruel and a brutal one whoever may practise it  if i have any authority over him i insist upon it that he shall not go if he goes i shall not stop here any longer  you can do as you like about it of course but you have my final word upon the matter lynmouth go down to the study  stop lynmouth cried his father boiling over visibly with indignation stop never mind what mr le breton says to you do you hear me go out if you choose with gerald talfourd  lynmouth didnt wait a moment for any further permission  he ran downstairs at once and banged the front door soundly after him with a resounding clatter lady hilda looked imploringly at ernest and whispered half audibly now youve done it ernest stood a second irresolute while the earl tramped angrily up and down the drawingroom and then he said in a calmer voice when would it be convenient lord exmoor that i should leave you  whenever you like lord exmoor answered violently  today if you can manage to get your things together  this is intolerable absolutely intolerable gross and  palpable impertinence in my own house too cruel and brutal indeed cruel and brutal fiddlesticks why its not a bit different from partridgeshooting and he went out closely followed by ernest leaving lady hilda alone and frightened in the drawingroom  ernest ran lightly upstairs to his own little study sittingroom ive done it this time certainly as lady hilda said he thought to himself but i dont see how i could possibly have avoided it even now when alls done i havent succeeded in saving the lives of the poor innocent tortured pigeons theyll be mangled and hunted for their poor frightened lives anyhow well now i must look out for that imaginary schoolmastership and see what i can do for dear edie i shant be sorry to get out of this after all for the place was an impossible one for me from the very beginning i shall sit down this moment and write to edie and after that i shall take out my portmanteau and get the man to help me put my luggage up to go away this very evening another day in the house after this would be obviously impossible  at that moment there came a knock at the doora timid tentative sort of knock and somebody put her head  inquiringly halfway through the doorway ernest looked up in sudden surprise it was lady hilda  mr le breton she said coming over towards the table where ernest had just laid out his blottingbook and writingpaper i couldnt prevent myself from coming up to tell you how much i admire your conduct in standing up so against papa for what you thought was right and proper i cant say how greatly i admire it im so glad you did as you did do you have acted nobly and hilda looked straight into his eyes with the most speaking and most melting of glances now she said to herself according to all correct precedents he ought to seize my hand fervently with a gentle pressure and thank me with tears in his eyes for my kind sympathy  but ernest only looking puzzled and astonished answered  in the quietest of voices thank you very much lady hilda but i assure you there was really nothing at all noble nothing at all to admire in what i said or did in any way in fact im rather afraid now i come to think of it that i lost my temper with your father dreadfully  then you wont go away hilda put in quickly you think better of it now do you youll apologise to papa and go with us to dunbude for the autumn do say you will please mr le breton  oh dear no ernest answered smiling quietly at the bare idea of his apologising to lord exmoor i certainly wont do that whatever i do to tell you the truth lady hilda i have not been very anxious to stop with lynmouth all along ive found it a most unprofitable tutorshipno sense of any duty performed or any work done for society and im not at all sorry that this accident should have broken up the engagement unexpectedly at the same time its very kind of you to come up and speak to me about it though im really quite ashamed you should have thought there was anything particularly praiseworthy or commendable  in my standing out against such an obviously cruel sport as pigeonshooting  ah but i do think so whatever you may say mr le breton hilda went on eagerly i do think so and i think it was very good of you to fight it out so against papa for what you believe is right and proper for my own part you know i dont see any particular harm in pigeonshooting  of course its very dreadful that the poor dear little things should be shot and wounded and winged and so forth but then everything almost gets shot you seerabbits and grouse and partridges and everything so that really its hardly worth while it seems to me making a fuss about it still thats not the real question you think its wrong which is very original and nice and proper of you and as you think its wrong you wont countenance it in any way i dont care myself whether its wrong or notim not called upon thank goodness to decide the question but i do care very much that you should suffer for what you think the right course of action and lady hilda in her earnestness almost laid her hand upon his arm and looked up to him in the most unmistakable and appealing fashion  youre very good im sure lady hilda ernest replied  half hesitatingly wondering much in his own mind what on earth she could be driving at  there was a moments pause and then hilda said pensively  and so we shall never walk together at dunbude on the clatter any more mr le breton we shall never climb again among the big boulders on those devonshire hillsides we shall never watch the red deer from the big pool on top of the sheepwalk im sorry for it mr le breton very sorry for it oh i do wish you werent going to leave us  ernest began to feel that this was really growing embarrassing  i dare say we shall often see one another he said evasively for simpleminded as he was a vague  suspicion of what lady hilda wanted him to say had somehow forced itself timidly upon him londons a very big place no doubt but still people are always running together  unexpectedly in it  hilda sighed and looked at him again intently without speaking she stood so face to face with him across the table for fully two minutes and then seeming suddenly to awake from a reverie she started and sighed once more and turned at last reluctantly to leave the little study i must go she said hastily mamma would be very angry indeed with me if she knew id come here but i couldnt let you leave the house without coming up to tell you how greatly i admire your spirit and how very very much i shall always miss you mr le breton will you take this and keep it as a memento as she spoke she laid an envelope upon the table and glided quietly out of the room  ernest took the envelope up with a smile and opened it with some curiosity it contained a photograph with a brief inscription on the back e l b from hilda  tregellis  as he did so hilda tregellis red and pale by turns had rushed into her own room locked the door wildly and flung herself in a perfect tempest of tears on her own bed where she lay and tossed about in a burning agony of shame and selfpity for twenty minutes he doesnt love me she said to herself bitterly he doesnt love me and he doesnt care to love me or want to marry me either im sure he understood  what i meant this time and there was no response in his eyes no answer no sympathy hes like a block of wooda cold impassive immovable lifeless creature and yet i could love himoh if only he would say a word to me in answer how i could love him i loved him when he stood up there and bearded papa in his own drawingroom and asked him how dare he speak so how dare he address him in such a manner i knew then that i really loved him if only he would let me but he wont to think that i could have half the algies and berties in london at my feet for the faintest encouragement and i cant have this one poor penniless ernest le breton though i go down on my knees before him and absolutely ask him to marry me  thats the worst of it ive humiliated myself before him by letting him see oh ever so much too plainly that i wanted him to ask me and ive been repulsed rejected positively refused and slighted by him and yet i love him i shall never love any other man as i love ernest le breton  poor lady hilda tregellis even she too had at times her sentimental moments and there she lay till her eyes were red and swollen with crying and till it was quite  hopeless to expect she could ever manage to make herself  presentable for the cecil faunthorpes gardenparty that  afternoon at twickenham    chapter xv  evil tidings   ernest had packed his portmanteau and ordered a hansom meaning to take temporary refuge at number 28 epsilon terrace and he went down again for a few minutes to wait in the breakfastroom where he saw the times lying casually on the little table by the front window he took it up half dreamily by way of having something to do and was skimming the telegrams in an unconcerned manner when his attention was suddenly arrested by the name le breton printed in conspicuous type near the bottom of the third column he looked closer at the paragraph and saw that it was headed accident to british tourists in switzerland a strange tremor seized him immediately  could anything have happened then to herbert he read the telegram through at once and found this bald and concise summary before him of the fatal pontresina accident  as mr h oswald frs of oriel college oxford and mr le breton fellow and bursar of st aldates college  along with three guides were making the ascent of the piz margatsch in the bernina alps this morning one of the party happened to slip near the great gulley known as the gouffre mr oswald and two of the guides were precipitated  over the edge of the cliff and killed immediately the breaking of the rope at a critical moment alone saved the lives of mr le breton and the remaining guide the bodies have been recovered this evening and brought back to pontresina  ernest laid down the paper with a thrill of horror poor edie how absolutely his own small difficulties with lord exmoor faded out of has memory at once in the face of that terrible irretrievable calamity harry dead the hope and mainstay of the familythe one great pride and glory of all the oswalds on whom their whole lives and affections centred taken from them unexpectedly without a chance of respite without a moments warning worst of all they would probably learn it as he did for the first time by reading it accidentally in the curt language of the daily papers pray heaven the shock might not kill poor edie  there was only a minute in which to make up his mind but in that minute ernest had fully decided what he ought to do and how to do it he must go at once down to calcombe  pomeroy and try to lighten this great affliction for poor little edie nay lighten it he could not but at least he could sympathise with her in it and that though little was still some faint shade better than nothing at all how fortunate that his difference with the exmoors allowed him to go that very evening without a moments delay when the hansom arrived at the door ernest told the cabman to drive at once to paddington station almost before he had had time to realise the full meaning of the situation he had taken a thirdclass ticket for calcombe road and was rushing  out of london by the plymouth express in one of the convenient and commodious little wooden horseboxes which the great western railway company provide as a wholesome deterrent for economical people minded to save half their fare by going third instead of first or second  didcot swindon bath bristol exeter newton abbot all followed one after another and by the time ernest had reached calcombe road station he had begun to frame for himself a definite plan of future action he would stop at the red lion inn that evening send a telegram from exeter beforehand to edie to say he was coming next day and find out as much as possible about the way the family had borne the shock before he ventured actually to see them  the calcombe omnibus drawn by two lean and weary horses toiled its way slowly up the long steep incline for six miles to the cross foxes and then rattled down the opposite slope steaming and groaning till it drew up at last with a sudden jerk and a general collapse in front of the old red lion inn in the middle of the high street there ernest put up for the present having seen by the shutters at the grocers shop on his way down that the oswalds had already heard of harrys accident he had dinner by himself with a sick heart in the gloomy close little coffeeroom of the village inn and after dinner he managed to draw in the landlord in person for a glass of sherry and half an hours conversation  very sad thing sir this ere causality in switzerland said the redfaced landlord coming round at once to the topic of the day at calcombe after a few unimportant  preliminary generalities young mr oswald as has been killed he lived here sir leastways his parents do he was a very promising young gentleman up at oxford they do tell menot much of a judge of horses i should say but still i understand quite the gentleman for all that very sad thing the causality sir for all his family pears he was climbing up some of these ere alps they have over there in them parts covered with snow from head to foot in the manner of speaking and there was another gentleman from oxford with him a mr le breton  my brother ernest put in interrupting him for he thought it best to let the landlord know at once who he was talking to  oh your brother sir said the redfaced landlord with a gleam of recognition growing redder and hotter than ever well now you mention it sir i find i remember your face somehow no offence sir but youre the young gentleman as come down in the spring to see young mr  oswald arent you  ernest nodded assent  ah well sir the landlord went on more freelyfor of course all calcombe had heard long since that ernest was engaged to edie oswaldyoure one of the family like in that case if i may make bold to say so well sir this is a shocking trouble for poor old mr oswald and no mistake  the old gentleman was sort of centred on his son you see as the saying is never thought of nobody else hardly he didnt old mr oswald sir was always a wonderful hand at figgers hisself and powerful fond of measurements and such kinds of things ive heard tell indeed as how he knew more mathematics and trigononomy and that than the rector and the schoolmaster both put together theres not one in fifty as knows as much mathematics as he do ill warrant well you see he brought up this son of his little harry as wasi can remember him now running to and from the school and figgerin away on the slates doin the sums in algemer for the other boys when they went amitchinhe brought him up like a gentleman as you know very well sir and sent him to oxford college to develop his mathematical talents mr legge his father says to me here in this very parlour whats the consequence he develops that boys talent sure enough sir till he comes to be a fellow of oxford college they tell me and even admitted into the royal society up in london but this is how he did it sir and as youre a friend of the family like and want to know all about it no doubt i dont mind tellin you on the strict confidential in the manner of speakin here the landlord drew his chair closer and sipped the last drop in his glass of sherry with a mysterious air of very private and important disclosures ernest listened to his roundabout story with painful attention  well sir the landlord went on after a short and pensive pause old mr oswalds business aint never been a prosperous  onethough he was such a clover hand at figgers he never made it remunerative a bare livin for the family i dont mind sayin and he always spent moren he ought to a done on mr harry and on the young lady too sir savin your presence so when mr harry was goin to oxford to college he come to me and he says to me mr legge says he its a very expensive thing sending my boy to the university says he and im going to borrow money to send him with dont you go adoin that mr oswald says i your business dont justify you in doin it sir says i for you see i knowed all the ins and outs of that there business and i knowed he hadnt never made moren enough just to keep things goin decent like as you may say without any money saved or put by against a emergence yes i will mr legge says he i can trust confidentially  in my sons abilities says he and i feel confidential  hell be in a position to repay me before long so he borrowed the money on an insurance of mr harrys life  mr harry he always acted very honourable sir he was a perfect gentleman in every way as you know sir and he began repayin his father the loan as fast as he was able and i daresay doin a great deal for the family and especially for the young lady sir out of his own pocket besides but he still owed his father a couple of hundred pound an more when this causality happened while the business i know had been agoin to rack and ruin for the last three year  today i seen the agent of the insurance and he says to me legge says he most private like this is a bad job about young oswald im afeard worsen they know for why sir says i well legge says he theyll never get a penny of that there insurance and the old gentlemanll have to pay up the defissit on his own account says he hows that mr micklethwaite says i because says he theres a clause in the policy agin exceptional risks in which is included naval and military services furrin  residences topical voyages and mountainclimbin says he and you mark my words says he theyll never get a penny of it in which case sir its my opinion that old mr oswaldll be clean broke for he cant never make up the defissit out of his own business can he now  ernest listened with sad forebodings to the redfaced landlords pitiful story and feared in his heart that it was a bad lookout for the poor oswalds he didnt sleep much that evening and next day he went round early to see edie the telegram he found would be a useless precaution for the gossip of calcombe pomeroy had recognised him at once and news had reached the oswalds almost as soon as he arrived that young mr le breton was stopping that evening at the red lion  edie opened the door for him herself pale of face and with eyes reddened by tears yet looking beautiful even so in her simple black morning dress her mourning of course hadnt yet come homeand her deep white linen collar  its very good of you to have come so soon mr le breton she said taking his hand quietlyhe respected her sorrow too deeply to think of kissing her he will be back with us tomorrow your brother is bringing him back to us to lay him in our little churchyard and we are all so very very grateful to him for it  ernest was more than half surprised to hear it it was an unusual act of kindly thoughtfulness on the part of herbert  next day the body came home as edie had said and ernest helped to lay it reverently to rest in calcombe  churchyard poor old mr oswald standing bowed and  brokenhearted by the open grave side looked as though he could never outlive that solemn burial of all his hopes and aspirations  in a single narrow coffin yet it was wonderful to ernest to see how much comfort he took even in this terrible grief from the leader which appeared in the times that morning on the subject of the pontresina accident it contained only a few of the stock newspaper platitudes of regret at the loss of a distinguished and rising young light of sciencethe ordinary glib commonplaces of obituary notices which a practised journalist knows so well how to adapt almost mechanically to the passing event of the moment but they seemed to afford the shattered old country grocer an amount of consolation and solemn relief that no mere spoken  condolences could ever possibly have carried with them see what a wonderful lot they thought of our boy up in london mr le breton he said looking up from the paper tearfully and wiping his big gold spectacles dim with moisture see what the times says about him one of the ablest among our young academical mathematicians a man who if his life had been spared to us might probably have attained the highest distinction in his own department of pure science thats our harry mr le breton thats what the times says about our dear dead harry i wish he could have lived to read it himself ediea scholar of singularly  profound attainments whose abilities had recently secured him a place upon the historic roll of the royal society and whom even the french academy of sciences had held worthy out of all the competitors of the civilised world to be adjudged the highest mathematical honours of the present season my poor boy my poor dear lost boy i wish you could have lived to hear it we must keep the paper edie we must keep all the papers theyll show us at least what people who are real judges of these things thought about our dear loved lost harry  ernest dared hardly glance towards poor edie with the tears trickling slowly down her face but he felt thankful that the brokenhearted old father could derive so much incomprehensible consolation from those cold and stereotyped conventional phrases truly a wonderful power there is in mere printers ink properly daubed on plain absorbent white paper and truly the human heart full to bursting and just ready to break will allow itself to be cheated and cajoled in marvellous fashions by extraordinary cordials and inexplicable little social palliatives the concentrated hopes of that old mans life were blasted and blighted for ever and he found a temporary relief from that stunning shock in the artificial and insincere condolences of a stock leaderwriter on a daily paper  walking back by himself in such sad meditations to the red lion and sitting there by the open window ernest overheard a tremulous chattering voice mumbling out a few incoherent words at the rectors doorway opposite oh yes chirped out the voice in a tone of cheerful resignation its very sad indeed very sad and shocking and im  naturally very sorry for it of course i always knew how it would be i warned them of it but theyre a pigheaded heedless unmannerly family and they wouldnt be guided by me i said to him now oswald this is all very wrong and foolish of you you go and put your son to oxford when he ought to be stopping at home minding the shop and learning your business you borrow money foolishly  to send him there with hell go to oxford hell fall in with a lot of wealthy young gentlemenpeople above his own natural stationhell take up expensive extravagant ways and in the end hell completely ruin himself he wont pay you back a penny you may depend upon itthese boys never do when you make fine gentlemen of them they think only of their cigars and their horses and their dogcarts and so forth and neglect their poor old fathers and mothers that brought them up and scraped and saved to make fine gentlemen of them you just take my advice oswald and dont send him to college but oswald was always a presumptuous highheaded independent sort of man and instead of listening to me what does he do but go and send this sharp boy of his up to oxford well now the boys gone to switzerland with one of the young le bretonsbrother of the poor young man theyve inveigled into what they call an engagement with miss edith or miss jemima or whatever the girls name isvery wellconnected people the le bretons and personal friends of the archdeaconsand there hes thrown himself over a precipice or something of the sort no doubt to avoid his moneymatters and debts and difficulties at any rate micklethwaite tells me the poor old fatherll have to pay up a couple of hundred pound to the insurance company  and how on earth hes ever to do it i dont know for to my certain knowledge the rent of the shop is in arrears halfayear already but its no business of mine thank goodnessand i only hope that exposure will serve to open that poor young le bretons eyes and to warn him against having anything further to say to miss jemima a  designing young minx if ever there was one poor young le bretons come down here for the funeral i hear which i must say was very friendly and proper and honourable of him but now its over i hope hell go back again and see miss jemima in her true colours  ernest turned back into the stuffy little coffeeroom with his face on fire and his ears tingling with mingled shame and indignation whatever happens he thought to himself i cant permit edie to be subjected any longer to such insolence as this poor dear guileless sorrowing little maiden one would have thought her childish innocence and her terrible loss would have softened the heart even of such a cantankerous virulent old harridan as that till a few weeks were over at least she spoke of the archdeacon it must be old miss luttrell whoever it is though edie shant much longer be left where she can possibly come in contact with such a loathsome mass of incredible and  unprovoked malice that edie should lose her dearlyloved brother is terrible enough but that she should be exposed afterwards to be triumphed over in her most sacred grief by that bad old womans querulous i told you so is simply intolerable and he paced up and down the room with a boiling heart unable to keep down his righteous anger    chapter xvi  flat rebellion   for the next fortnight ernest remained at the red lion though painfully conscious that he was sadly wasting his little reserve of funds from his late tutorship in order to find out exactly what the oswalds position would be after the loss of poor harry towards the end of that time he took edie pale and pretty in her simple new mourning out once more into the bourne close for half an hours quiet conversation  very delicate and sweet and refined that tiny girlish face and figure looked in the plain unostentatious black and white of her great sorrow and ernest felt as he walked along by her side that she seemed to lean upon him naturally now the loss of her main support and chief advisor in life seemed to draw her closer and closer every day to her one remaining prop and future husband  edie he said to her as they rested once more beside the old wooden bridge across the little river i think its time now we should begin to talk definitely over our common plans for the future i know youd naturally rather wait a little longer before discussing them i wish for both our sakes we could have deferred it but time presses and im afraid from what i hear in the village that things wont go on henceforth exactly as they used to do with your dear father and mother  edie coloured slightly as she answered then youve heard of all that already ernestshe was learning to call him ernest now quite naturally the calcombe tattle has got round to you so soon im glad of it though for it saves me the pain of having to tell you yes its quite true and im afraid it will be a terrible dreadful struggle for poor darling father and mother and the tears came up afresh as she spoke into her big black eyestoo familiar with them of late to make her even try to brush them away hastily from ernests sight with her little handkerchief  im sorry to know its true ernest said taking her hand gently very very sorry we must do what we can to lighten the trouble for them  yes edie replied looking at him through her tears i mean to try at any rate i wont be a burden to them myself any longer ive written already up to an agency in london to see whether they can manage to get me a place as a  nurserygoverness  you a governess edie ernest exclaimed hastily with a gesture of deprecation you a governess why my own precious darling you would never do for it  oh yes indeed edie answered quickly i really think i could ernest of course i dont know very muchnot judged by a standard like yours or our dear harrys  harry used to say all a woman could ever know was to find out how ignorant she was dear fellow he was so very learned himself he couldnt understand the  complacency of little perky halfeducated schoolmistresses  but still i know quite as much i think in my little way as a great many girls who get good places in london as governesses i can speak french fairly well you know and read german decently and then dear harry took such a lot of pains to make me get up books that he thought were good for mehistory and so forthand even to teach me a little a very little latin of course i know im dreadfully ignorant but not more so i really believe than  a great many girls whom people consider quite welleducated enough to teach their daughters after all the daughters themselves are only women too you see ernest and dont expect more than a smattering of bookknowledge and a few showy fashionable accomplishments  my dear edie ernest answered smiling at her gently in spite of her tearful earnestness you quite misunderstand me it wasnt that i was thinking of at all there are very few governesses and very few women anywhere who have half the knowledge and accomplishments and literary taste and artistic culture that you have very few who have had the advantage of associating daily with such a man as poor harry and if you really wanted to get a place of the sort the mere fact that youre harrys sister and that he interested himself in superintending your education ought by itself to ensure your getting a very good one but what i meant was rather thisi couldnt endure to think that you should be put to all the petty slights and small humiliations that a governess has always to endure in rich families you dont know what it is edie you cant imagine the endless devices for making her feel her dependence and her artificial  inferiority that these great people have devised in their  cleverness and their christian condescension you dont know what it is edie and i pray heaven you may never know but i do for ive seen itand darling i cant let you expose yourself to it  to say the truth at that moment there rose very vividly before ernests eyes the picture of poor shy miss merivale the governess at dunbude to little lady sybil lynmouths younger sister miss merivale was a rectors daughteran orphan and a very nice girl in her way and ernest had often thought to himself while he lived at the exmoors with just the slightest turn of fortunes wheel that might be my own edie now for himself he had never felt any sense of social inferiority at all at dunbude he was an oxford man and by the ordinary courtesy of english society he was always treated accordingly in every way as an equal  but there were galling distinctions made in miss merivales case which he could not think of even at the time without a blush of ingenuous shame and which he did not like now even to mention to pretty shrinking eager little edie one thing alone was enough to make his cheeks burn whenever he thought of ita little thing and yet how unendurable miss merivale lunched with the family and with her pupil in the middle of the day but she did not dine with them in the evening she had tea by herself instead in lady sybils little schoolroom many a time when ernest had been out  walking with her on the terrace just before dinner and the dressinggong sounded he had felt almost too ashamed to go in at the summons and leave the poor little governess out there alone with her social disabilities the gong seemed to raise such a hideous artificial barrier between himself and that delicatelybred sensitive cultivated english lady that edie should be subjected to such a life of affronts as that was simply unendurable true there are social distinctions of the sort which even ernest le breton communist as he was could not practically get over but then they were distinctions familiarised to the sufferers from childhood upward and so perhaps a little less insupportable but that harry oswalds sisterthat edie his own precious delicate little edie a dainty english wildflower of the tenderest should be transplanted from her own appreciative home to such a chilly and ungenial soil as thatthe very idea of it was horribly unspeakable  but ernest edie answered breaking in upon his bitter meditation i assure you i wouldnt mind it a bit i knowits very dreadful but thenand here she blushed one of her pretty apologetic little blushesyou know im used to it people in business always are they expect to be treated just like servantnow that i know youll say is itself a piece of hubris the expression of a horrid class prejudice and so it is no doubt but they do for all that  as dear harry used to say even the polypes in aristocratic useless sponges at the seabottom wont have anything to say to the sponges of commerce im sure nobody i could meet in a governesss place could possibly be worse in that respect than poor old miss catherine luttrell  that may be true edie darling ernest answered not caring to let her know that he had overheard a specimen of the calcombe squirearchy but in any case i dont want you to be troubled now either with old miss luttrell or any other bitter old busybodies i want to speak seriously to you about a very different project just look at this  advertisement  he took a scrap of paper from his pocket and handed it to edie it ran thus       wanted at pilbury regis grammar school dorset a     third classical master must be a graduate of oxford or     cambridge university prizeman preferred if unmarried     to take house duty commence september 20th salary     200l a year apply as above to the rev j greatrex     dd head master   edie read it through slowly well ernest she said looking up from it into his face do you think of taking this mastership  if i can get it ernest answered you see im not a university prizeman and that may be a difficulty in the way but otherwise im not unlikely to suit the requirements  herbert knows something of the schoolhes been down there to examine and mrs greatrex had a sort of distant bowing acquaintance with my mother so i hope their influence might help me into it  well ernest edie cried again feeling pretty certain in her own heart what was coming next and reddening  accordingly  well edie in that case would you care to marry at once and try the experiment of beginning life with me upon two hundred a year i know its very little darling for our wants and necessities brought up as you and i have been but herr max says you know its as much as any one family ought ever to spend upon its own gratifications and at any rate i dare say you and i could manage to be very happy upon it at least for the present in any case it wnuld be better than being a governess will you risk it edie  to me ernest edie answered with her unaffected simplicity it really seems quite a magnificent income i dont suppose any of our friends or neighbours in calcombe spend nearly as much as two hundred a year upon their own families  ah yes they do darling but that isnt the only thing  two hundred a year is a very different matter in quiet  oldworld little calcombe and in a fashionable modern  wateringplace like pilbury regis we shall have to live in lodgings edie and live very quietly indeed but epen so i think it will be better than for you to go out and endure the humiliation of becoming a governess then i may understand that if i can get this mastership youll consent to be married edie before the end of september  oh ernest thats dreadfully soon  yes it is darling but you must have a very quiet wedding and i cant bear to leave you here now any longer without harry to cheer and protect you shall we look upon it as settled  edie blushed and looked down as she answered almost  inaudibly as you think best dear ernest  so that very evening ernest sent off an application to pilbury regis together with such testimonials as he had by him mentioning at the same time his intention to marry and his recent engagement at lord exmoors i hope they  wont make a point about the university prize edie he said timidly but i rather think they dont mean to  insist upon it im afraid it may be put in to some extent mainly as a bait to attract parents advertisements are often so very dishonest at any rate we can only try and if i get it i shall be able to call you my little wife in september  so soon after poor harrys death he hardly liked to say much about how happy that consciousness would make him but he sent off the letter with a beating heart and waited anxiously for the head masters answer  maria said dr greatrex to his wife next morning turning over the pile of letters at the breakfast table who do you think has applied for the third mastership very lucky really isnt it  considering that there are some thirty millions of people in england i believe dr greatrex said his wife with dignity that some seventy of those have answered your advertisement and that you havent yet given me an opportunity even of guessing which it is of them all im sure i cant say so far whether its lucky or otherwise  youre pleased to be satirical my dear the doctor answered blandly he was in too good a humour to pursue the opening further but no matter well ill tell you then its young le breton  not lady le bretons son cried mrs greatrex forgetting  her dignity in her surprise well that certainly is very lucky now if we could only get her to come down and stay with us for a week sometimes after hes been here a little while what a splendid advertisement it would be for the place to be sure joseph  capital the head master said eyeing the letter complacently as he sipped his coffee a perfect jewel of a master i should say from every possible point of view  just the sort of person to attract parents and pupils  allow me to introduce you to our third master mr le breton i hope lady le breton was quite well when you heard from her last le breton and all that sort of thing  depend upon it maria theres nothing in the world that makes a middleclass parentand our parents are unfortunately all middleclassprick up his ears like the faintest suspicion or echo of a title very good school he goes back and says to his wife immediately well send tommy there they have a master whos an honourable or something  of the sort sure to give the boys a thoroughly high gentlemanly tone its snobbery i admit sheer snobbery but between ourselves maria most people are snobs and  we have to live professionally by accommodating ourselves to their foolish prejudices  at the same time doctor said his wife severely i dont think we ought to allow it too freely at least with the door open  youre quite right my dear the head master answered submissively rising at the same time to shut the door  but what makes this particular application all the better is that young le breton would come here straight from the earl of exmoors where he has been acting as tutor to the son and heir viscount lynmouth thats really admirable now isnt it just consider the advantages of the situation  a doubtful parent comes to inspect the arrangements sniffs at the dormitories takes the gauge of the studies snorts over the playground condescends to approve of the fives courts then after doing the usual christian principles business and working in the high moral tone a little we invite him to lunch and young le breton to meet him you remark casually in the most unconscious and natural fashioni admit my dear that you do these little things much better than i dooh talking of cricket mr le breton your old pupil lord lynmouth made a splendid score the other day at the eton and harrow fixes the wavering parent like a shot third master something or other in the peerage  and has been tutor to a son of lord exmoors place to send your boys to if you want to make perfect gentlemen of them i think wed better close at once with this young mans offer maria hes got a very decent degree too a first in mods and greats really very decent  but will he take a housemastership do you think doctor asked the careful lady  no he wont hes married or soon going to be we must let him off the house duty  married said mrs greatrex turning it over cautiously  whos he going to marry i wonder i hope somebody presentable  why of course dr greatrex answered as who should feel shocked at the bare suggestion that a young man of ernest le bretons antecedents could conceivably marry otherwise  his wife or rather his wife that is to be is a sister he tells me of that poor mr oswaldthe famous mathematician  you know of orielwho got killed you remember by falling off the matterhorn or somewhere just the other day  you must have seen about it in the times  i remember mrs greatrex answered in placid contentment  and i should say you cant do better than take him immediately itd be an excellent thing for the school certainly as the third masterships worth only two hundred a year of course he cant intend to marry upon that so he must have means of his own which is always a good thing to encourage in an undermaster or if his wife has money that comes in the end to the same thing theyll take a house of their own no doubt and shell probably entertainvery quietly i daresay still a small dinner now and then gives a very excellent tone to the school in its own way social considerations as i always say joseph are allimportant in school management and i think we may take it for granted that mr le breton would be socially a real acquisition  so it was shortly settled that dr greatrex should write back accepting ernest le breton as third master and mrs  greatrex began immediately dropping stray allusions to lady le breton our new masters mother you know among her various acquaintance especially those with rising young families the doctor and she thought a good deal of this catch they were making in the person of ernest le breton poor souls they little knew what sort of social qualities they were letting themselves in for a firebrand or a bombshell would really have been a less remarkable guest to drop down straight into the prim and proper  orthodox society of pilbury regis  when ernest received the letter in which dr greatrex informed him that he might have the third mastership he hardly knew how to contain his joy he kissed edie a dozen times over in his excitement and sat up late making plans with her which would have been delightful but for poor edies lasting sorrow in a short time it was all duly arranged and ernest began to think that he must go back to london for a day or two to let lady le breton hear of his change of plans and got everything in order for their quiet wedding he grudged the journey sadly for he was beginning to understand now that he must take care of the pence for edies sake as well as for humanityshis abstraction  was individualising itself in concrete formbut he felt so much at least was demanded of him by filial duty and besides he had one or two little matters to settle at epsilon terrace which could not so well be managed in his absence even by his trusty deputy ronald so he ran up to town once more in a hurry and dropped in as if nothing had happened at his mothers house it was no unusual matter for him to pass a fortnight at wilton place without finding time to call round at epsilon terrace to see ronald and his mother had not heard at all as yet of his recent change of engagement  lady le breton listened with severe displeasure to ernests account of his quarrel with lord exmoor it was quite unnecessary and wrong she said to prevent  lynmnouth from his innocent boyish amusements pigeonshooting was practised by the very best people and she was quite sure therefore there could be no harm of any sort in it she believed the sport was countenanced not only by bishops but even by princes pigeons she supposed had been specially created by providence for our use and enjoymenttheir final cause being apparently the manufacture of pigeonpie ronald suggested parenthetically but we couldnt use them without killing them unfortunately and shooting was probably as painless a form of killing as any other peter or somebody she distinctly remembered had been specially commanded to arise kill and eat to object to pigeonshooting indeed in lady le bretons opinion was clearly flying in the face of providence of ronalds muttered reference to five sparrows being sold for two farthings and yet not one of them being forgotten she would not condescend to take any notice however thank goodness the fault was none of hers she could wash her hands entirely of all responsibility in the matter she had done her best to secure ernest a good place in a thoroughly nice family and if he chose to throw it up at a moments notice for one of his own absurd communistical fads it was happily none of her business she was glad at any rate that hed got another berth with a conscientious earnest christian man like dr greatrex and indeed ernest she said returning once more to the pigeonshooting question  even your poor dear papa who was full of such absurd religious fancies didnt think that sport was unchristian im certain for i remember once when we were quartered at moozuffernugger in the northwest provinces he went out into a nullah near our compound one day and with his own hand shot a maneating tiger which had carried off three little native children from the thanah so that shows that he couldnt really object to sport and i hope you dont mean to cast disrespect upon the memory of your own poor father all of which profound moral and religious  observations ernest as in duty bound received with the most respectful and acquiescent silence  and now he had to approach the more difficult task of breaking to his mother his approaching marriage with edie oswald he began the subject as delicately as he could dwelling strongly upon poor harry oswalds excellent  position as an oxford tutor and upon herberts visit with him to switzerlandhe knew his mother too well to suppose that the real merits of the oswald family would impress her in any way as compared with their accidental social status and then he went on to speak as gently as possible about his engagement with little edie at this point to his exceeding discomfiture lady le breton adopted the unusual tactics of bursting suddenly into a flood of tears  oh ernest she sobbed out inarticulately through her scented cambric handkerchief for heavens sake dont tell me that youve gone and engaged yourself to that designing girl oh my poor poor misguided boy is there really no way to save you  no way to save me exclaimed ernest astonished and disconcerted by this unexpected outburst  yes yes lady le breton went on almost passionately  cant you manage somehow to get yourself out of it i hope you havent utterly compromised yourself couldnt dear herbert go down to whatshisname pomeroy and induce the fathera grocer if i remember rightinduce him somehow or other to compromise the matter  compromise cried ernest uncertain whether to laugh or be angry  yes compromise it lady le breton answered endeavouring  to calm herself of course that machiavellian girl has tried to drag you into it and the family have aided and abetted her and youve been weak and foolishthough not i trust wickedand allowed them to get their net closed almost imperceptibly around you but it isnt too late to withdraw even now my poor dear deluded ernest it isnt too late to withdraw even now think of the disgrace and shame to the family think of your dear brothers and their blighted prospects dont allow this designing girl to draw you helplessly into such an illassorted marriage  reflect upon your own future happiness consider what it will be to drag on years of your life with a woman no longer perhaps externally attractive whom you could never possibly respect or love for her own internal qualities dont go and wreck your own life and your brothers lives for any mistaken and quixotic notions of false honour you maynt like to throw her over after youve once been inveigled into saying yes and the feeling though foolish does your heart credit but reflect my dear boy such a promise so obtained can hardly be considered binding upon your  conscience ive no doubt dear herbert whos a capital man of business would get them readily enough to agree to a compromise or a compensation  my dear mothersaid ernest white with indignation but speaking very quietly as soon as he could edge in a word you quite misunderstand the whole question edie oswald is a lady by nature with all a ladys best feelingsi hate the word because of its false implications but i cant use any other that will convey to you my meaningand i love and admire and respect and worship her with all my heart and with all my soul she hasnt inveigled me or set her cap at me as you call it in any way shes the sweetest timidest most shrinking little thing that ever existed on the contrary it is i who have humbly asked her to accept me because i know no other woman to whom i could give my whole heart so unreservedly to tell you the truth mother with my ideas and opinions i could hardly be happy with any girl of the class that you would call distinctively ladies their class prejudices and their social predilections would jar and grate upon me at every turn but edie oswalds a girl whom i could worship and love without any reservewhom i can reverence for her beautiful character her goodness and her delicacy of feeling she has honoured me by accepting me and im going to marry her at the end of this month and i want if possible to get your consent to the marriage before i do so shes a wife of whom i shall be proud in every way i wish i could think she would have equal cause to be proud of her husband  lady le breton threw herself once more into a paroxysm of tears oh ernest she cried do spare me do spare me this is too wicked too unfeeling too cruel of you  altogether i knew already you were very selfish and heartless and headstrong but i didnt know you were quite so unmanageable and so unkind as this i appeal to your better naturefor you have a better natureim sure you have a better nature youre my son and you cant be utterly devoid of good impulses i appeal confidently to your better nature to throw off this unhappy designing  wicked girl before it is too late she has made you forget your duty to your mother but not i hope  irrevocably oh my poor dear wandering boy wont you listen to the voice of reason wont you return once more like the prodigal son to your neglected mother and your forgotten duty  my dear mother ernest said hardly knowing how to answer you will persist in completely misunderstanding me i love edie oswald with all my heart i have promised to marry her because she has done me the great and  undeserved honour of accepting me as her future husband and even if i wanted to break off the engagement which it would break my own heart to do i certainly couldnt break it off now without the most disgraceful and dishonourable wickedness that is quite fixed and certain and i cant go back upon it in any way  then you insist you unnatural boy said lady le breton wiping her eyes and assuming the air of an injured parent you insist against my express wish in marrying this girl osborne or whatever you call her  yes i do mother ernest answered quietly  in that case said lady le breton coldly i must beg of you that you wont bring this lady whether as your wife or otherwise under my roof i havent been accustomed to associate with the daughters of tradesmen and i dont wish to associate with them now in any way  if so ernest said very softly i cant remain under your roof myself any longer i can go nowhere at all where my future wife will not be received on exactly the same terms that i am  then you had bettor go said lady le breton in her chilliest manner ronald do me the favour to ring ihe bell for a cab for your brother ernest  i shall walk thank you mother said ernest quietly  good morning dear ronald  ronald rose solemnly and opened the door for him  therefore shall a man leave his father and mother he said in his clear soft voice and shall cleave unto his wife and they twain shall be one flesh amen  lady le breton darted a withering glance at her younger son as ernest shut the door after him and burst once more into a sudden flood of uncontrollable tears    chapter xvii  come ye out and be ye separate   arthur berkeleys london lodgings were wonderfully snug and comfortable for the second floor of a secondrate house in a small retired side street near the embankment at chelsea he had made the most of the four modest little rooms with his quick taste and his deft cunning fingersfour rooms or rather boxes one might almost call them a bedroom each for himself and the progenitor a wee sittingroom for meals and musicthe two berkeleys would doubtless as soon have gone without the one as the other and a tiny study where arthur might work undisturbed at his own desk upon his new and original magnum opus destined  to form the great attraction of the coming season at the latelyopened ambiguities theatre things had prospered well with the former oxford curate during the last twelvemonth his cantata at leeds had proved a wonderful success and had finally induced him to remove to london and take to composing as a regular profession he had his qualms about it to be sure as one who had put his hand to the plough and then turned back he did not feel quite certain in his own mind how far he was justified in giving up the more spiritual for the more worldly calling but natures like arthur berkeleys move rather upon passing feeling than upon deeper sentiment and had he not ample ground he asked himself for this reconsideration of the monetary position he had the progenitors happiness to insure before thinking of the possible injury to his nonexistent parishioners if he was doing whippingham parva or nortoncumsutton out of an eloquent and valuable potential rector if he was depriving the church in the next halfcentury of a dignified and portly prospective archdeacon he is at least making his fathers last days brighter and more comfortable than his early ones had ever been and then was not music too in its own way a service a liturgy a worship surely he could do higher good to mens soulsas they call themto whatever little spark of nobler and better fire there might lurk within those dull clods of common clay he saw all around himby writing such a work as his leeds cantata than by stringing together for ever those pretty centos of seventeenthcentury conceits and nineteenthcentury doubts or hesitations which he was accustomed to call his sermons whatever came of it he must give up the miserable pittance of a curacy and embrace the career open to the musical talents  so he fitted up his little chelsea rooms in his own economically sumptuous fashion with some bits of wall paper a few jugs and vases and an etching or two after meissonier planted the progenitor down comfortably in a large easychair with a melodious fiddle before him and set to work himself to do what he could towards elevating the british stage and pocketing a reasonable profit on his own account from that familiar and everrejuvenescent process he was quite in earnest now about producing a totally new effect of his own and believing in his work as a good workman ought to do he wrought at it indefatigably and well in the retirement of a secondpair back overlooking a yardful of fluttering clothes and a fine skyline vista of bare yellowish brick chimneys  what part are you working at today artie said the old shoemaker looking over his sons shoulder at the blank music paper before him quartette of biological professors eh  yes father berkeley answered with a smile how do you think it runs now and he hummed over a few lines of his own words set with a quaint lilt to his own  inimitable and irresistible music       and though in unanimous chorus     we mourn that from ages before us     no single enaliosaurus         today should survive      yet joyfully may we bethink us     with the earliest mammal to link us     we still have the ornithorhyncus         extant and alive   how do you think the score does for that father eh  catching air rather isnt it  not a better air in the whole piece artie but my boy who do you think will ever understand the meaning of the words the gods themselves wont know what youre driving at  but im going to strike out a new line daddie dear  im not going to play to the gallery i mean to play to the stalls and boxes  was there ever such a born aristocrat as this young parson is cried the old man lifting up both his hands with a playful gesture of mockdeprecation hes hopeless  hes terrible hes incorrigible why you unworthy son of a respectable paddington shoemaker if even the intelligent  british artizans in the gallery dont understand you how the dickens do you suppose the oiled and curled assyrian bulls in the stalls and boxes will have a glimmering idea of what youre driving at the suppositions an insult to the popular intelligencein other words to me sir your progenitor  berkeley laughed i dont know about that father he said holding up the page of manuscript music at arms length admiringly before him but i do know one thing this comic opera of mine is going to be a triumphant success  so ive thought ever since you began it artie you see my boy theres a great many points in its favour in the first place you can write your own libretto or whatever you call it and you know ive always held that though that wagner man was wrong in practicea most inflated thunderbomb his lohengrinyet he was right in theory right in theory artie every composer ought to be his own poet  well then again youve got a certain peculiar vein of humour of your own a kind of delicate semiserious burlesque  turn about you thats quite original both in writing and in composing youre a humourist in verse and a humourist in music thats the long and the short of it  now youve hit upon a fresh lode of dramatic ore in this opera of yours and if my judgment goes for anything itll bring the house down the first evening im a bit of a critic artie by hook or by crook you know paper or money ive heard every good opera comic or serious thats been given in london these last thirty years and i flatter myself i know something by this time about operatic criticism  youre wrong about wagner father said arthur still glancing with paternal partiality at his sheet of manuscript lohengrins a very fine work a grand work i assure you  i wont let you run it down but barring that i think youre pretty nearly right in your main judgment im not modest and it strikes me somehow that ive invented a genre  thats about what it comes to  if youd confine yourself to your native tongue mr  parson your ignorant old father might have some chance of agreeing or disagreeing with you but as he doesnt even know what the thingumbob you say youve invented may happen to be he cant profitably continue the discussion of that subject however my only fear is that you may perhaps  be writing above the heads of the audience not in the music artie they cant fail to catch that it rings in ones head like the song of a hedge warblertirree tirree lululu lala tirree tuwhit tuwhoo tralalabut in the words and the action im half afraid thatll be over their heads even in the gallery what do you think youll finally call it  im hesitating daddy between evolution and the primate of fiji which do you recommendtell me  the primate by all means said the old man gaily  and you still mean to open with the debate in the fijian parliament on the deceased grandmothers second cousin bill  no i dont daddy ive written a new first scene this week in which the president of the board of trade remonstrates  with the mermaids on their remissness in sending their little ones to the fijian board schools in order to receive primary instruction in the art of swimming ive got a capital chorus of mermaids to balance the other chorus of biological professors on the challenger expedition i consider its a happy cross between ariosto and aristophanes if you like ill give you the score and read over the words to you do said the old man settling himself down in comfort in his sons easychair and assuming the sternest air of an impartial critic arthur berkeley read on dramatically  in his own clever airy fashion suiting accent and gesture to the subject matter through the whole first three acts of that exquisitely humorous opera the primate of fiji sometimes he hummed the tune over to himself as he went sometimes he played a few notes upon his flute by way of striking the keynote sometimes he rose from his seat in his animation and half acted the part he was reading with almost unconscious and spontaneous mimicry he read through the famous song of the president of the local government board that everybody has since heard played by every german band at the street corners through the marvellously catching chorus of the superannuated tidewaiters through the culminating dialogue between the london missionary societys agent and the hereditary grand sacrificer to the king of fiji of course the recital lacked everything of the scenery and dresses that give it so much vogue upon the stage but it had at least the charmingly  suggestive music the wonderful linking of sound to sense the droll and inimitable intermixture of the plausible and the impossible which everybody has admired and laughed at in the acted piece  the old shoemaker listened in breathless silence keeping his eye fixed steadily all the time upon the clean copy of the score only once he made a wry face to himself and that was in the chorus to the debate in the fijian parliament on the proposal to leave off the practice of obligatory cannibalism  the conservative party were of opinion that if you began by burying instead of eating your deceased wife you might end by the atrocious practice of marrying your deceased wifes sister and they opposed the revolutionary measure in that well known refrain       of change like this were naturally chary     nolumus leges fijiae mutari   that passage evidently gave the progenitor deep pain  stick to your own language my boy he murmured stick to your own language the latin may be very fine but the gallery wil never understand it however when arthur finished at last he drew a long breath and laid down the roll of manuscript with an involuntary little cry of halfstifled applause  artie he said rising from the chair slowly artie thats not so bad for a parson i can tell you i hope the archbishop wont be tempted to cite you for displaying an amount of originality unworthy of your cloth  father said arthur suddenly after a short pause with a tinge of pensiveness in his tone that was not usual with him in speaking at least father i often think i ought never to have become a parson at all  well my boy said the old man looking up at him sharply with his keen eyes i knew that long ago youve never really believed in the thing and you oughtnt to have gone in for it from the very beginning it was the music and the dresses and the decorations that enticed you artie and not the doctrine  arthur turned towards him with a pained expression  father he said half reproachfully father dear father dout talk to me like that dont think im so shallow or so dishonest as to subscribe to opinions i dont believe in  its a curious thing to say a curious thing in this unbelieving age and im half ashamed to say it even to you but do you know father i really do believe it in my very heart of hearts i fancy i believe every word of it  the old man listened to him compassionately and tenderly as a woman listens to the fears and troubles of a little child  to him that plain confession of faith was in truth a wonder and a stumblingblock good simplehearted easygoing logicalminded sceptical shoemaker that he was with his head all stuffed full of malthus and john stuart mill and political economy and the hard facts of life and science how could he hope to understand the complex labyrinth of metaphysical thinking and childlike faith and aesthetic attraction and historical authority which made a sensitive man like arthur berkeley in his wayward halfserious emotional fashion turn back lovingly and regretfully to the fair old creed that his father had so long deserted how strange that artie a fullgrown male person with all the learning of the schools behind him should relapse at last into these childish and exploded mediaeval superstitions  how incredible that after having been brought up from his babyhood upward on the strong meat of the agnostic philosophers he should fall back in his manhood on the milk for babes administered to him by orthodox theology  the simpleminded old sceptic could hardly credit it now that arthur told him so with his own lips though he had more than once suspected it when he heard him playing sacred music with that last touch of earnestness in his execution which only the sincerest conviction and most intimate realisation of its import can ever give ah well ah well good sceptical old shoemaker there are perhaps more things in heaven and earth and in the deep soul of man than are dreamt of in your philosophy  still though the avowal shocked and disappointed him a little the old man could not find it in his heart to say one word of sorrow or disapproval far less of ridicule or banter to his dearly loved boy he felt instinctively what herbert le breton could not feel that this sentimental tendency of his sons as he thought it lay far too deep and seemed far too sacred for mere argument or common discussion  perhaps he said to himself softly arties emotional side has got the better of his intellectual i brought him up without telling him any thing of these things except negatively and by way of warning against superstitious tendencies and when he went to oxford and saw the doctrines tricked out in all the authority of a great hierarchy with its cathedrals and chapels and choirs and altars and robes and fallal finery it got the better of him got the better of him very naturally arties a cleverer fellow than his old fatherhad more education and so on and im fond of him very fond of him but his logical faculty isnt quite straight somehow he lets his feelings have too much weight and prominence against his calmer reason i can easily understand how with his tastes and leanings the clericals should have managed to get a hold over him the clericals are such insinuating cunning fellows a very impressionable boy artie was always the poetical temperament and the artistic temperament always is impressionable i suppose but shoemaking certainly does develop the logical faculties seems as though the logical faculties were situated in the forepart of the brain as they mark them out on the phrenological heads and the leaning forward that gives us the shoemakers forehead must tend to enlarge themgive them plenty of room to expand and develop saying which thing to himself musingly the father took his sons hand gently in his and only smoothed it quietly as he looked deep into arthurs eyes without uttering a single word  as for arthur berkeley he sat silent too half averting his face from his fathers gaze and feeling a little blush of shame upon his cheek at having been surprised unexpectedly into such an unwonted avowal how could he ever expect his father to understand the nature of his feelings to him good old man that he was all these things were just matters of priestcraft and obscurantismfables invented by the ecclesiastical mind as a means of getting fat livings and comfortable deaneries out of the public pocket and indeed arthur was well accustomed at oxford to keeping his own opinions to himself on such subjects what chance of sympathy or response was there for such a man as he in that coldly critical and calmly deliberative learned society not of course that all oxford was wholly given over even then to extreme agnosticism there were high churchmen and low churchmen and broad churchmen enough to be sure men learned in the fathers and the canons and the acts of the general councils men ready to argue on the intermediate  state or on the three witnesses or on the heretical nature of the old catholic schism men prepared with minute dogmatic opinions upon every conceivable or inconceivable point of abstract theology there were people who could trace the apostolic succession of the old cornish bishops and people who could pronounce authoritatively upon the exact distinction between justification and remission of sins but for all these things arthur berkeley cared nothing where then among those learned exegetical theologians was there room for one whose belief was a matter not of reason and argument but of feeling and of sympathy he did not want to learn what the council of trent had said about such and such a dogma he wanted to be conscious of an inner truth to find the world permeated by an informing righteousness to know himself at one with the inner essence of the entire universe and though he could never feel sure whether it was all illusion or not he had hungered and thirsted after believing it till as he told his father timidly that day he actually did believe it somehow in his heart of hearts let us not seek to probe too deeply into those inner recesses whose abysmal secrets are never perfectly clear even to the introspective eyes of the conscious selfdissector himself  after a pause arthur spoke again he spoke this time in a very low voice as one afraid to open his soul too much even to his father dear dear father he said releasing his hand softly you dont quite understand what i mean about it it isnt because i dont believe or try to believe or hope i believe that i think i ought never to have become a parson in my way as in a glass darkly i do strive my best to believe though perhaps my belief is hardly more in its way than ernest le bretons unbelieving i do want to think that this great universe we see around us isnt all a mistake and an abortion i want to find a mind and an order and a purpose in it and perhaps because i want it i make myself believe that i have really found it in that hope and belief with the ultimate object of helping on whatever is best and truest in the world i took orders  but i feel now that it was an error for me im not the right man to make a parson there are men who are born for that rôle men who know how to conduct themselves in it decently and in seemly fashion men who can quietly endure all its restraints and can fairly rise to the height of all its duties but i cant i was intended for something lighter and less onerous than that if i stop in the church i shall do no good to myself or to it if i come out of it i shall make both parties freer and shall be able to do more good in my own generation and so father for the very same reasons that made me go into it i mean to come out again not in any quarrel with it nor as turning my back upon it but just as the simple acknowledgment of a  mistaken calling it wouldnt be seemly for example for a parson to write comic operas but i feel i can do more good by writing comic operas than by talking dogmatically about things i hardly understand to people who hardly understand me so before i get this opera acted i mean to leave off my white tie and be known in future henceforth and for ever as plain arthur berkeley  the old shoemaker listened in respectful silence it isnt for me artie he said as his son finished to stand between a man and his conscience as john stuart mill says in his essay on liberty we must allow full play to every mans individuality wonderful man john stuart mill i understand his grandfather was a shoemaker well i wont talk with you about the matter of conviction but i never wanted you to be a parson and i shall feel all the happier myself when youve ceased to be one  and i said arthur shall feel all the freer but if i had been able to remain where i was i should have felt all the worthier for all that    chapter xviii  a quiet wedding   fate was adverse for the moment to arthur berkeleys well meant designs for shuffling off the trammels of his ecclesiastical  habit he was destined to appear in public at least once more not only in the black coat and white tie of his everyday professional costume but even in the flowing snowy surplice of a solemn and decorous spiritual function  the very next mornings post brought him a little note from ernest le breton specially begging him in his own name and edies to come down to calcombe pomeroy and officiate as parson at their approaching wedding the note had cost ernest a conscientious struggle for he would have personally preferred to be married at a registry office as being more in accordance with the duties of a good citizen and savouring less of effete ecclesiastical  superstition but he felt he couldnt even propose such a step to edie she wouldnt have considered herself married at all unless she were married quite regularly by a duly qualified clerk in holy orders of the church of england as by law established already indeed ernest was beginning to recognise with a sigh that if he was going to live in the world at all he must do so by making at least a partial sacrifice of political consistency you may step out of your own century if you choose yourself but you cant get all the men and women with whom you come in contact to step out of it also in unison just to please you  so ernest had sat down reluctantly to his desk and  consented to ask arthur berkeley to assist at the important ceremony in his professional clerical capacity if he was going to have a medicine man or a priest at all to marry him to the girl of his choicea barbaric survival at the best he thought ithe would at any rate prefer having his friend arthura good man and trueto having the fat easygoing purseproud rector of the parish the younger son of a wealthy family who had gone into the church for the sake of the living and who rolled sumptuously down the long hilly high street every day in his comfortable carriage leaning back with his fat hands folded complacently over his ample knees and gazing abstractedly with his little pigseyes half buried in his cheek at the beautiful prospect afforded him by the broad liverycovered backs of his coachman and his footman  ernest could never have consented to lot that lazy overfed useless encumbrance on a longsuffering commonwealth  that idle gorger of dainty meats and choice wines from the tithes of the tolling suffering people bear any part in what was after all the most solemn and serious contract of his whole lifetime and to say the truth edie quite agreed with him on that point too though her moral indignation against poor useless emptyheaded old mr walters didnt burn quite so fierce or so clear as ernestsshe regarded the fat old parson indeed rather from the social point of view as a ludicrously selfsatisfied specimen of the lower stages of humanity than from the political point of view as a greedy swallower of large revenues for small work inefficiently performedshe would still have felt that his presence at her wedding jarred and grated on all the finer sensibilities of her nature as out of accord with the solemn and tender associations of that supreme moment to have been married by prosy old mr walters to have taken the final benediction on the greatest act of her life from those big white fat fingers would have spoilt the reminiscence of the wedding day for her as long as she lived but when ernest suggested arthur berkeleys name to her she acquiesced with all her heart in the happy  selection she liked berkeley better than anybody else she had ever met except ernest and she knew that his presence would rather add one more bright association to the day than detract from it in the coming years her poor little wedding would want all the additions that friends could make to its cheerfulness to get over the lasting gloom and blank of dear harrys absence  you will come and help us i know berkeley ernest wrote to arthur in his serious fashion we feel there is nobody else we should so like to have present at our wedding as yourself come soon too for there are lots of things i want to talk over with you its a very solemn responsibility  getting married you have to take upon yourself the duty of raising up future citizens for the state and with our present knowledge of how nature works through the laws of heredity you have to think whether you two who contemplate marriage are well fitted to act as parents to the generations that are to be when i remember that all my own faults and failings may be handed on relentlessly to those that come after usbuilt up in the very fibre of their beingi am half appalled at my own temerity then again there is the inexorable question of money is it prudent or is it wrong of us to marry on such an  uncertainty im afraid that schurz and malthas would tell us very wrong i have turned over these things by myself till im tired of arguing them out in my own head and i want you to come down beforehand so as to cheer me up a bit with your lighter and brighter philosophy on the very eve of my marriage im somehow getting dreadfully pessimistic  arthur read the letter through impatiently and crumpled it up in his hands with a gesture of despondency poor little miss butterfly he said to himself pityingly was there ever such an abstraction of an ethical unit as this good solemn selftorturing ernest how will she ever live with him how will he ever live with her poor little soul harry is gone like the sunshine out of her life and now this wellmeaning gloomy conscientious cloud comes caressingly to overspread her with the shadowing pall of its endless serious doubts and hesitations  fancy a man who has won little miss butterflys heartdear little miss butterflys gay laughing tender little heartwriting such a letter as that to the friend whos going to marry them upon my word ive half a mind to go into the concientious scruples business on my own account have i any right to be a party to fettering poor airy fairy little miss butterfly with a heavy iron chain for life and always to this great lumbering elephantine moral ernest am i justified in tying the cable round her dainty little neck with a silken thread and then fastening it round his big leg with rivets of hardened steel on the patent bessemer process if a couple of persons duly called by banns in their own respective parishes or furnished with the right reverends  perquisite a licence come to me a clerk in holy orders and ask me to marry them ive a vague idea that unless i comply i lay myself open to the penalties of praemunire or something else equally awful and mysterious but if the couple write and ask me to come down into devonshire and marry them thats quite another matter i can lawfully answer non possumus theres a fine ecclesiastical ring by the way about answering non possumus it sums up the entire position of the church in a nutshell well i doubt whether i ought to go but as a matter of friendship ill throw overboard my poor conscience its used to the process  by this time no doubt like eels to skinning and as hudibras says       however tender it may be     tis passing blind where twill not see   if shed only have taken me now who knows but i might in time have risen to be a prebendary or even a dean  they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree paul wrote to timothy once but its not so now its not so now preferment goes by favour and the deacon must een shift as best he can on his own account so in the end arthur packed up his surplice  in his little handbag and took his way peacefully down to calcombe pomeroy  it was a very quiet almost a sombre wedding for the poor oswalds were still enveloped in the lasting gloom of their great loss and not much outward show or preparation such as the female heart naturally delights in could possibly be made under these painful circumstances still all the world of calcombe came to see little miss oswald married to the grave gentleman from oxford and most of them gave her their hearty good wishes for edie was a general favourite with gentle and simple throughout the whole borough herbert was there like a decorous gentleman to represent the bridegrooms family and so was ronald who had slipped away from london without telling lady le breton for fear of another distressful scone at the last moment arthur berkeley read the service in his beautiful impressive manner and looked his part well in his flowing white surplice but as he uttered the solemn words whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder the musical ring of his own voice sounded to his heart like the knell of his own one lovethe funeral service over the only romance he could ever mix in throughout his whole lifetime poor fellow he had taken the duty upon him with all friendly heartiness but he felt an awful and lonely feeling steal over him when it was all finished and when he knew that his little miss butterfly was now ernest le bretons lawful wife for ever and ever  in the vestry after signing the books herbert and ronald and some of the others insisted on their ancient right of kissing the bride in good old english fashion but arthur did not it would not have been loyal he felt in his heart that he had loved little miss butterfly too deeply himself for that to claim a kiss would be abusing the formal dues of his momentary position henceforth he would not even think of her to himself in that little pet name of his brief oxford dream he would call her nothing in his own mind but mrs le breton  edies simple little presents were all arranged in the tiny parlour behind the shop most of them were from her own personal friends a few were from the gentry of the surrounding neighbourhood but there were two handsomer than the rest they came from outside the narrow little circle of calcombe pomeroy society one was a plain gold bracelet from arthur berkeley and on the gold of the inner face though neither edie nor ernest noticed it he had lightly cut with his knife on the soft metal the one word frustra the other was a dressingcase with a little card inside miss oswald from lady hilda tregellis hilda had heard of ernests approaching wedding from herbert who took an early opportunity of casually lunching at dunbude  in order to show that he mustnt be identified with his socialistic brother and the news had strangely proved a slight salve to poor hildas wounded vanityor perhaps it would be fairer to say to her slighted higher instincts a country grocers daughter she said to herself the sister of a great mathematical scholar how very original of him to think of marrying a grocers daughter why of course he must have been engaged to her all along before he came here  and even if he hadnt been one might have known at once that such a man as he is would never go and marry a girl whose names in the peerage when he could strike out a line for himself by marrying a grocers daughter i really like him better than ever for it i must positively send her a little present theyll be as poor as church mice ive no doubt i ought to send her something thatll be practically useful and by way of sending something practically useful lady hilda chose at last a handsome silvertopped russia leather dressingcase  it was not such a wedding as edie had pictured to herself  in her first sweet maidenly fancies but still when they drove away alone in the landau from the sidedoor of the red lion to calcombe road station she felt a quiet pride and security in her heart from the fact that she was now the wedded wife of a man she loved so dearly as ernest le breton and even ernest so far conquered his social scruples that he took firstclass tickets for the first time in his life to ilfracombe where they were to spend their brief and hasty fragment of a poor little honeymoon its so  extremely hard to be a consistent socialist where women are concerned especially on the very day of your own wedding    chapter xix  into the fire   let me see le breton dr greatrex observed to the new master youve taken rooms for yourself in west street for the presentyoull take a house on the parade byandby no doubt now which church do you mean to go to  well really ernest answered taken a little aback at the suddenness of the question i havent had time to think about it yet  the doctor frowned slightly not had time to think about it he repeated rather severely not had time to think about such a serious question as your particular place of worship you quite surprise me well if youll allow me to make a suggestion in the matter it would be that you and mrs le breton should take seats for the present at least at st marthas the parish church is high decidedly high and i wouldnt recommend you to go there most of our parents dont approve of it youre an oxford man i know and so i suppose youre rather high yourself but in this particular matter i would strongly advise you to  subordinate your own personal feelings to the parents wishes  then theres st judes st judes is distinctly lowquite evangelical in fact indeed i may say scarcely what i should consider sound church principles at all in any way and i think you ought most certainly to avoid it sedulously  evangelicism is on the decline at present in pilbury regis  as to st barnabasbarabbas they call it generally a most irreverent joke but of course inevitablebarabbas is  absolutely ritualistic many of our parents object to it most strongly but st marthas is a quiet moderate inoffensive church in every respectsound and sensible and free from all extremes you can give no umbrage to anybody even the most cantankerous by going to st marthas the high church people fraternise with it on the one hand and the moderate church people fraternise with it on the other while as to the evangelicals and the dissenters they hardly contribute any boys to the school or if they do they dont object to unobtrusive church principles indeed my  experience has been le breton that even the most rabid dissenters prefer to have their sons educated by a sound moderate highprincipled and if i may say so neutraltinted church clergyman and the doctor complacently pulled his white tie straight before the big giltframed  drawingroom mirror  then again the doctor went on placidly in a bland tone of mild persuasion theres the question of politics  politics are a very ticklish matter i can assure you in  pilbury regis have you any fixed political opinions of your own le breton or are you waiting to form them till youve had some little experience in your profession  my opinions ernest answered timidly so far as they can be classed under any of the existing political formulas at all are decidedly liberali may even say radical  the doctor bit his lip and frowned severely radical he said slowly with a certain delicate tinge of acerbity in his tone thats bad if you will allow me to interpose in the matter i should strongly advise you for your own sake to change them at once and entirely i dont object to moderate liberalismperhaps as many as onethird of our parents are moderate liberals but decidedly the most desirable form of political belief for a successful schoolmaster  is a quiet and gentlemanly but unswerving conservatism  i dont say you ought to be an uncompromising oldfashioned toryfar from it that alienates not only the dissenters but even the respectable middleclass liberals  what is above all things expected in a schoolmaster is a central position in politics so to speaka careful avoidance of all extremesa readiness to welcome all reasonable progress  while opposing in a conciliatory spirit all revolutionary or excessive changesin short an attitude of studied  moderation that if you will allow me to advise you le breton is the sort of thing you may depend upon it that most usually meets the wishes of the largest possible number of pupils parents  im afraid ernest answered as respectfully as possible my political convictions are too deeply seated to be  subordinated to my professional interests  eh what the doctor cried sharply subordinate your principles to your personal interests oh pray dont mistake me so utterly as that not at all not at all my dear le breton i dont mean that for the shadow of a second what i mean is rather this and here the doctor cleared his throat and pulled round his white tie a second time that a schoolmaster considering attentively what is best for his pupils mark youwe all exist for our pupils you know my dear fellow dont wea schoolmaster should avoid such action as may give any unnecessary scandal you see or seem to clash with the ordinary opinion of the pupils parents of course if your views are fully formed and are of a mildly liberal complexion put it so i beg of you and dont use that distressful word radical i wouldnt for the world have you act contrary to them but i wouldnt have you obtrude them too ostentatiouslyfor your own sake le breton for your own sake i assure you remember youre a very young man yet you have plenty of time before you to modify your opinions in as you go on youll modify themmoderate thembring them into harmony with the average opinions of ordinary parents dont commit yourself  at presentthats all i would say to youdont commit yourself at present when youre as old as i am my dear fellow youll see through all these youthful extravagances  and as to the church mr le breton said mrs  greatrex with bland suggestiveness from the ottoman of course we regard the present very unsatisfactory arrangement  as only temporary the doctor hopes in time to get a chapel built which is much nicer for the boys and also more convenient for the masters and their familiesthey all have seats of course in the chancel at charlton college where the doctor was an assistant for some years before we came to pilbury there was one of the undermasters a young man of very good family who took such an interest in the place that he not only contributed a hundred pounds out of his own pocket towards building a chapel but also got ever so many of his wealthy friends elsewhere to subscribe first to that and then to the organ and stainedglass window  weve got up a small building fund here ourselves already of which the doctors treasurer and we hope before many years to have a really nice chapel with good music and service well donethe kind of thing thatll be of use to the school and have an excellent moral effect upon the boys in the way of religious training  no doubt ernest answered evasively youll soon manage to raise the money in such a place as pilbury  no doubt the doctor replied looking at him with a searching glance and evidently harbouring an uncomfortable suspicion already that this young man had not got the moral and religious welfare of the boys quite so deeply at heart as was desirable in a model junior assistant master  well well we shall see you at school tomorrow morning le breton till then i hope youll find yourselves quite comfortable in your new lodgings  ernest went back from this visit of ceremony with a doubtful heart and left dr and mrs greatrex alone to discuss their new acquisition  well maria said the doctor in a dubious tone of voice as soon as ernest was fairly out of hearing what do you think of him  think answered mrs greatrex energetically why i dont think at all i feel sure hell never never never make a schoolmaster  im afraid not the doctor responded pensively im afraid not maria hes got ideas of his own i regret to say and whats worse theyre not the right ones  oh hell never do mrs greatrex continued scornfully  nothing at all professional about him in any way  no interest or enthusiasm in the matter of the chapel not a spark of responsiveness even about the stainedglass window hardly a trace of moral or religious earnestness of care for the welfare and happiness of the dear boys he wouldnt in the least impress intending parentsor rather i feel sure hed impress them most unfavourably the best thing we can do now weve got him is to play off his name on relations in society but to keep the young man himself as far as possible in the background i confess hes a disappointmenta very great and distressing disappointment  he is he is certainly the doctor acquiesced with a sigh of regretfulness im afraid we shall never be able to make much of him but we must do our bestfor his own sake and the sake of the boys and parents its our duty maria to do our best with him  oh of course mrs greatrex replied languidly but im bound to say im sure itll prove a very thankless piece of duty young men of his sort have never any proper sense of gratitude  meanwhile edie in the little lodgings in a side street near the schoolhouse had run out quickly to open the door for ernest and waited anxiously to hear his report upon their new employers  well ernest dear she asked with something of the old childish brightness in her eager manner and what do you think of them  why edie ernest answered kissing her white forehead  gently i dont want to judge them too hastily but im inclined to fancy on first sight that both the doctor and his wife are most egregious and unmitigated humbugs  humbugs ernest why how do you mean  well edie theyve got the moral and religious welfare of the boys at their very finger ends and do you knowi dont want to be uncharitablebut i somehow imagine they havent got it at heart as well however we must do our best and try to fall in with them  and for a whole year ernest and edie did try to fall in with them to the best of their ability it was hard work for though the doctor himself was really at bottom a kindhearted man with a mere thick veneer of professional  humbug inseparable from his unhappy calling mrs greatrex was a veritable thorn in the flesh to poor little natural honesthearted edie when she found that the le bretons didnt mean to take a house on the parade or elsewhere but were to live ingloriously in wee side street lodgings her disappointment was severe and extreme but when she incidentally discovered that mrs le breton was positively a grocers daughter from a small country town her moral indignation against the baseness of mankind rose almost to white heat  to think that young le breton should have insinuated himself  into the position of third master under false pretencesshould have held out as qualifications for the post his respectable connections when he knew perfectly well all the time that he was going to marry somebody who was not in societyit was really quite too awfully wicked and deceptive and unprincipled of him a very bad dishonest young man she was very much afraid a young man with no sense of truth or honour about him though of course she wouldnt say so for the world before any of the parents or do anything to injure the poor young fellows future prospects if she could possibly help it but mrs greatrex felt sure that ernest had come to pilbury of malice prepense as part of a deeplaid scheme to injure and ruin the doctor by his horrid revolutionary notions he does it on purpose she used to say he talks in that way because he knows it positively shocks and annoys us he pretends to be very innocent all the time but at heart hes a malignant jealous uncharitable creature im sure i wish he had never come to pilbury regis and to go quarrelling with his own mother toothe unnatural man the only respectable relation he had and the only one at all likely to produce any good or salutary effect upon intending parents  my dear the doctor would answer apologetically youre really quite too hard upon young le breton as far as schoolwork goes hes a capital master i assure youso conscientious and hardworking and systematic he does his very best with the boys even with that stupid lout blenkinsopp major and he has managed to din something into them in mathematics somehow so that im sure the fifth form will pass a better examination this term than any term since we first came here now that you know is really a great thing even if he doesnt quite fall in with our preconceived social requirements  im sure i dont know about the mathematics or the fifth form joseph mrs geatrex used to reply with great dignity  that sort of thing falls under your department im aware not under mine but im sure that for all social purposes mr  le breton is really a great deal worse than useless a more unchristian disagreeable selfopinionated wrongheaded objectionable young man i never came across in the whole course of my experience however you wouldnt listen to my advice upon the subject so its no use talking any longer about it i always advised you not to take him without further enquiry into his antecedents and you overbore me you said he was so wellconnected and so forth and would hear nothing against him so i wish you joy now of your precious bargain the only thing left for us is to find some good opportunity of getting rid of him  i like the young man as far as he goes dr greatrex replied once with unwonted spirit and i wont get rid of him at all my dear unless he obliges me to hes really well meaning in spite of all his absurdities and upon my word maria i believe hes thoroughly honest in his opinions  mrs greatrex only met this flat rebellion by an indirect remark to the effect that some people seemed absolutely  destitute of the very faintest glimmering power of judging human character    chapter xx  literature music and the drama   the primate of fiji was duly accepted and put into rehearsal by the astute and enterprising manager of the ambiguities theatre its a risk he said candidly when he read the manuscript over a decided risk mr berkeley i acknowledge the riskiness but i dont mind trying it for all that you see youve staked everything upon the doubtful  supposition that the public possesses a certain amount of elementary intelligence and a certain appreciation of genuine original wit and humour your plays literature good literature  and thats rather a speculative element to introduce into the regular theatre nowadays illegitimate i should call it decidedly illegitimatebut still perhaps worth  trying do you know the story about old simon burbury the horsedealer young simon says to him one morning father dont you think we might manage to conduct this business of ours without always telling quite so many downright lies about it the old man looks back at him reproachfully and says with a solemn shake of the head ah simon simon little did i ever think i should live to see a son of mine go in for speculation well my dear sir thats pretty much how a modern manager feels about the literary element in the drama the public isnt accustomed  to it and theres no knowing how they may take it  shakespeare now they stand readily enough because hes an oldestablished and perfectly respectable family purveyor sheridan too of course and one play of goldsmiths and a trifle or so of george colmanall recognised and all tolerated because of their old prescriptive respectability  but for a new author to aim at being literarys rather  presumptuous now tell me yourself isnt it seems as if he was setting himself up for a heavensent genius and trying to sit upon the older dramatists of the present generation  melodrama sensation burlesquethats all right enoughperfectly legitimate but a real literary comic opera with good words and good musicit is a little strong for a beginner mr berkeley you will acknowledge  but dont you think arthur answered smiling goodhumouredly at his cynical frankness an educated and  cultured public is beginning to grow up that may perhaps really prefer a little literature provided its made light enough and attractive enough for their rapid digestion  dont you think intelligent people are beginning to get just a trifle sick of burlesque and spectacle and sensation and melodrama  why my dear sir the manager answered promptly thats the exact chance on which im calculating when i venture to accept your comic opera from an unknown beginner its clever theres no denying that and i hope the fact wont be allowed to tell against it but the musics bright and lively the songs are quaint and catching the dialogues brisk and not too witty and theres plenty of businessplenty of business in it i incline to think we can get together a house at the ambiguities thatll enter into the humour of the thing and see what your plays driving at how did you learn all about stage requirements though  i never saw a beginners play with so little in it that was absolutely impossible  i was a shooting star at oxford berkeley answered simply so that i know somethinglike a despised amateurabout stage necessities and ive written one or two little pieces before for private acting besides watkiss has helped me with all the technical arrangements of the little opera  itll do the manager answered more confidently i wont predict a success because you know a manager should never prophesy unless he knows but i think theres a public in london thatll take it in just as they took in caste and society twenty years back at the prince of waless  anyhow im quite prepared to give it a fair trial  on the first night arthur berkeley and the progenitor went down in fear and trembling to the stage door of the ambiguities there was a full house and the critics were all present in some surprise at the temerity of this new man for it was noised abroad already by those who had seen the rehearsals that the primate of fiji was a fresh departure after its own fashion in the matter of english comic opera  the curtain rose upon the chorus of mermaids and the first song was a decided hit still the public as becomes a first night maintained a dignified and critical reserve when the president of the board of trade in full court costume appeared upon the scene in the midst of the very realistic longhaired sealadies the audience was half shocked for a moment by the utter incongruity of the situation but after a while they began to discover that the incongruity was part of the joke and they laughed quietly a sedate and moderate laugh of suspended judgment as the progenitor had predicted  the gods were the first to enter into the spirit of the fun and to give a hand to the primates first sermon the scuntific professors on the challenger expedition took the fancy of the house a little more decidedly and even the stalls thawed visibly when the professor of biology delivered his famous exposition of the evolution hypothesis to the assembled chiefs of raratouga but it was the one feeble secondhand old joke of the piece that really brought pit and boxes down together in a sudden fit of inextinguishable laughter the professor of political economy enquired  diligently with note book in hand of the princess of fiji whether she thought the influence of the missionaries beneficial or otherwise whether she considered these preachers of a new religion really good or not to which the unsophisticated child of nature responded naively good very goodroasted but not quite so good boiled and the professor gravely entered the answer in his philosophic notebook it was a very ancient jest indeed but it tickled the ribs of the house mightily as ancient jests usually do and they burst forthwith into a hearty roar of genuine approval then arthur began to breathe more freely after that the house toned down again quietly and gave no decided token of approbation till the end of the piece when the curtain dropped there was a lull of hushed expectation for poor arthur berkeley and at its close the house broke out into a storm of applause and the primate of fiji had firmly secured its position as the one great theatrical success of the present generation  there was a loud cry of author author and arthur berkeley hardly knowing how he got there or what he was standing on found himself pushed from behind by friendly hands on to the narrow space between the curtain and the footlights he became aware that a very hot and red body presumably himself was bowing mechanically to a seething and clapping mass of hands and faces over the whole theatre  backing out again in the same semiconscious fashion with the universe generally reeling on more than one distinct axis all around him he was seized and handshaken violently first by the progenitor then by the manager and then by half a dozen other miscellaneous and unknown persons at last after a lot more revolutions of the universe he found himself comfortably pitched into a convenient hansom with the progenitor by his side and hardly knew anything further till he discovered his own quiet supper table at the chelsea lodgings and saw his father mixing a strong glass of brandy and seltzer for him to counteract the strength of the excitement  next morning arthur berkeley awoke and found himself  famous the primate of fiji was the rage of the moment everybody went to hear iteverybody played its tunes at their own pianoseverybody quoted it and adapted it and used its clever catchwords as the pet fashionable slang expressions of the next three seasons arthur berkeley was the lion of the hour and the mantelpiece of the quiet little chelsea study was ranged three rows deep with cards of invitation from people whose very names arthur had never heard of six months before and whom the progenitor declared it was a sin and shame for any  respectable young man of sound economical education even to countenance there were countesses and marchionesses too among the senders of those coronetted parallelograms of waste pasteboard as the progenitor called themnay there was even one invitation on the mantelpiece that bore the three strawberry leaves and other insignia of her grace the duchess of leicestershire  cant you give us just one evening mr berkeley said lady hilda tregellis as she sat on the centre ottoman in mrs campbell moncrieffs drawingroom with arthur berkeley talking lightly to her about the nothings which constitute polite conversation in the nineteenth century  just one evening any day after the next fortnight we should be so delighted if you could manage to favour us  no im afraid i cant lady hilda arthur answered  my evenings are so dreadfully full just now and besides you know im not accustomed to so much society and it unsettles me for my daily work after all you see im a journeyman playwright now and i have to labour at my unholy calling just like the theatrical carpenter  how delightfully frank thought lady hilda really i like him quite immenselynot even the afternoon on wednesday fortnight she went on aloud you might come to our garden party on wednesday fortnight  quite impossible arthur berkeley answered thats my regular day at pilbury regis  pilbury regis cried lady hilda starting a little  you dont mean to say you have engagements and in the thick of the season too at pilbury regis  yes i have every wednesday fortnight berkeley answered with a smile i go there regularly you see lady hilda wednesdays a halfholiday at pilbury grammar school so every second week i run down for the day to visit an old friend of mine whos also an acquaintance of yours i believeernest le breton hes married now you know and has got a mastership at the pilbury grammar school  then you know mr le breton cried lady hilda charmed at this rapprochement of two delightfully original men he is so nice i like him immensely and im so glad youre a friend of his and mrs le breton too wasnt it nice of him tell me mr berkeley was she really and truly a grocers daughter  berkeleys voice grew a little stiffer and colder as he answered she was a sister of oswald of oriel the great mathematician who was killed last year by falling from the summit of a peak in the bernina  oh yes yes i know all about that of course said lady hilda quickly and carelessly i know her brother was very clever and all that sort of thing but then there are so many men who are very clever arent there the really original thing about it all you know was that he actually married a grocers daughter that was really quite too delightfully original i was charmed when i heard about it i thought it was so exactly like dear mr le breton hes so deliciously unconventional in every way he was lynmouths tutor for a while as youve heard of course and then he went away from us at a moments notice so nicely because he wouldnt stand papas abominable behaviour  and quite right too when it was a matter of consciencei dare say hes told you all about it that horrid pigeonshooting business well and so you know mrs le bretondo tell me what sort of person is she  shes very nice and very good and very pretty and very clever arthur answered a little constrainedly i dont know that i can tell you anything more about her than that  then you really like her said lady hilda warmly  you think her a fit wife for mr le breton do you  i think him a very lucky fellow indeed to have married such a charming and beautiful woman arthur answered quietly  lady hilda noticed his manner and read through it at once with a womans quickness aha she said to herself the wind blows that way does it what a very remarkable  girl she must be really to have attracted two such men as mr berkeley and mr le breton ive lost one of them to her i cant very well lose the other too for after ernest le breton ive never seen any man i should care to marry so much as mr arthur berkeley  lady hilda said the hostess coming up to her at that moment youll play us something wont you you know you promised to bring your music  hilda rose at once with stately alacrity nothing could have pleased her better she went to the piano and to the awe and astonishment of mrs campbell moncrieff took out an arrangement of the fijian wardance from the primate of fiji it suited her brilliant slapdash style of execution admirably and she felt she had never played so well in her life before the presence of the composer which would have frightened and unnerved most girls of her age only made hilda tregellis the bolder and the more ambitious  here was somebody at least who knew something about it none of your ordinary fashionable amateurs and mere soulless professional performers but the very man who had made the musicthe man in whose brain the notes had first gathered themselves together into speaking melody and who could really judge the comparative merits of her rapid execution  she played with wonderful verve and spirit so that lady exmoor seated on the side sofa opposite though shocked at first at hildas choice of a piece glanced more than once at the wealthiest young commoner present she had long since mentally resigned herself to the prospect of a commoner for that poor dear foolish hilda and closely watched his face to see what effect this unwonted outburst of musical talent might succeed in producing upon his latent  susceptibilities but lady hilda herself wasnt thinking of the wealthy commoner she was playing straight at arthur berkeley and when she saw that arthur berkeleys mouth had melted slowly into an approving smile she played even more brilliantly and better than ever after her bold smart vehement fashion as she left the piano arthur said thank you i have never heard the piece better rendered and lady hilda felt that that was a triumph which far outweighed any number of inane compliments from a whole regiment of simpering algies monties and berties  you cant say any evening then mr berkeley she said once more as she held out her hand to him to say goodnight a little later not any evening at all or part of an evening you might really reconsider your engagements  arthur hesitated visibly well possibly i might manage it he said wavering though i assure you my evenings are very much more than full already  then dont make it an evening said lady hilda pressingly make it lunch after all mr berkeley its we ourselves who want to see you not to show you off as a curiosity to all the rest of london we have silly people enough in the evenings but if youll come to lunch with us alone one day we shall have an opportunity of talking to you on our own account  lady hilda was tall and beautiful and lady hilda spoke  as she always used to speak with manifest sincerity now it is not in human nature not to feel flattered when a  beautiful woman pays one genuine homage and arthur berkeley was quite as human after all as most other people youre very kind he said smiling i must make it lunch then though i really ought to be working in the mornings instead of running about merely to amuse myself what day will suit you best  oh not to amuse yourself mr berkeley hilda answered pointedly but to gratify us that you know is a work of benevolence say monday next then at two oclock will that do for you  perfectly berkeley answered taking her proffered hand extended to him with just that indefinable air of  frankness which lady hilda knew so well how to throw into all her actions good evening wilton place isnt itgracious heavens he thought to himself as he glanced after her satin train sweeping slowly down the grand staircase  what on earth would the dear old progenitor say if only he saw me in the midst of these meaningless aristocratic orgies i am positively halfwheedled it seems into making love to an earls daughter if this sort of thing continues i shall find myself before i know it connected by marriage with twothirds of the british peerage a beautiful woman really and quite queenlike in her manner when she doesnt choose rather to be unaffectedly gracious how she sat upon that tall young man with the brown moustaches over by the mantelpiece i didnt hear what she said to him but i could see he was utterly crushed by the way he slank away with his tail between his legs like a whipped spaniel  a splendid womanand no doubt about it looks as if shed stepped straight out of the canvas of titian with the pearls in her hair and everything else exactly as he painted them  the handsomest girl i ever saw in my lifebut not like edie le breton they say a man can only fall in love once in a lifetime i wonder whether theres any truth in it well well you wont often see a finer woman in her own style than lady hilda tregellis monday next at two precisely i neednt make a note of itno fear of my forgetting  i really do think lady hilda said to herself as she unrolled the pearls from her thick hair in her own room that winter evening i almost like him better than i did ernest le breton the very first night i saw him at lady marys i fell quite in love with his appearance before i knew even who he was and now that ive found out all about him i never did hear anything so absolutely and delightfully original  his father a common shoemaker that to begin with throws ernest le breton quite into the shade his father was a general in the indian armynothing could be more banal then mr berkeley began life as a clergyman but now hes taken off his white choker and wears a suit of grey tweed like any ordinary english gentleman so delightfully unconventional isnt it at last to crown it all he not only composes delicious music but goes and writes a comic operasuch a comic opera and the best of it is success hasnt turned his head one atom he doesnt run with vulgar eagerness after the great people like your ordinary everyday successful  nobody he took no more notice of me myself at first because i was lady hilda tregellis than if id been a common milkmaid  and he wouldnt come to our garden party because he wanted to go down to pilbury regis to visit the le bretons at their charity school or something it was only after i played the wardance arrangement so welli never played so brilliantly  in my life beforethat he began to alter and soften a little certainly these pearls do thoroughly become me i think he looked after me when i was leaving the room just a tiny bit as if he was really pleased with me for my own sake and not merely because i happen to be called lady hilda tregellis    chapter xxi  off with the old love   its really very annoying this letter from selah herbert le breton murmured to himself as he carefully burnt the compromising document envelope and all with a fusee from his oriental silver pocket matchcase i had hoped the thing had all been forgotten by this time after her long silence and my last two judiciously chilly lettersa sort of slow refrigerating process for poor shivering naked little cupid but here just at the very moment when i fancied the affair had quite blown over comes this most objectionable letter telling me that selah has actually betaken herself to london to meet me and what makes it more annoying still i wanted to go up myself this week to dine at home with ethel faucit mothers plan about ethel faucit is  exceedingly commendable a girl with eight hundred a year cultivated tastes and no father or other encumbrances dragging after her i always said i should like to marry a poor orphan a very desirable young woman to annex in every way and now heres selah briggsugh how could i ever have gone and entangled myself in my foolish days with a young woman burdened by such a cognomenheres selah briggs must needs run away from hastings and try to hunt me up on her own account in london if i dared i wouldnt go up to see her at all and would let the thing die a natural death of inanitionsine cerere et baccho and so forthim afraid poor girl shell be more likely to find bacchus than ceres if she sticks in london but the plain fact is i dont darethats the long and the short of it  if i did selahd be tracking me to earth here in oxford and a nice mess thatd make of it she doesnt know my name to be sure but as soon as she called at college and found nobody of the name of walters was known there shed lie in wait for me about the gates as sure as my names herbert le breton and sooner or later shed take it out of me one way or the other selah has as many devils in her as the gergesene who dwelt among the tombs ill be sworn to it and if shes provoked shell let them all loose in a legion to crush me id better see her and have it out quietly once for all than try to shirk it here in oxford and let myself in at the end for the worse condemnation  under this impression herbert le breton leaning back in his wellpadded oak armchair ordered his scout to pack his portmanteau and set off by the very first fast train for paddington station he would get over his interview with selah briggs in the afternoon and return to epsilon terrace in good time for lady le bretons dinner say what you like of it ethel faucit and eight hundred a year certe redditum was a thing in no wise to be sneezed at by a judicious and discriminating person  herbert left his portmanteau in the cloakroom at paddington  and drove off in a hansom to the queer address which selah had given him it was a fishy lodging of the commoner sort in a back street at notting hill not far from the portobello road at the top of the stairs selah stood waiting to meet him and seemed much astonished when instead of kissing her as was his wont he only shook her hand somewhat coolly but she thought to herself that probably he didnt wish to be too demonstrative before the eyes of the lodginghouse people and so took no further notice of it  well selah herbert said as soon as he entered the room and seated himself quietly on one of the  straightbacked wooden chairs why on earth have you come to london  goodness gracious herbert selah answered letting loose the floodgates of her rapid speech after a weeks silence dont you go and ask me why ive done it ask me rather why i didnt go and do it long ago father hes got more and more aggravating every day for the last twelvemonth till at last i couldnt atand him any longer prayer meetings missionary meetings convention meetings all that sort of thing i could put up with somehow but when it came to private exhortations and prayer over me with three or four of the godliest neighbours i made up my mind not to put up with it one day longer so last week i packed up two or three little things hurriedly and left a note behind to say i felt i was too unregenerate to live in such spiritual company any longer and came straight up here to london and took these lodgings emily lucas she wrote to me from hastingsshes the daughter of the hairdresser in our street you know and i told her to write to me to the postoffice emily lucas wrote to me that there was weeping and gnashing of teeth and swearing almost when they found out id really left them and well there might be indeed for i did more work for them mostly just to get away for a while from the privileges than theyll ever get a hired servant to do for them in this world herbert herbert moved uneasily  on his chair as he noticed how glibly she called him now by his christian name instead of saying mr walters and emily says selah went on without stopping to take breath for a second that father put an advertisement at once into the christian mirrorpah as if it was likely i should go buying or reading the christian mirror indeedto say that if s b would return at once to her affectionate  and injured parents the whole past would be forgotten  and forgiven forgotten and forgiven i should think it would indeed but he didnt ask me whether their eternal bothering and plaguing of me about my precious soul for twenty years past would also be forgotten and forgiven  he didnt ask me whether all their meetings and conventions  and prayers and all the rest of it would be forgotten and forgiven my precious soul in turkey they say the women have no souls i often wished it had been my happy lot to be born in turkey and then perhaps they wouldnt have worried me so much about it im sure i often said to them oh dont bother on account of my poor unfortunate misguided little soul any longer its lost altogether i dont doubt and it doesnt in the least trouble me if it was somebody elses i could understand your being in such a fearful state of mind about it but as its only mine you know im sure it really doesnt matter and then theyd only go off worse than evermother doing hysterics and so forthand say i was a wicked bad abominable scoffer and that it made them horribly frightened even to listen to me  as if i wasnt more likely to know the real value of my own soul than anybody else was  herbert looked at her curiously and anxiously as she  delivered this long harangue in a voluble stream without a single pause or break and then he said in his quiet voice how old are you selah  twentytwo selah answered carelessly why herbert  oh nothing herbert replied turning away his eyes from her keen searching gaze uncomfortably he  congratulated himself inwardly on the lucky fact that she was fully of age for then at least he could only get into a row with her and not with her parents and now selah do you know what i strongly advise you  to get married at once selah put in promptly  herbert drew himself up stiffly and looked at her cautiously out of the corner of his eyes no he said slowly not to get married but to go back again for the present to your people at hastings consider selah youve done a very foolish thing indeed by coming here alone in this way  youve compromised yourself and youve compromised me  indeed if it werent for the lasting affection i bear youhe put this in awkwardly but he felt it necessary to do so for the flash of selahs eyes fairly cowed him for the momenti wouldnt have come here at all this afternoon to see you it might get us both into very serious trouble andandand delay the prospect of our marriage you see everything depends upon my keeping my fellowship until i can get an appointment to marry on anything that risks loss of the fellowship is really a measurable danger for both of us  selah looked at him very steadily with her big eyes and herbert felt that he was quailing a little under their piercing withering inquisition by jove what a splendid woman she was though when she was angry herbert she said rising from her chair and standing her full height imperiously before him herbert youre deceiving me i almost believe  youre shillyshallying with me i almost believe you dont ever really mean to marry me  herbert moved uneasily upon his wooden seat what was he to do should he make a clean breast of it forthwith  and answer boldly well selah you have exactly diagnosed my mental attitude or should he try to put her off a little with some meaningless explanatory platitudes  or should heby jove she was a very splendid womanshould he take her in his arms that moment kiss her doubts and fears away like a donkey and boldly and sincerely promise to marry her pooh not such a fool as all that comes to not even with selah before him now for he was no boy any longer and not to be caught by the mere vulgar charms of a flashy selfasserting greengrocers daughter  selah he said at last after a long pause i strongly advise you once more to return to hastings for the present  youll find it better for you in the end if your people are quite unendurableas i dont doubt they are from what you tell meyou could look about meanwhile for a temporary appointment say ashe checked himself from uttering the word shop girl and substituted for it drapers assistant  selah looked at him angrily what fools you men are about such things she said in a voice of utter scorn  when do you suppose i ever learnt the drapery or who do you suppose would ever give me a place in a shop of that sort without having learnt the drapery i dare say you think it takes ten years to make one of you fine gentlemen at college with your greek and your latin but that the drapery or the millinery or the confectionery comes by nature however thats not the question now the questions  simply thisherbert walters do you or dont you mean to marry me  i must temporise herbert thought to himself placidly  this girls quite too unreservedly categorical she eliminates  modality with a vengeance well selah he said in his calmest and most deliberate manner we must take a great many points into consideration before deciding on that matter and then he went on to tell her what seemed to him the pros and cons of an immediate marriage couldnt she get a place meanwhile of some sort couldnt she let him have time to look about him couldnt she go back just for a few days to hastings until he could hear of  something feasible for either of them selah interrupted him more than once with forcible interjectional observations such as bosh and rubbish and when he had finished she burst out once more into a long and voluble statement  for more than an hour herbert le breton and selah briggs fenced with one another each after their own fashion in the little fishy lodgings and at every fresh thrust  herbert parried so much the worse that at last selah lost patience utterly and rose in the end to the dignity of the situation herbert walters she said looking at him with unspeakable contempt i see through your flimsy excuses now and i feel certain you dont mean to marry me you never did mean to marry me you wanted to amuse yourself  by making love to a poor girl in a country town and now youd like to throw her overboard and leave her alone  to her own devices i knew you meant that when you didnt write to me but i wouldnt condemn you unheard i gave you a chance to clear yourself i see now you were trying to drop the acquaintance quietly and make it seem as if i had backed out of it as well as you  herbert felt the moment for breaking through all reserve had finally arrived you admirably interpret my motives in the matter selah he said coldly i dont think it would be just of me to interfere with your prospects in life any longer i cant say how long it may be before i am able to afford marriage and meanwhile im preventing you from forming a natural alliance with some respectable and estimable young man in your own station i should be sorry to stand in your way any further but if i could offer you any small pecuniary assistance at any time either now or hereafter you know id be very happy indeed to do so selah  the angry girl turned upon him fiercely selah she cried in a tone of crushing contempt what do you mean by calling me selah sir how dare you speak to me by my christian name in the same breath you tell me you dont mean to marry me how dare you have the insolence and impertinence to offer me money never say another word to me as long as you live herbert walters and leave me now for i dont want to have anything more to say to you or your money for ever  herbert took up his hat doubtfully selahselahmiss briggs i mean he said falteringly for at that moment selahs face was terrible to look at im very sorry i can assure you that this interviewand our pleasant acquaintanceshould unfortunately have had such a disagreeable  termination for my own partherbert was always politici should have wished to part with you in no unfriendly spirit  i should have wished to learn your plans for the future and to aid you in forming a suitable settlement in life hereafter  may i venture to ask before i go whether you mean to remain in london or to return to hastings as one who has been your sincere friend i should at least like to know what are your movements for the immediate present how long do you mean to stop here and when you leave these rooms where do you think you will next go toconfoundedly awkward he thought to himself to have her prowling about and dogging ones footsteps here in london  selah read through his miserable transparent little  pretences at once with a womans quick instinctive insight  ugh she cried pushing him away from her figuratively with a gesture of disgust do you think you poor suspicious creature i want to go spying you or following you all over london are you afraid in your sordid little respectable way that ill come up to oxford to pry and peep into that snug comfortable fellowship of yours do you suppose im so much in love with you herbert walters that i cant let you go without wanting to fawn upon you and run after you ever afterwards pah you miserable pitiable contemptible cur and coward are you afraid even of a woman go away and dont be frightened i never want to see you or speak to you again as long as i live you wretched lying shuffling hypocrite id rather go back to my own people at hastings a thousand times over than have anything more to do with you they may be narrowminded and bigoted and ignorant and stupid but at least theyre honesttheyre not liars and hypocrites go this minute herbert walters go away this minute and dont stand there fiddling and quivering  with your hat like a whipped schoolboy but go at once and take my eternal loathing and contempt for a parting present with you  herbert held the door gingerly ajar for half a second trying to think of a neat and appropriate epigram but at that particular moment for the life of him he couldnt hit on one  so he closed the door after him quietly and walking out alone into the street immediately nailed a passing hansom  i didnt come out of that dilemma very creditably to myself i must admit he thought with a burning face as he rolled along quickly in the hansom but anyhow now im well out of it the coasts all clear at last for ethel faucit its well to be off with the old love before youre on with the new as that horrid vulgar practical proverb justly though somewhat coarsely puts it still shes a perfectly magnificent creature is selah and by jove when she got into that towering rage and no wonder for i wont be unjust to her in that respect her tone and attitude would have done credit to any theatre i should think mrs siddons must have looked like that say as constance poor girl im really sorry for her from the very bottom of my heart im really sorry for her if it rested with me alone hang me if i dont think i would positively have married her but after all the environment you know the environment is always too strong for us  meanwhile in the shabby lodgings near the portobello road poor selah the excitement once over was lying with her proud face buried in the pillows and crying her very life out in great sobs of utter misery the daydream of her whole existence was gone for ever the bubble was burst and nothing stood before her but a future of utter drudgery  the brute the cur the mean wretch she said aloud  between her sobs and yet i loved him how beautifully he talked and how he made me love him if it had only been a common everyday methodist sweetheart now but herbert walters oh god how i hate him and how i did love him  when herbert reached his mothers house in epsilon terrace lady le breton met him anxiously at the door  herbert she said almost weeping my dear boy what on earth should i do if it were not for you youre the one comfort i have in all my children would you believe itno you wont believe itas i was walking back here this  afternoon with mrs faucit ethels aunt of all people in the world what do you think i saw in our own main street too but a young man decently dressed in his shirt sleeves no coat i assure you but only his shirt sleeves imagine my horror when he came up to usmrs faucit too you knowand said to me out loud in the most unconcerned voice well mother i couldnt believe my eyes herbert but i solemnly declare to you it was positively ronald you really could have knocked me down with a feather  disgraceful wasnt it perfectly disgraceful  how on earth did he come so asked herbert almost smiling in spite of himself  why do you know herbert lady le breton answered somewhat obliquely a few days since i met him wheeling along a barrow full of coals for a dirty grimy ragged little girl from some alley or gutter somewhere i believe they call the place the mewsat the back of the terrace you  remember he pretended the child wasnt big enough to wheel the coals which was absurd of course or else her parents wouldnt have sent her but im sure he really did it on purpose to annoy me he never does these things when im not by to see or if he does i never see him now that was bad enough in all conscience wasnt it but today what he did was still more outrageous he met a poor man as he calls him in westbourne grove who was one of his christian brethren is that the right expression and who declared he was next door to starving so what must ronald do but run into a pawnbrokersi shouldnt have thought he could ever have heard of such a placeand sell his coat or something of the sort and give the man who was doubtless an impostor all the money then he positively walked home in his shirt sleeves i call it a most unchristian thing to doand to walk straight into my very arms too as i was coming along with mrs faucit  herbert offered at once such condolences as were in his power and are the faucits coming to night he asked eagerly  lady le breton kissed him again gently on the forehead  oh herbert she said warmly i cant tell you what a comfort you always are to me oh yes the faucits are coming and do you know herbert my dear boy im quite sure that old mr faucit the uncle wouldnt at all object to the match and that ethels really very much disposed indeed to like you immensely youve only to follow up the advantage my dear boy and i dont for a moment think shed ever refuse you and ive been talking to sir sydney weatherhead about your future too and he tells me quite privately of course that with your position and honours at oxford he fully believes he can easily push you into the first good vacant post at the education office only you must be careful to say nothing about it beforehand or the others will say its a job as they call it oh herbert i really and truly cant tell you what a joy and a comfort you always are to me

frequently this term and that keeps a boy green in ones memory but blenkinsopp minor cyril anastasius guy thingumbob whatyoumaycalliti dont remember him a bit i suppose hes one of those inoffensive mildly mediocre sort of boys who fail to impress their individuality upon one in any way my experience is that you can always bear in mind the three cleverest boys at the top of each form and the three stupidest or most mischievous boys at the bottom but the nine or a dozen meritorious nobodies in the middle of the class are all so like one another in every way that you might as well try to discriminate between every individual sheep of a flock in a pasture and yet such is the natural contradictiousness and vexatious disposition of the british parent that youll always find him coming to inquire after just one of those very particular tommies or bobbies  charles warringtoncyril anastasius guy whatyoumaycall it thatll do i shall remember now all about them and the doctor arranged his hair before the looking glass into the most professional stiffness as a preparatory step to facing mr blenkinsopps parental inquiries in the headmasters study  what mr blenkinsopp yes it is really my dear sir how do you do this is a most unexpected pleasure  we hadnt the least idea you were in pilbury when did you come here  i came last night dr greatrex answered the dreaded parent respectfully weve come down from staffordshire for a week at the seaside and we thought we might as well be within hail of guy and charlie  quite right quite right my dear sir said the doctor mentally noting that blenkinsopp minor was familiarly known as guy not cyril were delighted to see you  and now you want to know all about our two young friends dont you  well yes dr greatrex i should like to know how they are getting on  ah of course of course very right its such a pleasure to us when parents give us their active and hearty cooperation youd hardly believe mr blenkinsopp how little interest some parents seem to feel in their boys  progress to us you know who devote our whole time and energy assiduously to their ultimate welfare its sometimes quite discouraging to see how very little the parents  themselves seem to care about it but your boys are both doing capitally the eldestblenkinsopp major we call him charles warrington isnt it his home names charlie if i recollect right ah quite so well charlies the very picture of perfect health as usual health is his only strong point it seems to me the doctor thought to himself instinctively we must put that first and foremost in excellent health and very good spirits hes in the second eleven now and a capital batter ive no doubt hell go into the first eleven next term if we lose biddlecomb tertius to the university in work as you know hes not very great doesnt do his abilities full justice mr blenkinsopp through his dreadful inattention hes generally near the bottom of the form im sorry to say generally near the bottom of the form  well i dare say theres no harm in that sir said mr  blenkinsopp senior warmly i was always at the bottom of the form at school myself doctor but ive picked it up in after life ive picked it up sir as you see and im fully equal with most other people nowadays as youll find if you inquire of any town councilman or man of position down our way at brosely  ah i dare say you were mr blenkinsopp the doctor answered blandly with just the faintest tinge of unconscious satire peering at his square unintelligent features as a fancier peers at the face of a bulldog i dare say you were now  after all however clever a set of boys may be one of them must be at the bottom of the form in the nature of things mustnt he and your charlie i think is only fifteen ah yes well well hell do better no doubt if we keep him here a year or two longer so then theres the second guy you call him if i remember rightcyril anastasius guyour blenkinsopp minor guys a good boy an excellent boy to tell you the plain truth mr blenkinsopp i dont know much of him personally myself which is a fact that tells greatly in his favour charlie i must admit i have to call up some times for reproof guy never charlies in the fifth form guys seventh in the fourth a capital place for a boy of his age hes very industrious you knowwhat we call a plodder they call it a plodder you see at thirteen mr blenkinsopp but a man of ability at forty dr greatrex delivered that last effective shot pointblank at the eyes of the inquiring parent and felt in a moment that its delicate generalised flattery had gone home straight to the parents susceptible heart  but theres one thing doctor mr blenkinsopp began after a few minutes further conversation on the merits and failings of guy and charlie theres one other thing i feel i should like to speak to you about and thats the teaching of your fifth form master mr le breton from what charlie tells me i dont quite like that young mans political ideas and opinions its said things to his form sometimes that are quite horrifying i assure you things about property and about our duty to the poor and so on that are positively enough to appal you now for example he told themi dont quite like to repeat it for its sheer blasphemy i call itbut he told them in a greek testament lesson that the apostles themselves were a sort of republicanssocialists i think charlie said or else chartists or dynamiters im not sure he didnt say st peter himself was a regular communist  dr greatrex drew a long breath i should think mr  blenkinsopp he suggested blandly charlie must really have misunderstood mr le breton you see theyve been reading the acts of the apostles in their greek testament this term now of course you remember that during the first days of the infant church while its necessities were yet so great as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need you see heres the passage mr blenkinsopp in the authorised version i wont trouble you with the original youve forgotten most of your greek i dare say ah i thought go it doesnt stick to us like the latin does it now perhaps in expounding that passage mr le breton may have referred in passingas an illustration merelyto the unhappily prevalent modern doctrines of socialism and communism he may have warned his boys for example against confounding a christian communism like this if i may so style it with the rapacious aggressive immoral forms of communism now proposed to us which are based upon the forcible disregard of all property and all vested interests of every sort i dont say he did you know for i havent conferred with him upon the subject but he may have done so and he may even have used as i have used the phrase christian communism to define the temporary attitude of the apostles and the early church in this matter that perhaps my dear sir may be the origin of the misapprehension  mr blenkinsopp looked hard at the three verses in the big bible the doctor had handed him with a somewhat  suspicious glare he was a selfmade man with land and houses of his own in plenty and he didnt quite like this suggestive talk about selling them and laying the prices at the apostles feet it savoured to him both of communism and priestcraft thats an awkward text you know he said looking up curiously from the bible in his hand into the doctors face a very awkward text and i should say it was rather a dangerous one to set too fully before young people  it seems to me to make too little altogether of property  you know dr greatrex at first sight it does look just a little like communism  precisely what mr le breton probably said the doctor answered following up his advantage quickly at first sight no doubt but at first sight only i assure you mr  blenkinsopp if you look on to the fourth verse of the next chapter youll see that st peter at least was no communistwhich is perhaps what mr le breton really said st  peter there argues in favour of purely voluntary beneficence you observe as when you mr blenkinsopp contribute a guinea to our chapel windowyou see were grateful to our kind benefactors we dont forget them and if youll look at the thirtyeighth article of the church of england my dear sir youll find that the riches and goods of christians are not common as touching the right title and possession of the same as certain anabaptistsgracious heavens is he a baptist i wonderif so ive put my foot in itcertain anabaptists do falsely boastreferring of course to sundry german fanatics of the timefollowers of one kniperdoling a crazy enthusiast not to the respectable english baptist denomination but that nevertheless every man ought of such things as he possesseth liberally to give alms to the poor that you see is the doctrine of the church of england and that ive no doubt is the doctrine that mr  le breton pointed out to your boys as the true christian communism of st peter and the apostles  well i hope so dr greatrex mr blenkinsopp answered resignedly im sure i hope so for his own sake as well as for his pupils still in these days you know when infidelity and radicalism are so rife one ought to be on ones guard against atheism and revolution and attacks on property in every form oughtnt one doctor these opinions are getting so rampant all around us property itself isnt safe one really hardly knows what people are coming to nowadays why last night i came down here and stopped at the royal marine on the parade and having nothing else to do while my wife was looking after the little ones i turned into a hall down in combe street where i saw a lot of placards up about a grand national social democratic meeting well i turned in dr greatrex and there i heard a german refugee fellow from londona whitehaired man of the name of schurts or something of the sortmr  blenkinsopp pronounced it to rhyme with hurtswho was declaiming away in a fashion to make your hair stand on end and frighten you half out of your wits with his dreadful  communistic notions i assure you he positively took my breath away i ran out of the hall at last while he was still speaking for fear the roof should fall in upon our heads and crush us to pieces i declare to you sir i quite expected a visible judgment  did you really now said dr greatrex languidly  well i dare say for i know theres a sad prevalence of revolutionary feeling among our workmen here mr blenkinsopp now what was this man schurz talking about  why sheer communism sir said mr blenkinsopp severely sheer communism i can tell you cooperation of workmen to rob their employers of profits gross denunciation of capital and capitalists and regular inciting of them against the property of the landlords by quoting scripture too doctor by quoting the very words of scripture they say the devil can quote scripture to his own destruction dont they doctor well he quoted something out of the bible about woe unto them that join field to field or words to that effect to make themselves a solitude in the midst of the earth do you know it strikes me that its a very dangerous book the biblein the hands of these socialistic demagogues i mean look now at that passage and at what mr le breton said about christian communism  but my dear mr blenkinsopp the doctor cried in a tone of gentle deprecation i hope you dont confound a person like this man schurz a german refugee of the worst type with our mr le breton an oxford graduate and an english gentleman of excellent family i know schurz by name through the papers hes the author of a dreadful book called gold and the proletariate or something of that sorta revolutionary work like tom paines age of reason i believeand he goes about the country now and then lecturing and agitating to make money no doubt out of the poor misguided credulous workmen you quite pain me when you mention him in the same breath with a hardworking conscientious able teacher like our mr le breton  oh mr blenkinsopp went on a little mollified then mr le bretons of a good family is he thats a great safeguard at any rate for you dont find people of good family running recklessly after these bloodthirsty doctrines and disregarding the claims of property  my dear sir the doctor continued we know his mother lady le breton personally his father sir owen was a distinguished officergeneral in the indian army in fact and all his people are extremely well connected with some of our best county families nothing wrong about him in any way i can answer for it he came here direct from lord exmoors where hed been acting as tutor to viscount lynmouth the eldest son of the tregellis family and you may be sure they wouldnt have anybody about them in any capacity who wasnt thoroughly and perfectly responsible  and free from any prejudice against the just rights of property  at each successive step of this collective guarantee to ernest le bretons perfect respectability mr blenkinsopps square face beamed brighter and brighter till at last when the name of lord exmour was finally reached his mouth relaxed slowly into a broad smile and he felt that he might implicitly trust the education of his boys to a person so intimately bound up with the best and highest interests of religion and property in this kingdom of course he said placidly that puts quite a different complexion upon the matter dr greatrex im very glad to hear young mr le bretons such an excellent and trustworthy person but the fact is that schurts man gave me quite a turn for the moment with his sanguinary notions i wish you could see the man sir a long whitehaired savagebearded fierceeyed old revolutionist if ever there was one it made me shudder to look at him not raving and ranting like a  madmani shouldnt have minded so much if hed a done that but talking as cool and calm and collected doctor about eliminating the capitalistcutting off my head in factas we two are talking here together at this moment his very words were sir we must eliminate the capitalist why bless my souland here mr blenkinsopp rushed to the window excitedlywho on earths this coming across your lawn here arm in arm with mr le breton into the schoolhouse man alive dr greatrex whatever you choose to say hanged if it isnt realty that german cutthroat fellow himself and no mistake at all about it  dr greatrex rose from his magisterial chair and glanced with dignified composure out of the window yes there was positively no denying it ernest le breton in cap and gown with edie by his side was walking arm in arm up to the schoolhouse with a longbearded largeheaded germanlooking man whose placid powerful face the doctor immediately  recognised as the one he had seen in the illustrated papers above the name of max schurz the defendant in the coming state trial for unlawfully uttering a seditious libel  he could hardly believe his eyes though he knew ernests opinions were dreadfully advanced he could not have suspected him of thus consorting with positive murderous political criminals in spite of his natural and kindly desire to screen his own junior master he felt that this public  exhibition of irreconcilable views was quite unpardonable and irretrievable mr blenkinsopp he said gravely turning to the awestruck tobaccopipe manufacturer with an expression  of sympathetic dismay upon his practised face i must retract all i have just been saying to you about our junior master i was not aware of this mr le breton must no longer retain his post as an assistant at pilbury regis  grammar school  mr blenkinsopp sank amazed into an easychair and sat in dumb astonishment to see the end of this extraordinary and unprecedented adventure the doctor walked out severely to the school porch and stood there in solemn state to await the approach of the unsuspecting offender  its so delightful dear herr max ernest was saying at that exact moment to have you down here with us even for a single night you cant imagine what an oasis your coming has been to us both im sure edie has enjoyed it just as much as i have and is just as anxious you should stop a little time here with us as i myself could possibly be  oh yes herr schurz edie put in persuasively with her sweet little pleading manner do stay a little longer  i dont know when dear ernest has enjoyed anything in the world so much as he has enjoyed seeing you youve no idea how dull it is down here for him and for me too for that matter everybody here is so borné and narrowminded and selfcentred nothing expansive or sympathetic about them as there used to be about ernests set in dear quiet peaceable old oxford its been such a pleasure to us to hear some conversation again that wasnt about the school and the rector and the haigh park people and the flower show and old mrs jenkinss quarrel with the vicar of st  barnabas except when mr berkeley runs down sometimes  for a saturday to monday trip to see us and takes ernest out for a good blow with him on the top of the breezy downs over yonder we really never hear anything at all except the gossip and the smalltalk of pilbury regis  and what makes it worse herr max said ernest looking up in the old mans calm strong face with the same reverent almost filial love and respect as ever is the fact that i cant feel any real interest and enthusiasm in the work thats set before me i try to do it as well as i can and i believe dr greatrex whos a kindhearted good sort of man in his way is perfectly satisfied with it but my heart isnt in it you see and cant be in it what sort of good is one doing the world by dinning the same foolish round of horace and livy and latin elegiacs into the heads of all these useless  eatall donothing young fellows wholl only be fit to fight or preach or idle as soon as weve finished cramming them with our indigestible unserviceable nostrums  ah ernest ernest said herr max nodding his heavy head gravely you always will look too seriously altogether at your social duties i cant get other people to do it enough and i cant get you not to do it too much entirely  remember my dear boy my pet old saying about a little leaven youre doing more good by just unobtrusively holding  your own opinions here at pilbury and getting in the thin end of the wedge by slowly influencing the minds of a few middleclass boys in your form than you could possibly be doing by making shoes or weaving clothes for the fractional benefit of general humanity dont be so abstract ernest concrete yourself a little isnt it enough that youre earning a livelihood for your dear little wife here whom im glad to know at last and to receive as a worthy daughter i may call you edie maynt i my daughter so this is your school is it a pleasant building and that sternlooking old gentleman yonder i suppose is your head master  dr greatrex said edie innocently stepping up to him in her bright elastic fashion let me introduce you to our friend herr schurz whose name i dare say you knowthe german political economist hes come down to pilbury to deliver a lecture here and weve been fortunate enough to put him up at our little lodging  the doctor bowed very stiffly i have heard of herr schurzs reputation already he said with as much diplomatic  politeness as he could command fortunately bethinking  himself at the right moment of the exact phrase that would cover the situation without committing him to any further courtesy towards the terrible stranger will you excuse my saying mrs le breton that were very busy this afternoon and i want to have a few words with your husband in private immediately perhaps youd better take herr schurz on to the downs safer there than on the parade at any rate he thought to himself quickly and le breton will join you in the combe a little later in the afternoon ill take the fifth form myself and let him have a holiday with his friend here if hed like one le breton will you step this way please and lifting his square cap with stern solemnity to edie the doctor disappeared under the porch into the corridor closely followed by poor frightened and wondering ernest  edie looked at herr max in dismay for she saw clearly there was something serious the matter with the doctor the old man shook his head sadly it was very wrong of me he said bitterly very wrong and very thoughtless i ought to have remembered it and stopped away im a caput lupinum it seems in pilbury regis a sort of moral scarecrow  or political leper to be carefully avoided like some horrid contagion by a respectable prosperous headmaster i might have known it i might have known it edie and now im afraid by my stupidity ive got dear ernest  unintentionally into a pack of troubles come on my child my poor dear child come on to the downs as he told us i wont compromise you any longer by being seen with you in the streets in the decent decorous whited sepulchres of pilbury regis and the grey old apostle with two tears trickling unreproved down his wrinkled cheek took edies arm tenderly in his and led her like a father up to the green grassy slope that overlooks the little seaward combe by the nestling village of nether pilbury  meanwhile dr greatrex had taken ernest into the breakfastroomthe study was already monopolised by mr blenkinsoppand had seated himself nervously with his hands folded before him on a straightbacked chair there was a long and awkward pause for the doctor didnt care to begin the interview but at last he sighed deeply and said in a tone of genuine disappointment and difficulty my dear le breton this is really very unpleasant  ernest looked at him and said nothing  do you know the doctor went on kindly after a minute i really do like you and sympathise with you  but what am i to do after this i cant keep you at the school any longer can i now i put it to your own commonsense im afraid le bretonit gives me sincere pain to say sobut im afraid we must part at the end of the quarter  ernest only muttered that he was very sorry  but what are we to do about it le breton the doctor continued more kindly than ever what are we ever to do about it for my own sake and for the boys sake and for respectabilitys pake its quite impossible to let you remain here any longer the first thing you must do is to send away this schurz creatureernest started a littleand then we must try to let it blow over as best we can everybodyll be talking about it you know the mans become quite notorious lately and itll be quite necessary to say distinctly le breton before the whole of pilbury that weve been obliged to dismiss you summarily so much we positively must do for our own protection but what on earth are we to do for you my poor fellow im afraid youve cut your own throat and i dont see any way on earth out of it  how so asked ernest half stunned by the suddenness of this unexpected dismissal  why just look the thing in the face yourself le breton i cant very well give you a recommendation to any other head master without mentioning to him why i had to ask you for your resignation and im afraid if i told them nobody else would ever take you  indeed said ernest very softly is it such a heinous offence to know so good a man as herr schurzthe best follower of the apostles i ever knew  my dear fellow said the doctor confidentially with an unusual burst of outspoken frankness so far as my own private feelings are concerned i dont in the least object to your knowing herr schurz or any other socialist whatsoever  to tell you the truth i dare say he really is an excellent and most wellmeaning person at bottom between ourselves  ive always thought that there was nothing very heterodox in socialism in fact i often think le breton the bibles the most thoroughly democratic book that ever was written but we havent got to deal in practice with first principles we have to deal with societywith men and women as we find them now society doesnt like your herr schurz objects to him anathematises him wants to imprison him if you walk about with him in public society wont send its sons to your school therefore you should disguise your affection and if you want to visit him you should visit him like nicodemus by night only  im afraid said ernest very fixedly i shall never be able so far to accommodate myself to the wishes of society  im afraid not myself le breton the doctor went on with imperturbable good temper im afraid not and im sorry for it the fact is youve chosen the wrong profession  you havent pliability enough for a schoolmaster youre too isolated too much out of the common run your ideas are too peculiar now youve got me today into a dreadful pickle and i might very easily be angry with you about it and part with you in bad blood but i really like you le breton and i dont want to do that so i only tell you plainly youve mistaken your natural calling what it can be i dont know but we must put our two heads together and see what we can do for you before the end of the quarter  now go up to the combe to your wife and try to get that terrible bugbear of a german out of pilbury as quickly and as quietly as possible goodbye for today le breton no coolness between us for this i hope my dear fellow  ernest grasped his hand warmly youre very kind dr greatrex he said with genuine feeling i see you mean well by me and im very very sorry if ive  unintentionally caused you any embarrassment  not at all not at all my dear fellow dont mention it well tide it over somehow and ill see whether i can get you anything else to do that youre better fitted for  as the door closed on ernest the doctor just gently wiped a certain unusual dew off his gold spectacles with a corner of his spotless handkerchief hes a good fellow he murmured to himself an excellent fellow but he doesnt manage to combine with the innocence of the dove the wisdom of the serpent poor boy poor boy im afraid hell sink but we must do what we can to keep his chin floating above the water and now i must go back to the study to have out my explanation with that detestable thickheaded old pig of a blenkinsopp your views about young le breton i must say to him are unfortunately only too well founded and i have been compelled to dismiss him this very hour from pilbury grammar school ughhow humiliating the professions really enough to give one a perfect sickening of life altogether    chapter xxiii  the streets of askelon   before the end of the quarter two things occurred which made almost as serious a difference to ernests and edies lives as the dismissal from pilbury regis grammar school  it was about a week or ten days after herr maxs unfortunate visit that ernest awoke one morning with a very curious and unpleasant taste in his mouth accompanied by a violent fit of coughing he knew what the taste was well enough and he mentioned the matter casually to edie a little later in the morning edie was naturally frightened at the symptoms and made him go to see the school doctor the doctor felt his pulse attentively listened with his stethoscope at the chest punched and pummelled the patient all over in the most orthodox fashion and asked the usual inquisitorial personal questions about all the other members of his family  when he heard about ronalds predisposition he shook his head seriously and feared there was really something in it  increased vocal resonance at the top of the left lung he must admit some tendency to tubercular deposit there and perhaps even a slight deepseated cavity ernest must take care of himself for the present and keep himself as free as possible from all kind of worry or anxiety  is it consumption do you think dr sanders edie asked breathlessly  well consumption mrs le breton is a very vague and indefinite expression said the doctor tapping his white shirtcuff with his nail in his slowest and most deliberate manner it may mean a great deal or it may mean very little i dont want in any way to alarm you or to alarm your husband but theres certainly a marked incipient tendency towards tubercular deposit yes tubercular deposit well if you ask me the question pointblank i should say so certainly i should say it was phthisis very little doubt of it in short what some people would call consumption  ernest went home with edie comforting her all the way as well as he was able and trying to make light of it but feeling in his own heart that the lookout was decidedly beginning to gather blacker and darker than ever before them through the rest of that term he worked as well as he could but edie noticed every morning that the cough was getting worse and worse and long before the time came for them to leave pilbury he had begun to look distinctly delicate care for edie and for the future was telling on him his frame had never been very robust and the anxieties of the last year had brought out the same latent hereditary tendency which had shown itself earlier and more markedly in the case of his brother ronald  meanwhile dr greatrex was assiduous in looking about for something or other that ernest could turn his hand to and writing letters with indefatigable kindness to all his colleagues and correspondents for though he was as ernest said a most unmitigated humbug that was really his only fault and when his sympathies were once really aroused as the le bretons had aroused them there was no stone he would leave unturned if only his energy could be of any service to those whom he wished to benefit but unfortunately  in this case it couldnt im at my wits end what to do with you le breton he said kindly one morning  to ernest but how on earth im to manage anything i cant imagine for my own part you know though your conduct about that poor man schurz a wellmeaning harmless fanatic i dare say was really a public scandalfrom the point of view of parents i mean my dear fellow from the point of view of parentsi should almost be inclined to keep you on here in spite of it and brave the public opinion of pilbury regis if it depended entirely upon my own  judgment but in the management of a school my dear boy as you yourself must be aware a head master isnt the sole and only authority there are the governors for example le breton andandand ur theres mrs greatrex now in all matters of social discipline and attitude mrs greatrex is justly of equal authority with me and mrs greatrex thinks it would never do to keep you at pilbury so of course that practically settles the question im awfully sorry le breton dreadfully sorry but i dont see my way out of it the mischiefs done already to some extent for all pilbury knows now that schurz came down here to stop with you at your lodgings but if i were to keep you on theyd say i didnt disapprove of schurzs opinions and that would naturally be simple ruination for the schoolsimple ruination  ernest thanked him sincerely for the trouble he had taken but wondered desperately in his own heart what sort of future could ever be in store for them  the second event was less unexpected though quite equally embarrassing under existing circumstances hardly more than a month before the end of the quarter a little blackeyed baby daughter came to add to the prospective burdens of the le breton family she was a wee fat roundfaced dimpled devonshire lass to look at as far  surpassing every previous baby in personal appearance as each of those previous babies by universal admission had surpassed all their earlier predecessorsa fact which as mr sanders remarked ought to be of most gratifying import both to evolutionists and to philanthropists in general as proving the continuous and progressive amelioration of the human race and edie was very proud of her indeed as she lay placidly in her very plain little white robes on the pillow of her simple wickerwork cradle but ernest though he learned to love the tiny intruder dearly afterwards had no heart just then to bear the conventional congratulations of his friends and fellowmasters another mouth to feed another life dependent upon him and little enough as it seemed for him to feed it with when edie asked him what they should name the babyhe had just received an adverse answer to his application for a vacant secretaryshiphe crumpled up the envelope bitterly in his hand and cried out in his misery call her pandora edie call her pandora for weve got to the very bottom of the casket and there is nothing at all left for us now but hopeand even of that very little  so they duly registered her name as pandora but her mother shortened it familiarly into dot and as little dot she was practically known ever after  almost as soon as poor edie was able to get about again the time came when they would have to leave pilbury regis  the doctors search had been quite ineffectual and he had heard of absolutely nothing that was at all likely to suit ernest le breton he had tried government offices members of parliament colonial friends every body he knew in any way who miyht possibly know of vacant posts or appointments but each answer was only a fresh disappointment for him and for ernest in the end he was fain to advise his peccant undermaster since nothing else remained for it that he had better go up to london for the present take lodgings and engage in the precarious occupation known as looking about for something to turn up on the morning when edie and he were to leave the town dr  greatrex saw ernest privately in his own study  i wish very much i could have gone to the station to see you off le breton he said pressing his hand warmly but it wouldnt do you know it wouldnt do and mrs greatrex wouldnt like it people would say i sympathised secretly with your political opinions which might offend sir matthew ogle and others of our governors but im sorry to get rid of you really and sincerely sorry my dear fellow and apart from personal feeling im sure youd have made a good master in most ways if it werent for your most unfortunate socialistic notions get rid of them le breton i beg of you do get rid of them well the only thing i can advise you now is to try your hand for the present onlytill  something turns up you knowat literature and journalism i shall be on the lookout for you still and shall tell you at once of anything i may happen to hear of but meanwhile you must try to be earning something and if at any time my dear friend you should be temporarily in want of moneythe doctor said this in a shamefaced hesitating sort of way with not a little humming and hawingin want of money for immediate necessities merely if youll only be so kind as to write and tell me i should consider it a pleasure and a privilege to lend you a ten pound note you knowjust for a short time till you saw your way clear before you  dont hesitate to ask me now be sure and i may as well say write to me at the school le breton not at the schoolhouse so that even mrs greatrex need never know anything about it in fact if youll excuse me ive put a small sum into this envelopeonly twenty poundswhich may be of service to you as a loan as a loan merely if youll take itonly till something turns up you knowyoull really be conferring a great favour upon me there there my dear boy now dont be offended ive borrowed money myself at times when i was a young man like you and i hadnt a wife and family then as an excuse for it either put it in your pocket theres a good fellow youll need it for mrs le breton and the baby you see now do please put it in your pocket  the tears rode fast and hot in ernests eyes and he grasped the doctors other hand with grateful fervour dear dr greatrex he said as well as he was able its too kind of you too kind of you altogether but i really cant take the money even after the expenses of edies illness and of baby dots wardrobe we have a little sum a very little sum laid by thatll help us to tide over the immediate present  its too good of you too good of you altogether i shall remember your kindness for ever with the most sincere and heartfelt gratitude  as ernest looked into the doctors halfaverted eyes swimming and glistening just a little with sympathetic moisture his heart smote him when he thought that he had ever described that good kindly generous man as an  unmitigated humbug it shows how little one can trust the mere outside shell of human beings he said to edie selfreproachfully as they sat together in their hare thirdclass carriage an hour later the humbugs just the conventional mask of his professionnecessary enough i suppose for people who are really going to live successfully in the world as we find it the heart within hims a thousand times warmer and truer and more unspoiled than one could ever have imagined from the outer covering he offered me his twenty pounds so delicately and considerately that but for my fathers blood in me edie for your sake i believe i could almost have taken it  when they got to london ernest wished to leave edie and dot at arthur berkeleys rooms he knew nowhere else to leave them while he went out by himself to look about for cheap lodgings edie was still too weak he said to carry her baby about the streets of london in search of apartments but edie wouldnt hear of this arrangement she didnt quite like going to arthurs and she felt sure she could bargain with the london landladies a great deal more effectually than a man like ernestwhich was an important matter in the present very reduced condition of the family finances in the end it was agreed that they should both go out on the hunt together but that ernest should be permitted to relieve edie by turns in taking care of the precious baby  theyre dreadful people i believe london landladies said edie in her most housewifely manner regular cheats and skinflints ive always heard who try to take you in on every conceivable point and item we must be very careful not to let them get the better of us ernest and to make full inquiries about all extras and so forth beforehand  they turned towards holloway and the northern district to look for cheap rooms and they saw a great many more or less dear and more or less dirty and unsuitable until their poor hearts really began to sink within them at last in despair edie turned up a small side street in holloway and stopped at a tiny house with a clean white curtain in its wee front bay window this is awfully small ernest she said despondently but perhaps after all it might really suit us  the door was opened for them by a tall rawboned hardfaced woman the very embodiment and personification of edies ideal skinflint london landlady might they see the lodgings edie asked dubiously yes they might indeed mum answered the hardfaced woman edie glanced at ernest significantly as who should say that these would really never do  the lodgings were very small but they were as clean as a new pin edie began to relent and thought perhaps in spite of the landlady they might somehow manage to put up with them what was the rent  the hardfaced landlady looked at edie steadily and then answered fifteen shillings mum  oh thats too much for us im afraid said edie ruefully we dont want to go as high as that were very poor and quiet people  well mum the landlady assented quickly it is igh for the rooms perhaps mum though ive ad more but it is igh mum i wont deny it still for you mum and the baby i wouldnt mind making it twelve and sixpence  couldnt you say halfasovereign edie asked timidly emboldened by success  arf a suvveran mum well i ardly rightly know said the hardfaced landlady deliberately i cant say without askin of my usband whether hell let me excuse me a minnit mum ill just run down and ask im  edie glanced at ernest and whispered doubtfully theyll do but im afraid shes a dreadful person  meanwhile the hardfaced landlady had run downstairs quickly and called out in a pleasant voice of childish  excitement to her husband john john she crieddrat that man wheres he gone to oh a smokin of course in the back kitching oh john theres the sweetest little lady you ever set eyes on all in black with a dear baby a dear little speechless infant and a invalid usband i should say by the look of im as come to ask the price of the ground floor lodgins and seein she was so nice and kindlike i told her fifteen shillings instead of a suvveran and she says cant you let em for less says she and she was that pretty and engagin that i says well for you ill make it twelve and sixpence mum says i and says she you couldnt say arf a suvveran could you and says i ill ask my usband and oh john i do wish youd let me take em at that for a kinder sweeterlookin dearer family i never did an that i tell you  john drew his pipe slowly out of his mouthhe was a big heavy coachmanbuilt sort of person in waistcoat and shirtsleevesand answered with a kindly smile why martha if you want to take em for arf a suvveran in course youd ought to do it got a baby pore thing ave she now well there there you just go this very minnit and tell em as youll take em  the hardfaced landlady went up the stairs again only stopping a moment to observe parenthetically that a sweeter little lady she never did and what was arfacrown a week to you and me john and then holding the corner of her apron in her hand she informed edie that her usband was prepared to accept the ten shillings weekly  ill try to make you and the gentleman comfortable mum she said eagerly the gentleman dont look strong now do he we must try to feed im up and keep im cheerful and weve got plenty of flowers to make the room bright you see im very fond of flowers myself mum seems to me as if they was sort of company to one like and when you water em and tend em always i feel as if they was alive and got to know one again i do and that makes one love em now dont it mum to see em brighten up after youve watered em like that there maidenair fern there why its enough to make one love em the same as if they was christians mum there was a melting tenderness in her voice when she talked about the flowers that half won over edies heart even in spite of her hard features  im glad youre so fond of flowers mrs oh you havent told us your name yet edie said beginning vaguely to suspect that perhaps the hardfaced landlady wasnt quite as bad as she looked to a casual observer  alliss mum the landlady answered filling up edies interrogatory blank my name is alliss  alice what edie asked again  oh no mum you dont rightly understand me the landlady replied getting very red and muddling up her aspirates more decidedly than ever as people with her failing always do when they want to be specially deliberate and emphatic not halice but alliss haitch hay hell hell hi double hessalliss my full names martha alliss mum my usbands john alliss when would you like to come in  at once edie answered weve left our luggage at the cloakroom at waterloo and my husband will go back and fetch it while i stop here with the baby  not that he shant indeed mum cried the hardfaced landlady hastily beggin your pardon for sayin so our john shall gothats my usband mum and you shall give im the ticket i wouldnt let your good gentleman there go and im so tired too not for the world i wouldnt  just you give me the ticket mum and john shall go this very minnit and fetch it  but perhaps your husbands busy said ernest reflecting  upon the probable cost of cab hire and hell

nowadays john is retired from business e says sir and aint got nothink to do but clean the knives and lay the fires and split the firewood and such like  john were a coachman sir in a gentlemans

and set you right down there and ill make you and the lady a cup of tea at once and johnll bring round the luggage by the time youve got your things off  ernest looked at edie and edie looked at ernest could they have judged too hastily once more after their determination  to be lenient in first judgments for the future so ernest gave mrs halliss the cloakroom ticket and mrs  halliss ran downstairs with it immediately john the cried again drat that man wheres e gone to oh there you are dearie just you put on your coat an at as fast as ever you can and borrer tom woods barrer and run

said john vainly endeavouring to tear on his coat with becoming rapidity under the influence of mrs hallisss voluble exhortations pore are they pore things and so they may be ive knowed the sons of country gentlemen and that baronights too martha as ad kep their ounds redooced to be that pore as they couldnt have afforded to a took our lodgings even umble as they may be pore aint nothink to do

says is wed ought to do the very best we can for em any ow now oughtnt we  drat the man cried mrs halliss again impatiently dont stand talkin and sermonin about it there no longer like a poll parrot but just you run along and send in the milk like a dear will you or that dear little ladyll have to be waitin for her teaand her with a monthold baby too the pretty thing just to think of it  and indeed long before john halliss had got back again with the two wee portmanteausi could a carried that lot on my ead he soliloquised when he saw them without avin troubled to wheel round a onnecessary encumbrance in the way of a barrermrs halliss had put the room tidy and laid the baby carefully in a borrowed cradle in the corner and brought up edie and ernest a big square tray covered by a snowwhite napkinmy own washin mumand conveying a good cup of tea a couple of crisp rolls and two such delicious milky eggs as were never before known in the whole previous history of the county of middlesex  and while they drank their tea mrs halliss insisted upon taking the baby down into the kitchen so that they mightnt be bothered pore things for the pore lady must be tired with nursin of it herself the livelong day that she must and when she got it into the kitchen she was compelled  to call over the back yard wall to mrs bollond the greengrocers wife next door with the ultimate view to getting a hares brain for the dear baby to suck at through a handkerchief and mrs bollond being specially so  invited came in by the area door and inspected the dear baby and both together arrived at the unanimous conclusion that little dot was the very prettiest and sweetest child that ever sucked its fat little fingers lord bless her  and in the neat wee parlour upstairs edie pouring out tea from the glittering tin teapot into one of the scrupulously clean small whiteygold teacups was saying meanwhile to ernest well after all ernest dear perhaps london landladies  arent all quite as black as theyre usually painted a conclusion which neither edie nor ernest had ever after any occasion for altering in any way    chapter xxiv  the clouds begin to break   and now what were ernest and edie to do for a living  that was the practical difficulty that stared them at last plainly in the faceno mere abstract question of right and justice of socialistic ideals or of political economy but the stern uncompromising pressing domestic question of daily bread they had come from pilbury regis with a very small reserve indeed in their poor lean little purses and though mrs hallisss lodgings might be cheap enough as london lodgings go their means wouldnt allow them to stop there for many weeks together unless that hypothetical something of which they were in search should happen to turn up with most extraordinary and unprecedented rapidity  as soon as they were settled in at their tiny rooms therefore ernest began a series of weary journeys into town in search of work of some sort or another and he hunted up all his old oxford acquaintances in the temple or elsewhere to see if they could give him any suggestions towards a possible means of earning a livelihood most of them he found to his surprise though they had been great chums of his at college seemed a little shy of him nowadays one old oxford friend in particular an impeccable man in closecut frock coat and hat of shiny perfection he overheard saying to another he followed him accidentally up a long staircase in kings bench walk ah yes i met le breton in the strand yesterday when i was walking with a qc too hes married badly got no employment and looks awfully seedy  so very embarrassing you know now wasnt it and the other answered lightly in the same unconcerned tone oh of course dreadfully embarrassing really ernest slank down the staircase again with a sinking heart and tried to get no further hints from the respectabilities of kings bench walk at least in this his utmost extremity  night after night as the dusk was beginning to throw its pall over the great lonely desert of londonone vast frigid expanse of living souls that knew and cared nothing about himernest turned back footsore and heartsick to the cheery little lodgings in the short sidestreet at holloway  there good mrs halliss whose hard face seemed to grow softer the longer you looked at it had a warm clip of tea always ready against his coming and edie with wee dot sleeping placidly on her arm stood at the door to welcome him back again in wifelike fashion the flowers in the window bloomed bright and gay in the tiny parlour and edie with her motherly cares for little dot seemed more like herself than ever she had done before since poor harrys death had clouded the morning of her happy lifetime but to ernest even that pretty picture of the young mother and her sleeping baby looked only like one more reminder of the terrible burden he had unavoidably yet too lightly taken upon him those two dear lives depended wholly upon him for their daily bread and where that daily bread was ever to come from he had absolutely not the slightest notion  there is no place in which it is more utterly dreary to be quite friendless than in teeming london still they were not absolutely friendless even in that great lurid throng of jarring humanity all eagerly intent on its own business and none of it troubling its collective head about two such nonentities as ernest and edie ronald used to come round daily to see them and cheer them up with his quiet confidence  in the disposer of all things and arthur berkeley neglecting his west end invitations and his lady admirers used to drop in often of an evening for a friendly chat and a rational suggestion or two  why dont you try journalism le breton he said to ernest one night as they sat discussing possibilities for the future in the little parlour together literature in some form or others clearly the best thing for a man like you to turn his hand to it demands less compliance with conventional  rules than any other profession no editor or publisher would ever dream of dismissing you for example because you invited your firebrand friend max schurz to dinner  on the contrary if it comes to that hed ask you what herr max thought about the future of trades unions and the socialist movement in germany and hed advise you to turn it into a column and a half of copy with a large type  sensational heading a communistic leader interviewed from our special correspondent  but its such a very useless unsocialistic trade ernest answered doubtfully do you think it would be quite right arthur for a man to try and earn money by it of course it isnt much worse than schoolmastering i dare say nobody can say hes performing a very useful function for the world by hammering a few lines of ovid into the skull of poor stupid blenkinsopp major who after all will only use what he calls his education if he uses it in any way at all to enable him to make rather more money than any other tobaccopipe manufacturer in the entire trade still one does feel for all that that mere writing of books and papers is a very unsatisfactory kind of work for an ethical being to perform for humanity how much better now if one could only be a farmlabourer or a shoemaker  arthur berkeley looked across at him half angrily my dear ernest he said in a severer voice than he often used the time has gone by now for this economical puritanism of yours it wont do any longer you have to think of your child and of mrs le breton your first duty is to earn a livelihood for them and yourself when youve done that satisfactorily you may begin to think of the claims of humanity dont be vexed with me my dear fellow if i speak to you very plainly youve lost your place at  pilbury because you wouldnt be practical you might have known they wouldnt let you go hobnobbing publicly before the very eyes of boys and parents with a firebrand german socialist mind i dont say anything against herr schurz myselfwhat little i know about him is all in his favourthat hes a thorn in the side of those odious prigs the political economists ive often noticed that when a man wants to dogmatise to his hearts content without fear of contradiction he invariably calls himself a political economist then if people differ from him he smiles at them the benign smile of superior wisdom and says superciliously ah i see you dont understand political economy now your herr schurz is a dissenter among economists i believea sort of embryo luther come to tilt with a german toy lance against their economical infallibilities and im told he knows more about the subject than all the rest of them put together of course if you like him and respect himand i know you have one superstition left my dear fellowtheres no reason on earth why you shouldnt do so but you mustnt parade him too openly before the scandalised faces of respectable pilbury in future you must be practical turn your hand to whatever you can get to do and leave humanity at large to settle the debtor and creditor account with you hereafter  ill do my best berkeley ernest answered submissively  and if you like ill strangle my conscience and try my hand at journalism  do theres a good man arthur berkeley said delighted at his late conversion i know two or three editor fellows pretty well and if youll only turn off something ill ask them to have a look at it  next morning at breakfast ernest discussed the possibilities of this new venture very seriously with sympathising edie its a great risk he said turning it over dubiously in his mind a great risk and a great expense too for nothing certain let me see therell be a quire of white foolscap to start with thatll be a shillinga lot of money as things go at present edie isnt it  why not begin with half a quire ernest said his little wife cautiously thatd be only sixpence you see  do they halve quires at the stationers i wonder ernest went on still mentally reckoning well suppose we put it at sixpence then weve got pens already by us but not any inkthats a pennyand theres postage say about twopence total ninepence thats a lot of money isnt it now for a pure uncertainty  id try it ernest dear if i were you edie answered  we must do something mustnt we dear to earn our living  we must ernest said sighing i wish it were anything  but that but i suppose what must be must be well ill go out a walk by myself in the quietest streets i can find and try if i can think of anything on earth a man can write about arthur berkeley says i ought to begin with a social article for a paper he knows the morning intelligence people and hell try to get them to take something if i can manage to write it i wonder what on earth would do as a social article for the morning intelligence if only theyd let me write about socialism now but arthur says they wont take that the times arent yet ripe for it i wish they were edie i wish they were and then perhaps you and i would find some way to earn ourselves a decent living  so ernest went out and ruminated quietly by himself as well as he was able in the least frequented streets of holloway and highgate after about half an hours excogitation  a brilliant idea at last flashed across him he had found in a tobacconists window something to write about  your practised journalist doesnt need to think at all he writes whatever comes uppermost without the unnecessarily troublesome preliminary of deliberate thinking but ernest le breton was only making his first experiment in the queer craft and he looked upon himself as a veritable watt or columbus when he had actually discovered that hitherto unknown object a thing to write about he went straight back to good mrs hallisss with his discovery whirling in his head stopping only by the way at the stationers to invest in half a quire of white foolscap the bests a shilling a quire mister said the shopman second best tenpence communist as he was ernest couldnt help noticing the unusual mode of address but he took the  cheaper quality quietly and congratulated himself on his good luck in saving a penny upon the original estimate  when he got home he sat down at the plain wooden table by the window and began with nervous haste to write away rapidly at his first literary venture edie sat by in her little low chair and watched him closely with breathless interest would it be a success or a failure that was the question they were both every moment intently asking  themselves it was not a very important piece of literary  workmanship to be sure only a social leader for a newspaper to be carelessly skimmed today and used to light the fire  tomorrow if even that and yet had it been the greatest masterpiece ever produced by the human intellect ernest could not have worked at it with more conscientious care or edie watched him with profounder admiration when shakespeare  sat down to write hamlet it may be confidently asserted that neither mistress anne shakespeare nor anybody  else awaited the result of his literary labours with such unbounded and feverish anxiety by the time ernest had finished his second sheet of white foolscapmuch erased and interlined with interminable additions and correctionsedie ventured for a moment briefly to interrupt his creative efforts dont you think youve written as much as makes an ordinary leader now ernest she asked apologetically  im afraid youre making it a good deal longer than it ought to be by rights  im sure i dont know edie ernest answered gazing at the two laboured sheets with infinite dubitation and searching of spirit i suppose one ought properly to count the words in an average leader and make it the same length as they always are in the morning intelligence i think they generally run to just a column  of course you ought dear edie answered run out this minute and buy one before you go a single line further  ernest looked back at his two pages of foolscap somewhat  ruefully thats a dreadful bore he said with a sigh itll just run away with the whole penny i thought id managed to save in getting the second quality of foolscap for fivepence however i suppose it cant be helped and after all if the thing succeeds one can look upon the penny in the light of an investment its throwing a sprat to catch a whale as the proverb says though im afraid herr max would say that that was a very immoral capitalist proverb how horribly low we must be sinking edie when we come to use the antisocial language of those dreadful capitalists  i dont think capitalists deal much in proverbs dear  said edie smiling in spite of herself but you neednt go to the expense of buying a morning intelligence i dare say for perhaps mrs halliss may have an old one in the house or if not she might be able to borrow one from a neighbour she has a perfect genius for borrowing mrs  halliss she borrows everything i want from somebody or other ill just run down to the kitchen this minute and ask her  in a few seconds edie returned in triumph with an old soiled and torn copy of the morning intelligence duly  procured by the ingenious mrs halliss from the dairy opposite  it was a decidedly antiquated copy and it had only too  obviously been employed by its late possessor to wrap up a couple of kippered herrings but it was still entire so far as regarded the leaders at least and it was perfectly legible in spite of its ancient and fishlike smell to ensure accuracy ernest and edie took a leader apiece and carefully counted up the number of words that went to the column they came on an average to fifteen hundred then ernest counted his own manuscript with equal careno easy task when one took into consideration the interlined or erased passagesand to his infinite disgust discovered that it only extended to seven hundred and fifty words why edie he said in a very disappointed tone how little it prints into i should certainly have thought id written at least a whole column and the worst of it is i believe ive really said all i have to say about the subject  what is it ernest dear asked edie  italian organboys ernest answered i saw on a placard in the news shop that one of them had been taken to a hospital in a starving condition he hardly liked to tell even edie that he had stood for ten minutes at a tobacconists  window and read the case in a sheet of lloyds news conspicuously hung up there for public perusal  well let me hear what you have written ernest dear and then see if you couldnt expand it  ernest read it over most seriously and solemnlyit was only a social leader of the ordinary commonplace talkytalky sort but to those two poor young people it was a very serious and solemn matter indeedno less a matter than their own two lives and little dots into the bargain it began with the particular case of the particular organboy who formed the peg on which the whole article was to be hung it went on to discourse on the lives and manners of organboys in general it digressed into the natural history of the common guineapig with an excursus on the scenery of the lower apennines and it finished off with sundry abstract  observations on the musical aspect of the barrelorgan and the aesthetic value of hurdygurdy performances edie listened to it all with deep attention  its very good ernest dear she said with wifely admiration as soon as he had finished just like a real leader exactly only do you know there arent any anecdotes  in it i think a social leader of that sort ought always to have a lot of anecdotes couldnt you manage to bring in something about fox and sheridan or about george iv  and beau brummel they always do you know in most of the papers  ernest gazed at her in silent admiration how clever of you edie he said to think of that why of course there ought to be some anecdotes theyre the very breath of life to this sort of meaningless writing only somehow george iv and beau brummel dont seem exactly relevant to italian organgrinders now do they  i thought said edie with hardly a touch of unintentional  satire that the best thing about anecdotes of that kind in a newspaper was their utter irrelevancy but if beau brummel wont do couldnt you manage to work in guicciardini and the galleys thats strictly italian you know and therefore relevant and im sure the newspaper leaders are extremely fond of that story about guiccardini  they are ernest answeredmost undoubtedly but perhaps for that very reason readers may be beginning to get just a little tired of it by this time  i dont think the readers matter much said edie with a brilliant flash of practical commonsense at least not nearly half as much ernest as the editor  quite true ernest replied with another admiring look but probably the editor more or less consults the taste and feelings of the readers well ill try to expand it a bit and ill manage to drag in an anecdote or two  somehowif not guicciardini at least something or other else italian you see italys a tolerably rich subject because you can do any amount about raffael and michael angelo and leonardo and so forth not to mention botticelli the papers have made a dreadful run lately on botticelli  so ernest sat down once more at the table by the window and began to interlard the manuscript with such allusions to italy and the italians as could suggest themselves  on the spur of the moment to his anxious imagination  at the end of half an hourabout the time a practised hand would have occupied in writing the whole articlehe counted words once more and found there were still two hundred wanting two hundred more words to say about italian organboys alas for the untrained human fancy a master leader writer at the office of the morning intelligence  could have run on for ever on so fertile and suggestive  a themea theme pregnant with unlimited openings for all the cheap commonplaces of abstract journalistic philanthropy but poor ernest a prentice hand at the trade had yet to learn the fluent trick of the accomplished news purveyor he absolutely could not write without thinking about it a third time he was obliged to recommit his manuscript and a third time to count the words over  this time oh joy the reckoning came out as close as possible to the even fifteen hundred ernest gave a sigh of relief and turned to read it all over again as finally enlarged and amended to the critical ears of admiring edie  there was anecdote enough now in all conscience in the article and allusions enough to stock a whole weeks numbers of the morning intelligence edie listened to the whole tirade with an air of the most severe and impartial criticism  when ernest had finished she rose up and kissed him im sure itll do ernest she said confidently its exactly like a real leader its quite beautifula great deal more beautiful  in fact than anything else i ever read in a newspaper its good enough to print in a volume  i hope the editorll think so ernest answered dubiously  if not what a lot of valuable tenpenny foolscap wasted all for nothing now i must write it all out again clean edie on fresh pieces  newspaper men it must be candidly admitted do not usually write their articles twice over indeed to judge by the result it may be charitably believed that they do not even as a rule read them through when written to correct their frequent accidental slips of logic or english but ernest wrote out his organboy leader in his most legible and roundest hand copperplate fashion with as much care and precision as if it were his first copy for presentation to the stern writingmaster of a draconian board school editors are more likely to read your manuscript if its legible i should think edie he said looking up at her with more of hope in his face than had often been seen in it of late i wonder now whether they prefer it sent in a long envelope folded in three or in a square envelope folded twice over or in a paper cover open like a pamphlet there must be some recognised  professional way of doing it and i should think ones more likely to get it taken if one sends it in the regular  professional fashion than if one makes it look too amateurish i shall go in for the long envelope at any rate if not journalistic  its at least official  the editor of the morning intelligence is an important personage in contemporary politics and a man of more real weight in the world than halfadozen members of parliament  for obscure country boroughs but even that mighty man himself would probably have been a little surprised as well as amused if he could have seen it at the way in which ernest and edie le breton anxiously endeavoured to conciliate  beforehand his merest possible personal fads and fancies  as a matter of fact the question of the particular paper on which the article was written mattered to him absolutely less than nothing inasmuch as he never looked at anything whatsoever until it had been set up in type for him to pass offhand judgment upon its faults or its merits his time was far too valuable to be lightly wasted on the task of deciphering crabbed manuscript  in the afternoon berkeley called to see whether ernest had followed his suggestion and was agreeably surprised to find a whole article already finished he glanced through the neatly written pages and was still more pleased to  discover that ernest with an unsuspected outburst of practicality  and practicability had really hit upon a possible subject  this may do ernest he said with a sigh of relief i dare say it will i know lancaster wants leader writers and i think this is quite good enough to serve his turn ive spoken to him about you come round with me nowhell be at the office by four oclockand well see what we can do for you its absolutely useless sending anything to the editor of a daily paper without an introduction you might write with the pen of the angel gabriel or turn out leaders which were a judicious mean between gladstone burke and herbert spencer and it would profit you nothing for the simple reason that he hasnt got the time to read them he would toss junius and montesquieu into the waste paper basket and accept copy on the shocking murder in the borough road from one of his regular contributors instead  he cant help himself and what you must do ernest is to become one of the regular ring and combine to keep junius and montesquieu permanently outside  the struggle for existence gives no quarter ernest said sadly with half a sigh  and takes none berkeley answered quickly so for your wifes sake you must try your best to fight your way through it on your own account for yourself and your family  the editor of the morning intelligence mr hugh lancaster was a short thickset hardheaded sort of man with a kindly twinkle in his keen grey eyes and a harassed smile playing continually around the corners of his firm and dose mouth he looked as though he was naturally a  goodhumoured benevolent person overdriven at the journalistic mill till half the life was worn out of him leaving the  benevolence as a wearied remnant without energy enough to express itself in any other fashion than by the perpetual harassed smile he saw arthur berkeley and ernest le breton at once in his own sanctum and took the manuscript from their hands with a languid air of perfect resignation  this is the friend you spoke of is it berkeley he said in a wearied way well well well see what we can do for him at the same time he rang a tiny handbell a boy rather the worse for printers ink appeared at the summons  mr lancaster handed him ernests careful manuscript unopened with the laconic order press proof immediately the boy took it without a word im very busy now mr  lancaster went on in the same wearied dispirited manner come again in thirtyfive minutes jones show these  gentlemen into a room somewhere and the editor fell back forthwith into his easychair and his original attitude of listless indifference berkeley and ernest followed the boy into a bare back room furnished only with a deal table and two chairs and there anxiously awaited the result of the editors critical examination  dont be afraid of lancaster ernest arthur said kindly his manners awfully cold i know but he means well and i really believe hed go out of his way rather than not to do a kindness for anybody he thought actually in want of occupation with most men thats an excellent reason for not employing you with lancaster i do truly think its a genuine recommendation  at the end of thirtyfive minutes the grimyfaced officeboy returned with a friendly nod editorll see you he said with the spartan brevity of the journalistic worldnobody connected with newspapers ever writes or speaks a single word unnecessarily if he isnt going to be paid for it at so much per thousandand ernest followed him trembling  from head to foot into mr lancasters private study  the great editor took up the steaming hot proof that had just been brought him and glanced down it carelessly with a rapid scrutiny then he turned to ernest and said in a dreamy fashion this will do well print this tomorrow  you may send us a middle very occasionally come here at four oclock when a subject suggests itself to you and speak to me about it my times very fully occupied good morning mr le breton berkeley stop a minute i want to talk with you  it was all done in a moment and almost before ernest knew what had happened he was out in the street again with tears filling his eyes and joy his heart for here at last was bread bread bread for edie and the baby he ran without stopping all the way back to holloway rushed headlong into the house and fell into edies arms calling out wildly hes taken it hes taken it edie kissed him halfadozen times over and answered bravely i knew he would ernest it was such a splendid article and yet thousands of readers of the morning intelligence next day skimmed lightly over the leader on organboys in their ordinary casual fashion without even thinking what hopes and fears and doubts and terrors had gone to the making of that very commonplace bit of newspaper rhetoric for if the truth must be told edies first admiring criticism was perfectly correct and ernest le bretons leader was just for all the world exactly the same as anybody elses  meanwhile arthur berkeley had stayed behind as requested in mr lancasters study and waited to hear what mr lancaster had to say to him the editor looked up at him wearily from his chair passed his bread hand slowly across his bewildered forehead and then said the one word poor  nothing on earth to do berkeley answered  he might make a journalist perhaps the editor gaid sleepily this socials up to the average at any rate ill do my very best for him but he cant live upon socials  we have too many social men already what can he do  thats the question it wont do to say he can write pretty nearly as well about anything that turns up as any other man in england can do i can get a hundred young fellows in the temple to do that any day the real questions this is there anything he can write about a great deal better than all the other men in all england put together  yes there is berkeley answered with commendable promptitude undismayed by mr lancasters excessive requirements he knows more about communists socialists  and political exiles generally than anybody else in the whole of london  good the editor answered brightening up and speaking  for a moment a little less languidly thats good  theres this man schurz now the german agitator hes going to be tried soon for a seditious libel it seems and hell be sent to prison naturally now does your friend know anything at all of this fellow  he knows him personally and intimately berkeley replied delighted to find that the card which had proved so bad a one at pilbury regis was turning up trumps in the more bohemian neighbourhood of the temple and fleet street he can give you any information you want about schurz or any of the rest of those people he has associated with them all familiarly for the last six or seven years  then he takes an interest in politics said mr lancaster  almost waking up now thats good again its so very difficult to find young men nowadays able to write who take a genuine interest in politics they all go off after literature and science and aesthetics and other dry  uninteresting subjects now what does your average intelligent daily paper reader care i should like to know about literature  and science and aesthetics and so forth well hell do ive very little doubt at any rate ill give him a trial  perhaps he might be able to undertake this great widgerly disenfranchising case stop hes poor isnt he i daresay hed just as soon not wait for his money for this social in the ordinary course he wouldnt get paid till the end of the quarter but ill give you a cheque to take back to him now perhaps he wants it poor fellow poor fellow he really looks very delicate depend upon it berkeley ill do anything on earth for him if only hell write tolerably  youre awfully good arthur said taking the proffered cheque gratefully im sure the money will be of great use to him and its very kind indeed of you to have thought of it  not at all not at allthe editor answered collapsing dreamily good morning good morning  at mrs hallisss lodgings in holloway edie was just saying to ernest over their simple tea i wonder what theyll give you for it ernest and ernest had just answered big with hope well i should think it would be quite ten shillings but i shouldnt be surprised edie if it was as much as a pound when the door opened and in walked arthur berkeley with a cheque in his hand which he laid by edies teacup edie took it up and gave a little cry of delight and astonishment ernest caught it from her hand in his eagerness and gazed upon it with dazed and swimming vision did he read the words aright and could it be really pay e le breton esq or order three guineas three guineas three guineas three real actual positive gold and silver guineas it was almost too much for either of them to believe and all for a single mornings light labour  what a perfect eldorado of wealth and happiness seemed now to be opening out unexpectedly before them  so much arthur berkeley his own eyes glistening too with a sympathetic moisture saw and heard before he went away in a happier mood and left them to their own domestic congratulations but he did not see or know the reaction that came in the dead of night after all that days unwonted excitement to poor sickening weary overburdened ernest  even edie never knew it all for ernest was careful to hide it as much as possible from her knowledge but he knew himself though he would not even light the candle to see it that he had got those three glorious guineasthe guineas they had so delighted inwith something more than a mornings labour he had had to pay for them not figuratively but literally with some of his very lifeblood    chapter xxv  hard pressed   a week or two later while the primate of fiji was still running vigorously at the ambiguities theatre arthur berkeleys second opera the duke of bermondsey or the bold buccaneers of the isle of dogs was brought out with vast success and immense exultation at the marlborough  there is always a strong tendency to criticise a little severely the second work of a successful beginner people like to assume a knowing air and to murmur selfcomplacently that they felt sure from the beginning he couldnt keep up  permanently to his first level but in spite of that natural tendency of the unregenerate human mind and in spite too of a marked political bias on the authors part the duke of bermondsey took the town by storm almost as completely as the primate of fiji had done before it  everybody said that though the principles of the piece were really quite atrocious when one came to think of them seriously yet the music and the dialogue were crisp and brisk enough to float any amount of social or economical heresy that that clever young man mr arthur berkeley might choose to put into one of his amusing and original operas  the social and economical heresies of course were partly due to ernest le bretons insidious influence at the same time that berkeley was engaged in partially converting ernest ernest was engaged in the counter process of partially converting berkeley to say the truth the conversion  was not a very difficult matter to effect the neophyte had in him implicitly already the chief saving doctrines of the socialistic faith or if one must put it conversely the germs of the disease were constitutionally implanted in his system and only needed a little external encouragement to cring the poison out fully in the most virulent form of the complaint the great point of the duke of bermondsey consisted in the ridiculous contrast it exhibited between the wealth dignity and selfimportance of the duke himself and the squalid miserable shrinking poverty of the eastend  purlieus from which he drew his enormous revenues  ernest knew a little about the eastend from practical experience he had gone there often with ronald on his rounds of mercy and had seen with his own eyes those dens of misery which most people have only heard or read about  it was ernest who had suggested this light satirical treatment  of the great social problem whose more serious side he himself had learnt to look at in max schurzs revolutionary salon and it was to ernest that arthur berkeley owed the first hint of that famous scene where the young countess of coalbrookdale converses familiarly on the natural beauties of healthful labour with the chorus of intelligent colliery hands in the most realistic of grimy costumes from her fathers estates in staffordshire the stalls hardly knew whether to laugh or frown when the intelligent colliers respectfully invited the countess in her best ascot flounces and furbelows to enjoy the lauded delights of healthful mine labour in propriâ personâ but they quite recovered their good humour when the band of theatrical buccaneers got up by the duke in spanish costumes with intent to deceive his lawless tenants in the eastend came unexpectedly face to face with the genuine buccaneers of the isle of dogs clothed in real costermonger caps and secondhand pilotjackets of the marinestoredealers fashionable pattern  it was all only the ridiculous incongruity of our actual society represented in the very faintest shades of caricature upon the stage but it made the incongruities more  incongruous still to see them crowded together so closely in a single concentrated tableau unthinking people laughed uproariously at the fun and nonsense of the piece thinking people laughed too but not without an uncomfortable side twinge of conscientious remorse at the pity of it all some wise heads even observed with a shrug that when this sort of thing was applauded upon the stage the fine old institutions  of england were getting into dangerous contact with these pernicious continental socialistic theories and no doubt those good people were really wise in their generation  when figaro came arthur berkeley said himself to ernest the french revolution wasnt many paces behind on the track of the ages  better even than the primate mr berkeley said hilda tregellis as she met him in a london drawingroom a few days later what a delightful scene that of the countess of coalbrookdale youre doing real good i do believe by making people think about these things more seriously you know as poor dear mr le breton would have said youve got an ethical purposeisnt that the wordunderlying even your comic operas by the way do you ever see the le bretons now poor souls i hear theyre doing very badly the elder brother herbert le bretonhorrid wretchhes here tonight going to marry that pretty miss faucit they say daughter of old mr  faucit the candlemakerno not candles soap i think it isbut it doesnt matter twopence nowadays does it  well as i was saying youre doing a great deal of good with characters like this countess of coalbrookdale we want more mixture of classes dont we more free intercourse between them more familiarity of every sort for my part now i should really very much like to know more of the inner life of the working classes if only hed ask me to go to lunch she thought with his dear old father the superannuated shoemaker so very romantic really  but arthur only smiled a sphinxlike smile and answered lightly you would probably object to their treatment of you as much as the countess objected to the uupleasant griminess  of the toorealistic coal galleries suppose you were to fall into the hands of a logical old radical workman for example who tore you to pieces mentally speaking with a shake or two of his big teeth and calmly informed you that in his opinion you were nothing more than a very emptyheaded  pretentious ignorant young womanperhaps even after the plainspoken vocabulary of hie kind a regular downright minx and hussey  charming lady hilda answered with perfect candour so very different from the senseless adulation of all the hughs and guys and berties what i do love in talking to clever men mr berkeley is their delicious frankness and transparency if they think one a fool they tell one so plainly or at least they let one see it without any reserve  now that you know is really such a very delightful trait in clever peoples characters  i dont know how you can have had the opportunity of judging lady hilda arthur answered looking at her handsome open face with a momentary glance of passing admirationhilda tregellis was improving visibly as she maturedfor no one can possibly ever have thought anything  of the sort with you im certain and that i can say quite candidly without the slightest tinge of flattery or adulation  what you dont think me a fool mr berkeley cried lady hilda delighted even with that very negative bit of favourable appreciation now that i call a real compliment  i assure you because i know you clever people pitch your standard of intelligence so very very high you  consider everybody fools im sure except the few people who are almost as clever as you yourselves are however to return to the countess i do think there ought to be more mixture of classes in england and somebody told methis  was a violent effort to be literary on hildas part by way of rising to the height of the occasionsomebody told me that mr matthew arnold whos so dreadfully satirical and cultivated and so forth thinks exactly the same thing you know why shouldnt the countess of coalbrookdale have really married the foreman of the colliers i daresay shed have been a great deal happier with a kindhearted sensible man like him than with that lumbering hunting pheasantshooting horseracing lout of a lord coalbrookdale  who would go to norway on a fishing tour without hernow  wouldnt she  very probably berkeley answered but in these matters we dont regard happiness onlythat you see would be mere base vulgar commonplace utilitarianismwe  regard much more that grand impersonal overruling entity that unseen code of social morals which we  commonly call the convenances proper people dont take happiness into consideration at all comparatively they act religiously after the fashion that the convenances impose upon them  ah but why mr berkeley lady hilda said vehemently why should the whole world always take it for granted that because a girl happens to be born the daughter of people whose names in the peerage she must necessarily be the slave of the proprieties devoid of all higher or better instincts why should they take it for granted that shes destitute of any appreciation for any kind of greatness except the kind thats represented by a million and a quarter in the three per cents or a greatgreatgrandfather who fought at the battle of naseby why maynt she have a spark of originality why maynt she be as much attracted by literature by science by art by by by beautiful music as say the daughter of a lawyer a doctor or or or a country shopkeeper what i want to know is just this mr berkeley if people dont believe in distinctions of birth why on earth should they suppose that lady mary or lady betty or lady winifred must necessarily be more banale and vulgarminded and commonplace than plain miss jones or miss brown or miss robinson you admit that these other girls may possibly care for higher subjects then why on earth shouldnt we can you tell me  certainly arthur berkeley answered looking down into lady hildas beautiful eyes after a dreamy fashion certainly theres no inherent reason why one person shouldnt have just as high tastes by nature as another  everything depends i suppose upon inherited qualities variously mixed and afterwards modified by society and educationits very hot here tonight lady hilda isnt it  very lady hilda echoed taking his arm as she spoke  shall we go into the conservatory  i was just going to propose it myself berkeley said with a faint tremor thrilling in his voice she was a very beautiful woman certainly and her unfeigned appreciation of his plays and his music was undeniably very flattering to him  unless i bring him fairly to book this evening hilda thought to herself as she swept with him gracefully into the conservatory i shall have to fall back upon the redhaired hurlyburlying scotch professor after allif i dont want to end by getting into the clutches of one of those horrid monties or algies    chapter xxvi  irreclaimable   the occasional social articles for the morning intelligence supplied ernest with work enough for the time being to occupy part of his leisure and income enough to keep the ship floating somehow if not securely at least in decent fairweather fashion his frequent trips with ronald into the eastend gave him something comparatively fresh to write about and though he was compelled to conceal his own sentiments upon many points in order to conform to that impersonal conscience the policy of the paper he was still able to deal with subjects that really interested him and in which he fancied he might actually be doing a little good a few days after he had taken seriously to the new occupation good mrs halliss made her appearance in the tiny sittingroom one morning and with many apologies and much humming and hawing ventured to make a slight personal representation to wondering little edie  if you please mum she said nervously fumbling all the while with the corner of the table cloth she was folding on the breakfasttable if i might make so bold mum without offence i should like to say as me an john as been talkin it hover an we think now as your good gentleman as so much writin to do at is littery work mum as i may make bold to call it perhaps you wouldnt mind so as not to disturb im with the blessed babynot as that dear child couldnt never disturb nobody bless er dear eart the darling not even when shes cryin shes that sweet and gentlebut we thought mum as littery gentlemen likes to ave the coast clear in the manner of speakin and perhaps you wouldnt mind bein so good as to use the little front room upstairs mum for a sort o nursery as i may call it for the dear baby it was our bedroom that was where john an me used to sleep but weve been an putt our things into the front hattic mum as is very nice and comfortable in every way so as to make room for the dear baby an if you wont take it as a liberty mum me an john ud be moren glad if youd kindly make use of that there room for a sort of occasional nursery for the dear baby  edie bit her lip hard in her momentary confusion oh dear mrs halliss she said almost crying at the kindly meant offer im afraid we cant afford to have three rooms all for ourselves as things go at present how much do you propose to charge us for the additional nursery  charge you for it mum mrs halliss echoed almost indignantly charge our lodgers for any little hextry accommodation like the small front room upstairs mumnow  dont you go and say that to john mum i beg of you for is tempers rather short at times mum thro boin asmatic and the rheumatiz though you wouldnt think it to look at im that you wouldnt an im reely afraid mum he might get angry if anybody was to holler im anythink for a little bit of hextry accommodation like that there lord bless your dear eart mum dont you say nothink more about that i beg of you for if john was to ear of it hed go off in a downright tearin tantrum at the bare notion an about dinner mum youll ave the cold mutton an potatoes and a bit of biled beetroot and ill just run round to the  greengrocers this moment to order it for early dinner and before edie had time to thank her the good woman was out of tha room again and down in the kitchen at her daily  preparations with tears trickling slowly down both her hard red cheeks in her own motherly fashion  so from that time forth ernest had the small sittingroom  entirely to himself whenever he was engaged in his literary labours while edie and dot turned the front bedroom  on the first floor into a neat and commodious nursery  as other work did not turn up so rapidly as might have been expected and as ernest grew tired after a while of writing magazine articles on the great social problem which were invariably declined with thanks so promptly as to lead to a wellfounded suspicion that they had never even been opened by the editor he determined to employ his spare time in the production of an important economical volume a treatise on the ultimate ethics of a labouring community to be entitled the final rule of social right living this valuable economical work he continued to toil at for many months in the intervals of his other occupations and when at last it was duly completed he read it over at full length to dear little edie who considered it one of the most profoundly logical and convincing political treatises ever written the various leading firms however to whom it was afterwards submitted with a view to publication would appear oddly enough to have doubted its complete suitability  to the tastes and demands of the reading public in the present century for they invariably replied to ernests inquiries that they would be happy to undertake its production for the trilling sum of one hundred guineas payable in advance but that they did not see their way to accepting the risk and responsibility of floating so speculative a volume on their own account in the end the unhappy manuscript after many refusals was converted into cockboats hats and paper dollies for little dot and its various intermediate reverses need enter no further into the main thread of this history it kept ernest busy in the spare hours of several months and prevented him from thinking too much of his own immediate prospects in his dreams for the golden future of humanity and insomuch it did actually subserve some indirectly useful function but on the other hand it wasted a considerable quantity of valuable tenpenny foolscap and provided him after all with one more severe disappointment to put on top of all the others to which he was just then being subjected clearly the reading public took no paying interest in political economy or if they did then the article practically affected by the eternal laws of supply and demand was at least not the one meted out to them from the enthusiastic  schurzian pen of ernest le breton  one afternoon not long after ernest and edie had taken rooms at mrs hallisss they were somewhat surprised at receiving the honour of a casual visit from a very unexpected and unusual quarter ronald was with them talking earnestly over the prospects of the situation when a knock came at the door and to their great astonishment the knock was quickly followed by the entrance of herbert he had never been there before and ernest felt sure he had come now for some very definite and sufficient purpose and so he had indeed it was a strange one for him but herbert le breton was actually bound upon a mission of charity  we have all of us our feelings no doubt and herbert le breton too in his own fashion had his ernest was after all a good fellow enough at bottom and his own brother a man cant for very rospectabilitys sake let his own brother go utterly to the dogs if he can possibly help it and so herbert had made up his mind much against his natural inclination to warn ernest of the danger he incurred in having anything more to do or say with this insane disreputable old schurz fellow for his own part he hated giving advice people never took it and that was a deadly offence against his amour propre and a gross insult to his personal dignity but still in this case for ernests sake he determined after an inward struggle to swallow his own private scruples and make an effort to check his brother on the edge of the abyss not that he would come to the point at once herbert was a careful diplomatic agent and he didnt spoil his hand by displaying all his cards too openly at the outset he would begin upon comparatively indifferent subjects and lead round the conversation gradually to the perils and errors of pure schurzianism so he set out by admiring his nieces fat armsa remarkable stretch of kindliness on herberts part for of course other peoples babies are well known to be really the most uninteresting objects in the whole animate universeand then he passed on by natural transitions to ernests housekeeping arrangements and to the prospects of journalism  as a trade and finally to the necessity for a journalist to consult the tastes of his reading public and by the way ernest he said quietly at last of course after this row at pilbury youll drop the acquaintance of your very problematical german socialist  edie started in surprise what herr schurz she said eagerly dear simple kindly old herr schurz oh no herbert that im sure he wont ernest will never drop his acquaintance whatever happens  herbert coughed drily then there are two of them for me to contend against he said to himself with an inward smile i should really hardly have expected that now  one would have said a priori that the sound commonsense and practical regard for the dominant feelings of society which is so justly strong in most women would have kept her at any ratewith her own social disabilities toofrom aiding and abetting her husband in such a piece of egregious follyim sorry to hear it mrs le breton he went on aloudhe never called her by her christian name and edie was somehow rather pleased that he didnt for you know herr schurz is far from being a desirable acquaintance  quite apart from his own personal worth of coursewhich is a question that i for my part am not called upon to decidehes a snare and a stumblingblock in the eyes of society and very likely indeed to injure ernests future prospects as he has certainly injured his career in the past you know hes going to be tried in a few weeks for a seditious libel and for inciting to murder the emperor of russia now you will yourself admit mrs le breton that its an awkward thing to be mixed up with people who are tried on a criminal charge for inciting to murder of course we all allow that the czars a very despotic and autocratic sovereign that his existence is an anomaly and that the desire to blow him up is a very natural desire for every intelligent russian to harbour privately in the solitude of his own bosom if we were russians ourselves no doubt wed try to blow him up too if we could conveniently do so without detection so much every rational englishman who isnt blinded by  prejudice or frightened by the mere sound of words must at once frankly acknowledge but unfortunately you see the mass of englishmen are blinded by prejudice and are frightened by the mere sound of words to them blowing up a czar is murder though of course blowing up any number of our own black people isnt and inciting to blow up the czar or doing what seems to most englishmen equivalent to such incitement as for example saying in print that the czars government isnt quite ideally perfect and ought gradually and tentatively to be abolishedwhy that i say is a criminal offence and is naturally punishable by a term of imprisonment now is it worth while to mix oneself  up with people like that ernest when you can just as easily do without having anything on earth to say to them  edies face burnt scarlet as she listened but ernest only answered more quietlyhe never allowed anything that herbert said to disturb his equanimitywe dont think alike upon this subject you know herbert and im afraid the disagreement is fundamental it doesnt matter so much to us what the world thinks as what is abstractly right and edie would prefer to cling to herr schurz through good report and evil report rather than to be applauded by your mass of englishmen for having nothing to do with inciting to murder we know that herr max never did anything of the kind that he is the gentlest and best of men and that in russian affairs he has always been on the side of the more merciful methods as against those who would have meted out to the czar the harsher measure of pure justice  well herbert answered bravely with a virtuous determination not to be angry at this open insult to his own opinion but to persevere in his friendly efforts for his brothers sake we wont take herr max into consideration at all but will look merely at the general question the fact is ernest youve chosen the wrong side the environment  is too strong for you and if you set yourself up against it itll crush you between the upper and the nether millstone it isnt your business to reform the world its your business to live in it and if you go on as youre doing now it strikes me that youll fail at the outset in that very  necessary first particular  if i fail ernest answered with a heavy heart i can only die once and after all every man can do no more than till to the best of his ability the niche in nature that he finds already cut out for him by circumstances  my dear ernest herbert continued quietly twisting himself a cigarette with placid deliberateness as a  preliminary to his departure your great mistake in life is that you will persist in considering the universe as a cosmos  now the fact is it isnt a cosmos its a chaos and a very poor one at that  ah yes ernest answered gravely nobody recognises that fact more absolutely than i do but surely its the duty of man to try as far as in him lies to cosmise his own particular  little corner of it  in the abstract certainly as a race most distinctly so but as individuals why the things clearly impossible  there was one man who once tried to do it and his name was don quixote  there was another i always thought ernest replied more solemnly and after his name weve all been taught as children to call ourselves christians at bottom my ideal is only the christian ideal  but my dear fellow dont you see that the survival of the fittest must succeed in elbowing your ideal for the present at least out of existence look here ernest youre going the wrong way to work altogether for your own happiness  and comfort it doesnt matter to me of course you can do as you like with yourself and i oughtnt to interfere with you but i do it because im your brother and because i take a certain amount of interest in you accordingly now i quite grant with you that the worlds in a very unjust social condition at present im not a fool and i cant help seeing that wealth is very badly distributed and that happiness is very unequally meted but i dont feel called upon to make myself the martyr of the cause of readjustment for all that if i were a working man i should take up the side that youre taking up now i should have everything to gain and nothing to lose by it but your mistake is just this that when you might identify your own interests with the side of the haves as i do you go out of your way to identify them with the side of the havenots out of pure idealistic utopian philanthropy you belong by birth to the small and intrinsically weak minority of persons specially gifted by nature and by fortune and why do you lay yourself  out with all your might to hound on the mass of your inferiors till they trample down and destroy whatever gives any special importance interest or value to intellectual superiority vigour of character political knowledge or even wealth i can understand that the others should wish to do this i can understand that they will inevitably do it in the long run but why on earth do you of all men want to help them in pulling down a platform on which you yourself might if you chose stand well above their heads and shoulders  because i feel the platforms an unjust one ernest answered warmly  an excellent answer for them herbert chimed in in his coldest and calmest tone but a very insufficient one for you the injustice if any tells all in your own favour  as long as the mob doesnt rise up and tear the platform down as it will one day why on earth should you be more anxious about it than they are  because herbert if there must be injustice i would rather suffer it than do it  well go your own way herbert answered with a calm smile of superior wisdom go your own way and let it land you where it will for my part i back the environment  but its no business of mine i have done my best to warn you liberavi animam meam you wont take my advice and i must leave you to your own devices and with just a touch of the hand to edie and a careless nod to his two brothers he sauntered out of the room without  another word as usual he thought to himself as he walked down the stairs i go out of my way to give good advice to a fellowcreature and i get only the black ingratitude of a snubbing in return this is really almost enough to make even me turn utterly and completely selfish  i wonder ernest said ronald looking up as herbert shut the door gently behind him how you and i ever came to have such a brother as herbert  i think its easy enough to understand ronald on plain hereditary principles  ronald sighed i see what you mean he said its poor mothers strainthe whitaker straincoming out in him  i often fancy ronald i can see the same two strains in varying intensity running through all three of us alike in herbert the whitaker strain is uppermost and the le breton comparatively in abeyance in me theyre both more or less blended in you the le breton strain comes out almost  unadulterated yet even herbert has more of a le breton in him than one might imagine for hes with us intellectually its the emotional side only thats wanting to him even when members of a family are externally very much unlike one another in the mere surface features of their characters i believe you can generally see the family likeness underlying it for all that  only you must know how to analyse the character to see it said edie i dont think it ever struck me before that there was anything in common between you and herbert ernest and yet now you point it out i believe there really is something after all im sorry you told me for i cant bear to think that youre like herbert  oh no ronald put in hastily it isnt ernest who has something in him like herbert its herbert who has something  in him like ernest theres a great deal of difference between the one thing and the other besides he hasnt got enough of it edie and ernest has    chapter xxvii  ronald comes of age   strange ronald le breton thought to himself as he walked along the embankment between westminster and waterloo some weeks laterthe day of herr maxs triali had a sort of impulse to come down here alone this afternoon i felt as if there was an unseen hand somehow impelling me  depend upon it one doesnt have instincts of that sort utterly for nothing the finger that guides us guides us always aright for its own wise and unfathomable purposes what a blessing and a comfort it is to feel that ones steps are  continually directed from above and that even an afternoon stroll through the great dreary town is appointed to us for some fit and sufficient reason look at that poor girl over there now at the edge of the embankment i wonder what on earth she can have come here for whyhow pale and excited she looks whats she going so near the edge for gracious heavens it cant beyesit is  no no but still it must bethats what the finger was guiding me here for this afternoon theres no denying it  the poor creatures tempted to destroy herself my instinct tells me so at once and it never tells me wrong oh  inscrutable wisdom help me help me give me light to act rightly i must go up this very moment and speak to her  the girl was walking moodily along the edge of the bank and looking in a dreamy fashion over the parapet into the sullen fastflowing brown water below an eye less keen than ronalds might have seen in a moment from her harassed weary face and her quick glance to right and left after the disappearing policeman that she was turning over in her own mind something more desperate than any common everyday venture ronald stepped up to her hastily and firm in his conviction that the finger was guiding him aright spoke out at once with boldness on the mere strength of his rapid instinctive conjecture  stop stop he said laying his hand gently on her shoulder not for a moment i beg of you not for a moment not till youve at least told me what is your trouble  selah turned round sharply and looked up in his face with a vague feeling of indefinable wonder what do you mean she asked in a husky voice dont do what  how do you know i was going to do anything  you were going to throw yourself into the riverronald answered confidently or at least you were debating about it in your own soul i know you were because a sure guide tells me so  selahs lip curled a little at the sound of that familiar language and suppose i was she replied defiantly in her reckless fashion suppose i was whats that to you or anybody i should like to know are you your brothers keeper as your own bible puts it well yes then perhaps i was going to drown myself and if i choose as soon as your backs turned i shall go and do it still so there and thats all i have to say about it  ronald turned his face towards her with an expression of the intensest interest but before he could put in a single word selah interrupted him  i know what youre going to say she went on looking up at him rebelliously i know what youre going to say every bit as well as if youd said it youre one of these city missionary sort of people you are and youre going to tell me its awfully wicked of me to try and destroy myself and aint i afraid of a terrible hereafter ugh i hate and detest all that mummery  ronald looked down upon her in return with a sort of silent wondering pity awfully wicked he said slowly awfully wicked how meaningless how incomprehensible  awfully wicked to be friendless or poor or wretched or unhappy awfully wicked to be driven by despair or by heartlessness to such a pitch of misery or frenzy that you want to fling yourself wildly into the river only to be out of it all anywhere in a minute why you poor unhappy girl how on earth can you possibly help it  there was something in the tone of his earnest voice that melted for a moment even selah briggss pride and vehemence  it was very impertinent of him to try and interfere with her purely personal business no doubt but he seemed to do so in a genuinely kindly rather than in a fussy interfering spirit  at any rate he didnt begin by talking to her that horrid cant about the attempt to commit suicide being so extremely wicked if he had done that selah would have felt it was not only an unwarrantable intrusion upon her liberty of action but a grotesque insult to her natural intelligence as well  ive a right to drown myself if i choose she faltered out leaning faintly as she spoke against the parapet and nobody else has any possible right to hinder or prevent me  if you people make laws against my rights in that matter i shall set your laws aside whenever and wherever it happens to suit my personal convenience  exactly so ronald answered in the same tone of gentle and acquiescent persuasion i quite agree with you its as clear as daylight that every individual human being has a perfect right to put an end to his own life whenever it  becomes irksome or unpleasant to him and nobody else has any right whatever to interfere with him the prohibitions that law puts upon our freedom in that respect are only of a piece with the other absurd restrictions of our existing  unchristian legislationas opposed to the spirit of the word as the old rule that made us bury a suicide at four cross roads with a hideously barbarous and brutal ceremonial theyre all mere temporary survivals from a primitive paganism the truth shall make us free but though we maynt rightly interfere we may surely inquire in a brotherly spirit of interest whether it isnt possible for us to make life less  irksome for those who unhappily want to get rid of it after all the causes of our discontent are often quite removable  tell me at least what yours are and let me see whether im able to do anything towards removing them  selah hung back a little sullenly this was a wonderful mixture of tongues that the strange young man was talking in when he spoke about the right and wrong of suicide ethically considered it might have been herbert walters himself who was addressing her when he glided off sideways  to the truth and the word it might have been her primitive methodist friends at hastings in full meeting assembled and by the way he reminded her strangely somehow of herbert walters what manner of man could he be she wondered and what strange sort of new gospel was this that he was preaching to her  how do i know who you are she asked him carelessly  how do i know what you want to know my story for  perhaps youre only trying to get something out of me  trust me ronald said simply by faith we live you know only trust me  selah answered nothing  come over here to the bench by the garden ronald went on earnestly we can talk there more at our leisure  i dont like to see you leaning so close to the parapet its a temptation i know its a temptation  seiah looked at him again inquiringly she had never before met anybody so curious she fancied arent you afraid of being seen sitting with me like this she said on the embankment benches some of your fine friends might come by and wonder who on earth you had got here with you and indeed selahs dress had grown vory shabby and poorlooking during a long and often fruitless search for casual work or employment in london  but ronald only surveyed her gently from head to foot with a quiet smile and answered softly oh no theres no reason on earth why we shouldnt sit down and talk together and even if there were my friends all know me far too well by this time to be surprised at anything i may do when the hand guides me if you will only sit down and tell me your story i should like to see whether i could possibly do anything to help you  selah let him lead her in his gentle halfwomanly fashion to the bench and sat down beside him mechanically still she made no attempt to begin her pitiful story ronald suspected for a second some special cause for her embarrassment and ventured to suggest a possible way out of it perhaps he said timidly you would rather speak to some older and more fatherly man about it or to some kind lady if so i have many good friends in london who would listen to you with as much interest and attention as i should  the old spirit flared up in selah for a second as she answered quickly no no sir its nothing of that sort i can tell you as well as i can tell anybody if ive been unfortunate its been through no fault of my own thank goodness but only through the hardheartedness and  unkindness of other people id rather speak to you than to anyone else because i feel somehowwhy i dont knowas if you had something or other really good in you  i beg your pardon ronald said hastily for even  suggesting it but you see i often have to meet a great many people whove been unhappy through a great many different causes and that leads one occasionally for a time into  mistaken inferences let me hear all your history please and i firmly believe through the aid that never forsakes us i shall be able to do something or other to help you in your difficulties  thus adjured selah began and told her whole unhappy history through without pause or break into ronalds quietly sympathetic ear she told him quite frankly and fully how she had picked up the acquaintance of a young mr walters from oxford at hastings how this mr walters had led her to believe he would marry her how she had left her home hurriedly under the belief that he would be induced to keep his promise how he had thrown her over to her own devices and how she had ever since been trying to pick up a precarious livelihood for herself in stray ways as a sempstress work for which she wag naturally very illfitted and for which she had no introductions she slurred over nothing on either side of the story and especially she did not forget to describe the full measure of her troubles and trials from her methodist friends at hastings ronald shook his head sympathetically at this stage of the story  ah i know i know he muttered half under his breath nasty pious people very well meaning very devout very earnest one may be sure of itbut oh what terrible soulkilling people to live among i can understand all about it for ive met them oftensabbathkeeping folks preaching and praying folks worrying bothering fussyreligious folks formalists pharisees mintanise andcummin christians  awfully anxious about your soul and so forth and doing their very best to make you as miserable all the time as a slave at the torture i dont wonder you ran away from them  and i wasnt really going to drown myself you know when you spoke to me selah said quite apologetically i was only just looking over into the beautiful brown water and thinking how delicious it would be to fling oneself in there and be carried off down to the sea and rolled about for ever into pebbles on the shingle and there would be an end of one altogetheroh how lovely  very natural ronald answered calmly very natural  of course it would ive often thought the same thing myself  still one oughtnt if possible to give way to these impulses one ought to do all thats in ones power to prevent  such a miserable termination to ones divinely allotted existence after all it is his will you see that we should be happy  when selah had quite finished all her story ronald began drawing circles in the road with the end of his stick and perpending within himself what had better be done about it now that all was told him no work he said half to himself no money no food why why i suppose you must be hungry  selah nodded assent  will you allow me to offer you a little lunch he asked hesitatingly with something of herberts stately politeness  even in this last extremity ronald felt instinctively what was due to selah briggss natural sentiments of pride and delicacy he must speak to her deferentially as if she were a lady not give her alms as if she were a beggar  then for the first time that day selah burst suddenly into tears oh sir she said sobbing you are very kind to me  ronald waited a moment or two till her eyes were dry and then took her across the gardens and into gattis any other man might have chosen some other place of entertainment  under the circumstances but ronald in his perfect simplicity of heart looked only for the first shop where he could get selah the food she needed he ordered something hot hastily and when it came though he had had his own lunch already he played a little with a knife and fork himself for shows sake in order not to seem as if he were merely looking on while selah was eating these little touches of feeling were not lost upon selah she noticed them at once and recognised in what ernest would have called her aboriginal unregenerate vocabulary that she was dealing with a true gentleman  walters ronald said pausing a second with a bit of chop poised lightly on the end of his fork let me seewalters i dont know any man of that name myself but ive had two brothers at oxford and perhaps one of them could tell me who he is walterswalters you said your own name was miss briggs i think didnt you my names ronald le breton  how curious selah said colouring up im sure i remember mr walters talking more than once to me about his brother ronald  indeed ronald answered without even a passing tinge of suspicion that any man should give a false name to other people with intent to deceive was a thing that would never have entered into his simple headfar less that his own brother herbert should be guilty of such a piece of  disgraceful meanness  i think ronald went on as soon as selah had finished her lunch youd better come with me back to my mothers house for the present i suppose now youve talked it over a little you wont think of throwing yourself into the river any more for today youll postpone your intention for the present wont you adjourn it sine die till we can see what can be done for you  selah smiled faintly even with the slight fresh spring of hope that this chance rencontre had roused anew within her it seemed rather absurd and childish of her to have meditated suicide only an hour ago besides she had eaten and drunk since then and the profoundest philosophers have always frankly admitted that the pessimistic side of human nature is greatly mitigated after a good dinner  ronald called a hansom and drove up rapidly to epsilon terrace when he got there he took selah into the little back breakfast room regardless of the proprieties and began once more to consider the prospects of the future  is lady le breton in he asked the servant and selah noticed with surprise and wonder that this strange young mans mother was actually a lady of title as she called it to herself in her curious ordinary language  no sir the girl answered she have been gone out about an hour  then i must leave you here while i go out and get you lodgings for the present ronald said quietly you wont object to my doing that of course you can easily pay me back from your salary as soon as we succeed in finding you some suitable occupation let me see where can i put you for the next fortnight naturally you wouldnt like to live with religious people would you  i hate them selah answered vigorously  of course of course ronald went on as if to himself  perfectly natural she hates them so should i if id been bothered and worried out of my life by them in the way she has i hate them myselfthat kind or rather its wrong to say that of them poor creatures for they mean well they really mean well at bottom in their blundering formal pettifogging way they think they can take the kingdom of heaven not by storm but by petty compliances like servile servants who have to deal with a capricious  exacting master poor souls they know no better they measure the universe by the reflection in their muddy millpond nasty pious people is what i always call them nasty pious people little narrow souls trying hard to be christians  after their lights and only attaining after all to a sort of secondhand diluted judaism a religion of cupwashing and phylacteries and new moons and sabbaths and daily sacrifices however thats neither here nor there i wont hand you over miss briggs to any of those poor  benighted people no nor to any religious people at all it wouldnt suit you you want to be well out of it i know the very place for you there are the baumanns theyd be glad to let a room baumanns a german refugee and a friend of ernests a good man but a secularist they wouldnt bother you with any religion poor things they havent got any mrs baumanns an excellent womaneducated too no objection at all in any way to the  baumanns theyre people i like and respect immenselyevery good quality they have and im often grieved to think such excellent people should be deprived of the comfort and pleasure of believing but then sos my dear brother ernest and you know theyre none the worse for it apparently any of them indeed i dont know that theres anybody with whom i can talk more sympathetically on spiritual matters than dear ernest depend upon it most of the most spirituallyminded people nowadays are outside all the churches altogether  selah listened in blank amazement to this singular avowal of heterodox opinion from an obviously religious person  what ronald le breton could be she couldnt imagine and she thought with an inward smile of the very different way in which her friends at hastings would have discussed the spiritual character of a wicked secularist  just at that moment a latchkey turned lightly in the street door and two sets of footsteps came down the passage to lady le bretons little back breakfastroom  one set turned up the staircase the other halted for a second at the breakfastroom doorway then the door opened gently and herbert le breton and selah briggs stood face to face again in blank astonishment  there was a moments pause as selah rose with burning cheeks from the chair where she was sitting and neither spoke a word as they looked with eyes of mutual suspicion and dislike into each others faces at last herbert le breton turned with some acerbity to his brother ronald and asked in a voice of affected contempt who is this woman  this ladys name is miss briggs ronald answered pointedly but of course quite innocently  i neednt ask you who this man is selah said with bitter emphasis its herbert walters  a horrible light burst in upon ronald instantaneously as she uttered the name but he could not believe it he would not believe it it was too terrible too incredible no no he said falteringly turning to selah you must be mistaken this is not mr walters this is my brother herbert le breton  selah gazed into herberts slinking eyes with a concentrated expression of scorn and disgust then he gave me a false name she said slowly fronting him like a tigress  he gave me a false name it seems from the very beginning  all through the false wretch all through he actually meant to deceive me he laid his vile scheme for it beforehand  i never wish to see you again you miserable cur herbert le breton if thats your real name at last i never wish to see you again but im glad ive done it now by accident if it were only to inflict upon you the humiliation of knowing that i have measured the utmost depth of your infamy you mean common false scoundrel i have measured to the bottom the depth of your infamy  oh dont ronald said imploringly laying his hand upon her arm he deserves it no doubt but dont glory over his humiliation he had no need to ask whether she spoke the truth his brothers livid and scarlet face was  evidence enough against him  herbert however answered nothing he merely turned angrily to ronald i wont bandy words he said constrainedly  in his coldest tone with this infamous woman whom you have brought here on purpose to insult me but i must request you to ask her to leave the house immediately  your mothers home is no place to which to bring people of such a character  as he spoke the door opened again and lady le breton attracted by the sound of angry voices entered unexpectedly  what does all this riot mean herbert she asked  imperiously who on earth is this young woman that ronald has brought into my own house actually without my permission  herbert whispered a few words quietly into her ear and then left the room hurriedly with a stiff and formal bow to his brother ronald lady le breton turned round to the culprit severely  disgraceful ronald she cried in her sternest and most angry voice perfectly disgraceful you aid and abet this wretched creaturewhose object is only to extort money by false pretences out of your brother herbertyou aid and abet her in her abominable stratagems and you even venture to introduce her clandestinely into my own breakfastroom i wonder youre not ashamed of yourself what on earth can you mean by such extraordinary such  unchristian conduct go to your own room this moment sir and ask this young woman to leave the house immediately  i shall go without being asked selah said proudly her big eyes flashing defiance haughtily into lady le bretons  i dont know who you all may be or what this gentleman who brought me here may have to do with you but if you are in any way connected with that wretch herbert le breton who called himself herbert walters for the sake of deceiving me i dont want to have anything further to say to any of the whole pack of you please stand out of my way she went on to ronald and i shall have done with you all together this very instant i wish to god i had never seen a single one of you  no no not just yet please ronald put in hastily  you mustnt go just yet i implore you i beg of you till i have explained to my mother before you how this all  happened and then when you go i shall go with you though i have the misfortune to be the brother of the man who gave you a false name in order to deceive you i trust you will still allow me to help you as far as i am able and to take you to my german friends of whom i spoke to you  ronald lady le breton cried in her most commanding  tone you must have taken leave of your senses how dare you keep this person a moment longer in my house against my wish when even she herself is anxious to quit it  let her go at once let her go at once sir  no mother ronald answered firmly we are commanded  in the word to obey our parents in all things in the lord i think youve forgotten that proviso mother in the lord now mother i will tell you all about it and then in a rapid sketch ronald with his back planted solidly against the door told his mother briefly all he knew about selah briggs how he had found her how he had brought her home not knowing who she was and how she had recognised herbert as her unfaithful lover lady le breton when she saw that escape was practically impossible flung herself back in an easychair where she swayed herself backward and forward gently all the while without once lifting her eyes towards ronald and sighed impatiently from time to time audibly as if the story merely bored her as for poor selah she stood upright in front of ronald without a word looking neither to the right nor to the left and waiting eagerly for the story to be finished  when ronald had said his say lady le breton looked up at last and said simply with a pretended yawn now ronald will you go to your own room  i will not ronald answered in a soft whisper i will go with this lady to the rooms of which i have spoken to her  then lady le breton said coldly you shall not return here it seems im to lose all my children one after another by their extraordinary rebelliousness  by your own actyes ronald answered very calmly  you forgot that last thursday was my birthday i daresay mother but i didnt forget it it was and i came of age then im my own master now ive stopped here as long as i could mother because of the commandment but i cant stop here any longer i shall go to ernests for tonight as soon as ive got rooms for this lady  good evening lady le breton said bowing frigidly without another word  good evening mother ronald replied in his natural voice miss briggs will you come with me im very sorry that this unhappy scene should have been inflicted upon you against my will but i hope and pray that you wont have lost all confidence in my wish to help you in spite of these unfortunate accidents  selah followed him blindly in a dazzled fashion out on to the flagstones of epsilon terrace  dear me dear me moaned lady le breton sinking back vacantly once more with an air of resignation after her efforts into the easychair was there ever a mother so plagued and burdened with unnatural and undutiful sons as i am if it werent for dear herbert im sure i dont know what i should ever do between them ronald too who always pretended to be so very very religious to think that he should go and uphold the word of a miserable abandoned improper adventuress against his own brother herbert atrocious perfectly atrocious where on earth he can have picked up such a woman im positively at a loss to imagine but its exactly like his poor dear father i remember once when we were stationed at moozuffernugger in the northwest provinces with the 14th bengal poor owen absolutely insisted on taking up the case of some eurasian waman who pretended shed been badly treated by young walker of our regiment i call it quite improperalmost unseemlyto meddle in the affairs of such people i daresay herbert has had something or other to say to this horrid girl young men will be young men and in the army we know how to make allowances for that sort of thing but that ronald should positively think of bringing such a person into my breakfastroom is not to be heard of ronalds a pure le bretonthats undeniable thank goodness not a single one of the good whitaker points to be found in all his nature however poor dear sir owen in spite of all his nonsense was at least an officer and a gentleman whereas the nonsense these boys have picked up at oxford and among their german refugee people is both irreligious and i may even say indecent or to put it in the mildest way indecorous i wish with all my heart id never sent them to oxford ive always thought that if only ernest had gone in for a direct commission hed soon have got all that absurd revolutionary rubbish knocked out of him in a messroom  but its a great comfort to me to think i have one real blessing in dear herbert whos just such a son as any mother might well be thoroughly proud of in every way  while lady le breton was thus communing with herself in the breakfastroom and while herbert was trying to patch up a hollow truce with his own muchbruised selfrespect in his own bedroom ronald was taking poor dazed and wearied selah round to the refuge of the baumanns hospitable roof  as soon as that matter was temporarily arranged to the mutual satisfaction of all the parties concerned ronald walked over alone to ernests little lodgings at holloway  he would sleep there that night and send round a letter to amelia the housemaid in the morning asking her to pack up his things and forward them at once to mrs hallisss  for himself he did not propose unless circumstances  compelled it again to enter his mothers rooms except by her own express invitation after all he thought even his little income if clubbed with edie and ernests would probably help them all to live now in tolerable comfort  so he told edie all his story and edie listened to it with an approving smile i think dear ronald she said taking his hand in hers you did quite rightquite as ernest himself would have done under the circumstances  wheres ernest asked ronald half smiling at that naive wifely standard of right conduct  gone with mr berkeley to the trial edie answered  the trial what trial  oh dont you know herr maxs theyre trying him today for littering a seditious libel and inciting to murder the chief of the third section at st petersburg  but he said nothing at all ronald cried in astonishment  i read the article myself he said nothing that any englishman mightnt have said under the same circumstances  why i could have written the libel as they call it myself even and im not much of a politician either they cant ever be trying him in a country like england for  anything so ridiculously little as that  but they are edie answered quietly and dear ernests dreadfully afraid the verdict will go against him  nonsense ronald answered with natural confidence  no english jury would ever convict a man for speaking  up like that against an odious and abominable tyranny  very late in the afternoon ernest and berkeley returned  to the lodgings ernests face was white with excitement  and his lips were trembling violently with suppressed emotion his eyes were red and swollen edie hardly needed to ask in a breathless whisper of arthur berkeley what verdict  guilty arthur berkeley answered with a look of unfeigned  horror and indignation he had learnt by this time quite to take the communistic view of such questions  guilty ronald cried jumping up from his chair in astonishment impossible and what sentence  twelve months hard labour berkeley answered slowly and remorsefully  an atrocious sentence ronald exclaimed turning red with excitement an abominable sentence a most malignant and vindictive sentence who was the judge arthur  bassenthwaite berkeley replied half under his breath  and may the lord have mercy upon his soul said ronald solemnly  but ernest never said a single word he only sat down and ate his supper in silence like one stunned and dazzled  he didnt even notice ronalds coming and edie knew by his quick breath and his face alternately flushed and pallid that there would be another crisis in his gathering complaint before the next morning    chapter xxviii  tell it not in oath   as they sat silent in that little sittingroom after supper a double knock at the door suddenly announced the arrival of a telegram for ernest he opened it with trembling lingers  it was from lancastercome down to the office at once  schurz has been sentenced to a years imprisonment and we want a leader about him for tomorrow the telegram roused ernest at once from his stupefied lethargy here was a chance at last of doing something for max schurz and for the cause of freedom here was a chance of waking up all england to a sense of the horrible crime it had just  committed through the voice of its duly accredited judicial mouthpiece the country was trembling on the brink of an abyss and he ernest le breton might just be in time to save it the home secretary must be compelled by the unanimous clamour of thirty millions of free working people to redress the gross injustice of the law in sending max sohurz the greatest noblest and purestminded of  mankind to a common felons prison nothing else on earth could have moved ernest jaded and dispirited as he was at that moment to the painful exertion of writing a newspaper leader after the days fatigues and excitements except the thought that by doing so he might not only blot out this national disgrace as he considered it but might also help to release the martyr of the peoples rights from his incredible unspeakable punishment flushed and feverish though he was he rose straight up from the table handed the telegram to edie without a word and started off alone to hail a hansom cab and drive down immediately to the office arthur berkeley fearful of what might happen to him in his present excited state stole out after him quietly and followed him unperceived in another hansom at a little distance  when ernest got to the morning intelligence buildings  he was shown up at once into the editorial room he expected to find mr lancaster at the same white heat of indignation as himself but to his immense surprise he actually found him in the usual sleepy languid condition of apathetic impartiality i wired for you le breton the impassive editor said calmly because i understand you know all about this man schurz who has just got his twelve months imprisonment this evening i suppose of course youve heard already all about it  ive been at the trial all day ernest answered and myself heard the verdict and sentence  good mr lancaster said with a dreamy touch of approval in his tone thats good journalism certainly and very smart of you helps you to give local colour and realistic touches to the matter but you ought to have called in here to see me immediately we shall have a regular reporters report of the trial of course but reporters reports are fearfully and wonderfully lifeless if you like besides the leader you might work up a striking headed article on the scene in court this is an important case and we want something more about it than mere writing you know a little about the man himself and his personal history which berkeley tells me youre well acquainted with hes written something called gold and the proletariate or whatever it is just tell our readers all about it as to the leader say what you like in itof course i shall look over the proof and tone it down a bit to suit the taste of our publicwe appeal mainly to the mercantile middle class i need hardly say but you know the general policy of the paper and you can just write what you think best subject to subsequent editorial revision  get to work at once please as the articles are wanted immediately and send down slips as fast as theyre written to the printers  ernest could hardly contain his surprise at mr lancasters calmness under such unheardof circumstances when the whole laborious fabric of british liberties was tottering visibly to its basebut he wisely concluded to himself that the editor had to see articles written about every possible subject every eveningfrom a european convulsion to a fire at a theatreand that use must have made it in him a property of easiness when a mans obliged to work himself up perpetually into a state of artificial excitement about every railway accident explosion shipwreck earthquake or volcanic eruption in europe asia africa america and the islands of the pacific ocean why then ernest charitably said to himself his sympathies must naturally end by getting a trifle callous especially when hes such a very apathetic person to start with as this laconic editorial lancaster so he turned into the little bare box devoted to his temporary use and began writing with perfectly unexampled and extraordinary rapidity at his leader and his article about the injured and martyred apostle of the slighted communistic religion  it was only a few months since ernest had with vast toil and forethought spun slowly out his maiden newspaper article on the italian organboy and now he found himself to his own immense surprise covering sheet after sheet of paper in feverish haste with a long account of max schurzs splendid life and labours and with a really fervid and eloquent appeal to the english people not to suffer such a man as he to go helplessly and hopelessly to an english prison at the bare bidding of a foreign despot he never stopped for one moment to take thought or to correct what he had written in the excitement of the moment his pen travelled along over the paper as if inspired and he found the words and thoughts thronging his brain almost faster than his lagging hand could suffice to give them visible embodiment as each page was thrown off hurriedly he sent it down still pale and wet to the printers in the office and before two oclock in the morning he had full proofs of all he had written sent up to him for final correction it was a stirring and vigorous leader he felt quite certain himself as he read it over and he thought with a swelling breast that it would appear next day with all the impersonal authority of the morning intelligence stamped upon its face at ten thousand english breakfast tables where it might rouse the people in their millions to protest sternly before it was too late against this horrid violation of our cherished and boasted national hospitality  meanwhile arthur berkeley had stopped at the office and run in hastily for five minutes talk with the terrible editor dont say anything to shock le breton i beg of you lancaster he said about this poor man schurz who has just been sent for a year to prison its a very hard case and im awfully sorry for the man myself though thats neither here nor there i can see from your face that you for your part dont sympathise with him but at any rate dont say anything about it to hurt le bretons feelings hes in a dreadfully feverish and excited condition this evening max schurz has always been to him almost like a father and he naturally takes his sentence very bitterly to heart to tell you the truth i regret it a great deal myself i know a little of schurz through le breton and i know what a wellmeaning ardent enthusiastic person he really is and how much good actually underlies all his chaotic socialistic notions but at any rate i do beg of you dont say anything to further excite and hurt poor le breton  certainly not the editor answered smoothing his large hands softly one over the other certainly not though i confess as a practical man i dont sympathise in the least with this preposterous german refugee fellow so far as i can learn hes been at the bottom of half the revolutionary and insurrectionary movements of the last twenty yearsa regular outandout professional socialistic incendiary  you wouldnt say so berkeley replied quietly if youd seen more of him lancaster but being a man of the world and having come mainly on ernests account he didnt care to press the abstract question of herr maxs political sincerity any further  well the editor went on a little testily be that as it may i wont discuss the subject with your friend le breton whos really a nice enthusiastic young fellow i think as far as ive seen him ill simply let him write tonight whatever he pleases and make the necessary alterations in proof afterwards without talking it over with him personally at all thatll avoid any needless discussion and ruffling of his supersensitive communistic feelings poor fellow he looks very ill indeed tonight im really extremely sorry for him  when will he be finished asked arthur  at two the editor answered  ill send a cab for him arthur said therell be none about at that hour probably will you kindly tell him its waiting for him  at two oclock or a little after ernest drove home with his heart on fire full of eagerness and swelling hope for tomorrow morning he found edie waiting for him late as it was with a little bottle of winean unknown luxury at mrs hallisss lodgingsand such light supper as she thought he could manage to swallow in his excitement ernest drank a glass of the wine but left the supper untasted then he went to bed and tossed about uneasily till morning he couldnt sleep through his anxiety to see his great leader appear in all the added dignity of printers ink and rouse the slumbering world of england up to a due sense of max schurzs wrongs and the laws incomprehensible iniquity  before seven he rose very quietly dressed himself without saying a word and stole out to buy an early copy of the morning intelligence he got one at the small tobacconists shop round the corner where he had taken his first hint for the italian organboy leader it was with difficulty that he could contain himself till he was back in mrs hallisss little front parlour and there he tore open the paper eagerly and turned to the wellremembered words at the beginning of his desperate appealing article he could recollect the very run of every clause and word he had written no englishman can read without a thrill of righteous indignation it beganthe sentence passed last night upon max schurz the author of that remarkable economical work gold and the proletariate herr schurz is one of those numerous refugees from german despotism who have taken advantage of the hospitable welcome usually afforded by england to the oppressed of all creeds or nationsand so forth and so forth where was it now yes that was it in the place of honour of coursethe first leader under the clock in the morning intelligence his eye caught at once the opening keywords no englishman sinking down into the easychair by the flowers in the window he prepared to run it through at his leisure with breathless anxiety  no englishman can read without a feeling of the highest approval the sentence passed last night upon max schurz the author of that misguided economical work gold and the proletariate herr schurz is one of those numerous refugees from german authority who have taken advantage of the hospitable welcome usually afforded by england to the oppressed of all creeds or nations in order to hatch plots in security against the peace of sovereigns or governments with which we desire always to maintain the most amicable and cordial relations ernests eyes seemed to fail him the type on the paper swam wildly before his bewildered vision  what on earth could this mean it was his own leader indeed with the very rhythm and cadence of the sentences accurately preserved but with all the adjectives and epithets so ingeniously altered that it was turned into a crushing condemnation of max schurz his principles his conduct and his ethical theories from beginning to end the article appealed to the commonsense of intelligent englishmen to admire the dignity of the law in thus vindicating itself against the atrocious schemes of a dangerous and ungrateful political exile who had abused the hospitality of a great fres country to concoct vile plots against the persons of friendly sovereigns and innocent ministers on the european continent  ernest laid down the paper dreamily and leant back for a moment in his chair to let his brain recover a little from the reeling dizziness of that crushing disappointment then he turned in a giddy mechanical fashion to the headed article on the fourth page there the selfsame style of treatment met once more his astonished gaze all the minute facts as to max schurzs history and personality were carefully preserved the description of his simple artisan life his modest household his sunday evening receptions his great following of earnest and enthusiastic refugeesevery word of all this which hardly anyone else could have equally well supplied was retained intact in the published copy yet the whole spirit of the thing had utterly evaporated or rather had been perverted into the exact opposite unsympathetic channel where ernest had written enthusiasm lancaster had simply altered the word to fanaticism where ernest had spoken of herr maxs singlehearted devotion lancaster had merely changed the phrase into undisguised revolutionary ardour the whole paper was one long sermon against max schurzs utopian schemes imputing to him not only folly but even positive criminality as well we all know how we all in england look upon the foreign political refugeea man to be hit again with impunity because he has no friends but to ernest who had lived so long in his own little socialistic set the discovery that people could openly say such things against his chosen apostle at the very moment of his martyrdom was a hideous and blinding disillusionment he put the paper down upon the table once more and buried his face helplessly between his burning hands  the worst of it all was this if herr max ever saw those articles he would naturally conclude that ernest had been guilty of the basest treachery and that too on the very day when he most needed the aid and sympathy of all his followers with a thrill of horror he thought in his own soul that the great leader might suspect him for an hour of being the venal judas of the little sect  how ernest ever got through that weary day he did not know himself nothing kept him up through it except his burning indignation against lancasters abominable conduct  about eleven oclock arthur berkeley called in to see him  im afraid youve been a little disappointed he said about the turn lancaster has given to your two articles  he told me he meant to alter the tone so as to suit the policy of the paper and i see hes done so very thoroughly  you cant look for much sympathy from commonplace cold calculating englishmen for enthusiastic natures like herr maxs  ernest turned to him in blank amazement he had expected berkeley to be as angry as himself at lancasters shameful mutilation of his appealing leader and he found now that even berkeley accepted it as an ordinary incident in the course of journalistic business his heart sank within him as he thought how little hope there could be of herr maxs liberation when even his own familiar friend berkeley looked upon the matter in such a casual careless fashion  i shall never write another word for the morning intelligence he cried vehemently after a moments pause  if we starve for it i shall never write another word in that wicked abominable dishonourable paper i can die easily enough heaven knows without a murmur but i cant be disloyal to dear herr max and to all my innate ingrained principles  dont say that ernest berkeley answered gently  think of mrs le breton and the baby the luxury of starvation for the sake of a cause is one you might venture to allow yourself if you were alone in the world as i am but not one which you ought to force unwillingly upon your wife and children youve been getting a trifle more practical of late under the spur of necessity dont go and turn  impossible again at the supreme moment whatever happens its your plain duty to go on writing for the morning intelligence you say with your own hand only what you think and believe yourself the editor alone is responsible for the final policy of the paper  ernest only muttered slowly to himselfnever never never  still though the first attempt had failed ernest did not wholly give up his hopes of doing something towards the release of herr max from that unutterable imprisonment  he drew up a form of petition to the home secretary in which he pointed out the reasons for setting aside the course of the law in the case of this particular political prisoner  with feverish anxiety he ran about london for the next two days trying to get influential signatures to his petition and to rouse the people in their millions to demand the release of the popular martyr alas for the stolid indifference of the british public the people in their millions sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play exactly as if nothing unusual in any way had happened most of them had never heard at all of herr max or of gold and the proletariate and those who had heard understood for the most part that he was a bad lot who was imprisoned for trying nefariously to blow up the emperor of rooshia crowds of people nightly besieged the doors of the ambiguities and the marlborough to hear the fate of the primate of fiji and the duke of bermondsey but very few among the millions took the trouble to sign their names to ernest le bretons despairing petition even the advanced radicals of the marketplace the men who figured largely at trafalgar square meetings and agricultural labourers unions feared to damage their reputation for moderation and sobriety by getting themselves mixed up with a continental agitator like this man schurz that people were talking about the irish members expressed a pious horror of the very word dynamite the workingman leaders hemmed and hawed and regretted their inability in their very delicate position to do anything which might seem like countenancing russian nihilism in the end ernest sent in his petition with only half a dozen unknown signatures and the home secretarys private prompter threw it into the wastepaper basket entire  without even taking the trouble to mention its existence to his harassed and overburdened chief just a marylebone communist refugee in prison how could a statesman with half the bores and faddists of england on his troubled hands find time to look at uninfluential petitions about an  insignificant worthless nobody like that  so gentle noblenatured learned herr max went to prison and served his year there uncomplainingly like any other social malefactor and society talked about his case with languid interest for nearly a fortnight and then  straightway found a new sensation and forgot all about him but there are three hundred and sixtyfive days of twentyfour hours each in every year and for every one of those days herr max and herr maxs friends never forgot for an hour together that he was in prison  and at the end of the week ernest got a letter from lancaster enclosing a cheque for eight guineas that is a vast sum of money eight guineas just think of all the bread and meat and tea and clothing one can buy with it for a small family my dear le breton the editor wrotein his own hand too a rare honour for he was a kindly man and he had learned much to his surprise from arthur berkeley that ernest was angry at his treatment of the schurzian leader my dear le breton i enclose cheque for eight guineas for your two articles i hope you didnt mind the way i was obliged to cut them up in some unessential  details so as to suit the policy of the paper i kept whatever was really most distinctive as embodying special information in them you know we are above all things strictly moderate please send us another social shortly  it was a kind letter undoubtedly a kind and kindlymeant letter but ernest flung it from him as though he had been stung by a serpent or a scorpion then he handed the cheque to edie in solemn silence to see what she would do with it he merely wanted to try her constancy for himself  he would have felt like a judas indeed if he had taken and used their thirty pieces of silver  edie looked at the cheque intently and sighed a deep sigh of regret how could she do otherwise they were so very poor and it was such an immense sum of money then she rose quietly without saying a word and lighted a match from the box on the mantelpiece she held the cheque firmly between her finger and thumb till it was nearly burnt end let it drop slowly at last into the empty fireplace ernest rose up and kissed her tenderly the leaden weight of the thirty pieces of silver was fairly off their united conscience  they had made what reparation they could for the evil of that unhappy undesigned leader after all ernest had wasted the last remnant of his energy on one eventful evening all for nothing  as edie sat looking wistfully at the smouldering fragments  of the burnt cheque ernest roused her again by saying quietly todays saturday have we got anything for tomorrows dinner edie  nothing edie answered simply how much money have you left ernest  sixpence ernest said without needing to consult his empty purse for confirmationhe had counted the pence as they went too carefully for that already edie im afraid we must go at last to the poor mans banker till i can get some more money  oh ernestnotnotnot the pawnbroker  yes edie the pawnbroker  the tears came quickly into edies eyes but she answered nothing they must have food and there was no other way open before them they rose together and went quietly into the bedroom there they gathered together the few little trinkets and other things that might be of use to them and ernest took down his hat from the stand to go out with them to the pawnbrokers  as he turned out he was met energetically on the landing by a stout barricade from good mrs halliss no sir not you sir the landlady said firmly trying to take the parcel from him as he went towards the door i beg your pardon sir for avin overeard what wasnt meant for me to ear no doubt but i couldnt elp it sir and john an me cant allow nothink of this sort we cant were used to this sort o things sir john and me is but you and the dear lady isnt used to em sir and didnt nought to be neither and john an me cant allow it not anyhow  ernest turned scarlet with shame but could say nothing  edie only whispered softly dear dear mrs halliss were so sorry but we cant help it  elp it maam said mrs halliss herself almost crying nor there aint no reason why you should try to elp it neither as i says to john john says i there aint no arm in it noways says i but i cant stand by says i and see them two poor dear young creechurs meanin no offence maam apawning of their own jewelry and things to go and pay for their sundays dinner and john e says says e quite right martha says e dont let em my dear says e the lord has prospered us a bit in our umble way martha says e and we aint got no cause to want we aint and if the dear lady and the good gentleman wouldnt take it as a liberty says e it ud be better they should just borrer a pound or two for a week from us says e beggin your pardon maam for intin of it than that there mr le breting as aint accustomed to such places nohow should go amakin acquaintance for the fust time of his life as you may say with the inside of a pawnbrokers shop says e john says i its my belief the lady and gentleman ud be insulted says i though they are the sweetest unassoominest young gentlefolk i ever did see says i if we were to go as tin them to accept the loan of money from the likes of you and me john as is no better by the side of them nor old servants in the manner o speakin insulted says e not a bit of it they neednt martha says e for i knows the ways of the aristocracy says e and i knows as theres many a gentleman  as owns is own osses and is own ounds as isnt afraid to borrer a pound or so from is own coachman or even from is own groomnot but what to borrer from a groom is lowerin says e in a tempory emergency mind you martha says e a tempory emergency is a thing as may appen to landed gentlefolks any day says e its like a ole in your coat made by a tear says e a haccident as may appen tomorrer to the prince of wales isself upon the untin field e says well then john says i ill just go an speak to em about it this very minnit says i and if i might make so bold maam without seemin too  presumptious i should be very glad if youd kindly allow me maam to lend mr le breting a few suvverins till e gets is next remittances maam  edie looked at ernest and ernest looked at edie and the landlady and then they all three burst out crying together without further apology perhaps it was the old adam left in ernest a little but though he could stand kindness from dr greatrex or from mr lancaster stoically enough he couldnt watch the humble devotion of those two honesthearted simple old servants without a mingled thrill of shame and tenderness mrs halliss he said catching up the landladys hard red hand gratefully in his own you are too good and too kind and too considerate for us altogether i feel we have done nothing to deserve such great kindness from you but i really dont think it would be right of us to borrow from you when we dont even know how long it may be before were able to return your money or whether we shall ever be able to return it at all were so much obliged to you so very very much obliged to you dear mrs halliss but i think we ought as a matter of duty to pawn these few little things rather than run into debt which weve no fair prospect at present of ever redeeming  has you please sir mrs halliss said gently wiping her eyes with her snowwhite apron for she saw at once that ernest really meant what he said not that john an me would think of it for a minnit sir so long as you wouldnt mind our takin the liberty but anyow sir we cant allow you to go out yourself and go to the pawnbrokers it aint no fit place for the likes of you sir a pawnbrokers aint in all that low company and i dont suppose youd rightly know ow much to hask on the articles neither john e aint afeard of goin an e says e insists upon it as es to go for e dont think sir for the honour of the ouse e says sir as a lodger of ours ought to be seen agoin to the pawnbrokers just you give them things right over to john sir and ell get you a better price on em by a long way nor theyd ever think of giving a gentleman like you sir  ernest fought off the question in a halfhearted fashion for a little while but mrs halliss insisted upon it and after a short time ernest gave way for to say the truth he had very vague ideas himself as to how he ought to proceed in a pawnbroking expedition mrs halliss ran down the kitchen stairs quickly for fear he should change his mind as soon as her back was turned and called out gaily to her husband in the first delight of her unexpected triumph  john she cried drat that man where is e john dear you just putt your at on and purtend to run round the corner a bit to astons the pawnbrokers the lord have mercy upon me for the stories ive been atellin of em but i couldnt bear to see them two pore things apawnin their little bits of jewelry and sich and mr le breting too im as aint fit to go knockin together with underbred folks like pawnbrokers so i told im as youd take em round and pawn em for im yourself not as i dont suppose youve never pawned nothink in your ole life john leastways not since ever you an me kep company for afore that i suppose you was purty much like other young men is john for all you shakes your ead at it now so innocent like  but you just run round theres a dear and make as if you was goin to the pawnbrokers and then you come straight ome again unbeknown to em i aint a goin to let them two pore dears go pawnin their things for a dinner nohow  you take them two suvverins out of your box john and putt away these ere little things for the present time till the pore souls is able to pay us and if they never dont small matter neither now you go fast john theres a dear and come back and mind you give them two suvverins to mr le breting as natural like as ever youre able  pawn em john said in a pitying voice no indeed it aint come to that yet i should ope that they need go apawnin their effects while weve got a suvverin or two laid by in our box martha not as anybody need be ashamed of pawnin on occasions for that matteri dont say as a reglar thing but now an then on occasions as you may call it for even in the best dookal families ive eard tell they do sometimes ave to pawn the dimonds so that pawnin aint in the runnin noways bless you as respects gentility  not as id like to go into a pawnshop myself martha as ive always been brought up respectable but when you send for mr hattenborough to your own ressydence and say quite commandin like er grace ud be obleeged if youd wait upon er in belgrave square to hinspeck er dimonds as i want to raise the wind on em why thats quite another matter natrally  when honest john came back in a few minutes and handed the two sovereigns over to ernest he did it with such an unblushing face as might have won him applause on any stage for its perfect naturalness lor bless your eart sir he said in answer to ernests shamefaced thanks touching the place where his hat ought to be mechanically it aint nothing sir that aint if it werent for the dookal families of england sir its my belief the pawnbrokin business wouldnt be worth mentioning in the manner o speakin  that evening ernest paced up and down the little parlour rather moodily for half an hour with three words ringing perpetually in his dizzy earsthe never never never he had used so short a tune since about the morning  intelligence he must get money somehow for dot and edie he must get money somehow to pay good mrs  halliss for their board and lodging there was only one way possible fight against it as he would in the end he must come back to that inevitable conclusion at last he sat down with a gloomy face at the centre table and pulled out a sheet of blank foolscap  what are you going to do ernest edie asked him  ernest groaned im writing a social for the morning intelligence edie he answered bitterly  oh ernest edie said with a face of horror and surprise  not after the shameful way theyve treated poor max schurz  ernest groaned again theres nothing else to be done edie he said looking up at her despondently i must earn money somehow to keep the house going  it is the business of the truthful historian to narrate facts not to palliate or extenuate the conduct of the various actors  whether ernest did right or wrong at least he did it he wrote a playful social for mondays morning intelligence and carried it into the office on sunday afternoon himself beause there was no postal delivery in the london district  that night he lay awake once more for hours together tossing and turning and reflecting bitterly on his own  baseness and his final moral downfall herbert was right after all the environment was beginning to conquer he could hold out no longer herr max was in prison the world was profoundly indifferent he himself had fallen away like peter and there was nothing left for him now but to look about and find himself a dishonourable grave  and dot and edie what was to become of them after ah me for the pity of it when a man cannot even crawl quietly into a corner and die in peace like a dog without being tortured by fears and terrors beforehand as to what will come to those he loves far better than life when he himself is quietly dead and buried out of the turmoil    chapter xxix  a man and a maid   if ernest and edie had permitted it ronald le breton would have gone at once after his coming of age to club income and expenditure with his brothers household but as edie justly remarked when he proposed it such a course would pretty nearly have amounted to clubbing his income with their expenditure and even in their last extreme of poverty that was an injustice which neither she nor her husband could possibly permit ronald needed all his little fortune for his own simple wants and though they themselves  starved they couldnt bear to deprive him of the small luxuries which had grown into absolute necessaries for one so feeble and weak indeed ill as ernest himself now was he had never outgrown the fixed habit of regarding ronald as the invalid of the family and to have taken anything though in the direst straits from him would have seemed like robbing the helpless poor of their bare necessities so ronald was fain at last to take lodgings for himself with a neighbour of good mrs hallisss and only to share in ernests troubles to the small extent of an occasional loan which edie would have repaid to time if she had to go without their own poor little dinner for the sake of the repayment  meanwhile ronald had another interest on hand which to his enthusiastic nature seemed directly imposed upon him by the finger of providenceto provide a home and occupation  for poor selah whom herbert had cast aside as a legacy to him as soon as he had got settled down to his own new mode of life in the holloway lodgings he began to look about for a fit place for the homeless girla place he thought to himself which must combine several special advantages plenty of workshe wanted that to take her mind off brooding good honest upright people and above all no religion ronald recognised that last undoubted requirement as of absolutely paramount importance shell stand any amount of talk or anything else from me he said to himself often because she knows im really in earnest but she wouldnt stand it for a moment from those wellmeaning undiscriminating religious busybodies who are so awfully anxious about other peoples souls though they never seem for a single minute to consider in any way other peoples feelings after a little careful hunting among his various acquaintances however he found at last a place that would exactly suit selah at a stationers in netting hill and there he put herwith full confidence that selah would do the work entrusted to her well and ably if not from conscientiousness at least from personal pride which after all roland soliloquised dreamily is as good a  substitute for the genuine article as one can reasonably expect to find in poor fallen human nature  i wish mr le breton selah said quite timidly for her maidenly reserve it must be admitted was not one of selah briggss strong points that i wasnt going to be quite so far from you as notting hill if i could see you sometimes you know i should feel that it might keep me more straightkeep me away from the river in future i mean i cant stand most peoples preaching but somehow your preaching seems to do me more good than harm really which is just the exact opposite way it seems to me from everybody elses  ronald smiled sedately im glad you want to see me sometimes he said with a touch of something very like gallantry in his tone that was wholly unusual with him i shall walk over every now and then and look you up at your lodgings over yonder and besides you can come on sundays to dear edies and i shall be able to meet you there once a fortnight or thereabouts but im not going to let you call me mr le breton any longer it isnt friendly and whats more it isnt christian why should there be these artificial barriers between soul and soul eh selah i shall call you selah in future it seems more genuine and heartfelt and unencumbered with needless  conventions than your misters and misses after all why should we keep up such idle formalities between brethren and fellowworkers  selah started a littleshe knew better than ronald  himself did what such first advances really led to oh mr le breton she said quickly i really cant call you ronald i can never call any other man by his christian name as long as i live afteryour brother  you mistake me selah ronald put in hastily with his quaint gravity i mean it merely as a sign of  confidence and a mark of christian friendship sisters call their brothers by their christian names dont they so there can be no harm in that surely it seems to me that if you call me mr le breton youre putting me on the footing  of a man merely if you call me ronald youre putting me on the footing of a brother which is really a much more harmless and unequivocal position for me to stand in do please selah call me ronald  im afraid i cant selah answered i darent i mustnt but she faltered a little for a moment  notwithstanding  you must selah ronald said with all the force of his enthusiastic nature fixing his piercing eyes full upon her  you must i tell you call me ronald  very wellronald selah said at last after a long pause goodbye now i must be going goodbye and thank you thank you thank you there was a tear quivering even in selah briggss eye as she held his hand lingeringly a moment in hers before releasing it he was a very good fellow really and he had been so very kind too in interesting himself about her future  what a marvellous thread of sameness ronald thought to himself as he walked back rapidly to his solitary lodgings runs through the warp and woof of a single family after all what an underlying unity of texture there must be throughout in all its members however outwardly dissimilar  they may seem to be from one another one would say at first sight there was very little if anything in common between me and herbert and yet this girl interests  me wonderfully of course im not in love with herthe notion of my falling in love with anybody is clearly too ridiculous but im attracted by her drawn towards her fascinated as it were i feel a sort of curious spell upon me whenever i look into her deep big eyes flashing out upon one with their strange luminousness it isnt merely that the hand has thrown her in my way that counts for something no doubt but not for everything besides the hand doesnt act blindlynay rather acts with supreme wisdom surpassing the powers or the comprehension of man when it threw selah briggs in my way depend upon it it was because the infinite saw in me something that was specially adapted to her and in her something that was specially adapted to me the instrument is duly shaped by inscrutable wisdom for its own proper work now whatever interests me in her must have also interested herbert in her equally and for the same reason were drawn towards her clearly she exercises over both of us some curious electric power that she doesnt exercise  presumably over other people for herbert must have been really in love with hernot that im in love with her of course but still the phenomena are analogous even if on a slightly different planeherbert must have been really in love with her im sure or such a prudent man as he is would never have let himself get into what he would  consider such a dangerous and difficult entanglement yes clearly theres something in selah briggs that seems to possess a singular polarity as ernest would call it for the le breton character and individuality  and then it cuts both ways too for selah was once desperately in love with herbert of that im certain she must have been to judge from the mere strength of the final revulsion shes a girl of intensely deep passionsi like people to have some depth to their character even if its only in the way of passionand shed never have loved him at all without loving him fervently and almost wildly hers is a fervent wild indomitable nature yes she was certainly in love with herbert and now though of course i dont mean to say shes in love with me i hope it isnt wrong to think in this way about an unmarried girl still i cant help seeing that i have a certain influence over her in returnthat she pays much attention to what i say and think considers me a person worth considering which she doesnt do im sure with most other people ah well theres a vast deal of truth no doubt in these new hereditary  doctrines of darwins and galtons that herbert and ernest talk about so much a familys a family thats certain not a mere stray collection of casual acquaintances  how the likeness runs through the very inmost structure of our hearts and natures i see in selah very much what herbert saw in selah selah sees in me very much what she saw in herbert extraordinary insight into human nature men like darwin and galton have to be sure and david too what a marvellous thinker he was really what  unfathomed depths of meaning lie unexpected in that simple sentence of his i am fearfully and wonderfully made fearfully and wonderfully indeed when one remembers that from one father and mother herbert and i have both been compounded so unlike in some things that we scarcely seem to be comparable with one another look at herberts splendid intellect beside mine so like in others that selah briggsgoodness gracious what am i thinking of i was just going to say that selah briggs falls in love first with one of us and then with the other i do hope and trust it isnt wrong of me to fill my poor distracted head so much with these odd thoughts about that unfortunate girl selah    chapter xxx  the environment finally triumphs   winter had come and on a bitter cold winters night ernest le breton once more received an unexpected telegram asking him to hurry down without a moments delay on important business to the morning intelligence office  the telegram didnt state at all what the business was it merely said it was urgent and immediate without in any way specifying its nature ernest sallied forth in some perturbation  for his memories of the last occasion when the morning  intelligence required his aid on important business were far from pleasant ones but for edies sake he felt he must go and so he went without a murmur  sit down le breton mr lancaster said slowly when ernest entered the matter i want to see you abouts a very peculiar one i understand from some of my friends that youre a son of sir owen le breton the indian general  yes i am ernest answered wondering within himself to what end this curious preamble could possibly be leading up if theres any one profession he thought which is absolutely free from the slightest genealogical interest in the persons of its professors surely that particular calling ought to be the profession of journalism  well so i hear le breton now i believe im right in saying am i not that it was your father who first subdued and organised a certain refractory hilltribe on the tibetan frontier known as the bodahls wasnt it  quite right ernest replied with a glimmering idea slowly rising in his mind as to what mr lancaster was now driving at  ah thats good very good indeed certainly well tell me le breton do you yourself happen to know anything on earth about these precious insignificant people  i know all about them ernest answered quickly ive read all my fathers papers and despatches and seen his maps and plans and reports in our house at home from my boyhood upward i know as much about the bodahls in fact as i know about bayswater or holborn or fleet street  capital capital the editor said fondling his big hands softly thatll exactly suit us and could you get at these plans and papers now this very evening just to refresh the gaps in your memory  i could have them all down here ernest answered at an hours notice  good the editor said again ill send a boy for them with a cab meanwhile youd better be perpending this telegram from our simla correspondent just received its going to be the question of the moment and we should very much like you to give us a leader of a full column about the matter  ernest took the telegram and read it over carefully it ran in the usual very abbreviated newspaper fashion  russian agents revolted bodahls tibetan frontier advices peshawur state russian army marching on merv bodahls attacked commissioner declared independence british raj  will you write us a leader the editor asked simply  ernest drew a long breath three guineas edie dot an empty exchequer if he could only have five minutes to make his mind up but he couldnt after all what did it matter what he said about these poor unknown bodahls if he didnt write the leader somebody else who knew far less about the subject than he did would be sure to do it he wasnt responsible for that impalpable entity the policy of the paper beside the great social power of the morning intelligence of the united english people what was he ernest le breton but a miserable solitary misplaced unit one way or the other he could do very little indeed for good or for evil after half a minutes internal struggle he answered back the editor faintly yes i will for edie he muttered half audibly to himself i must do it for dear edie  and youll allow me to make whatever alterations i think necessary in the article to suit the policy of the paper the editor asked once more looking through him with his sleepy keen grey eyes you see le breton i dont want to annoy you and i know your own principles are rather peculiar but of course all we want you for is just to give us the correct statement of facts about these outlandish people  all that concerns our own attitude towards them as a nation falls naturally under the head of editorial matter you must see yourself that its quite impossible for us to let any one single contributor dictate from his own standpoint the policy of the paper  ernest bent his head slowly youre very kind to argue out the matter with me so mr lancaster he said trembling with excitement yes i suppose i must bury my scruples  ill write a leader about these bodahls and let you deal with it afterwards as you think proper  they showed him into the bare little back room and sent a boy up with a hastily written note to ronald for the maps and papers there ernest sat for an hour or two writing away for very life and putting on paper everything that he knew about the poor bodahls by two oclock the proofs had all come up to him and he took his hat in a shamefaced manner to sally out into the cold street where he hoped to hide his rising remorse and agony under cover of the solitary night he knew too well what the policy of the paper would be to venture upon asking any questions about it as he left the office a boy brought him down a sealed envelope from mr lancaster with his usual kindly thoughtfulness the editor had sent him at once the customary cheque for three guineas ernest folded it up with quivering  fingers and felt the blood burn in his cheeks as he put it away in his waistcoat pocket that accursed money for it he had that night sold his dearest principles and yet not for it not for it not for itoh no not for it but for dot and edie  the boy had a duplicate proof in his other hand and ernest saw at once that it was his own leader as altered and corrected by mr lancaster he asked the boy whether he might see it and the boy knowing it was ernests own writing handed it to him at once without further question  ernest did not dare to look at it then and there for fear he should break down utterly before the boy he put it for the moment into his inner pocket and buttoned his thin overcoat  tightly around him it was colder still in the frosty air of early morning and the contrast to the heated atmosphere of the printing house struck him with ominous chill as he issued slowly forth into the silent precincts of unpeopled fleet street  it was a terrible memorable night that awful tuesday the coldest night known for many years in any english winter snow lay deep upon the ground and a few flakes were falling still from the cloudy sky for it was in the second week of january the wind was drifting it in gusty eddies down the long streets and driving the drifts before it like whirling dust in an august storm not a cab was to be seen anywhere not even a stray hansom crawling home from clubs or theatres and ernest set out with a rueful countenance to walk as best he might alone through the snow all the way to holloway it is a long and dreary trudge at any time it seemed very long and dreary indeed to ernest le breton with his delicate frame and weak chest battling against the fierce wind on a dark and snowy winters night and with the fever of a great anxiety and a great remorse silently torturing his distracted bosom at each step he took through the snow he almost fancied himself a hunted bodahl would british soldiers drive those poor savage women and children to die so of cold and hunger on their snowy hilltops would english fathers and mothers at home at their ease applaud the act with careless  thoughtlessness as a piece of our famous spirited foreign policy  and would his own article written with his own poor thin cold fingers in that days morning intelligence help to spur them on upon that wicked and unnecessary war what right had we to conquer the bodahls what right had we to hold them in subjection or to punish them for revolting  and above all what right had he ernest le breton upon whose head the hereditary guilt of the first conquest ought properly to have weighed with such personal heavinesswhat right had he of all men directly or indirectly to aid or abet the english people in their immoral and inhuman resolve  oh god his sin was worse than theirs for they sinned thinking they did justly but as for him he sinned against the light he knew the better and bribed by gold he did the worse at that moment the little slip of printed paper in his waistcoat pocket seemed to burn through all the frosts of that awful evening like a chain of molten steel into his very marrow  trudging on slowly through the white stainless snow step by stepsnow that cast a sheet of pure white even over the narrow lanes behind the farringdon roadcold at foot and hot at heart he reached at last the wide corner by the angel at islington the lights in the windows were all out long ago of course but the lamps outside were still flaring brightly and a solitary policeman was standing under one of them trying to warm his frozen hands by breathing rapidly on the curved and distorted fingers ernest was very tired of his tramp by that time and emboldened by companionship he stopped awhile to rest himself in the snow and wind under the opposite lamplight putting his back against the post he drew the altered proof of his article slowly out of his inner pocket it had a strange fascination for him and yet he dreaded to look at it with an effort he unfolded it in his stiff fingers and held the paper up to the light regardless of the fact that the policeman was watching his proceedings with the interest naturally due from a man of his profession to a suspiciouslooking character who was probably a convicted pickpocket the first sentence once more told him the worst there was no doubt at all about it the three guineas in his pocket were the price of blood  the insult to british prestige in the east ran that terrible opening paragraph implied in the brief telegram which we publish this morning from our own correspondent at simla calls for a speedy and a severe retribution it must be washed out in blood blood blood blood the letters swam before his eyes it was this then that he the disciple of peaceloving max schurz the hater of war and conquest the foe of unjust british domination over inferior racesit was this that he had helped to make plausible with his special knowledge and his ready pen oh heaven what reparation could he make for this horrid crime he had knowingly and wilfully committed what could he do to avoid the guilt of those poor savages blood upon his devoted head in one moment he thought out a hundred scenes of massacre and pillagescenes such as he knew only too well always precede and accompany the blessings of british rule in distant  dependencies the temptation had been strongthe money had been sorely wantedthere was very little food in the house but how could he ever have yielded to such a depth of premeditated wickedness he folded the piece of paper into his pocket once more and buried his face in his hands for a whole minute the policeman now began to suspect that he was not so much a pickpocket as an escaped lunatic  and so he was no doubt of course we who are practical men of the world know very well that all this foolish feeling on ernest le bretons part was very womanish and weak and overwrought that he ought to have done the work that was set before him asking no questions for conscience sake and that he might honestly have pocketed the three guineas letting his supposed duty to a few naked brown people somewhere  up in the indian hillcountry take care of itself as all the rest of us always do but some allowance must naturally be made for his peculiar temperament and for his particular state of health consumptive people are apt to take a somewhat  hectic view of life in every way they lack the commonsense ballast that makes most of us able to value the lives of a few hundred poor distant savages at their proper infinitesimal  figure at any rate ernest le breton as a matter of fact rightly or wrongly did take this curious standpoint about things in general and did then and there turn back through the deep snow all his soul burning within him fired with dire remorse and filled only with one ideahow to prevent this wicked article to which he had contributed so many facts and opinions from getting printed in tomorrows paper true it was not he who had put in the usual newspaper platitudes about the might of england and the insult to the british flag and the immediate necessity for a stern retaliation but all that vapouring wicked talk as he thought it would go forth to the world fortified by the value of his special facts and his obviously intimate acquaintance  with the whole past history of the bodahl people so he turned back and battled once more with the wind and snow as far as fleet street and then he rushed excitedly into the morning intelligence office and asked with the wildness of despair to see the editor  mr lancaster had gone home an hour since the porter said but mr wilks the subeditor was still there  superintending the printing of the paper and if ernest liked mr  wilks would see him immediately  ernest nodded assent at once and was forthwith ushered up into mr wilkss private sanctum the subeditor was a dry grizzlybearded man with a prevailing wolfish greyness of demeanour about his whole person and he shook ernests proffered hand solemnly in the dreary fashion that is always begotten of the systematic transposition of night and day  for heavens sake mr wilks ernest cried imploringly i want to know whether you can possibly suppress or at least alter my leader on the bodahl insurrection  mr wilks looked at him curiously as one might look at a person who had suddenly developed violent symptoms of dangerous insanity suppress the bodahl leader he said slowly like one dreaming suppress the bodahl leader  impossible why its the largest type heading in the whole of todays paper is this bodahl business shocking  outrage upon a british commissioner on the indian frontier  revolt of the entire bodahl tribe russian intrigue in central asia dangerous position of the viceroy at simla oh dear me no not to have a leader upon that my dear sir would be simply suicidal  but cant you cut out my part of it at least ernest said anxiously oh mr wilks you dont know what ive suffered tonight on account of this dreadful unmerited leader its wicked its unjust its abominable and i cant bear to think that i have had anything to do with sending it out into the world to inflame the passions of unthinking people do please try to let my part of it be left out and only mr lancasters at least be printed  mr wilks looked at him again with the intensest suspicion  a subeditor he answered evasively has nothing at all to do with the politics of a paper the editor alone manages that department on his own responsibility but what on earth would you have me do i cant stop the machines for half an hour can i just to let you have the chance of doctoring your leader if you thought it wrong to write it you ought never to have written it now its written it must certainly stand  ernest sank into a chair and said nothing but he turned so deadly pale that mr wilks was fain to have recourse to a little brown flask he kept stowed away in a corner of his desk and to administer a prompt dose of brandy and water  there there he said in the kindest manner of which he was capable what are you going to do now you cant be going out again in this state and in this weather can you  yes i am ernest answered feebly im going to walk home at once to holloway  to holloway the subeditor said in a tone of comparative horror oh no i cant allow that wait here an hour or two till the workmens trains begin running or stay lancaster left his brougham here for me tonight as i have to be off early tomorrow on business ill send you home in that and let hawkins get me a cab from the mews by order  ernest made no resistance and so the subeditor sent him home at once in lancasters brougham  when he got home in the early grey of morning he found edie still sitting up for him in her chair and  wondering what could be detaining him so long at the newspaper office he threw himself wildly at her feet and in such broken sentences as he was able to command he told her all the pitiful story edie soothed him and kissed him as he went along but never said a word for good or evil till he had finished  it was a terrible temptation darling she said softly a terrible temptation indeed and i dont wonder you gave way to it but we mustnt touch the three guineas as you say rightly its bloodmoney  ernest drew the cheque slowly from his pocket and held it hesitatingly a moment in his hand edie looked at him curiously  what are you going to do with it darling she asked in a low voice as he gazed vacantly at the last dying embers in the little smouldering fireplace  nothing edie dearest ernest answered huskily folding  it up and putting it away in the drawer by the window  they neither of them dared to look the other in the face but they bad not the heart to burn it boldly it was bloodmoney to be sure but three guineas are really so very useful  four days later little dot was taken with a sudden illness  ernest and edie sat watching by her little cradle throughout the night and saw with heavy hearts that she was rapidly growing feebler poor wee soul they had nothing to keep her for it would be better perhaps if she were gone and yet the human heart cannot be stifled by such calm deliverances of practical reason it will let its hot emotions overcome the cold calculations of better and worse supplied it by the unbiassed intellect  all night long they sat there tearfully fearing she would not live till morning and in the early dawn they sent round hastily for a neighbouring doctor they had no money to pay him with to be sure but that didnt much matter they could leave it over for the present and perhaps some day before long ernest might write another social and earn an honest three guineas anyhow it was a question of life and death and they could not help sending for the doctor whatever difficulty they might afterwards find in paying him  the doctor came and looked with the usual professional seriousness at the baby patient did they feed her entirely on london milk he asked doubtfully yes entirely ah  then that was the sole root of the entire mischief she was very dangerously ill no doubt and he didnt know whether he could pull her through anyhow but if anything would do it it was a change to goats milk there was a man who sold goats milk round the corner he would show ernest where to find him  ernest looked doubtfully at edie and edie looked back again at ernest one thought rose at once in both their minds they had no money to pay for it with exceptexcept that dreadful cheque for four days it had lain  burning a hole in ernests heart from its drawer by the window and he had not dared to change it now he rose without saying a word and opened the drawer in a solemn hesitating fashion he looked once more at edie inquiringly edie nodded a faint approval ernest pale as death put on his hat and went out totteringly with the doctor he stopped on the way to change the cheque at the bakers where they usually dealt and then went on to the goats milk shop  how that sovereign he flung upon the counter seemed to ring the knell of his seifrespect the man who changed it noticed the strangeness of ernests look and knew at once he had not come by the money honestly he rang it twice to make sure it was good and then gave the change to ernest but dot at least was saved that was a great thing the milk arrived duly every morning for some weeks and after a severe struggle dot grew gradually better  while the danger lasted neither of them dared think much of the cheque but when dot had got quite well again ernest was concious of a certain unwonted awkwardness of manner in talking to edie he knew perfectly well what it meant they were both accomplices in crime together  when ernest wrote his social after max schurzs affair he felt he had already touched the lowest depths of degradation he knew now that he had touched a still lower one oh horrible abyss of selfabasementhe had taken the bloodmoney and yet it was to save dots life  herbert was right after all quite right yes yes all hope was gone the environment had finally triumphed  in the awful selfreproach of that deadly remorse for the acceptance of the bloodmoney ernest le breton felt at last in his heart that surely the bitterness of death was past it would be better for them all to die together than to live on through such a life of shame and misery ah peter peter you are not the only one that has denied his lord and master  and yet ernest le breton had only written part of a newspaper leader about a small revolt of the bodahls and he suffered more agony for it than many a sensitive man even has suffered for the commission of some obvious crime  i say berkeley lancaster droned out in the lobby of their club one afternoon shortly afterwards what on earth am i ever to do about that socialistic friend of yours le breton i cant ever give him any political work again you know just fancy first you remember i set him upon the schurz imprisonment business and he nearly went mad then because i didnt back up schurz for wanting to murder the emperor of russia after that just now the other day i tried him on the bodahl business and hang me if he didnt have qualms of conscience about it afterwards and trudge back through all the snow that awful tuesday to see if he couldnt induce wilks to stop the press and let him cut it all out at the last moment hes as mad as a march hare you know and if it werent that im really sorry for him i wouldnt go on taking socials from him any longer but i will ill give him work as long as hell do it for me on any terms though of course its obviously impossible under the circumstances to let him have another go at politics isnt it  youre really awfully kind lancaster berkeley answered warmly no other fellow would do as much for le breton as you do i admit hes absolutely impracticable but i would give more than i can tell you if only i thought he could be made to pull through somehow  impracticable the editor said shortly i believe you indeed why do you remember that ridiculous schurz business well i sent le breton a cheque for eight guineas for that lot and can you credit it its remained  uncashed from that day to this i really think he must have destroyed it  no doubt arthur answered with a smile and the bodahls what about them  oh he kept that cheque for a few days uncashedthough im sure he wanted money at the time but in the end im happy to say he cashed it  arthurs countenance fell ominously  he did he said gloomily he cashed it thats bad news indeed then i must go and see them tomorrow morning early im afraid they must be at the last pitch of poverty before theyd consent to do that and yet solomon says men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry and le breton after all has a wife and child to think of  lancaster stared at him blankly and turned aside to glance at the telegrams saying to himself meanwhile that all these young fellows of the new school alike were really quite too incomprehensible for a sensible practical man like himself to deal with comfortably    chapter xxxi  de profundis   after all ernest didnt get many more socials to write for the morning intelligence as it happened for the war that came on shortly after crowded such trifles as socials fairly out of all the papers and he had harder work than ever to pick up a precarious living somehow by the most casual possible contributions of course he tried many other channels but he had few introductions and then his views were really so absurdly ultra that no reasonable editor could ever be expected to put up with them he got tired at last of seeing his wellmeant papers return to him  morning after morning with the unvarying legend declined with thanks and he might have gone to the wall utterly but for the kindly interest which arthur berkeley still took in his and edies future on the very day after his  conversation with lancaster at the club arthur dropped round casually at holloway and brought with him a proposal which he said had just been made him by a colonial newsagent  it was a transparent little ruse enough but ernest and edie were not learned in the ways of the world and did not suspect it so readily as older and wiser heads might probably have done would ernest supply a fortnightly letter to go by the australian mail to the paramatta chronicle and news containing london political and social gossip of a commonplace kindjust the petty chitchat he could pick up easily out of truth and the worldfor the small sum of thirty shillings a letter  yes ernest thought he could manage that  very well then the letter must be sent on alternate wednesdays to the colonial newsagents address and it would be duly forwarded by mail to the office of the paramatta  chronicle a little suspicious that item berkeley thought but ernest swallowed it like a child and made no comment it must be addressed to paramatta care of lane  co and the payments would be made fortnightly through the same agency arthur watched his friends face narrowly at this point again but ernest in his simpleminded unsuspecting wasy never noticed the obvious meaning of this little deception he thanked arthur over and over again for his kindness but he never guessed how far it  extended the letters kept him employed for two days a  week or thereabouts and though they never got to paramatta nor any farther than arthur berkeleys own study in the little house he had taken for himself at chelsea they were regularly paid for through the colonial newsagents by means of a cheque which really owed its ultimate origin to arthur berkeley himsslf fifteen shillings a week is not a large fortune certainly but still it is considerably better than nothing when you come to try both methods of living by practical experience  even so however ernest and edie had a hard struggle with their habits of life and ernests delicate health to make both ends meet upon that modest income they found the necessity for recourse to the imaginary  pawnbroker growing upon them with alarming rapidity and though the few small articles that they sent out for that purpose never really went beyond kind mrs hallisss kitchen dresser yet so far as ernest and edie were concerned the effect was much the same as if they had been really pledged to the licensed broker the good woman hid them away carefully in the back drawers of the dresser sending up as much money for the poor little trinkets as she thought it at all credible that any man in his senses could possibly advanceif she had given altogether too much she thought it probable that even the unsuspicious le bretons would detect the kindly deceptionat the time remarking to john that if ever them pore dear young creechurs was able to redeem em again why well an good an if not why they could just find some excuse to give em back to the dear lady after pore mr le breting was dead an gone as he must be no doubt afore many months was over what wretched stuff that is that some narrowminded cynics love to talk after their cheap moralising fashion about the coldness and cruelty of the world the world is not cold and cruel it is brimming over everywhere with kindliness and warmth of heart and you have only got to put yourself into the proper circumstances in order to call forth at once on every hand and in all classes its tenderest and truest sympathies none but selfish unsympathetic people themselves ever find it otherwise in the day of trouble it is not the world that is cold and heartlessit is not the individual members of the world that are cruel and unkindit is the relentless march of  circumstancesthe faulty organisation which none of us can  control and for which none of us is personally responsible that grinds us to powder under its juggernaut wheels  private kindliness is for ever trying feebly and unsuccessfully  but with its best efforts to undo the evil that general mismanagement is for ever perpetrating in its fateful course  one day a few weeks later arthur berkeley called in again and on the stairs he met a child playinga neighbours  child whom good mrs halliss allowed to come in and amuse herself while the mother went out charing the girl had a bright gold object in her hand and arthur wondering  how she came by it took it from her and looked at it curiously he recognised it in a moment for what it wasa gold bracelet a well remembered gold braceletthe very one that he himself had given as a wedding present to poor edie he turned it over and looked closely at the inside cut into the soft gold he saw the one word frustra that he himself had carved into it with his penknife the night before the memorable wedding  where did you get this he asked the child  mrs alliss give it me the little one answered beginning  to cry  arthur ran lightly down the steps again and knocked at the door of mrs hallisss kitchen with the telltale  bracelet in his hand mrs halliss opened the dcor to him respectfully and after a faint attempt at innocent prevarication  felt bound to let out all the pitiful little secret without further preamble so arthur good kindhearted delicatesouled arthur took his seat sadly upon one of the hard wooden kitchen chairs and waited patiently while mrs halliss and honest john in their roundabout inarticulate fashion slowly unfolded the story how them two pore young creechurs upstairs had been druv that low through want of funs that mrs le breting god bless er eart ad ad to pawn her poor little bits of jewelry and such like and how they adnt ad the face to go an pawn it for her and so ad locked it up in their drawers and waited hopefully for better times arthur listened to all this with an aching heart and went home alone to ponder on the best way of still further assisting them  the only thing that occurred to him was a plan for giving edie too a little relief in the way of what she might suppose to be moneygetting occupation she used to paint a little in watercolours he remembered in the old days so he put an advertisement in a morning paper which he got mrs halliss to show edie asking for drawings of orchids the flowers to be supplied and accurately copied by an amateur at a reasonable price edie fell into the harmless friendly trap readily enough and was duly supplied with orchids by a florist in regent street who professed to receive his instructions from the advertiser the pictures were all produced in due time and were sent to a fixed address where a gentleman in a hansom used to call for them at regular intervals arthur berkeley kept those poor little watercolours long afterwards locked up in a certain drawer all by themselves they were sacred mementoes to him of that old hopeless love for the little miss butterfly of his oxford days  with the very first three guineas that edie earned carefully saved and hoarded out of her payments for the watercolours she insisted in the pride of her heart that ernest should go and visit a great london consulting physician  sir antony wraxall was the best specialist in town on the subject of consumption she had heard and she was quite sure so clever a man must do ernest a great deal of good if he didnt even permanently cure him  its no use edie darling ernest said to her imploringly  youll only be wasting your hardearned money what i want is not advice or medicine i want what no doctor on earth can possibly give merelief from this terrible crushing responsibility  but edie would bear no refusal it was her money she said the first she had ever earned in her whole life and she should certainly do as she herself liked with it sir antony wraxall she was quite confident would soon be able to make him better  so ernest overborne by her intreaties yielded at last and made an appointment with sir antony wraxall he took his quarterhour in due form and told the great physician all his symptoms as though he believed in the foolish farce sir antony held his head solemnly on one side weighed him with puritanical scrupulosity to a quarter of an ounce on his delicate balance listened attentively at the chest with his silvermounted stethoscope and perpended the net result of his investigation with professional gravity then he gave edie his full advice and opinion to the maximum  extent of five minutes  your husbands case is not a hopeful one mrs le breton he said solemnly but still a great deal may be done for him edies face brightened visibly with care his life may be prolonged for many yearsi may even say indeed quite indefinitely edie smiled with joy and  gratitude but you must strictly observe my rules and  directionsthe same that ive just given in a similar case to the crown prince of servia who was here before you in the first place your husband must give up work altogether he must be content to live perfectly and absolutely idle then secondly he must live quite away from england i should recommend the engadine in summer and algeria or the nile trip every winter but if thats beyond your meansand i understand from mr le breton that youre in somewhat straitened circumstancesi dont object to catania or malaga or even mentone and the riviera you can rent furnished villas for very little on the riviera but he must in no case come farther north even in summer than the lake of geneva that i assure you is quite indispensable if he wishes to live another twelvemonth take him south at once in a coupélit of course and break the journey once or twice at lyons and marseilles next as to diet he must live generouslyvery generously dont let him drink claret clarets poor sour stuff a pint of good  champagne daily or a good fullbodied genial vintage burgundy would be far better and more digestible for him oysters game sweetbreads red mullet any little delicacy of that sort as much as possible dont let him walk let him have carriage exercise daily you can hire carriages for a mere trifle monthly at cannes and mentone above all things give him perfect freedom from anxiety allow him to concentrate  his whole attention on the act of getting well and youll find hell improve astonishingly in no time but if you keep him here in england and feed him badly and neglect my directions i cant answer for his getting through another winterdont disturb yourself i beg of you dont pray give way to tears there is really no occasion for it my dear madam no occasion for it at all if youll only do as i tell youquite right thank you good morningnext case mcfarlanegood morning good morning  so that was the end of weeping little edies poor hardlyspared three guineas  the very next day arthur berkeley happened to mount the stairs quietly at an earlier hour than usual and knocked at the door of ernests lodging there was no answer so he turned the handle and entered by himself the remains of breakfast lay upon the table arthur did not want to spy but he couldnt help remarking that these remains were extremely meagre and scanty half a loaf of bread stood upon a solitary plate in the centre a teapot and two cups occupied one side andthat was all in spite of himself he couldnt restrain his curiosity and he looked more closely at the knives and plates not a mark of anything but crumbs upon them not even butter he looked into the cups  nothing but milkless tea at the bottom yes the truth was only too evident they had had no meat for breakfast no butter no milk no sugar it was quite clear that the meal had consisted entirely of dry bread with plain teacall it hot waterand that for a dying man and a delicate overworked lady arthur looked at that pitiable breakfasttable with a twinge of remorse and the tears rose sharply and involuntarily into his eyes he had not done enough for them then he had not done enough for them  poor little miss butterfly and had it really come to this you so bright so light so airy in want in positive want in hunger even with your good impossible  impracticable ernest had it come to this bread and water dry bread and water down tears down a man must be a man but oh what a bitter sight for arthur berkeley and yet what could he do to mend it money they would not take he dare not even offer it and he was at his wits end for any other contrivance for serving them without their knowledge he must do what he could but how he was to do it he couldnt imagine  as he stood there ruminating bitterly over that poor bare table he thought he heard sounds above as of edie coming downstairs with dot on her shoulder he knew she would not like to know that he had surprised the secret of their dire poverty and he turned silently and cautiously to descend the stair there was only just time enough to get away for edie was even then opening the door of the nursery noiselessly with catlike tread he crept down the steps once more and heard edie descending and singing as she came down to dot it was a plaintive little song in a sad keya plaintive little song of his ownbut not wholly distressful arthur thought she could still sing then to her baby with the hot tears rising a second time to his eyes he groped his way to the foot of the staircase there he brushed them hurriedly aside with his hand and turned out into the open street the children were playing and tumbling in the sun and a languid young man in a faultless frock coat and smooth silk hat was buying a showy buttonhole flower from the little suburban florists opposite  with a heavy heart arthur berkeley turned homeward to his own cosy little cottage that modest palace of art which he had once hoped little miss butterfly might have shared with him he went up the steps and turned quickly into his own small study the progenitor was there sitting reading in an easychair at least arthur thought to  himself i have made his old age happy if i could only do as much for little miss butterfly for little miss butterfly for little miss butterfly if i could only do as much for her oh how happy and contented i should be  he flung himself down on his own sofa and brushed big eyes nervously with his handkerchief before he dared lookup again towards the progenitor father he said clutching his watchchain hard and playing with it nervously to keep down his emotion im afraid those poor le bretons are in an awfully bad way im afraid do you know that they actually havent enough to eat i went into their rooms just now and would you believe it i found nothing on the table for breakfast but dry bread and tea  the progenitor looked up quietly from the volume of morleys voltaire which he was at that moment placidly engaged in devouring nothing but dry bread and tea he said in what seemed to arthur a horribly unconcerned tone  really hadnt they well i dare say they are very badly off poor people but after all you know artie they cant be really poor for le breton told me himself he was generally earning fifteen shillings or a pound a week and that you see is really for three people a very good income now isnt it  arthur delicateminded gentle chivalrous arthur gazed in surprise and sudden distress at that dear good unselfish old father of his how extraordinary that the kindly old man couldnt grasp the full horror of the situation how strange that he who would himself have been so tender so considerate so womanly in his care and sympathy towards anything that seemed to him like real poverty or real suffering  should have been so blinded by his long hard workingman  life towards the peculiar difficulties and trials of classes other than his own as not to recognise the true meaning of that dreadful disclosure arthur was not angry with himhe felt too fully at that moment what depths of genuine silent hardship uncomplainingly endured were implied in the stoically calm frame of mind which could treat edie le bretons penury of luxuries as a comparatively slight matter after all his father was right at bottom such mere sentimental  middleclass poverty is as nothing to the privations of the really poor yet he could not help feeling a little  disappointed for all that he wanted sympathy in his pity and he could clearly expect none here why father he cried bitterly you dont throw yourself into the position as you ought to do a pound a week paid regularly would be a splendid income of course for people brought up like you or me but just consider how those two young people have been brought up consider their wants and their habits  consider the luxury they have been accustomed to and then think of their being obliged to want now almost for food in their last extremity  his father answered in the same quiet tonenot hardly but calmly as though he were discussing a problem in  political economy instead of the problem of edie le bretons happinesswell you see its all a matter of the standard of comfort these two friends of yours have been brought up above their future and now that theyre got to come down to their natural level why of course they feel it depend upon it they feel it their parents of course shouldnt have accustomed them to a style of life above their station good dry bread not too stale does nobody any harm still i dare say they dont like coming down to it  but bless your heart artie if youd seen the real want and poverty that ive seen my boythe actual hunger and cold and nakedness that ive known honest working people brought down to by no work and nothing but the house open before them or not that even you wouldnt think so much of the sentimental grievances of people who are earning fifteen shillings a week in ease and comfort  but father arthur went on scarcely able to keep down the rising tone of indignation at such seeming  heartlessness ernest doesnt earn even that always sometimes he earns nothing or next to nothing and its the  uncertainty and insecurity that tells upon them even more than the poverty itself oh father father you who have always been so good and kind i never heard you speak so cruelly about anyone before as youre speaking now about that poor friendless helpless penniless heartbroken little woman  the old shoemaker caught at the word suddenly and looking him through and through with an unexpected gleam of discovery laid down the life of voltaire on the table with a bang and sat straight upright in his chair nodding his head and muttering slowly to himself little womanhe said little woman poor artie poor artie in a tone of inexpressible pity at last he turned to arthur and cried with a voice of womanly tenderness my boy my boy i didnt know before it was the lassie you were thinking of i thought it was only poor young le breton i see it all now ive surprised your secret youve let it out to me without knowing it oh artie if thats she im sorry for her and im sorry for you my boy from the bottom of my heart if thats she artie well put our heads together and see what plan we can manage to save her from what she has never been accustomed to dont think too hardly of your old progenitor artie he hasnt mixed with these people all his life and learned to sympathise with them as youve done my son he doesnt understand them or know their troubles as you do but if thats her that you told me about one day we shall find the means to make her happy and comfortable yet if we have to starve for it dear arthur do not think i could be harsh or unfeeling for a moment to the woman that you ever once in passing fixed your heart upon lets talk it over and think it over and sooner or later well surely find the way to accomplish it    chapter xxxii  precontract of marriage   whether ronald le bretons abstruse speculations on the theory of heredity were well founded or not it certainly did happen at any rate that the more he saw of selah briggs the better he liked her and the more selah saw of him the better she liked him in return curiously enough too selah did actually recognise in him what he fancied he  recognised in himself that part of his brothers nature not all wholly assumed which was just what selah had first been drawn to admire in herbert himself it wasnt merely the originality of his general point of view it was something more deepseated and undefinable than thatin a word his idiosyncrasy selah briggs with her peculiar fiery soul and rebellious nature found in both the le bretons something that seemed at once to satisfy her wants to fulfil her desires to saturate her affinities and with ronald as with herbert before she was conscious of a certain awe and respect which was all the more pleasant to her because her untamed spirit had never felt anything like it with any other human being  she didnt understand them and she didnt want to understand  them that constituted just the very charm of their whole personality to her peculiar fancy all the other people she had ever met were as transparent as glass for good or for evil she could see through all their faults and virtues as easily as one sees through a window the le bretons were to her inscrutable novel incomprehensible inexplicable and she prized them for their very inscrutability  and so it came to pass that almost by a process of natural and imperceptible transference she passed on at last to ronalds account very much the same intensity of feeling that she had formerly felt towards his brother herbert  but at the same time selah never for a moment let him see it she was too proud to confess now that she could ever love another man the mr walters she had once believed  in had never never never existed and she would raise no other idol in future to take the place of that vanished ideal she was grateful to ronald and even fond of him but that was alloutwardly at least she never let him see by word or act that in her heart of hearts she was  beginning to love him and yet ronald instinctively knew it  he himself could not have told you why but he knew it  even a woman cannot hide a secret from a man with that peculiarly penetrating intuitive temperament which belongs to sensitive delicate types like ronald le bretons  one sunday evening when selah had been spending a few hours at edies lodgings ronald always made it an  excuse for finding them a supper on the ground that selah was really his guest though he could not conveniently ask her to his own rooms he walked home towards notting hill with selah and as they crossed the regents park he took the opportunity to say something to her that he had had upon his mind for a few weeks past in some vague  indefinite halfunconscious fashion  selah he began a little timidly dont you think its very probable we shant have ernest here much longer with us  im afraid it is ronald selah answered she had got quite accustomed now to calling him ronald with such a poor weak sickly fellow as that why really after all it did not much matter  well selah ronald went on gravely his eyes filling with tears as he spoke in that case you know i cant think whats to become of poor edie its a dreadful  contingency to talk about selah and i cant bear talking about it but we must face these things however terrible mustnt we and in this case ones absolutely bound to face it for poor edies sake as well as for ernests selah she must have a home to go to when dear ernests taken from us  im very sorry for her ronald selah answered with unusual softness of manner but i really dont see how a home can possibly be provided for her  i do ronald answered more calmly and for their sakes selah i want you to help me in trying to provide it  how selah asked looking up in his face curiously as they passed into a ray of lamplight  listen selah and ill tell you why by marrying me  never selah answered firmly and with a decided tinge of the old adam in her trembling voice never ronald never never never  wait a minute selah ronald pleaded till youve heard the end of what i have to say to you consider that when dear ernests gone oh selah you must excuse me it makes me cry so to think of it therell be nowhere on earth for poor little edie and dot to go to  did ever a man propose to a girl so extraordinarily in all this world selah thought to herself angrily he actually expects me to marry him in order to provide a home for his precious sisterinlaw thats really carrying  unselfishness a step too far i call it  edie couldnt come and live with me of course ronald went on quickly if i were a bachelor but if i were married why then naturally she and dot could come and live with us and she could earn a little money somehow no doubt and at any rate itd be better for her than starvation  selah stopped a minute and tapped the hard ground two or three times angrily with the point of her umbrella and me ronald she said in a curious defiant voice and me  i suppose youve forgotten all about me you dont ask me to marry you because you love me you dont ask me whether i love you or not you only propose to me that i should quietly turn domestic housekeeper for mrs ernest le breton  and for my part i answer you plainly once for all that im not going to do itno never never never  she spoke haughtily flashing her eyes at him in the fierce old fashion and ronald was almost frightened at the angry intensity of her contemptuous gestures selah he cried trying to take her hand which she tore away from him hurriedly selah you misunderstand me i only approached the subject that way because i didnt want to seem overweening  and presumptuous its a very great piece of vanity it seems to me for any man to ask a woman whether she loves him im too conscious of all my own faults and failings  selah to venture upon asking you ever to love me but i do love you selah im sure i do love you and i hoped i somehow fanciedit may have been mere fancy but i did imaginethat i detected i cant say how that you did really love me too just a very very little oh selah its because i really love you that i ask you whether youll marry me such as i am i know im a poor sort of person to marry but i ventured to hope you might love me just a little for all that  he looked so frail and gentle as he stood there pleading in the pale moonlight that selah could have taken him to her bosom then and there and fondled him as one would pet a sick child for pure womanliness but the devil in her blood kept her from doing it and she answered haughtily instead ronald if you wanted to marry me you ought to have asked me for my own sake now that youve asked me for anothers you cant expect me to give you an answer keep your money my poor boy youll want it all for you and her hereafter dont go sharing it and spending it on perfect strangers such as me and dont go talking to me again about this business as long as your sisterinlaw is unprovided for im not going to take the bread out of her mouth and im not going to marry a man who doesnt utterly and  entirely love me  but i do ronald answered earnestly i do selah i love you truly and faithfully from the very bottom of my heart  leave off roland selah said in the same angry tone  if you ever talk to me of this again i give you my word of honour about it ill never speak another word to you  and ronald who deeply respected the sanctity of a promise were it only a threat bided his time and said no more about it for the present  next day as ronald sat reading in his own rooms he was much surprised at hearing a wellknown voice at the door inquiring with some asperity whether mr le breton was at home he listened to the voice in intense astonishment it was his mothers  ronald lady le breton began the moment she had been shown into his little sittingroom i didnt think after your undutiful ungrateful conductwith that abominable woman toothat i should ever have come to see you unless you came first as you ought clearly to do and begged my pardon penitently for your disgraceful behaviour its hard i know to acknowledge oneself in the wrong but every christian ought to be above vindictiveness and obstinate selfwill and i expect you therefore sooner or later to come and ask forgiveness for your dreadful unkindness to me till then as i said i didnt expect to call upon you in any way  but ive felt compelled today to come and speak to you about a matter of duty and as a matter of duty strictly i regard it not as any relaxation of my just attitude of indignant  expectancy towards yourself no parent ought rightly to  overlook such conduct as yours on the part of a son ronald inclined his head respectfully well what ive come to speak to you about today ronald is about your poor  misguided brother ernest he too as you know has behaved very badly to me  no ronald answered stoutly without further note or comment where the matter touched himself only he could maintain a decent silence but where it touched poor dying ernest he couldnt possibly restrain himself even from a sense of filial obligation  very badly to me lady le breton went on sternly without in any way noticing the brief interruption and i cant of course go to see him either especially not as i should by so doing expose myself to meeting the person whom he has chosen to make his wife still as i hear that ernest a in a very serious or even dangerous condition  hes dying ronald answered the quick tears once more finding the easy road to his eyes as usual  i considered as a mother it was my duty to warn him to take a little thought about his soul  his soul ronald exclaimed in astonishment ernests soul why mother dear ernest has no need to look after his soul he doesnt take that sordid petty limited view of our relations with eternity and of our relations with the  infinite which makes them all consist of the miserable selfish squalid desire to save our own poor personal little souls at all hazards ernest has something better and nobler to think of i can assure you than such a mere selfcentred idea as that  ronald lady breton exclaimed drawing herself up with much dignity how on earth you who have always pretended to be a religious person can utter such a shocking and wicked sentiment as that really passes my comprehension  what in the world is religion for i should like to know if it isnt to teach us how to save our own souls but the particular  thing i want to speak to you about is just this couldnt you manage to induce ernest to see the archdeacon a little and let the archdeacon speak to him about his deplorable spiritual condition i thought about you both so much at church yesterday when the dear archdeacon was preaching such a beautiful sermon his text was like this as far as i can remember it there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death i couldnt help thinking all the time of my own two poor rebellious boys and of the path that their misguided notions were leading them on for i believe ernest does really somehow persuade himself  that hes in the rightits inconceivable but its the fact and im afraid the end thereof will be the ways of death and then as the dear archdeacon said after death the judgment oh ronald when i think of your poor dear brother ernests open unbelief it makes me tremble for his future so that i couldnt rest upon my bed until id been to see you and urged you to go and try to save him  mother ronald said with that tone in which he was well accustomed to answering lady le bretons religious harangues i dont think you need feel any uneasiness whatever on dear ernests account so far as all thats  concerned what does he want with saving his soul mother  whosoever will save his life shall lose it remember what is written not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven  but ronald lady le breton continued half angrily consider his unbelief his dreadful opinions his errors of doctrine how on earth can we be happy about him when we think of those  i dont think mother ronald answered gently that infinite justice and infinite love take much account of a mans opinions they take account of his life and soul only not of the correctness of his propositions in dogmatic theology other sheep have i which are not of this foldthem also must i bring  it seems to me ronald lady le breton rejoined coldly that you dont in the least care for whatever is most distinctive and characteristic in the whole of christian  doctrine you talk so very very differently on religious subjects from that dear good excellent archdeacon    chapter xxxiii  a gleam of sunshine   lady hilda tregellis rang the bell resolutely i shall have no more nonsense about it she said to herself in her most decisive and determined manner whether mamma wishes it or not i shall go and see them this very day  without another word upon the subject  the servant answered the bell and stood waiting for his orders by the doorway  harris will you tell jenkins at once that i shall want the carriage at halfpast eleven  yes my lady  all right then thatll do dont stand staring at me there like an image but go this minute and do as i tell you  beg pardon my lady but her ladyship said she wanted the carriage herself at twelve puncshual  she cant have it then harris thats all go and give my message to jenkins at once and ill settle about the carriage with my lady myself  shes the rummest young lady ever i come across the man murmured to himself in a dissatisfied fashion as he went down the stairs again but there its none of my business thank goodness the places and the people she does go and hunt up when shes got the fit on are truly ridiclous blest if she didnt acshally make mr jenkins drive her down into camberwell the other mornin to see ow the poor lived she said as if it mattered tuppence to us in our circles of society ow the poor live i wonder what little game shes up to now well well what the aristocracy is coming to in these days is moren i can fathom as sure as my names william arris  the little game that lady hilda was up to that morning was one that a gentleman in mr harriss position was  certainly hardly like to appreciate or sympathise with  the evening before she had met arthur berkeley once more at a small at home and had learned from him full particulars as to the dire straits into which the poor le bretons had finally fallen now hilda tregellis was a kindhearted girl at bottom and when she heard all about it she said at once to arthur i shall go and see them  myself tomorrow mr berkeley whether mamma allows me or not  what good will it do arthur had answered her quickly you cant find work for poor le breton can you and of course if you cant do that you can be of no earthly use in any way to the poor creatures  i dont know about that hilda responded warmly  sympathys always something isnt it mr berkeley  nobody ought to know that better than you do besides theres no saying when one may happen to turn up useful  of course ive never been of the slightest use to anybody in all my life myself i know and i dare say i never shall be but at least theres no harm in trying is there im on speaking terms with such an awful lot of people all of them rich and many of them influentialparliament and government  offices and all that sort of nonsense you knowpeople who have no end of things to give away and cant tell who on earth theyd better give them to for fear of offending all the others that i might possibly hear of something or other  im afraid lady hilda berkeley answered smiling none of those people would have anything to offer that could possibly be of the slightest use to poor le breton if hes to be saved at all he must be saved in his own time and by his own methods for my own part i dont see what conceivable chance of success in life there is left for him  you cant imagine a man like him making money and living comfortably its a tragedyall the dramas of real life always are tragedies but im terribly afraid theres no  conceivable way out of it  lady hilda only looked at him with bold good humour  nonsense she said bravely all pure rubbishing pessimistic  nonsense i hope pessimistics the right wordits a very good word anyhow even if it isnt in the proper place well i dont agree with you at all about this question mr berkeley im very fond of mr le breton really very fond of him and i believe theres a corner somewhere for every man if only he can jog down properly into his own corner instead of being squeezed forcibly into somebody elses the worst of it is all the holes are round and mr  le bretons a square man i allow he wants all the angles cutting down off him  but you cant cut them off thats the very trouble arthur answered with just a faint rising suspicion that he was half jealous of the interest hilda showed even in poor lonely ernest le breton gracious heavens could he be playing false at last to the longcherished memory of little miss butterfly could he be really beginning to fall just a little in love after all with this bold beautiful lady hilda tregellis he didnt know and yet he somehow hardly liked himself to think it and while edie was still so poor too  no you cant cut them off i know that perfectly well hilda rejoined quickly i wouldnt care twopence for him if i thought you could its the angles that give him all his charming delicious originality but you can look out a square hole for him somewhere you know and that of course would be a great deal better depend upon it mr berkeley there are square holes up and down in the world if only we knew where to look for them and the mistake that everybody  has made in poor mr le bretons case has been that instead of finding one to suit him theyve gone on trying to poke him down anyhow by main force into one of the round ones that goes against the grain you know besides which i call it a clear waste of the very valuable solid mahogany corners  arthur berkeley looked at her silently for a moment as if a gleam of light had burst suddenly in upon him then he said to her slowly and deliberately perhaps youre right lady hilda though i never thought of it quite in that light before but one thing certainly strikes me now and that is that youre a great deal cleverer after all than i ever thought you  lady hilda made a little mock curtsey its very good of you to say so she answered halfsaucily only the compliment is rather doubleedged you must confess because it implies that up to now youve had a dreadfully low opinion of my poor little intelligence  so after that conversation lady hilda made up her mind that she would certainly go the very next day and call as soon as possible upon edie le breton nobody could tell what good might possibly come of it but at least there could come no harm and so when the carriage drew up it the door at halfpast eleven hilda tregellis stepped into it with a vague consciousness of an important mission and ordered jenkins to drive at once to the side street in  holloway whose address arthur berkeley had last night given her jenkins touched his hat with mechanical respect but inwardly wondered what the dickens my lady would think if only she came to know of these ere extrornary goins on  at the door of the lodgings hilda alighted and rang the bell herself good mrs halliss opened the door and answered quickly that mrs le breton was at home her womans eye detected at once the coronet on the carriage and she was ready to burst with delight when the tall visitor handed her a card for edie bearing the name of lady hilda tregellis it was almost the first time that edie had had any lady callers certainly the first time she had had any of such social distinction and mrs halliss made haste to usher her up in due form and then ran down hastily to communicate the good news to honest john who in his capacity of past coachman was already gazing out of the area window with deep interest at the carriage and horses  there john dear she cried with tears of joy in her eyes forgetting in her excitement to drat the man for not being in the back kitchen to think that we should see a carriage an pair like that there adrawin up in front of out own very ouse and lady ilder tergellis or summat o the sort acomin ere to see that dear little lady in the parlour why its enough to make ones eart burst nearly just you see now if it reelly isnt you could a knocked me down with a feather amost when that there lady ilder anded me er curd and asked so sweetlike if mrs le breting was at ome mr le bretings people is comin round you may be sure of it is mothers a lady of title that much we know for certing and she wouldnt go and let er own flesh an blood die ere of downright poverty as theyre like to do and wont let us elp it pore dears without sendin round to inquire and assist em married against er will i understand from what that dear mr berkeley bless is kind eart do tell me not as i can believe e married beneath im no not no ways for a sweeter dearer nicer little lady than our mrs le breting i never did an that i tell you sweeter manners you never did see yourself john for all youve lived among the aristocracy an i always knew is people ud come round at last and do what was right by im an you may depend upon it john this ere lady ilders one of his relations an shes come round on a message from lady le breting to begin a reconciliation and though we should be sorry to lose em as as stood by em through all their troubles im glad to ear it john that i am for i cant abear to see that dear young fellow aeatin is life out with care and anxiety and mrs halliss who had always felt convinced in her own mind that ernest must really be the unacknowledged heir to a splendid fortune began to wipe her eyes violently in her delight at this evident realisation of her wildest fancies and wishes  meanwhile upstairs in the little parlour edie had risen in some trepidation as mrs halliss placed in her hands lady hilda tregelliss card ernest was out gone to walk feebly around the streets of holloway and she hardly knew at first what to say to so unexpected a visitor but lady hilda put her almost at her ease at once by coming up to her with both her arms outstretched as to an old friend and saying with one of her pleasantest smiles  you must forgive me mrs le breton for never having come to call on you before but i have been long meaning to and doubting whether you would care to see me or not you know im a very old friend of your husbandshe was so kind to me always when he was down at our place in dear old devonshire youre a devonshire girl yourself arent you  just as i am i thought so im so glad of it i always get on so well with the dear old devonshire folk well ive been meaning to come for ever so long and putting it off and putting it off and putting it off as one will put things off you know when youre not quite sure about them until last evening and then our friend mr arthur berkeley who knows everybody talked to me about your husband and you and told me he thought you wouldnt mind my coming to see you for he fancied you hadnt much society up here that you cared for or sympathised with though of course im dreadfully afraid of coming to call upon you because i know youre the sister of that very clever mr oswald whose sad death we were all so sorry to hear about in the papers and naturally as youve lived so much with him and with mr le breton you must be so awfully learned and all that sort of thing and no doubt despise ignorant people like myself dreadfully but you really mustnt despise me mrs le breton because you see i havent had all the advantages that youve had indeed the only clever people ive ever met in all my life are your husband and mr arthur berkeley except of course cabinet ministers and so forth and they dont count  because theyre political and so very old and solemn and grand and wont take any notice of us girls except to sit upon us so thats whats made me rather afraid to call upon you because i thought youd be quite too much in the higher education way for a girl like me and i havent got any education at all except in rubbish as your husband used always to tell me and now i want you to tell me all about mr le breton and the babydot you call her mr berkeley told meand yourself too for though ive never seen you before i feel of course like an old friend of the family having known your husband so very intimately  lady hilda designedly delivered all this long harangue straight off without a break in her goahead breathless voluble fashion because she felt sure edie wouldnt feel perfectly at her ease at first and she wanted to give her time to recover from the first foolish awe of that meaningless prefix lady moreover lady hilda in spite of her offhand manner was a good psychologist and a true woman and she had concocted her little speech on the spur of the moment with some cleverness so as just to suit her instinctive reading of edies small personal peculiarities she saw in a moment that that slight pale delicate girl was lost in london far from her own home and surroundings and that the passing allusion to their common devonshire origin would please and conciliate her as it always does with the clannish warmhearted simpleminded west country folk then again the deft hints as to their friendship with arthur berkeley as to ernests stay at dunbude and as to her own fear lest edie should be too learned for her all tended to bring out whatever  points of interest they had together while the casual touch about poor harrys reputation and the final mention of little dot by name completed the conquest of edies simple gentle little womans heart so this was the great lady hilda tregellis she thought of whom she had heard so much and whom she had dreaded so greatly as a grand rival  why after all she was exactly like any other devonshire girl in calcombe pomeroy except perhaps that she was easier to get on with and smiled a great deal more pleasantly than ten out of a dozen  its very kind indeed of you to come edie answered smiling back as well as she was able the first moment that lady hilda allowed her a chance to edge in a word sideways  ernest will be so very very sorry that hes missed you when he comes in hes spoken to me a great deal about you ever so many times  no has he really lady hilda asked quickly with unmistakable interest and pleasure well now im so glad of that for to tell you the truth mrs le breton though he was really always very kind to me and so patient with all my stupidity i more than half fancied he didnt exactly like me  in fact i was dreadfully afraid he thought me a perfect nuisance im so sorry he isnt in because the truth is i came partly to see him as well as to see you and i should be awfully disappointed if i had to miss him wheres he gone if i may ask perhaps i may be able to wait and see him  oh hes only out walking somewhereursomewhere about holloway edie answered half blushing at the nature of their neighbourhood and glancing round the little room to see how it was likely to strike so grand a person as lady hilda tregellis  hilda noticed the glance and made as if she did not notice it her heart had begun to warm at once to this poor pale eagerlooking little woman who had had the doubtful happiness of winning ernest le bretons love  then i shall certainly wait and see him mrs le breton she said cordially what a dear cosy little room youve got here to be sure i do so love those nice bright little cottage parlours with their pretty pots of flowers and  cheerful furnitureso much warmer and more comfortable you know than the great dreary empty barns that most people go and do penance by living in if ever i marrywhich i dont suppose i ever shall do for nobodyll have me im sorry to say at least nobody but stupid people in the peerage algies and berties and monties i always call themwell if i ever do marry i shall have a cosy little house just like this one with no unnecessary space to walk over every time you come in or out and with a chance of keeping yourself warm without having to crone over the fire in order to get safely out of the horrid draughts and dot now let me see how old is she by this time i ought to remember im sure for mr berkeley told me all about her at the time and i said should i write and ask if i might stand as godmother and mr berkeley laughed at me and said what could i be dreaming of and did i think you were going to make your baby liable to fine and imprisonment if it ever published works hereafter on philosophy or something of the sort so delightfully original of all of you really  once started on that fertile theme of female conversation edie and hilda got on well enough in all conscience to satisfy the most exacting mind dot was duly brought in and exhibited by mrs halliss and was pronounced to be the very sweetest dearest darlingest little duck ever seen on earth since the beginning of all things her various points of likeness to all her relations were duly discussed and hilda took particular pains to observe that she didnt in the very faintest degree resemble that old horror lady le breton then her whole past history was fully related she had been fed on and what illnesses she had had and how many teeth she had got and all the other delightful nothings so perennially interesting to the maternal heart  hilda listened to the whole account with unfeigned attention  and begged leave to be allowed to dance dot in her own strong arms and tickled her fat cheek with her slender forefinger and laughed with genuine delight when the baby smiled again at her and turned her face to be tickled a second time gradually hilda brought the conversation round to ernests journalistic experiences and at last she said very quietly im sorry to learn from mr berkeley dear that your husband doesnt get quite as much work to do as he would like to have  edies tender eyes filled at once with swimming tears  that one word dear said so naturally and simply touched her heart at once with its genuine half unspoken sympathy  oh lady hilda she answered falteringly please dont make me talk about that we are so very very very poor  i cant bear to talk about it to you please please dont make me  hilda looked at her with the moisture welling up in her own eyes too and said softly im so sorry dear dear little mrs le breton im so very very very sorry for you from the bottom of my heart im sorry for you  it isnt for myself you know edie answered quickly for myself of course i could stand anything but its the trouble and privations for darling ernest oh lady hilda i cant bear to say it but hes dying hes dying  hilda took the pretty small hand affectionately in hers  dont dear dont she said brushing away a tear from her own eyes at the same time he isnt believe me he isnt  and dont call me by that horrid stiff name dear please dont call me hilda i should be so pleased and flattered if you would call me hilda and may i call you edie i know your husband calls you edie because mr ronald le breton told me so i want to be a friend of yours and i feel sure if only you will let me that we might be very good and helpful friends indeed together  edie pressed her hand softly how very different from the imaginary lady hilda she had pictured to herself in her timid girlish fancy how much even dear ernest had been mistaken as to what there was of womanly really in her oh dont speak so kindly to me she said imploringly dont speak so kindly or else youll make me cry i cant bear to hear you speak so kindly  cry dear lady hilda whispered in a gentle tone kissing her forehead delicately as she spoke cry and relieve yourself therea nothing gives one so much comfort when ones heart is bursting as a regular good downright cry and suiting the action to the word forthwith lady hilda laid her own statuesque head down beside edies and so those two weeping women rivals once in a vague way and now bound to one another by a newfound tie mingled their tears silently together for ten minutes in unuttered sympathy  as they sat there both tearful and speechless with lady hilda soothing edies wan hand tenderly in hers and leaning above her and stroking her hair softly with a sisters fondness the door opened very quietly and arthur berkeley stood for a moment pausing in the passage and looking in without a word upon the unexpected sight that greeted his wondering vision he had come to call upon ernest about some possible opening for a new writer on a paper lately started and hearing the sound of sobs within had opened the door quietly and tentatively he could hardly believe his own eyes when he actually saw lady hilda tregellis sitting there side by side with edie le breton kissing her pale forehead a dozen times in a minute and crying over her like a child with unwonted tears of unmistakable sympathy for ten seconds arthur held the door ajar in his hands and gazed silently with the awe of chivalrous respect upon the tearful beautiful picture then he shut the door again noiselessly and unperceived and stole softly out into the street to wait alone for ernests return it was not for him to intrude his unbidden presence upon the sacred sorrow of those two weeping sisterwomen  he lighted a cigar outside and walked up and down a neighbouring street feverishly till he thought it likely the call would be finished dear little mrs le breton he said to himself softly dear little miss butterfly of the days that are dead softened and sweetened still more by suffering with the beauty of holiness glowing in your face how i wish some good for you could unexpectedly come out of this curious visit though i dont see how its possible i dont see how its possible the stream carries us all down unresistingly before its senseless flood and sweeps us at last sooner or later like helpless logs into the unknown sea poor ernest is drifting fast thitherwards before the current and nothing on earth it seems to me can conceivably stop him  he paced up and down a little with a quick unsteady tread and took a puff or two again at his cigar abstractedly  then he held it thoughtfully between his fingers for a while and began to hum a few bars from his own new opera then in course of compositiona stately longdrawn air it was  something like the rustle of hilda tregelliss satin train as she swept queenlike down the broad marble staircase of some great elizabethan country palace and dear lady hilda too he went on musingly dear kind sympathising lady hilda who on earth would ever have thought she had it in her to comfort that poor weeping sorrowing girl as i just now saw her doing dear lady hilda kind lady hilda  i have undervalued you and overlooked you because of the mere accident of your titled birth but i could have kissed you myself for pure gratitude that very minute hilda tregellis when i saw you stooping down and kissing that dear white forehead that looked so pale and womanly and beautiful yes hilda i could have kissed you i could have kissed your own grand smooth white marble forehead  and no very great trial of endurance either arthur berkeley if it comes to that for say what you will of her shes a beautiful stately queenlike woman indeed and it somehow strikes me shes a truer and better woman too than you have ever yet in your shallow superficiality imagined not like little miss butterfly oh no not like little miss butterfly but still there are keys and keys in music and if every tune was pitched to the selfsame key even the tenderest what a monotonous dreary world it would be to live and sing in after all perhaps a man might make himself a little shrine not wholly without sweet savour of pure incense for beautiful stately queenlike  hilda tregellis too but no i mustnt think of it  i have no other duty or prospect in life possible as yet while dear little miss butterfly still remains practically unprovided for    chapter xxxiv  hope   from edie le bretons lodgings hilda tregellis drove straight without stopping all the way to arthur berkeleys house at chelsea for arthur had long since risen to the dignity of an enfranchised householder and had bought himself a pretty cottage near the embankment with room enough for himself and the progenitor and even for any possible future domestic contingency in the way of wife and children it was a very unconventional thing for her to do no doubt but lady hilda was certainly not the person to be deterred from doing anything she contemplated on the bare ground of its extreme unconventionally and so far was she from objecting personally to her visit on this score that before she rang the berkeleys bell she looked quietly at her little bijou watch and said with a bland smile to the suspicious mr jenkins let me see jenkins its one oclock i shall lunch with my friends here this morning so you may take the carriage home now for my lady and i shall cab it back or come round by metropolitan jenkins was too much accustcmed to lady hildas unaccountable vagaries to express any surprise at her wildest resolutions even if she had proposed to go home on a costermongers barrow so he only touched his hat respectfully in his marionette fashion and drove away at once without further colloquy  is mr berkeley at home hilda asked of the pretty servant girl who opened the door to her mentally taking note at the same time that arthurs aesthetic tendencies evidently extended even to his human surroundings  which mr berkeley the girl asked in reply mr  berkeley senerer es at ome but mr arthur es gone up this mornin to olloway  hilda seized with avidity upon this unexpected and almost providential opening no is he she said delighted  then ill go in and see mr berkeley senior no card thank you no name tell him merely a lady would like to see him i dare say mr arthurll be back before long from holloway  the girl hesitated a moment as if in doubt and surveyed lady hilda from head to foot hilda whose eyes were still red from crying couldnt help laughing outright at the obvious cause of the girls hesitation do as i tell you she said in her imperious way who on earth do you take me for my good girl thats my card see but you neednt give it to mr berkeley senior now go and tell him at once that a lady is waiting to see him  the innate respect of the english working classes for the kind of nobility that is supposed to be represented by the british peerage made the girl drop an instinctive curtsey as she looked at the card and answer in a voice of hushed surprise yes my lady she had heard lady hilda tregellis spoken of more than once at her masters table and she knew of course that so great a personage as that could do no wrong so she merely ushered her visitor at once into arthur berkeleys beautiful little study with its delicate grey pomegranate wall paper and its exquisite  unpolished oak fittings and said simply in an overawed manner a lady wishes to speak to you sir  the old shoemaker looked up from the english translation of ribots psychologie anglaise contemporaine with whose intricacies he was manfully struggling and rose with native politeness to welcome hilda  good morning hilda said extending her hand to him with one of her beaming disarming smiles and annihilating all that was most obtrusively democratic in him at once by her pleasant manner im a friend of your sons mr  berkeley and ive come here to see him about very particular private businessin short on an errand of charity  will he be long gone do you know  not very the progenitor answered in a somewhat  embarrassed manner surveying her curiously at least i should think not hes gone to holloway for an hour or two but i fancy hell be back for two oclock luncheon missur i dont think i caught your name did i  to holloway hilda echoed taking no notice of his suggested query oh then hes gone to see the poor dear le bretons of course why thats just what i wanted to see him about if youll allow me then ill just stop and have lunch with you  the dickens you will the progenitor thought to himself  in speechless astonishment thats really awfully cool of you however i dare say its usual to invite oneself in the state of life that that boy artie has gone and hoisted himself into most unnaturally a fine lady no doubt of their modern pattern but in my day up in paddington we should have called her a brazen husseycertainly if you will he added aloud if youve come on any errand that will do any good to the le bretons im sure my sonll be delighted to see you hes greatly grieved at their unhappy condition  im afraid ive nothing much to suggest of any very practical sort hilda answered with a slight sigh but at least i should like to talk with him about the matter  something must be done for these two poor young people you know mr berkeley something must really be done to help them  then youre interested in them missururah yesare you  look at my eyes hilda said plumply are they very red mr berkeley  welluryes if i may venture to say so to a lady the old shoemaker answered hesitatingly with unwonted  gallantry i should say they were a trifle ur just a trifle roseate you know  quite so hilda went on seriously thats it theyre red with crying ive been crying like a baby all the morning with that poor dear sweet little angel of a mrs  le breton  then youre a great friend of hers i suppose the progenitor suggested mildly  never set eyes on her in my life before this morning on the contrary hilda continued in her garrulous fashion  but oh mr berkeley if youd only seen that dear little woman crying as if her heart would break and telling me that dear ernest was dying actually dying whythereexcuse mei cant help it you know we women are always crying about something or other arent we  the old man laid his hand on hers quietly dont mind me my dear he said with genuine tenderness dont mind me a bit im only an old shoemaker as i dare say youve heard before now but i know youll be the better for cryingwomen always areand tears shed on somebody  elses account are never thrown away my dear are they  hilda took his hand between hers and wiping her eyes once more whispered softly no mr berkeley no perhaps theyre not but oh theyre so useless so very very very useless do you know i never felt my own powerlessness and helplessness in all my life so much as i did at that dear patient little mrs le bretons this very morning there i sat knowing she was in dire need of money for her poor husband and wanting sufficient food and drink perhaps for herself and him and the dear darling baby and in my hand in my muff i had my purse there with five tennersbank of england tenpound uotes you knowfifty pounds altogether rolled up inside it and i would have given anything if only i could have pulled them out and made them a present to her then and there and i couldnt you see and oh mr  berkeley isnt it terrible to look at them and then before i left poor mr le breton himself came in and i was quite shocked to see him i used to know him a few years ago and even then he wasnt what youd call robust by any means but now oh dear me he does look so awfully ill and haggard and miserable that it quite made me break down again and i cried about him before his very face and the moment i got away i said to the coachman jenkins  drive straight off to the embankment at chelsea and here i am you see waiting to talk with your clever son about it for really mr berkeley the poor le bretons havent got a single friend anywhere like your son arthur  and then lady hilda went on to praise arthurs music to the progenitor and to speak of how much admired he was everywhere and to hint that so much genius and musical power must of course be largely hereditary whereat the old man not unmoved by her gentle insinuating flattery at last confessed to his own lifelong musical tastes and even casually acknowledged that the motive for one or two of the minor songs in the famous operas was not entirely of arthurs own unaided invention and so from one subject to another they passed on so quickly and hit it off with one another so exactly for hilda had a wonderful knack of leading up to everybodys strong points that long before lunch was ready the progenitor had been quite won over by the fascinations of the brazen hussey and was prepared to admit that she was really a very nice kind tenderhearted intelligent appreciative and discriminating young lady true she had not read mill or fawcett and was ignorant of the very name of herbert spencer but she had a vast admiration for his dear boy artie and she saw that he himself knew a thing or two in his own modest way though he was only what the grand world she moved in would doubtless call an old superannuated journeyman shoemaker  ah yes a shoemaker so ive heard somewhere i fancy lady hilda remarked brightly when for the third time in the course of their conversation he informed her with great dignity of the interesting fact how very delightful and charming that is really now isnt it so original you know to make shoes instead of going into some useless  profession especially when youre such a great reader and student and thinker as you arefor i see youre a philosopher and a psychologist already mr berkeleyhilda considered it rather a bold effort on her part to pronounce the word psychologist at the very first trial without stumbling but though she was a little doubtful about the exact pronunciation  of that fearful vocable she felt quite at her ease about the fact at least because she carefully noticed him lay down ribot on the table beside him name upward one cant help finding that much out on a very short acquaintance can one though indeed now i come to think of it i believe ive heard often that men of your calling generally are very fond of reading and are very philosophical and clever and political and all that sort of thing and they say thats the reason of course why northamptons such an exceptionally intelligent constituency and always returns such thoroughgoing able logical radicals  the old mans eyes beamed as she spoke with inexpressible  pride and pleasure im very glad indeed to hear you say so he answered promptly with a complacent selfsatisfied  smile and i believe youre right too miss urururquite so the practice of shoemaking undoubtedly tends to develop a very high and exceptional level of general intelligence and logical power  im sure of it hilda answered demurely in a tone of the deepest and sincerest conviction and when i heard somebody say somewhere that your son waswell was your son i said to myself at once ah well there now that quite accounts of course for young mr berkeleys very extraordinary and unusual abilities  shes really a most sensible wellinformed young woman whoever she is the progenitor thought to himself silently and its certainly a pity that dear artie couldnt take a fancy to some nice appreciative kindhearted practical girl like that now instead of wearing away all the best days of his life in useless regret for that poor slender unsubstantial nonentity of a watery little mrs le breton  by two oclock lunch was ready and just as it had been announced arthur berkeley ran up the front steps and let himself in with his proprietory latchkey turning straight into the diningroom he was just in time to see his own father walking into lunch arm in arm with lady hilda tregellis  as mrs hallis had graphically expressed it he felt as if you might have knocked him down with a feather  was she absolutely ubiquitous then this pervasive lady hilda and was he destined wherever he went to come upon her suddenly in the most unexpected and incomprehensible situations  will you sit down here my dear the progenitor was saying to hilda at the exact moment he entered or would you prefer your back to the fire  arthur berkeley opened his eyes wide with unspeakable amazement what you here he exclaimed coming forward  suddenly to shake hands with hilda why i saw you only a couple of hours since at the le bretons at holloway  you did hilda cried with almost equal astonishment why how was that i never saw you  arthur sighed quietly no he answered with a curious look at the progenitor you were engaged when i opened the door and i didnt like to disturb you you wereyou were speaking with poor little mrs le breton but im so much obliged to you for your kindness to them lady hilda so very much obliged to you for your great kindness to them  it was the progenitors turn now to start in surprise  what lady hilda he cried with a bewildered look  lady hilda did i hear you say lady hilda is this lady hilda tregellis then that ive heard you talk about so often artie  why of course father you didnt know who it was then didnt you lady hilda im afraid youve been stealing a march upon the poor unsuspecting hostile  progenitor  not quite that mr berkeley hilda replied laughing only after the very truculent character i had heard of your father as a regular redhot militant radical i thought id better not send in my name to him at once for fear it might prejudice him against me before first acquaintance  the progenitor looked at her steadfastly from head to foot standing before him there in her queenly beauty as if she were some strange wild beast that he had been requested to inspect and report upon for a scientific purpose lady hilda tregellis he said slowly and deliberately lady hilda tregellis so this is lady hilda tregellis is it  well all i can say is this then that as far as i can judge her lady hilda tregellis is a very sensible modest intelligent wellconducted young woman which is more than i could possibly have expected from a person of her unfortunate  and distressing hereditary antecedents but you know my dear it was a very mean trick of you to go and take an old mans heart by guile and stratagem in that way  hilda laughed a little uneasily the progenitors manner was perhaps a trifle too open and unconventional even for her it wasnt for that i came mr berkeley she said again with one of her sunny smiles which brought the  progenitor metaphorically to her feet again but to talk over this matter of the poor le bretons with your son oh mr  arthur something must really be done to help them i know you say theres nothing to be done but there must be we must find it out we must invent it we must compel it  when i sat there this morning with that dear little woman and saw her breaking her full heart over her husbands trouble i said to myself somehow hilda tregellis if you cant find a way out of this youre not worth your salt in this world and youd better make haste and take a rapid throughticket at once to the next if there is one  which is more than doubtful really the progenitor muttered softly half under his breath which as strauss has conclusively shown is certainly a good deal more than doubtful  arthur took no notice of the interruption but merely answered imploringly with a despairing gesture of his hands what are we to do lady hilda what can we possibly do  why sit down and have some lunch first hilda rejoined  with practical commonsense and then talk it over rationally afterwards instead of wringing our hands helplessly  like a pair of frenchmen in a street difficulty hilda had a fine old crusted english contempt by the way for those vastly inferior and foolish creatures known as foreigners  thus adjured berkeley sat down promptly and they proceeded to take counsel together in this hard matter over the cutlets and claret provided before them ernest and mrs le breton told me all about your visit arthur went on soon after and theyre so much obliged to you for having taken the trouble to look them up in their sore distress do you know lady hilda i think youve quite made a conquest of our dear little friend mrs le breton  i dont know about that hilda responded with a smile but im sure at any rate that the sweet little woman quite made a conquest of me mr berkeley in fact i cant say what you think but for my part im determined an effort must be made one way or another to save them  its no use arthur answered shaking his head sadly it cant be done theres nothing for it but to let them float down helplessly with the tide wherever it may bear them  stuff and nonsense hilda replied energetically all rubbish utter rubbish and if i were a man as you are mr  berkeley i should be ashamed to take such a desponding view of the situation if we say its got to be done it will be done and thats an end of it work must and can be found for him somehow or somewhere  but the mans dying arthur interrupted with a vehement  gesture theres no more work left in him the only thing thats any use is to send him off to madeira or egypt or catania or somewhere of that sort and let him die quietly among the palms and cactuses and aloes thats sir antony wraxalls opinion and surely nobody in london can know half as well as he does about the matter  sir antonys a fool hilda responded with refreshing bluntness he knows nothing on earth at all about it  hes accustomed to prescribing for a lot of us idle goodfornothing rich peoplevery true the progenitor assented parenthetically and hes got into a fixed habit of prescribing  a nile voyage just as hes got into a fixed habit of prescribing old wine and carriage exercise and ten thousand a year to all his patients what mr le breton really wants is not egypt or old wine or sir antony or anything of the sort but relief from this pressing load of anxiety and responsibility put him in my hands for six months and ill back myself at a hundred to six against sir antony to cure him for a monkey  for a what the progenitor asked with a puzzled expression  of countenance  back myself for a monkey you know hilda answered without perceiving the cause of the old mans innocent confusion  the progenitor was evidently none the wiser still for hildas answer though he forbore to pursue the subject any farther lest he should betray his obvious ignorance of aristocratic manners and dialect  but arthur looked up at lady hilda with something like the gleam of a newborn hope on his distressed features  lady hilda he said almost cheerfully you really speak as if you had some practicable plan actually in prospect it seems to me if anybody can pull them through you can because youve got such a grand reserve of faith and energy  what is it now you think of doing  well hilda answered taken a little aback at this practical question ive hardly got my plan matured yet but ive got a plan and i thought it all out as far as it went as i came along here just now in the carriage the great thing is we must inspire mr le breton with a new  confidence we must begin by showing him we believe in him and letting him see that he may still manage in some way or other to retrieve himself he has lost all hope we must begin with him over again ive got an idea but itll take money now i can give up half my allowance for the next yearthe le bretons need never know anything about itthatll be something youre a rich man now i believe mr  berkeley will you make up as much as i do if my plan seems a feasible one to you for retrieving the position  the progenitor answered quickly for him miss tregellis  he said with a little tremor in his voice youll excuse me my dear but its against my principles to call anybody my ladyhe will i know he will and if he wouldnt why my dear id go back to my cobbling and earn it myself rather than that you or your friends should go without it for a single minute  arthur said nothing but he bowed his head silently  what a lot of good there was really in that splendid woman and what a commanding energetic masterful way she had about her to a feckless undecided faltering man like arthur berkeley there was something wonderfully attractive and magnificent after all in such an imperious resolute woman as lady hilda  then this is my plan hilda went on hastily we must do something thatll take mr le breton out of himself  for a short time entirelythatll give him occupation of a kind he thinks right and at the same time put money in his pocket now hes always talking about this socialistic business of his but why doesnt he tell us what he has actually seen about the life and habits of the really poor  mrs le breton tells me he knows the east end well why doesnt he sit down and give us a good rattling rousing frightening description of all thats in it of course i dont care twopence about the poor myselfnot in the lump i meani beg your pardon mr berkeleyfor the progenitor  gave a start of surprise and astonishmentyou know we women are nothing if not concrete we never care for anything in the abstract mr le breton used to tell me we want the particular case brought home to our sympathies before we can interest ourselves about it after all even you who are men dont feel very much for all the miserable wretched people there are in china you know theyre too far away for even you to bother your heads about but i do care about the le bretons and it strikes me we might help them a little in this way i know a lot of artists mr  berkeley and i know one who i think would just do for the very work i want to set him hes poor too by the way and i dont mind giving him a lift at the same time and killing two birds with one stone very well then i go to him and say mr verney i saythere now i didnt mean to tell you his name but no matter mr verney i shall say a friend of mine in the writing line is going to pay some visits to the very poor quarters in the east end and write about it which will make a great noise in the world as sure as midday  but how do you know it will asked the progenitor simply  hilda turned round upon him with an unfeigned look of startled astonishment how do i know it will she said confidently why because i mean it to mr berkeley  because i say it shall because i choose to make it two cabinet ministers shall quote it in the house and a duke shall write letters to the times denouncing it as an intensely wicked and revolutionary publication if i choose to float it i will float itwell mr verney i say for example will you undertake to accompany him and make sketches itll be unpleasant work i know because ive been there myself to see and the places dont smell nice at allworse than genoa or the old town at nice even i can tell you but itll make you a name and in any case the publisher whos getting it upll pay you well for it of course mr verney says yes then we go on to mr le breton and say a young artist of my acquaintance is making a pilgrimage into the east end to see for himself how the people live and to make pictures of them to stir up the sluggish consciences of the lazy aristocratsthats me and my people of course thatll be the way to work it  play upon mr le bretons tenderest feelings make him feel hes fighting for the cause and hell be ready to throw himself heart and soul into the spirit of the project i dont care twopence about the cause myself of course so thats flat and i dont pretend to either mr berkeley but i care a great deal for the misery of that poor dear pale little woman sitting there with me this morning and regularly  sobbing her heart out and if i can do anything to help her why i shall be only too delighted  le bretons a wellmeaning young fellow certainly the progenitor murmured gently in a voice of graceful concession and i believe his hearts really in the cause as you call it but you know my dear hes very far from being sound in his economical views as to the relations of capital and labour far from sound as john stuart mill would have judged the question i can solemnly assure you  very well hilda went on almost without noticing the interruption we shall say to him or rather we shall get our publisher to say to him that as hes interested in the matter and knows the east end well he has been selectedshall we put it on somebodys recommendationto accompany  the artist and to supply the reading matter the letterpress i think you call it in fact to write up to our  illustrators pictures and that he is to be decently paid for his trouble he must do something graphic something stirring something to wake up lazy people in the west end to a passing sense of what he calls their responsibilities thatll seem like real work to mr le breton itll put new heart into him hell take up the matter vigorously hell do it well hell write a splendid book and i shall guarantee its making a stir in the world this very dull season whats the use of knowing half the odiously commonplace bores and prigs in all london if you cant float a single little heterodox pamphlet for a particular purpose what do you think of it mr  berkeley  arthur sighed again it seems to me lady hilda he said regretfully a very slender straw indeed to hang ernest le bretons life on but any straw is better than nothing to a drowning man and you have so much faith yourself and mean to fling yourself into it so earnestly that i shouldnt be wholly surprised if you were somehow to pull it through  if you do lady hildaif you manage to save these two poor young people from the verge of starvationyoull have done a very great good work in your day and youll have made me personally eternally your debtor  was it mere fancy the progenitor wondered or did hilda cast her eyes down a little and half blush as she answered in a lower and more tremulous tone than usual i hope i shall mr berkeley for their sakes i hope i shall the progenitor didnt feel quite certain about it but somehow more than once that evening as he sat reading spencers data of ethics in his easychair a curious vision of lady hilda as a future daughterinlaw floated vaguely with singular persistence before the old shoemakers bewildered eyes itd be a shocking falling away on arties part from his fathers principles he muttered inarticulately to himself several times over and yet on the other hand i cant deny that this bit of a tregellis girl is really a very tidy goodlooking respectable wellmeaning intelligent and appreciative sort of a young woman whod maybe make artie as good a wife as anybody else hed be likely to pitch on    chapter xxxv  the tide turns   when ernest le breton got a letter from the business house of a wellknown publishing firm asking him whether he would consent to supply appropriate letterpress for an illustrated work on the poor of london then in course of preparation his delight and relief were positively  unbounded that anyone should come and ask him for work instead of his asking them was in itself a singular matter for surprise and congratulation that the request should be based on the avowed ground of his known political and social opinions was almost incredible ernest felt that it was a triumph not only for him but for his dearlyloved principles and beliefs as well for the first time in his life he was going to undertake a piece of work which he not only thought not wrong but even considered hopeful and praiseworthy arthur berkeley who called round as if by accident the same morning saw with delight that lady hildas prognostication seemed likely to be fulfilled and that if only ernest could be given some congenial occupation there was still a chance after all for his permanent recovery for it was clear enough that as there was hope there must be a little life yet left in him  it was lady hilda who as she herself expressively phrased it had squared the publishers she had called upon the head of the wellknown house in person and had told him fully and frankly exactly what was the nature of the interest she took in the poor of london at first the publisher was scandalised and obdurate the thing was not regular he saidnot in the ordinary way of business his firm couldnt go writing letters of that sort to unknown young authors and artists if she wanted the work done she must let them give her own name as the promoter of the undertaking but hilda persevered as she always did she smiled pleaded cajoled threatened and made desperate love to the publisher to gain his acquiescence in her  benevolent scheme after all even publishers are only human though authors have been frequently known to deny the fact and human nature especially in england is apt to be very little proof against the entreaties of a pretty girl who happens also to be an earls daughter so in the end when lady hilda said most bewitchingly i put it upon the grounds of a personal favour mr percival the obdurate publisher gave way at last and consented to do her bidding gladly  for six weeks ernest went daily with ronald and the young artist into the familiar slums of bethnal green and bermondsey and lambeth whose ins and outs he was  beginning to know with painful accuracy and every night he came back and wrote down with a glowing pen all that he had seen and heard of distressing and terrible during his days peregrination it was an awful task from one point of view for the scenes he had to visit and describe were often heartrending and arthur feared more than once that the air of so many loathsome and noxious dens might still further accelerate the progress of ernests disease but lady hilda said emphatically no and somehow arthur was beginning now to conceive an immense respect for the practical value of lady hildas vehement opinions as a matter of fact indeed ernest did not visibly suffer at all either from the unwonted hard work or from the strain upon mind and body to which he had been so little accustomed  distressing as it all was it was change it was variety it was occupation it was relief from that terrible killing round of perpetual personal responsibility above all ernest really believed that here at last was an opportunity of doing some practical good in his generation and he threw himself into it with all the passionate ardour of a naturally eager and vivid nature the enthusiasm of humanity was upon him and it kept him going at highpressure rate with no apparent loss of strength and vigour throughout the whole ordeal to arthur berkeleys intense delight he was even visibly fatter to the naked eye at the end of his six weeks exploration of the most dreary and desolate slums in all london  the book was written at white heat as the best of such books always are and it was engraved and printed at the very shortest possible notice terrible and ghastly it  certainly was at lastinstinct with all the grim local colouring of those narrow squalid feverstricken dens where  misfortune and crime huddle together indiscriminately in dirt and miserya book to make ones blood run cold with awe and disgust and to stir up even the callous apathy of the great rich capitalist west end to a passing moments ineffective remorse but very clever and very graphic after its own sort beyond the shadow of a question for all its horror  when arthur berkeley turned over the first proofsheets of londons shame with its simple yet thrilling recital of true tales taken down from the very lips of outcast children or stranded women with its awful woodcuts and still more awful descriptionswordpictures reeking with the vice and filth and degradation of the most pestilent overcrowded undrained tenementshe felt instinctively that ernest le bretons book would not need the artificial aid of lady hildas influential friends in order to make it successful and even famous the cabinet ministers might be as silent as they chose the indignant duke might confine his denunciations to the attentive and sympathetic ear of his friend lord connemara but nothing on earth could prevent ernest le bretons fiery and scathing diatribe from immediately  enthralling the public attention lady hilda had hit upon the exact subject which best suited his peculiar character and temperament and he had done himself full justice in it  not that ernest had ever thought of himself or even of his style or the effect he was producing by his narrative it was just the very nonselfconsciousness of the thing that gave it its power he wrote down the simple thoughts that came up into his own eager mind at the sight of so much inequality and injustice and the motto that arthur prefixed upon the titlepage facit indignatio versum aptly described  the keynote of that fierce and angry final denunciation  yes lady hilda had certainly hit the right nail on the head arthur berkeley said to himself more than once a wonderful woman truly that beautiful stately uncompromising brilliant and still really tender hilda tregellis  hilda on her part worked hard and well for the success of ernests book as soon as it appeared nay she even condescended not being what ernest himself would have described as an ethical unit to practise a little gentle hypocrisy in suiting her recommendations of londons shame to the tastes and feelings of her various acquaintances  to her radical cabinet minister friend she openly praised its outspoken zeal for the cause of the people and its value as a wonderful storehouse of useful facts at first hand for political purposes in the increasingly important  outlying metropolitan boroughs just think sir edmund she said persuasively how you could crush any  conservative candidate for hackney or the tower hamlets out of that awful chapter on the east end matchmakers while with the duke to whom she presented a marked copy as a sample of what our revolutionary thinkers were really coming to she insisted rather upon its wicked interference with the natural rights of landlords and its abominable insinuation so subversive of all truly english ideas as to liberty and property that they were bound not to poison their tenants by total neglect of sanitary precautions if i were you now she said to the duke in the most seemingly simpleminded manner possible id just quote those passages  ive marked in pencil in the house tonight on the small urban holdings bill and point out how the wave of continental socialism is at last invading england with its devastating flood and the duke who was a complacent thickheaded obstinate old gentleman congenitally incapable  of looking at any question from any other point of view whatsoever except that of his own order fell headlong passively into lady hildas cruel little trap and murmured to himself as he rolled down luxuriously to the august society of his peers that evening tremendous clever girl hilda tregellis really wave of continental socialism at last invading england with its whatyoumaycallit flood she said if i remember rightly capital sentence to end off ones speech with i declare devizesll positively wonder where i got it from id no idea before that girl took such an intelligent interest in political questions so they want their cottages whitewashed do they whatll they ask for next i wonder do they think were to be content at last with one and ahalf per cent upon the feesimple value of our estates i should like to know why some of the places this writerfellow talks about are on my own property in the rookeryone of the most noisome courtyards in all london he actually calls it whitewash their cottages indeed the lazy improvident creatures theyll be asking us to put down encaustic tiles upon the floors next and to paper their walls with japanese leather or fashionable  dados really the general ignorance that prevails among the working classes as to the clearest principles of political economy is something absolutely appalling  absolutely appalling and his grace scribbled a note in his memorandumbook of hildas readymade peroration for fear he should forget its precise wording before he began to give the house the benefit of his views that night upon the political economy of small urban holdings  next morning all london was talking of the curious coincidence by which a book from the pen of an unknown author published only one day previously had been quoted and debated upon simultaneously in both houses of parliament  on a single evening in the commons sir edmund calverley the distinguished radical minister had read a dozen pages from the unknown work in his declamatory theatrical fashion and had so electrified the house with its graphic and horrible details that even mr fitzgeraldgrenville the wellknown member for the baroness drummondlloyd whose rotten or at least decomposing borough of cherbury minor he faithfully represented in three  successive parliaments had mumbled out a few halfinaudible apologetic sentences about this state of things being truly deplorable and about the necessity for meeting such a  distressing social crisis by the prompt and vigorous application of that excellent specific and familiar panacea a spirited foreign policy in the lords the duke himself by some untoward coincidence had been moved to make a few quotations accompanied by a running fire of essentially ducal criticism from the very selfsame obscure author and to his immense surprise even the members of his own party moved uneasily in their seats during the course of his speech while later in the evening lord devizes muttered to him angrily in the robingroom look here duke youve been and put your foot in it i assure you about that radical book you were illadvised enough to quote from you ought never to have treated the small urban holdings bill in the way you did and just you mark my words the papersll all be down upon you tomorrow morning as sure as daylight  youve given the bystander such an opening against you as youll never forget till your dying day i can tell you and as the duke drove back again after his arduous legislative efforts that evening he said to himself between the puffs at his havana this comes now of allowing oneself to be made a fool of by a handsome woman how the dooce i could ever have gone and taken hilda tregelliss advice on a political question is really more than i can fathomand at my time of life too and yet all the same theres no denying that shes a devilish fine woman by jove if ever there was one  of course everybody asked themselves next day what this book londons shame was like and who on earth its author could be so much so indeed that a large edition was completely exhausted within a fortnight it was the great sensational success of that london season everybody  read it discussed it dissected it corroborated it refuted it fought over it and wrote lengthy letters to all the daily papers about its faults and its merits imitators added their sincerest flattery rivals proclaimed themselves the original discoverers of londons shame one enterprising  author even thought of going to law about it as a question of copyright owners of noisome lanes in the east end trembled in their shoes and sent their agents to inquire into the precise degree of squalor to be found in the filthy courts and alleys where they didnt care to trust their own sensitive aristocratic noses it even seemed as if a little real good was going to come at last out of ernest le bretons impassioned pleadingas if the sensation were going to fall not quite flat at the end of its short run in the clubs and drawingrooms of london as a nine days wonder  and ernest le breton and edie in the little lodgings  at holloway they sat first trembling for the result and ready to burst with excitement when lady hilda up at the unwonted hour of six in the morning tore into their rooms with an early copy of the times to show them the dukes speech and sir edmunds quotations and the editorial leader in which even that most dignified and reticent of british journals condescended to speak with studiously moderated praise of the immense collection of facts so ably strung together by mr ernest le breton in all the legible glory of small capitals too as to the undoubtedly disgraceful  condition of some at least among our london alleys  how edie clung around lady hilda and kissed her and how lady hilda kissed her back and cried over her with tears of happier augury and how they both kissed and cried over unconscious wondering little dot and how lady hilda could almost have fallen upon ernest too as he sat gazing in blank astonishment and delight at his own name in the magnificent small capitals of a times leader  between crying and laughing with much efficient aid in both from good mrs halliss they hardly knew how they ever got through the long delightful hours of that memorable epochmaking  morning  and then there came the gradual awakening to the fact that this was really famefame and perhaps also competence  first in the field of course was the editor of the cosmopolitan review with a polite request that ernest would give the readers of that intensely hotandhot and thoughtful periodical the opportunity of reading his valuable views on the east end outcast question before they had had time to be worth nothing for journalistic purposes through the natural and inevitable cooling of the public interest in this new sensation then his old friends of the morning intelligence once more begged that he would be good enough to contribute a series of signed and headed articles to their columns on the slums and fever dens of povertystricken london next an illustrated weekly asked him to join with his artist friend in getting up another pilgrimage into yet undiscovered metropolitan plaguespots and so before the end of a month ernest le breton for the first time in his life had really got more work to do than he could easily manage and work too that he felt he could throw his whole life and soul into with perfect honesty  when the first edition of londons shame was exhausted  there was already a handsome balance to go to ernest and his artist coadjutor who by the terms of the agreement were to divide between them half the profits  the other half for appearance sake lady hilda and arthur had been naturally compelled to reserve for themselves for of course it would not have been probable that any publisher would have undertaken the work without any hope of profit in any way arthur called upon hilda at lord exmoors house in wilton place to show her the first balancesheet and accompanying cheque what on earth can we do with it he asked seriously we cant divide it between us and yet we cant give it to the poor le bretons i dont see how were to manage  why of course hilda answered promptly put it into the consols or whatever you call it for the benefit of little dot  the very thing arthur answered in a tone of obvious admiration what a wonderfully practical person you really are lady hilda  as to ernest and edie when they got their own cheque for their quarter of the proceeds they gazed in awe and astonishment at the bigness of the figure and then they sat down and cried together like two children with their hands locked in one anothers  and youll get well now ernest dear edie whispered gently why youre ever so much fatter darling already  im sure youll get well in no time now ernest  upon my word edie ernest answered kissing her white forehead tenderly i really and truly believe i shall  its my opinion that sir antony wraxalls an unmitigated ignorant humbug  a few weeks later when ernests remarkable article on how to improve the homes of the poor appeared in one of the leading magazines mr herbert le breton of the education office looked up from his cup of postprandial coffee in his comfortable diningroom at south kensington and said musingly to his young wife do you know ethel it seems to me that my brother ernests going to score a success at last with this slumhunting business that hes lately invented theres an awful lot about it now in all the papers and reviews perhaps it might be as well after all to scrape an acquaintance with him again especially as hes my own brother theres no knowing really when a man of his peculiar illregulated mercurial temperament may be going to turn out famous dont you think youd better find out where theyre living nowtheyve left holloway no doubt since this turn of the tideand go and call upon mrs  ernest  whereto mrs herbert le breton raising her eyes for a moment from the pages of her last new novel answered languidly dont you think herbert itd be better to wait a little while and see how things turn out with them in the long run you know before we commit ourselves by going to call upon them one swallow you see doesnt make a summer does it dear ever whence the acute and intelligent reader will doubtless conclude that mrs  herbert le breton was a very prudent sensible young woman and that perhaps even herbert himself had met at last with his fitting nemesis for what worse purgatory could his bitterest foe wish for a selfishly prudent and coldhearted man than that he should pass his whole lifetime in congenial intercourse with a selfishly prudent and coldhearted wife exactly after his own pattern    chapter xxxvi  out of the hand op the philistines   ernests unexpected success with londons shame was not as arthur berkeley at first feared it might be the mere last dying flicker of a weak and failing life arthur was quite right indeed when he said one day to lady hilda that its very brilliancy and fervour had the hectic glow about it as of a man who was burning himself out too fiercely and rapidly you could read the feverish eagerness of the writer in every line but still lady hilda answered with her  ordinary calm assurance that it was all going well and that ernest only needed the sense of security to pull him round again and as usual lady hildas practical sagacity was not at fault the big pamphletfor it was hardly more than thatsoon proved an opening for further work in procuring which hilda and arthur were again partially instrumental  an advanced radical member of parliament famous for his declamations against the capitalist faction and his enormous holding of english railway stock was induced to come  forward as the founder of a new weekly paper in the interest of social reform of course the thing was got up solely with an idea to utilising ernest as editor for said the great anticapitalist with his usual charming frankness the young fellow has a positive moneyvalue now if hes taken in hand at once before the sensations over and there can be no harm in turning an honest penny by exploiting him you know and starting a popular paper when ernest was offered the post of editor to the new periodical at a salary which almost alarmed him by its plutocratic magnificence for it was  positively no less than six hundred a year he felt for a moment some conscientious scruples about accepting so splendid a post and when lady hilda in her emphatic fashion promptly overruled these nascent scruples by the application  of the very simple solvent formula bosh he felt bound at least to stipulate that he should be at perfect liberty to say whatever he liked in the new paper without interference or supervision from the capitalist proprietor  to which the radical member in his business capacity  immediately responded why certainly what we want to pay you for is just your power of startling people which in its proper place is a very useful marketable commodity  every pig has its valueif only you sell it in the best market  the social reformer a weekly advocate of the new economy achieved at once an immense success among the working classes and grew before long to be one of the most popular journals of the second rank in all london the interest that ernest had aroused by his big pamphlet was carried on to his new venture which soon managed to gain many readers by its own intrinsic merits seen your brothers revolutionary broadsheet le breton asked a friend at the club of herbert not many weeks laterhe was the same person who had found it so very embarrassing to recognise ernestin his shabby days when walking with a qcits a dreadful tissue of the reddest french communism  i believe but still its scored the biggest success of its sort in journalism im told since the days of kenealys englishman bradbury whos found the money to start itdeuced clever fellow in his way bradburyis making an awful lot out of the speculation they say what do you think of the paper eh  herbert drew himself up grimly to tell you the truth he said in his stiffest style i havent yet had time to look at a copy ernest le bretons not a man in whose affairs i feel called upon to take any special interest and i havent put myself to the trouble of reading his secondhand political lucubrations faint echoes of max schurz all of it no doubt and having read and disposed of schurz himself long ago i dont feel inclined now to go in for a second supplementary course of schurz and water  well well that may be so the friend answered turning  over the pages of the peccant periodical carelessly but all the same im afraid your brothers really going to do an awful lot of mischief in the way of setting class against class and stirring up the dangerous orders to recognise their own power you see le breton the real danger of this sort of thing lies in the fact that your brother ernests a more or less educated and cultivated person i dont say hes really got any genuine depth of culturewould you believe it he told me once hed never read rabelais and didnt want toand of course a man of true culture in the grain like you and me now my dear fellow would never dream of going and mistaking these willothewisps of socialism for the real guiding light of regenerated humanityof course not but the dangerous symptom at the present day lies just in the fact that while the papers written for the mob used to be written by vulgar noisy selfmade halfeducated demagogues  theyre sent out now with all the authority and specious respectability of decently instructed and comparatively  literary english gentlemen now nobody can deny that thats a thing very seriously to be regretted and for my part im extremely sorry your brother has been illadvised enough to join the mob thats trying to pull down our  comfortably built and after all eminently respectable even if somewhat patched up old british constitution  the subjects one herbert answered curtly in which i for my part cannot pretend to feel the remotest personal interest  ernest and edie howerer in the little lodgings up at holloway which they couldnt bear to desert even now in this sudden burst of incredible prosperity went their own way as selfcontainedly as usual wholly unconcerned by the nonarrival of mrs herbert on a visit of ceremony or the failure of the social reformer to pierce the lofty ethereal regions of abstract contemplation where herbert himself sat throned like an epicurean god in the pure halo of cultivated pococurantism every day as that eminent medical authority hilda tregellis had truly prophesied ernests cheeks grew less and less sunken and a little colour returned slowly to their midst while edies face was less pale than of old and her smile began to recover something of its oldfashioned girlish joyousness she danced about once more as of old and arthur berkeley when he dropped in of a sunday afternoon for a chat with ernest noticed with pleasure that little miss butterfly was beginning to flit round again almost as naturally  as in the old days when he first saw her light little form among the grey old pillars of magdalen cloisters yet he couldnt help observing too that his feeling towards her was more one of mere benevolence now and less of tender regret than it used to be even a few short months before in the darkest days of edies troubles could it be he asked himself more than once that the tall stately picture of hilda tregellis was overshadowing in his heart the natural photograph  of that unwedded edie oswald that he once imagined was so firmly imprinted there ah well ah well it may be true that a man can love really but once in his whole  lifetime and yet the second spurious imitation is positively sometimes a very good facsimile of the genuine first impression  for all that  as the months went slowly round too the time came in the end for good herr max to be released at last from his long imprisonment on the day that he came out there was a public banquet at the marylebone dancing saloon and all the socialists and communards were there and all the russian nihilists and all the other wicked revolutionary plotters in all london and in the chair sat ernest le breton now the editor of an important social paper while at his left hand to balance the guest of the evening sat arthur berkeley the wellknown dramatic author who was himself more than suspected of being the timid nicodemus of the new faith  and when ernest announced that herr schurz had consented to aid him on the social reformer and to add the wisdom of age to the impetuosity of youth in conducting its future the simple enthusiasm of the wicked revolutionists knew no bounds and they cried hoch and viva and hooray and many other like inarticulate shouts in many varieties of interjectional dialect all the evening and  everybody agreed that after all herr max was very little grayer than before the trial in spite of his long and terrible term of imprisonment  he was a little embittered by his troubles no doubtwhat can you expect if you clap men in prison for the  expression of their honest political convictionsbut ernest tried to keep his eye steadily rather on the future than on the past and with greater ease and unwonted comforts the old mans cheerfulness as well as his enthusiasm gradually returned im too old now to do anything more worth doing myself before i die he used to say holding ernests arm tightly in his vicelike grip but i have great hopes in spite of everything for friend ernest i have very great hopes indeed for friend ernest here theres no knowing yet what he may accomplish  ernest only smiled a trifle sadly and murmured half to himself that this was a hard world and he began himself to fear there was no fitting feeling for a social reformer except one of a brave despair we can do little or nothing after all he said slowly and our only consolation must be that even that little is perhaps just worth doing    chapter xxxvii  land at last but what land   long before the social reformer had fully made its mark in the world another event had happened of no less importance  to some of the chief actors in the little drama whose natural termination it seemed to form while the pamphlet and the paper were in course of maturation arthur berkeley had been running daily in and out of the house in wilton place in what lady exmoor several times described as a positively disgraceful and unseemly manner  what hilda can mean her ladyship observed to her husband more than once by encouraging that odd young mans extraordinary advances in the way she does is really more than i can understand even in her but when the le bretons were fairly launched at last on the favourable flood of full prosperity both hilda and arthur began to feel as though they had suddenly been deprived of a very pleasant common interest after all benevolent counsel on behalf of other people is not so entirely innocent and impersonal in certain cases as it seems to be at first sight  do you know lady hilda berkeley said one afternoon when he had come to pay as it were a sort of farewell visit on the final completion of their joint schemes for restoring happiness to the home of the le bretons our intercourse together has been very delightful and im quite sorry to think that in future we must see so much less of one another than weve been in the habit of doing for the last month or so  hilda looked at him straight and said in her own frank unaffected fashion so am i mr berkeley very sorry very sorry indeed  arthur looked back at her once more and their eyes met  his look was full of admiration and hilda saw it she moved a little uneasily upon the ottoman waiting apparently as though she expected arthur to say something else but arthur looked at her long and steadfastly and said nothing  at last he seemed to wake from his reverie and make up his mind for a desperate venture could he be mistaken  could he have read either record wronghis own heart or hildas eyes no no both of them spoke to him too plainly and evidently his heart was fluttering like a windshaken aspenleaf and hildas eyes were dimming visibly with a tender moisture yes yes yes there was no  misreading possible he knew he loved her he knew she loved him  bending over towards where hilda sat he took her hand in his dreamily and hilda let him take it without a  movement then he looked deeply into her eyes and felt a curious speechlessness coming over him deep down in the ball of his throat  lady hilda he began at last with an effort in a low voice not wholly untinged with natural timidity lady hilda is a working mans son  hilda looked back at him with a sudden look of earnest deprecation not that way mr berkeley she said quietly not that way please youll hurt me if you do you know thats not the way i look at the matter why not simply hilda  berkeley clasped her hand eagerly and raised it to his lips hilda then he said kissing it twice over it shall be hilda  hilda rose and stood before him erect in all her queenlike  beauty so now thats settled she said with a vain endeavour to control her tears of joy dont lets talk about it any more now i cant bear to talk about it theres nothing to arrange arthur whenever you like will suit me but oh im so happy so happy so happyi never thought i could be so happy  nor i arthur answered holding her hand a moment in his tenderly  how strange hilda said again after a minutes delicious  silence its the poor le bretons who have brought us two thus together and yet they were both once our dearest rivals you were in love with edie le breton i was half in love with ernest le breton and nowwhy now arthur i do believe were both utterly in love with one another what a curious little comedy of errors  and yet only a few months ago it came very near being a tragedy rather arthur put in softly  never mind hilda answered in her brightest and most joyous tone as she wiped the joyful tears from her eyes it isnt a tragedy now after all arthur and alls well that ends well  when the countess heard of hildas determinationhilda didnt pretend to go through the domestic farce of asking her mothers consent to her approaching marriageshe said that so far as she was concerned a more shocking or unchristian piece of conduct on the part of a wellbroughtup girl had never yet been brought to her knowledge to refuse lord connemara and then go and marry the son of a common cobbler but the earl only puffed away vigorously at his cheroot and observed philosophically that for his part he just considered himself jolly well out of it this young fellow berkeley mightnt be a man of the sort of family hilda would naturally expect to marry into but he was decently educated and in good society and above all a gentleman you know dont you know and hang it all in these days thats really everything besides berkeley was making a pot of money out of these operas of his the earl understood and as he had always expected that hildad marry some penniless painter or somebody of that sort and be a perpetual drag upon the family exchequer he really didnt see why they need trouble their heads very much about it by george if it came to that he rather  congratulated himself that the girl hadnt taken it into her nonsensical head to run away with the groom or the stableboy as to lynmouth he merely remarked succinctly in his own dialect go it hilda go it my beauty you always were a oneer you know and its my belief you always will be  it was somewhere about the same time that ronald le breton coming back gladdened in soul from a cheerful talk with ernest called round of an evening in somewhat unwonted exultation at selahs lodgings selah he said to her calmly as she met him at the door to let him in herself i want to have a little talk with you  what is it about ronald selah asked with a perfect consciousness in her own mind of what the subject he wished to discourse about was likely to be  why selah ronald went on in his quiet matteroffact unobtrusive manner do you know i think we may fairly consider ernest and edie out of danger now  i hope so ronald selah answered imperturbably  ive no doubt your brotherll get along all right in future and im sure at least that hes getting stronger for he looks ten per cent better than he did three months ago  well selah  well ronald  why in that case you see your objection falls to the ground there can be no possible reason on either side why you should any longer put off marrying me we neednt consider edie now and you cant have any reasonable doubt that i want to marry you for your own sake this time  what a nuisance the man is selah cried impetuously  always bothering a body out of her nine senses to go and marry him have you never read what paul says that its good for the unmarried and widows to abide he was always dead against the advisability of marriage paul was  brother paul was an able and earnest preacher ronald murmured gravely from whose authority i should be sorry to dissent except for sufficient and weighty reason but you must admit that on this particular question he was prejudiced selah decidedly prejudiced and that the balance of the best opinion goes distinctly the other way  selah laughed lightly oh does it she said in her provoking mocking manner then you propose to marry me i suppose on the balance of the best scriptural opinion  not at all selah ronald replied without a touch of anything but grave earnestness in his toneit must be admitted ronald was distinctly lacking in the sense of humour not at all i assure you i propose to marry you because i love you and i believe in your heart of hearts you love me too you provoking girl though youre too proud or too incomprehensible ever to acknowledge it  and even if i do selah asked what then  why then selah ronald answered confidently taking her hand boldly in his own and actually kissing heryes kissing her why then selah suppose we say monday fortnight  its awfully soon selah replied half grumbling you dont give a body time to think it over  certainly not ronald responded quickly taking the handsome face firmly between his two spare hands and kissing her lips half a dozen times over in rapid succession  let me go ronald selah cried struggling to be free and trying in vain to tear down his thin wiry arms with her own strong shapely hands let me go at oncetheres a good boy and ill marry you on monday fortnight or do anything else you like just to keep you quiet after all youre a kindhearted fellow enough and you want looking after and taking care of and if you insist upon it i dont mind giving way to you in this small matter  ronald stepped back a pace or two and stood looking at her a little sadly with his hands folded oh selah he cried in a tone of bitter disappointment dont speak like that to me dont please dont dont tell me that you dont really love methat youre going to marry me for nothing else but out of mere compassion for my weakness and helplessness  selah burst at once into a wild flood of uncontrollable tears oh ronald she cried in her old almost fiercely passionate manner flinging her arms around his neck and covering him with kisses oh ronald how can you ever ask me whether i really really love you you know i love you you know i love you youve given me back life and everything thats dear in it and i never want to live for  anything any longer except to love you and wait upon you and make you happy im stronger than you ronald and i shall be able to do a little to make you happy i do believe  my ways are not your ways nor my thoughts your thoughts my darling but i love you all the better for that ronald i love you all the better for that and if you were to kick me beat me trample on me now ronald i should love you love you love you for ever still  so they two were quietly married with no audience save ernest and edie on that very monday fortnight  when herbert le breton heard of it from his mother a few days later he went home at once to his own eminently cultured home and told mrs le breton the news of course without much detailed allusion to selahs earlier antecedents  and do you know ethel he added significantly i think it was an excellent thing that you decided not to call after all upon ernests wife for im sure itll be a great deal safer for you and me to have nothing to say in any way to the whole faction of them a greengrocers daughter you knowquite unpresentable theyll be all mixed up together in future whichll make it quite impossible to know the one without at the same time knowing the other now itd be just practicable for you to call upon mrs ernest i must admit but to call upon mrs ronald would be really and truly too inconceivable  at the end of the first year of the social reformer the annual balance was duly audited and it showed a very considerable and solid surplus to go into the pocket of the enterprising radical proprietor ernest and herr max scanned it closely together and even ernest could not refrain from a smile of pleasure when he saw how thoroughly successful the doubtful venture had finally turned out  and yet he said regretfully as he looked at the heavy balancesheet what a strange occupation after all for the author of gold and the proletariate to be looking carefully  over the sumtotal of a capitalists final balance to think too that all that money has come out of the hardearned scrapedup pennies of the toiling poor i often wish herr max that even so i had been brought up an honest shoemaker but whether im really earning my salt at the hands of humanity now or not is a deep problem i often have many an uncomfortable internal sigh over to this day  there is work and work friend ernest herr max answered as gently as had been his wont in older years and for my part it seems to me you are better here writing your social reformers than making shoes for a single generation  one man builds for today another man builds for tomorrow and he that plants a fruit tree for his children to eat of is doing as much good work in the world as he that sows the corn in spring to be reaped and eaten at this autumns harvest  perhaps so ernest answered softly i wish i could think so but after all im not quite sure whether if we had all starved eighteen months ago together as seemed so likely then it wouldnt have been the most right thing in the end that could possibly have happened to all of us as things are constituted now there seems only one life thats really worth living for an honest man and thats a martyrs  a martyrs or else a workers and i i greatly fear have managed somehow to miss being either the wind carries us this way and that and when we would do that which is right it drifts us away incontinently into that which is only profitable  dear ernest edie cried in her bright oldfashioned manner from the ofice door dot has come in her new frock to bring daddy home for her birthday dinner as she was promised come quick or your little daughterll be very angry with you and lady hilda berkeley has come too to drive us back in her own brougham now dont be a silly theres a dear or say that you cant drive away from the office of the social reformer in lady hildas brougham
