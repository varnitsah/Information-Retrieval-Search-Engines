   and never a flower at the close     over and gone with the roses       and winter again and the snows  that was not the way i ended it firstbut unsymmetrically preposterously illogically out of passion without artlike a song of the people will you have it the last parthian shaft of a forlorn cupid at the kings left breast and all lefthandedness and underhandedness        and never a flower at the close     over and gone with the roses       not over and gone with the rose  true one rose will outblossom the rest one rose in a bower i speak after my fancies for i am a troubadour you know and won the violet at toulouse but my voice is harsh here not in tune a nightingale out of season for marriage rose or no rose has killed the golden violet  becket madam you do ill to scorn wedded love  eleanor so i do louis of france loved me and i dreamed that i loved louis of france and i loved henry of england and henry of england dreamed that he loved me but the marriagegarland withers even with the putting on the bright link rusts with the breath of the first aftermarriage kiss the harvest moon is the ripening of the harvest and the honeymoon is the gall of love he dies of his honeymoon i could pity this poor world myself that it is no better ordered  henry dead is he my queen what altogether let me swear nay to that by this cross on thy neck gods eyes what a lovely cross what jewels  eleanor doth it please you take it and wear it on that hard heart of yours there                                          gives it to him  henry puts it on      on this left breast before so hard a heart     to hide the scar left by thy parthian dart  eleanor has my simple song set you jingling nay if i took and translated that hard heart into our provençal facilities i could so play about it with the rhyme  henry that the heart were lost in the rhyme and the matter in the metre may we not pray you madam to spare us the hardness of your facility  eleanor the wells of castaly are not wasted upon the desert we did but jest  henry theres no jest on the brows of herbert there what is it herbert      enter herbert of bosham  herbert my liege the good archbishop is no more  henry peace to his soul  herbert i left him with peace on his facethat sweet otherworld smile which will be reflected in the spiritual body among the angels but he longed much to see your grace and the

secret of her whereabouts and the king gave it to his chancellor  fltzurse to this son of a london merchanthow your grace must hate him  eleanor hate him as brave a soldier as henry and a goodlier man but thou dost thou love this chancellor that thou hast sworn a voluntary allegiance to him  fltzurse not for my love toward him but because he had the love of the king how should a baron love a beggar on horseback with the retinue of three kings behind him outroyalling royalty besides he holp the king to break down our castles for the which i hate him  eleanor for the which i honour him statesman not churchman he a great and sound policy that i could embrace him for it you could not see the king for the kinglings  fltzurse ay but he speaks to a noble as tho he were a churl and to a churl as if he were a noble  eleanor pride of the plebeian  fltzurse and this plebeian like to be archbishop  eleanor true and i have an inherited loathing of these black sheep of the papacy archbishop i can see further into a man than our hotheaded henry and if there ever come feud between church and crown and i do not then charm this secret out of our loyal thomas i am not eleanor  fltzurse last night i followed a woman in the city here her face was veiled but the back methought was rosamundhis paramour thy rival i can feel for thee  eleanor thou feel for meparamourrival king louis had no paramours and i loved him none the more henry had many and i loved him none the lessnow neither more nor lessnot at all the cups empty i would she were but his paramour for men tire of their fancies but i fear this one fancy hath taken root and borne blossom too and she whom the king loves indeed is a power in the state rivalay and when the king passes there may come a crash and embroilment as in stephens time and her childrencanst thou notthat secret matter which would heat the king against thee whispers him and he starts nay that is safe with me as with thyself but canst thou notthou art drowned in debtthou shalt have our love our silence and our goldcanst thou notif thou light upon herfree me from her  fitzurse well madam i have loved her in my time  eleanor no my bear thou hast not my courts of love would have held thee guiltless of lovethe fine attractions and repulses the delicacies the subtleties  fitzurse madam i loved according to the main purpose and intent of nature  eleanor i warrant thee thou wouldst hug thy cupid till his ribs cracked enough of this follow me this rosamund day and night whithersoever she goes track her if thou canst even into the kings lodging that i may clenches her fistmay at least have my cry against him and herand thou in thy way shouldst be jealous of the king for thou in thy way didst once what shall i call it affect her thine own self  fitzurse ay but the young colt winced and whinnied and flung up her heels and then the king came honeying about her and this becket her fathers friend like enough staved us from her  eleanor us  fitzurse yea by the blessed virgin there were more than i buzzing round the blossomde tracyeven that flint de brito  eleanor carry her off among you run in upon her and devour her one and all of you make her as hateful to herself and to the king as she is to me  fitzurse i and all would be glad to wreak our spite on the rosefaced minion of the king and bring her to the level of the dust so that the king  eleanor let her eat it like the serpent and be driven out of her paradise     act one   scene ibeckets house in london chamber barely furnished becket unrobing herbert of bosham and servant   servant

tower of strength a bulwark against throne and baronage too heavy for me this off with it herbert  herbert is it so much heavier than thy chancellors robe  becket no but the chancellors and the archbishops together more than mortal man can bear  herbert not heavier than thine armour at thoulouse  becket o herbert herbert in my chancellorship i more than once have gone against the church  herbert to please the king  becket                     ay and the king of kings or justice for it seemd to me but just the church should pay her scutage like the lords but hast thou heard this cry of gilbert foliot that i am not the man to be your primate for henry could not work a miracle make an archbishop of a soldier  herbert                                  ay for gilbert foliot held himself the man  becket am i the man my mother ere she bore me dreamd that twelve stars fell glittering out of heaven into her bosom  herbert                 ay the fire the light the spirit of the twelve apostles enterd into thy making  becket                  and when i was a child the virgin in a vision of my sleep gave me the golden keys of paradise dream or prophecy that  herbert

canterbury minster and spake to the lord god and said o lord i have been a lover of wines and delicate meats and secular splendours and a favourer of players and a courtier and a feeder of dogs and hawks and apes and lions and lynxes am i the man and the lord answerd me thou art the man and all the more the man and then i asked again o lord my god henry the king hath been my friend my brother and mine uplifter in this world and chosen me for this thy great archbishoprick believing that i should go against the church with him and i shall go against him with the church and i have said no word of this to him am i the man and the lord answerd me thou art the man and all the more the man and thereupon methought he drew toward me and smote me down upon the minster floor i fell  herbert         god make not thee but thy foes fall  becket i fell why fall why did he smite me what shall i fall offto please the king once more not fighttho somehow traitor to the king my truest and mine

yet i seem appalldon such a sudden at such an eagleheight i stand and see the rift that runs between me and the king i served our theobald well when i was with him i served king henry well as chancellor i am his no more and i must serve the church this canterbury is only less than rome and all my doubts i fling from me like dust winnow and scatter all scruples to the wind and all the puissance of the warrior and all the wisdom of the chancellor and all the heapd experiences of life i cast upon the side of canterbury our holy mother canterbury who sits with tatterd robes laics and barons thro the random gifts of careless kings have graspt her livings her advowsons granges farms and goodly acreswe will make her whole not one rood lost and for these royal customs these ancient

bread whereupon he asked our mother if i could keep a quiet tongue i my head and not speak till i was spoke to and i answered for myself that i never spoke more than was needed and he told me he would advance me to the service of a great lady and took me ever so far away and gave me a great pat o the cheek for a pretty wench and said it was a pity to blindfold such eyes as mine and such to be sure they be but he blinded em for all that and so brought me nohows as i may say and the more shame to him after his promise into a garden and not into the world and bad me whatever i saw not to speak one word an it ud be well for me in the end for there were great ones who would look after me and to be sure i ha seen great ones todayand then not to speak one word for thats the rule o the garden tho to be sure if i had been eve i the garden i shouldnt ha minded the apple for whats an apple you know save to a child and im no child but more a woman o the world than my lady here and i ha seen what i ha

walter map do you see that great black cloud that hath come over the sun and cast us all into shadow  herbert and feel it too  walter map and see you yon sidebeam that is forced from under it and sets the churchtower over there all ahellfire as it were  herbert ay  walter map it is this black bellsilencing antimarrying burialhindering interdict that hath squeezed out this sidesmile upon canterbury whereof may come conflagration were i thomas i wouldnt trust it sudden change is a house on sand and tho i count henry honest enough yet when fear creeps in at the front honesty steals out at the back and the king at last is fairly scared by this cloudthis interdict i have been more for the king than the church in this matteryea even for the sake of the church for truly as the case stood you had safelier have slain an archbishop than a shegoat but our recoverer and upholder of customs hath in this crowning of young henry by york and london so violated the immemorial usage of the church that like the gravediggers child i have heard of trying to ring the bell he hath halfhanged himself in the rope of the church or rather pulled all the church with the holy father astride of it down upon his own head  herbert were you there  walter map in the church ropeno i was at the crowning for i have pleasure in the pleasure of crowds and to read the faces of men at a great show  herbert and how did roger of york comport himself  walter map as magnificently and archiepiscopally as our thomas would have done only there was a daredevil in his eyei should say a darebecket he thought less of two kings than of one roger the king of the occasion foliot is the holier man perhaps the better once or twice there ran a twitch across his face as who should say whats to follow but salisbury was a calf cowed by mother church and every now and then glancing about him like a thief at night when he hears a door open in the house and thinks the master  herbert and the fatherking  walter map the fathers eye was so tender it would have called a goose off the green and once he strove to hide his face like the greek king when his daughter was sacrificed but he thought better of it it was but the sacrifice of a kingdom to his son a smaller matter but as to the young crownling himself he looked so malapert in the eyes that had i fathered him i had given him more of the rod than the sceptre then followed the thunder of the captains and the shouting and so we came on to the banquet from whence there puffed out such an incense of unctuosity into the nostrils of our gods of church and state that lucullus or apicius might have sniffed it in their hades of heathenism so that the smell of their own roast had not come across it  herbert map tho you make your butt too big you overshoot it  walter map for as to the fish they demiracled the miraculous draught and might have sunk a navy  herbert there again goliasing and goliathising  walter map and as for the flesh at table a whole peters sheet with all manner of game and fourfooted things and fowls  herbert and all manner of creeping things too  walter map well there were abbotsbut they did not bring their women and so we were dull enough at first but in the end we flourished out into a merriment for the old king would act servitor and hand a dish to his son whereupon my lord of yorkhis finecut face bowing and beaming with all that courtesy which hath less loyalty in it than the backward scrape of the clowns heelgreat honour says he from the kings self to the kings son did you hear the young kings quip  herbert no what was it  walter map glancing at the days when his father was only earl of anjou he answeredshould not an earls son wait on a kings son and when the cold corners of the kings mouth began to thaw there was a great motion of laughter among us part real part childlike to be freed from the dulnesspart royal for king and kingling both laughed and so we could not but laugh as by a royal necessitypart childlike againwhen we felt we had laughed too long and could not stay ourselvesmany midriffshaken even to tears as springs gush out after earthquakesbut from those as i said before there may come a conflagrationtho to keep the figure moist and make it hold water i should say rather the lacrymation of a lamentation but look if thomas have not flung himself at the kings feet they have made it up

golden ornaments are stolen from her  henry have i not promised to restore her thomas and send thee back again to canterbury  becket send back again those exiles of my kin who wander faminewasted thro

herbert when i was in mine anger with king louis i sware i would not give the kiss of peace not on french ground nor any ground but english where his cathedral stands mine old friend thomas i would there were that perfect trust between us that health of heart once ours ere pope or king had come between us even nowwho knows i might deliver all things to thy hand if  but i say no more  farewell my

together like two ships in a calm you wrong the king he meant what he said today who shall vouch for his tomorrows one word further doth not the fewness of anything make the fulness of it in estimation is not virtue prized mainly for its rarity and great baseness loathed as an exception for were all my lord as noble as yourself who would look up to you and were all as base aswho shall i sayfitzurse and his followingwho would look down upon them my lord you have put so many of the kings household out of communion that they begin to smile at it  becket at their peril at their peril  walter map for tho the drop may hollow out the dead stone doth not the living skin thicken against perpetual whippings this is the second grain of good counsel i ever proffered thee and so cannot suffer by the rule of frequency have i sown it in salt i trust not for before god i promise you the king hath many more wolves than he can tame in his woods of england and if it suit their purpose to howl for the king and you still move against him you may have no less than to die for it but god and his free wind grant your lordship a happy homereturn and the kings kiss of peace in kent farewell i must follow the king                                       exit  herbert ay and i warrant the customs did the king speak of the customs  becket                       noto die for it i live to die for

be so my friend the wolves of england must murder her one shepherd that the sheep may feed in peace false figure map would say earths falses are heavens truths and when my voice is martyrd mute and this man disappears that perfect trust may come again between us and there there there not here i shall rejoice to find my stray sheep back within the fold the crowd are scattering let us move away

once was at the hunting of a lion roused by the clamour of the chase he woke came to the front of the woodhis monarch mane bristled about his quick earshe stood there staring upon the hunter a score of dogs gnawd at his ankles at the last he felt the trouble of his feet put forth one paw slew four and knew it not and so remaind staring upon the hunter and this rome will crush you if you wrestle with her then save for some slight report in her own senate scarce know what she has done aside would i could move him provoke him any way aloud the lady camma wise i am sure as she is beautiful will close with me that to submit at once is better than a whollyhopeless war our gallant citizens murderd all in vain son husband brother gashd to death in vain and the small state more cruelly trampled on than had she never moved  camma sir i had once a boy who died a babe but were he living and grown to man and sinnatus willd it i would set him in the front rank of the fight with scarce a pang rises sir if a state submit at once she may be blotted out at once and swallowd in the conquerors chronicle whereas in wars of freedom and defence the glory and grief of battle won or lost solders a race togetheryeatho they fail the names of those who fought and fell are like a bankdup fire that flashes out again from century to century and at last may lead them on to victoryi hope so like

crowd may wreak my wrongs upon my wrongers marriage that fine fat hooknosed uncle of mine old harold who leaves me all his land at littlechester he too would oust me from his will if i made such a marriage and marriage in itself the storm is hard at hand will sweep away thrones churches ranks traditions customs marriage one of the feeblest then the man the woman following their best affinities will each bid their old bond farewell with smiles not tears good wishes not reproaches with no fear of the worlds gossiping clamour and no need of veiling their desires
