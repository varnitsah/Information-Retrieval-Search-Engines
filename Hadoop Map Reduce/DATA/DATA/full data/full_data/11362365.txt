some odd acquaintances for he was one of those who have ears to hear and can use their eyes no less than their intelligence he made as many thoughts as stuart mill but his philosophy concerned flesh and blood and was experimental as to its method he was a typehunter among mankind he despised small game and insignificant personalities whether in the shape of dukes or bagmen letting them go by like seaweed but show him a refined or powerful face let him hear a plangent or a penetrating voice fish for him with a living look in some ones eye a passionate gesture a meaning or ambiguous smile and his mind was instantaneously awakened there was a man there was a woman he seemed to say and he stood up to the task of comprehension with the delight of an artist in his art  and indeed rightly considered this interest of his was an artistic interest there is no science in the personal study of human nature all comprehension is creation the woman i love is somewhat of my handiwork and the great lover like the great painter is he that can so embellish his subject as to make her more than human whilst yet by a cunning art he has so based his apotheosis on the nature of the case that the woman can go on being a true woman and give her character free play and show littleness or cherish spite or be greedy of common pleasures and he continue to worship without a thought of incongruity to love a character is only the heroic way of understanding it when we love by some noble method of our own or some nobility of mien or nature in the other we apprehend the loved one by what is noblest in ourselves when we are merely studying an eccentricity the method of our study is but a series of allowances to begin to understand is to begin to sympathise for comprehension comes only when we have stated anothers faults and virtues in terms of our own hence the proverbial toleration of artists for their own evil creations hence too it came about that dick naseby a highminded creature and as scrupulous and brave a gentleman as you would want to meet held in a sort of affection the various human creeping things whom he had met and studied  one of these was mr peter van tromp an englishspeaking twolegged animal of the international genus and by profession of general and more than equivocal utility years before he had been a painter of some standing in a colony and portraits signed van tromp had celebrated the greatness of colonial governors and judges in those days he had been married and driven his wife and infant daughter in a pony trap what were the steps of his declension no one exactly knew here he was at least and had been any time these past ten years a sort of dismal parasite upon the foreigner in paris  it would be hazardous to specify his exact industry coarsely followed it would have merited a name grown somewhat unfamiliar to our ears followed as he followed it with a skilful reticence in a kind of social chiaroscuro it was still possible for the polite to call him a professional painter his lair was in the grand hotel and the gaudiest cafés there he might be seen jotting off a sketch with an air of some inspiration and he was always affable and one of the easiest of men to fall in talk withal a conversation usually ripened into a peculiar sort of intimacy and it was extraordinary how many little services van tromp contrived to render in the course of sixandthirty hours he occupied a position between a friend and a courier which made him worse than embarrassing to repay but those whom he obliged could always buy one of his villainous little pictures or where the favours had been prolonged and more than usually delicate might order and pay for a large canvas with perfect certainty that they would hear no more of the transaction  among resident artists he enjoyed the celebrity of a nonprofessional sort he had spent more moneyno less than three individual fortunes it was whisperedthan any of his associates could ever hope to gain apart from his colonial career he had been to greece in a brigantine with four brass carronades he had travelled europe in a chaise and four drawing bridle at the palacedoors of german princes queens of song and dance had followed him like sheep and paid his tailors bills and to behold him now seeking small loans with plaintive condescension sponging for breakfast on an artstudent of nineteen a fallen don juan who had neglected to die at the propitious hour had a colour of romance for young imaginations his name and his bright past seen through the prism of whispered gossip had gained him the nickname of the admiral  dick found him one day at the receipt of custom rapidly painting a pair of hens and a cock in a little watercolour sketchingbox and now and then glancing at the ceiling like a man who should seek inspiration from the muse dick thought it remarkable that a painter should choose to work over an absinthe in a public café and looked the man over the aged rakishness of his appearance was set off by a youthful costume he had disreputable grey hair and a disreputable sore red nose but the coat and the gesture the outworks of the man were still designed for show dick came up to his table and inquired if he might look at what the gentleman was doing no one was so delighted as the admiral  a bit of a thing said he i just dash them off like that ii dash them off he added with a gesture  quite so said dick who was appalled by the feebleness of the production  understand me continued van tromp i am a man of the world and yetonce an artist always an artist all of a sudden a thought takes me in the street i become its prey its like a pretty woman no use to struggle i mustdash it off  i see said dick  yes pursued the painter it all comes easily easily to me it is not my business its a pleasure life is my businesslifethis great city parisparis after darkits lights its gardens its odd corners aha he cried to be young again the heart is young but the heels are leaden a poor mean business to grow old nothing remains but the coup doeil the contemplative mans enjoyment mr  and he paused for the name  naseby returned dick  the other treated him at once to an exciting beverage and expatiated on the pleasure of meeting a compatriot in a foreign land to hear him you would have thought they had encountered in central africa dick had never found any one take a fancy to him so readily nor show it in an easier or less offensive manner he seemed tickled with him as an elderly fellow about town might be tickled by a pleasant and witty lad he indicated that he was no precisian but in his wildest times had never been such a blade as he thought dick dick protested but in vain this manner of carrying an intimacy at the bayonets point was van tromps stockintrade with an older man he insinuated himself with youth he imposed himself and in the same breath imposed an ideal on his victim who saw that he must work up to it or lose the esteem of this old and vicious patron and what young man can bear to lose a character for vice  as last as it grew towards dinnertime do you know paris asked van tromp  not so well as you i am convinced said dick  and so am i returned van tromp gaily paris my young friendyou will allow mewhen you know paris as i do you will have seen strange things i say no more all i say is strange things we are men of the world you and i and in paris in the heart of civilised existence this is an opportunity mr naseby let us dine let me show you where to dine  dick consented on the way to dinner the admiral showed him where to buy gloves and made him buy them where to buy cigars and made him buy a vast store some of which he obligingly accepted at the restaurant he showed him what to order with surprising consequences in the bill what he made that night by his percentages it would be hard to estimate and all the while dick smilingly consented understanding well that he was being done but taking his losses in the pursuit of character as a hunter sacrifices his dogs as for the strange things the reader will be relieved to hear that they were no stranger than might have been expected and he may find things quite as strange without the expense of a van tromp for guide yet he was a guide of no mean order who made up for the poverty of what he had to show by a copious imaginative commentary  and such said he with an hiccup such is paris  pooh said dick who was tired of the performance  the admiral hung an ear and looked up sidelong with a glimmer of suspicion  goodnight said dick im tired  so english cried van tromp clutching him by the hand so english so blasé such a charming companion let me see you home  look here returned dick i have said goodnight and now im going youre an amusing old boy i like you in a sense but heres an end of it for tonight not another cigar not another grog not another percentage out of me  i beg your pardon cried the admiral with dignity  tut man said dick youre not offended youre a man of the world i thought ive been studying you and its over have i not paid for the lesson au revoir  van tromp laughed gaily shook hands up to the elbows hoped cordially they would meet again and that often but looked after dick as he departed with a tremor of indignation after that they two not unfrequently fell in each others way and dick would often treat the old boy to breakfast on a moderate scale and in a restaurant of his own selection often too he would lend van tromp the matter of a pound in view of that gentlemans contemplated departure for australia there would be a scene of farewell almost touching in character and a week or a month later they would meet on the same boulevard without surprise or embarrassment and in the meantime dick learned more about his acquaintance on all sides heard of his yacht his chaise and four his brief season of celebrity amid a more confiding population his daughter of whom he loved to whimper in his cups his sponging parasitical nameless way of life and with each new detail something that was not merely interest nor yet altogether affection grew up in his mind towards this disreputable stepson of the arts ere he left paris van tromp was one of those whom he entertained to a farewell supper and the old gentleman made the speech of the evening and then fell below the table weeping smiling paralysed     chapter ii  a letter to the papers   old mr naseby had the sturdy untutored nature of the upper middle class the universe seemed plain to him the things right he would say or the things wrong and there was an end of it there was a contained prophetic energy in his utterances even on the slightest affairs he saw the damned thing if you did not it must be from perversity of will and this sent the blood to his head apart from this which made him an exacting companion he was one of the most upright hottempered old gentlemen in england florid with white hair the face of an old jupiter and the figure of an old foxhunter he enlivened the vale of thyme from end to end on his big cantering chestnut  he had a hearty respect for dick as a lad of parts dick had a respect for his father as the best of men tempered by the politic revolt of a youth who has to see to his own independence whenever the pair argued they came to an open rupture and arguments were frequent for they were both positive and both loved the work of the intelligence it was a treat to hear mr naseby defending the church of england in a volley of oaths or supporting ascetic morals with an enthusiasm not entirely innocent of port wine dick used to wax indignant and none the less so because as his father was a skilful disputant he found himself not seldom in the wrong on these occasions he would redouble in energy and declare that black was white and blue yellow with much conviction and heat of manner but in the morning such a licence of debate weighed upon him like a crime and he would seek out his father where he walked before breakfast on a terrace overlooking all the vale of thyme  i have to apologise sir for last night he would begin  of course you have the old gentleman would cut in cheerfully you spoke like a fool say no more about it  you do not understand me sir i refer to a particular point i confess there is much force in your argument from the doctrine of possibilities  of course there is returned his father come down and look at the stables only he would add bear this in mind and do remember that a man of my age and experience knows more about what he is saying than a raw boy  he would utter the word boy even more offensively than the average of fathers and the light way in which he accepted these apologies cut dick to the heart the latter drew slighting comparisons and remembered that he was the only one who ever apologised this gave him a high station in his own esteem and thus contributed indirectly to his better behaviour for he was scrupulous as well as highspirited and prided himself on nothing more than on a just submission  so things went on until the famous occasion when mr naseby becoming engrossed in securing the election of a sound party candidate to parliament wrote a flaming letter to the papers the letter had about every demerit of party letters in general it was expressed with the energy of a believer it was personal it was a little more than half unfair and about a quarter untrue the old man did not mean to say what was untrue you may be sure but he had rashly picked up gossip as his prejudice suggested and now rashly launched it on the public with the sanction of his name  the liberal candidate he concluded is thus a public turncoat is that the sort of man we want he has been given the lie and has swallowed the insult is that the sort of man we want i answer no with all the force of my conviction i answer no  and then he signed and dated the letter with an amateurs pride and looked to be famous by the morrow  dick who had heard nothing of the matter was up first on that inauspicious day and took the journal to an arbour in the garden he found his fathers manifesto in one column and in another a leading article no one that we are aware of ran the article had consulted mr naseby on the subject but if he had been appealed to by the whole body of electors his letter would be none the less ungenerous and unjust to mr dalton we do not choose to give the lie to mr naseby for we are too well aware of the consequences but we shall venture instead to print the facts of both cases referred to by this redhot partisan in another portion of our issue mr naseby is of course a large proprietor in our neighbourhood but fidelity to facts decent feeling and english grammar are all of them qualities more important than the possession of land mr n is doubtless a great man in his large gardens and that halfmile of greenhouses where he has probably ripened his intellect and temper he may say what he will to his hired vassals but as the scots say                      here   he maunna think to domineer  liberalism continued the anonymous journalist is of too free and sound a growth etc  richard naseby read the whole thing from beginning to end and a crushing shame fell upon his spirit his father had played the fool he had gone out noisily to war and come back with confusion the moment that his trumpets sounded he had been disgracefully unhorsed there was no question as to the facts they were one and all against the squire richard would have given his ears to have suppressed the issue but as that could not be done he had his horse saddled and furnishing himself with a convenient staff rode off at once to thymebury  the editor was at breakfast in a large sad apartment the absence of furniture the extreme meanness of the meal and the haggard brighteyed consumptive look of the culprit unmanned our hero but he clung to his stick and was stout and warlike  you wrote the article in this mornings paper he demanded  you are young mr naseby i published it replied the editor rising  my father is an old man said richard and then with an outburst and a damned sight finer fellow than either you or dalton he stopped and swallowed he was determined that all should go with regularity i have but one question to put to you sir he resumed granted that my father was misinformed would it not have been more decent to withhold the letter and communicate with him in private  believe me returned the editor that alternative was not open to me mr naseby told me in a note that he had sent his letter to three other journals and in fact threatened me with what he called exposure if i kept it back from mine i am really concerned at what has happened i sympathise and approve of your emotion young gentleman but the attack on mr dalton was gross very gross and i had no choice but to offer him my columns to reply party has its duties sir added the scribe kindling as one who should propose a sentiment and the attack was gross  richard stood for half a minute digesting the answer and then the god of fair play came uppermost in his heart and murmuring good morning he made his escape into the street  his horse was not hurried on the way home and he was late for breakfast the squire was standing with his back to the fire in a state bordering on apoplexy his fingers violently knitted under his coattails as richard came in he opened and shut his mouth like a codfish and his eyes protruded  have you seen that sir he cried nodding towards the paper  yes sir said richard  oh youve read it have you  yes i have read it replied richard looking at his foot  well demanded the old gentleman and what have you to say to it sir  you seem to have been misinformed said dick  well what then is your mind so sterile sir have you not a word of comment no proposal  i fear sir you must apologise to mr dalton it would be more handsome indeed it would be only just and a free acknowledgment would go far richard paused no language appearing delicate enough to suit the case  that is a suggestion which should have come from me sir roared the father it is out of place upon your lips it is not the thought of a loyal son why sir if my father had been plunged in such deplorable circumstances i should have thrashed the editor of that vile sheet within an inch of his life i should have thrashed the man sir it would have been the action of an ass but it would have shown that i had the blood and the natural affections of a man son you are no son no son of mine sir  sir said dick  ill tell you what you are sir pursued the squire youre a benthamite i disown you your mother would have died for shame there was no modern cant about your mother she thoughtshe said to me sirim glad shes in her grave dick naseby misinformed misinformed sir have you no loyalty no spring no natural affections are you clockwork hey away this is no place for you away waving his hands in the air go away leave me  at this moment dick beat a retreat in a disarray of nerves a whistling and clamour of his own arteries and in short in such a final bodily disorder as made him alike incapable of speech or hearing and in the midst of all this turmoil a sense of unpardonable injustice remained graven in his memory     chapter iii  in the admirals name   there was no return to the subject dick and his father were henceforth on terms of coldness the upright old gentleman grew more upright when he met his son buckrammed with immortal anger he asked after dicks health and discussed the weather and the crops with an appalling courtesy his pronunciation was pointdevice his voice was distant distinct and sometimes almost trembling with suppressed indignation  as for dick it seemed to him as if his life had come abruptly to an end he came out of his theories and clevernesses his premature manoftheworldness on which he had prided himself on his travels shrank like a thing ashamed before this real sorrow pride wounded honour pity and respect tussled together daily in his heart and now he was within an ace of throwing himself upon his fathers mercy and now of slipping forth at night and coming back no more to naseby house he suffered from the sight of his father nay even from the neighbourhood of this familiar valley where every corner had its legend and he was besieged with memories of childhood if he fled into a new land and among none but strangers he might escape his destiny who knew and begin again lightheartedly from that chief peak of the hills that now and then like an uplifted finger shone in an arrow of sunlight through the broken clouds the shepherd in clear weather might perceive the shining of the sea there he thought was hope but his heart failed him when he saw the squire and he remained his fate was not that of the voyager by sea and land he was to travel in the spirit and begin his journey sooner than he supposed  for it chanced one day that his walk led him into a portion of the uplands which was almost unknown to him scrambling through some rough woods he came out upon a moorland reaching towards the hills a few lofty scots firs grew hard by upon a knoll a clear fountain near the foot of the knoll sent up a miniature streamlet which meandered in the heather a shower had just skimmed by but now the sun shone brightly and the air smelt of the pines and the grass on a stone under the trees sat a young lady sketching we have learned to think of women in a sort of symbolic transfiguration based on clothes and one of the readiest ways in which we conceive our mistress is as a composite thing principally petticoats but humanity has triumphed over clothes the look the touch of a dress has become alive and the woman who stitched herself into these material integuments has now permeated right through and gone out to the tip of her skirt it was only a black dress that caught dick nasebys eye but it took possession of his mind and all other thoughts departed he drew near and the girl turned round her face startled him it was a face he wanted and he took it in at once like breathing air  i beg your pardon he said taking off his hat you are sketching  oh she exclaimed for my own amusement i despise the thing  ten to one you do yourself injustice returned dick besides its a freemasonry i sketch myself and you know what that implies  no what she asked  two things he answered first that i am no very difficult critic and second that i have a right to see your picture  she covered the block with both her hands oh no she said i am ashamed  indeed i might give you a hint said dick although no artist myself i have known many in paris i had many for friends and used to prowl among studios  in paris she cried with a leap of light into her eyes did you ever meet mr van tromp  i yes why youre not the admirals daughter are you  the admiral do they call him that she cried oh how nice how nice of them it is the younger men who call him so is it not  yes said dick somewhat heavily  you can understand now she said with an unspeakable accent of contented and nobleminded pride why it is i do not choose to show my sketch van tromps daughter the admirals daughter i delight in that name the admiral and so you know my father  well said dick i met him often we were even intimate he may have mentioned my namenaseby  he writes so little he is so busy so devoted to his art i have had a half wish she added laughing that my father was a plainer man whom i could helpto whom i could be a credit but only sometimes you know and with only half my heart for a great painter you have seen his works  i have seen some of them returned dick theythey are very nice  she laughed aloud nice she repeated i see you dont care much for art  not much he admitted but i know that many people are glad to buy mr van tromps pictures  call him the admiral she cried it sounds kindly and familiar and i like to think that he is appreciated and looked up to by young painters he has not always been appreciated he had a cruel life for many years and when i thinkthere were tears in her eyeswhen i think of that i feel inclined to be a fool she broke off and now i shall go home you have filled me full of happiness for think mr naseby i have not seen my father since i was six years old and yet he is in my thoughts all day you must come and call on me my aunt will be delighted i am sure and then you will tell me allall about my father will you not  dick helped her to get her sketching traps together and when all was ready she gave dick her hand and a frank return of pressure  you are my fathers friend she said we shall be great friends too you must come and see me soon  then she was gone down the hillside at a run and dick stood by himself in a state of some bewilderment and even distress there were elements of laughter in the business but the black dress and the face that belonged to it and the hand that he had held in his inclined him to a serious view what was he under the circumstances called upon to do perhaps to avoid the girl well he would think about that perhaps to break the truth to her why ten to one such was her infatuation he would fail perhaps to keep up the illusion to colour the raw facts to help her to false ideas while yet not plainly stating falsehoods well he would see about that he would also see about avoiding the girl he saw about this last so well that the next afternoon beheld him on his way to visit her  in the meantime the girl had gone straight home light as a bird tremulous with joy to the little cottage where she lived alone with a maiden aunt and to that lady a grim sixty years old scotswoman with a nodding head communicated news of her encounter and invitation  a friend of his cried the aunt what like is he what did ye say was his name  she was dead silent and stared at the old woman darkling then very slowly i said he was my fathers friend i have invited him to my house and come he shall she said and with that she walked off to her room where she sat staring at the wall all the evening miss mglashan for that was the aunts name read a large bible in the kitchen with some of the joys of martyrdom  it was perhaps halfpast three when dick presented himself rather scrupulously dressed before the cottage door he knocked and a voice bade him enter the kitchen which opened directly off the garden was somewhat darkened by foliage but he could see her as she approached from the far end to meet him this second sight of her surprised him her strong black brows spoke of temper easily aroused and hard to quiet her mouth was small nervous and weak there was something dangerous and sulky underlying in her nature much that was honest compassionate and even noble  my fathers name she said has made you very welcome  and she gave him her hand with a sort of curtsey it was a pretty greeting although somewhat mannered and dick felt himself among the gods she led him through the kitchen to a parlour and presented him to miss mglashan  esther said the aunt see and make mr naseby his tea  as soon as the girl was gone upon this hospitable intent the old woman crossed the room and came quite near to dick as if in menace  ye know that man she asked in an imperious whisper  mr van tromp said dick yes i know him  well and what brings ye here she said i couldnt save the motherher thats deadbut the bairn she had a note in her voice that filled poor dick with consternation man she went on what is it now is it money  my dear lady said dick i think you misinterpret my position i am young mr naseby of naseby house my acquaintance with mr van tromp is really very slender i am only afraid that miss van tromp has exaggerated our intimacy in her own imagination i know positively nothing of his private affairs and do not care to know i met him casually in paristhat is all  miss mglashan drew a long breath in paris she said well and what do you think of himwhat do ye think of him she repeated with a different scansion as richard who had not much taste for such a question kept her waiting for an answer  i found him a very agreeable companion he said  ay said she did ye and how does he win his bread  i fancy he gasped that mr van tromp has many generous friends  ill warrant she sneered and before dick could find more to say she was gone from the room  esther returned with the teathings and sat down  now she said cosily tell me all about my father  hestammered dick he is a very agreeable companion  i shall begin to think it is more than you are mr naseby she said with a laugh i am his daughter you forget begin at the beginning and tell me all you have seen of him all he said and all you answered you must have met somewhere begin with that  so with that he began how he had found the admiral painting in a café how his art so possessed him that he could not wait till he got home towell to dash off his idea how this in reply to a question his idea consisted of a cock crowing and two hens eating corn how he was fond of cocks and hens how this did not lead him to neglect more ambitious forms of art how he had a picture in his studio of a greek subject which was said to be remarkable from several points of view how no one had seen it nor knew the precise site of the studio in which it was being vigorously though secretly confected how in answer to a suggestion this shyness was common to the admiral michelangelo and others how they dick and van tromp had struck up an acquaintance at once and dined together that same night how he the admiral had once given money to a beggar how he spoke with effusion of his little daughter how he had once borrowed money to send her a dolla trait worthy of newton she being then in her nineteenth year at least how if the doll never arrived which it appeared it never did the trait was only more characteristic of the highest order of creative intellect how he wasno not beautifulstriking yes dick would go so far decidedly striking in appearance how his boots were made to lace and his coat was black not cutaway a frock and so on and so on by the yard it was astonishing how few lies were necessary after all people exaggerated the difficulty of life a little steering just a touch of the rudder now and then and with a willing listener there is no limit to the domain of equivocal speech sometimes miss mglashan made a freezing sojourn in the parlour and then the task seemed unaccountably more difficult but to esther who was all eyes and ears her face alight with interest his stream of language flowed without break or stumble and his mind was ever fertile in ingenious evasions and  what an afternoon it was for esther  ah she said at last its good to hear all this my aunt you should know is narrow and too religious she cannot understand an artists life it does not frighten me she added grandly i am an artists daughter  with that speech dick consoled himself for his imposture she was not deceived so grossly after all and then if a fraud was not the fraud piety itselfand what could be more obligatory than to keep alive in the heart of a daughter that filial trust and honour which even although misplaced became her like a jewel of the mind there might be another thought a shade of cowardice a selfish desire to please poor dick was merely human and what would you have had him do     chapter iv  esther on the filial relation   a month later dick and esther met at the stile beside the cross roads had there been any one to see them but the birds and summer insects it would have been remarked that they met after a different fashion from the day before dick took her in his arms and their lips were set together for a long while then he held her at arms length and they looked straight into each others eyes  esther he saidyou should have heard his voice  dick said she  my darling  it was some time before they started for their walk he kept an arm about her and their sides were close together as they walked the sun the birds the west wind running among the trees a pressure a look the grasp tightening round a single finger these things stood them in lieu of thought and filled their hearts with joy the path they were following led them through a wood of pine trees carpeted with heather and blueberry and upon this pleasant carpet dick not without some seriousness made her sit down  esther he began there is something you ought to know you know my father is a rich man and you would think now that we love each other we might marry when we pleased but i fear darling we may have long to wait and shall want all our courage  i have courage for anything she said i have all i want with you and my father i am so well off and waiting is made so happy that i could wait a lifetime and not weary  he had a sharp pang at the mention of the admiral hear me out he continued i ought to have told you this before but it is a thought i shrink from if it were possible i should not tell you even now my poor father and i are scarce on speaking terms  your father she repeated turning pale  it must sound strange to you but yet i cannot think i am to blame he said i will tell you how it happened  o dick she said when she had heard him to an end how brave you are and how proud yet i would not be proud with a father i would tell him all  what cried dick go in months after and brag that i meant to thrash the man and then didnt and why because my father had made a bigger ass of himself than i supposed my dear thats nonsense  she winced at his words and drew away but then that is all he asks she pleaded if he only knew that you had felt that impulse it would make him so proud and happy he would see you were his own son after all and had the same thoughts and the same chivalry of spirit and then you did yourself injustice when you spoke just now it was because the editor was weak and poor and excused himself that you repented your first determination had he been a big red man with whiskers you would have beaten himyou know you wouldif mr naseby had been ten times more committed do you think if you can tell it to me and i understand at once that it would be more difficult to tell it to your own father or that he would not be more ready to sympathise with you than i am and i love you dick but then he is your father  my dear said dick desperately you do not understand you do not know what it is to be treated with daily want of comprehension and daily small injustices through childhood and boyhood and manhood until you despair of a hearing until the thing rides you like a nightmare until you almost hate the sight of the man you love and whos your father after all in short esther you dont know what it is to have a father and thats what blinds you  i see she said musingly you mean that i am fortunate in my father but i am not so fortunate after all you forget i do not know him it is you who know him he is already more your father than mine and here she took his hand dicks heart had grown as cold as ice but i am sorry for you too she continued it must be very sad and lonely  you misunderstand me said dick chokingly my father is the best man i know in all this world he is worth a hundred of me only he doesnt understand me and he cant be made to  there was a silence for a while dick she began again i am going to ask a favour its the first since you said you loved me may i see your fathersee him pass i mean where he will not observe me  why asked dick  it is a fancy you forget i am romantic about fathers  the hint was enough for dick he consented with haste and full of hangdog penitence and disgust took her down by a back way and planted her in the shrubbery whence she might see the squire ride by to dinner there they both sat silent but holding hands for nearly half an hour at last the trotting of a horse sounded in the distance the park gates opened with a clang and then mr naseby appeared with stooping shoulders and a heavy bilious countenance languidly rising to the trot esther recognised him at once she had often seen him before though with her huge indifference for all that lay outside the circle of her love she had never so much as wondered who he was but now she recognised him and found him ten years older leaden and springless and stamped by an abiding sorrow  o dick dick she said and the tears began to shine upon her face as she hid it in his bosom his own fell thickly too they had a sad walk home and that night full of love and good counsel dick exerted every art to please his father to convince him of his respect and affection to heal up this breach of kindness and reunite two hearts but alas the squire was sick and peevish he had been all day glooming over dicks estrangementfor so he put it to himself and now with growls cold words and the cold shoulder he beat off all advances and entrenched himself in a just resentment     chapter v  the prodigal father makes his dÉbut at home   that took place upon a thursday on the thursday following as dick was walking by appointment earlier than usual in the direction of the cottage he was appalled to meet in the lane a fly from thymebury containing the human form of miss mglashan the lady did not deign to remark him in her passage her face was suffused with tears and expressed much concern for the packages by which she was surrounded he stood still and asked himself what this circumstance might portend it was so beautiful a day that he was loth to forecast evil yet something must perforce have happened at the cottage and that of a decisive nature for here was miss mglashan on her travels with a small patrimony in brown paper parcels and the old ladys bearing implied hot battle and unqualified defeat was the house to be closed against him was esther left alone or had some new protector made his appearance from among the millions of europe it is the character of love to loathe the near relatives of the loved one chapters in the history of the human race have justified this feeling and the conduct of uncles in particular has frequently met with censure from the independent novelist miss mglashan was now seen in the rosy colours of regret whoever succeeded her dick felt the change would be for the worse he hurried forward in this spirit his anxiety grew upon him with every step as he entered the garden a voice fell upon his ear and he was once more arrested not this time by doubt but by an indubitable certainty of ill  the thunderbolt had fallen the admiral was here  dick would have retreated in the panic terror of the moment but esther kept a bright lookout when her lover was expected in a twinkling she was by his side brimful of news and pleasure too glad to notice his embarrassment and in one of those golden transports of exultation which transcend not only words but caresses she took him by the end of the fingers reaching forward to take them for her great preoccupation was to save time she drew him towards her pushed him past her in the door and planted him face to face with mr van tromp in a suit of french country velveteens and with a remarkable carbuncle on his nose then as though this was the end of what she could endure in the way of joy esther turned and ran out of the room  the two men remained looking at each other with some confusion on both sides van tromp was naturally the first to recover he put out his hand with a fine gesture  and you know my little lass my esther he said this is pleasant this is what i have conceived of home a strange word for the old rover but we all have a taste for home and the homelike disguise it how we may it has brought me here mr naseby he concluded with an intonation that would have made his fortune on the stage so just so sad so dignified so like a man of the world and a philosopher and you see a man who is content  i see said dick  sit down continued the parasite setting the example fortune has gone against me i am just sirrupping a little brandyafter my journey i was going down mr naseby between you and me i was décavé i borrowed fifty francs smuggled my valise past the conciergea work of considerable tactand here i am  yes said dick and here you are he was quite idiotic  esther at this moment reentered the room  are you glad to see him she whispered in his ear the pleasure in her voice almost bursting through the whisper into song  oh yes said dick very  i knew you would be she replied i told him how you loved him  help yourself said the admiral help yourself and let us drink to a new existence  to a new existence repeated dick and he raised the tumbler to his lips but set it down untasted he had had enough of novelties for one day  esther was sitting on a stool beside her fathers feet holding her knees in her arms and looking with pride from one to the other of her two visitors her eyes were so bright that you were never sure if there were tears in them or not little voluptuous shivers ran about her body sometimes she nestled her chin into her throat sometimes threw back her head with ecstasy in a word she was in that state when it is said of people that they cannot contain themselves for happiness it would be hard to exaggerate the agony of richard  and in the meantime van tromp ran on interminably  i never forget a friend said he nor yet an enemy of the latter i never had but twomyself and the public and i fancy i have had my vengeance pretty freely out of both he chuckled but those days are done van tromp is no more he was a man who had successes i believe you knew i had successesto which we shall refer no further pulling down his neckcloth with a smile that man exists no more by an exercise of will i have destroyed him there is something like it in the poets first a brilliant and conspicuous careerthe observed i may say of all observers including the bumbaily and then presto a quiet sly old rustic bonhomme cultivating roses in paris mr naseby  call him richard father said esther  richard if he will allow me indeed we are old friends and now near neighbours and à propos how are we off for neighbours richard the cottage stands i think upon your fathers land a family which i respectand the wood i understand is lord trevanions not that i care i am an old bohemian i have cut society with a cut direct i cut it when i was prosperous and now i reap my reward and can cut it with dignity in my declension these are our little amours propres my daughter your father must respect himself thank you yes just a leetle leetle tinythanks thanks you spoil me but as i was saying richard or was about to say my daughter has been allowed to rust her aunt was a mere duenna hence in parenthesis richard her distrust of me my nature and that of the duenna are poles asunderpoles but now that i am here now that i have given up the fight and live henceforth for one only of my worksi have the modesty to say it is my bestmy daughterwell we shall put all that to rights the neighbours richard  dick was understood to say that there were many good families in the vale of thyme  you shall introduce us said the admiral  dicks shirt was wet he made a lumbering excuse to go which esther explained to herself by a fear of intrusion and so set down to the merit side of dicks account while she proceeded to detain him  before our walk she cried never i must have my walk  let us all go said the admiral rising  you do not know that you are wanted she cried leaning on his shoulder with a caress i might wish to speak to my old friend about my new father but you shall come today you shall do all you want i have set my heart on spoiling you  i will take just one drop more said the admiral stooping to help himself to brandy it is surprising how this journey has fatigued me but i am growing old i am growing old i am growing old andi regret to addbald  he cocked a white wideawake coquettishly upon his headthe habit of the ladykiller clung to him and esther had already thrown on her hat and was ready while he was still studying the result in a mirror the carbuncle had somewhat painfully arrested his attention  we are papa now we must be respectable he said to dick in explanation of his dandyism and then he went to a bundle and chose himself a staff where were the elegant canes of his parisian epoch this was a support for age and designed for rustic scenes dick began to see and appreciate the mans enjoyment in a new part when he saw how carefully he had made it up he had invented a gait for this first country stroll with his daughter which was admirably in key he walked with fatigue he leaned upon the staff he looked round him with a sad smiling sympathy on all that he beheld he even asked the name of a plant and rallied himself gently for an old townbird ignorant of nature this country life will make me young again he sighed they reached the top of the hill towards the first hour of evening the sun was descending heaven the colour had all drawn into the west the hills were modelled in their least contour by the soft slanting shine and the wide moorlands veined with glens and hazelwoods ran west and north in a hazy glory of light then the painter awakened in van tromp  gad dick he cried what value  an ode in four hundred lines would not have seemed so touching to esther her eyes filled with happy tears yes here was the father of whom she had dreamed whom dick had described simple enthusiastic unworldly kind a painter at heart and a fine gentleman in manner  and just then the admiral perceived a house by the wayside and something depending over the house door which might be construed as a sign by the hopeful and thirsty  is that he asked pointing with his stick an inn  there was a marked change in his voice as though he attached some importance to the inquiry esther listened hoping she should hear wit or wisdom  dick said it was  you know it inquired the admiral  i have passed it a hundred times but that is all replied dick  ah said van tromp with a smile and shaking his head you are not an old campaigner you have the world to learn now i you see find an inn so very near my own home and my first thought ismy neighbours i shall go forward and make my neighbours acquaintance no you neednt come i shall not be a moment  and he walked off briskly towards the inn leaving dick alone with esther on the road  dick she exclaimed i am so glad to get a word with you i am so happy i have such a thousand things to say and i want you to do me a favour imagine he has come without a paintbox without an easel and i want him to have all i want you to get them for me in thymebury you saw this moment how his heart turned to painting they cant live without it she added meaning perhaps van tromp and michelangelo  up to that moment she had observed nothing amiss in dicks behaviour she was too happy to be curious and his silence in presence of the great and good being whom she called her father had seemed both natural and praiseworthy but now that they were alone she became conscious of a barrier between her lover and herself and alarm sprang up in her heart  dick she cried you dont love me  i do that he said heartily  but you are unhappy you are strange youyou are not glad to see my father she concluded with a break in her voice  esther he said i tell you that i love you if you love me you know what that means and that all i wish is to see you happy do you think i cannot enjoy your pleasure esther i do if i am uneasy if i am alarmed if oh believe me try and believe in me he cried giving up argument with perhaps a happy inspiration  but the girls suspicions were aroused and though she pressed the matter no further indeed her father was already seen returning it by no means left her thoughts at one moment she simply resented the selfishness of a man who had obtruded his dark looks and passionate language on her joy for there is nothing that a woman can less easily forgive than the language of a passion which even if only for the moment she does not share at another she suspected him of jealousy against her father and for that although she could see excuses for it she yet despised him and at least in one way or the other here was the dangerous beginning of a separation between two hearts esther found herself at variance with her sweetest friend she could no longer look into his heart and find it written in the same language as her own she could no longer think of him as the sun which radiated happiness upon her life for she had turned to him once and he had breathed upon her black and chilly radiated blackness and frost to put the whole matter in a word she was beginning although ever so slightly to fall out of love     chapter vi  the prodigal father goes on from strength to strength   we will not follow all the steps of the admirals return and installation but hurry forward towards the catastrophe merely chronicling by the way a few salient incidents wherein we must rely entirely upon the evidence of richard for esther to this day has never opened her mouth upon this trying passage of her life and as for the admiralwell that naval officer although still alive and now more suitably installed in a seaport town where he has a telescope and a flag in his front garden is incapable of throwing the slightest gleam of light upon the affair often and often has he remarked to the present writer if i know what it was all about sir ill be in short be what i hope he will not and then he will look across at his daughters portrait a photograph shake his head with an amused appearance and mix himself another grog by way of consolation once i have heard him go further and express his feelings with regard to esther in a single but eloquent word a minx sir he said not in anger rather in amusement and he cordially drank her health upon the back of it his worst enemy must admit him to be a man without malice he never bore a grudge in his life lacking the necessary taste and industry of attention  yet it was during this obscure period that the drama was really performed and its scene was in the heart of esther shut away from all eyes had this warm upright sullen girl been differently used by destiny had events come upon her even in a different succession for some things lead easily to others the whole course of this tale would have been changed and esther never would have run away as it was through a series of acts and words of which we know but few and a series of thoughts which any one may imagine for himself she was awakened in four days from the dream of a life  the first tangible cause of disenchantment was when dick brought home a painters arsenal on friday evening the admiral was in the chimneycorner once more sirrupping some brandyandwater and esther sat at the table at work they both came forward to greet the new arrival and the girl relieving him of his monstrous burthen proceeded to display her offerings to her father van tromps countenance fell several degrees he became quite querulous  god bless me he said and then i must really ask you not to interfere child in a tone of undisguised hostility  father she said forgive me i knew you had given up your art  oh yes cried the admiral ive done with it to the judgmentday  pardon me again she said firmly but i do not i cannot think that you are right in this suppose the world is unjust suppose that no one understands you you have still a duty to yourself and oh dont spoil the pleasure of your coming home to me show me that you can be my father and yet not neglect your destiny i am not like some daughters i will not be jealous of your art and i will try to understand it  the situation was odiously farcical richard groaned under it he longed to leap forward and denounce the humbug and the humbug himself do you fancy he was easier in his mind i am sure on the other hand that he was actually miserable and he betrayed his sufferings by a perfectly silly and undignified access of temper during which he broke his pipe in several places threw his brandyandwater into the fire and employed words which were very plain although the drift of them was somewhat vague it was of very brief duration van tromp was himself again and in a most delightful humour within three minutes of the first explosion  i am an old fool he said frankly i was spoiled when a child as for you esther you take after your mother you have a morbid sense of duty particularly for others strive against it my dearstrive against it and as for the pigments well ill use them some of these days and to show that im in earnest ill get dick here to prepare a canvas  dick was put to this menial task forthwith the admiral not even watching how he did but quite occupied with another grog and a pleasant vein of talk  a little after esther arose and making some pretext good or bad went off to bed dick was left hobbled by the canvas and was subjected to van tromp for about an hour  the next day saturday it is believed that little intercourse took place between esther and her father but towards the afternoon dick met the latter returning from the direction of the inn where he had struck up quite a friendship with the landlord dick wondered who paid for these excursions and at the thought that the reprobate must get his pocketmoney where he got his board and lodging from poor esthers generosity he had it almost in his heart to knock the old gentleman down he on his part was full of airs and graces and geniality  dear dick he said taking his arm this is neighbourly of you it shows your tact to meet me when i had a wish for you i am in pleasant spirits and it is then that i desire a friend  i am glad to hear you are so happy retorted dick bitterly theres certainly not much to trouble you  no assented the admiral not much i got out of it in time and herewell here everything pleases me i am plain in my tastes a propos you have never asked me how i liked my daughter  no said dick roundly i certainly have not  meaning you will not and why dick she is my daughter of course but then i am a man of the world and a man of taste and perfectly qualified to give an opinion with impartialityyes dick with impartiality frankly i am not disappointed in her she has good looks she has them from her mother she is devoted quite devoted to me  she is the best woman in the world broke out dick  dick cried the admiral stopping short i have been expecting this let uslet us go back to the trevanion arms and talk this matter out over a bottle  certainly not said dick you have had far too much already  the parasite was on the point of resenting this but a look at dicks face and some recollections of the terms on which they had stood in paris came to the aid of his wisdom and restrained him  as you please he said although i dont know what you meannor care but let us walk if you prefer it you are still a young man when you are my age but however to continue you please me dick you have pleased me from the first and to say truth esther is a trifle fantastic and will be better when she is married she has means of her own as of course you are aware they come like the looks from her poor dear good creature of a mother she was blessed in her mother i mean she shall be blessed in her husband and you are the man dick you and not another this very night i will sound her affections  dick stood aghast  mr van tromp i implore you he said do what you please with yourself but for gods sake let your daughter alone  it is my duty replied the admiral and between ourselves you rogue my inclination too i am as matchmaking as a dowager it will be more discreet for you to stay away tonight farewell you leave your case in good hands i have the tact of these little matters by heart it is not my first attempt  all arguments were in vain the old rascal stuck to his point nor did richard conceal from himself how seriously this might injure his prospects and he fought hard once there came a glimmer of hope the admiral again proposed an adjournment to the trevanion arms and when dick had once more refused it hung for a moment in the balance whether or not the old toper would return there by himself had he done so of course dick could have taken to his heels and warned esther of what was coming and of how it had begun but the admiral after a pause decided for the brandy at home and made off in that direction  we have no details of the sounding  next day the admiral was observed in the parish church very properly dressed he found the places and joined in response and hymn as to the manner born and his appearance as he intended it should attracted some attention among the worshippers old naseby for instance had observed him  there was a drunkenlooking blackguard opposite us in church he said to his son as they drove home do you know who he was  some fellowvan tromp i believe said dick  a foreigner too observed the squire  dick could not sufficiently congratulate himself on the escape he had effected had the admiral met him with his father what would have been the result and could such a catastrophe be long postponed it seemed to him as if the storm were nearly ripe and it was so more nearly than he thought  he did not go to the cottage in the afternoon withheld by fear and shame but when dinner was over at naseby house and the squire had gone off into a comfortable doze dick slipped out of the room and ran across country in part to save time in part to save his own courage from growing cold for he now hated the notion of the cottage or the admiral and if he did not hate at least feared to think of esther he had no clue to her reflections but he could not conceal from his own heart that he must have sunk in her esteem and the spectacle of her infatuation galled him like an insult  he knocked and was admitted the room looked very much as on his last visit with esther at the table and van tromp beside the fire but the expression of the two faces told a very different story the girl was paler than usual her eyes were dark the colour seemed to have faded from round about them and her swiftest glance was as intent as a stare the appearance of the admiral on the other hand was rosy and flabby and moist his jowl hung over his shirtcollar his smile was loose and wandering and he had so far relaxed the natural control of his eyes that one of them was aimed inward as if to catch the growth of the carbuncle we are warned against bad judgments but the admiral was certainly not sober he made no attempt to rise when richard entered but waved his pipe flightily in the air and gave a leer of welcome esther took as little notice of him as might be  aha dick cried the painter ive been to church i have upon my word and i saw you there though you didnt see me and i saw a devilish pretty woman by gad if it were not for this baldness and a kind of crapulous air i cant disguise from myselfif it werent for this and that and tother thingiive forgot what i was saying not that that matters ive heaps of things to say im in a communicative vein tonight ill let out all my cats even unto seventy times seven im in what i call the stage and all i desire is a listener although he were deaf to be as happy as nebuchadnezzar  of the two hours which followed upon this it is unnecessary to give more than a sketch the admiral was extremely silly now and then amusing and never really offensive it was plain that he kept in view the presence of his daughter and chose subjects and a character of language that should not offend a lady on almost any other occasion dick would have enjoyed the scene van tromps egotism flown with drink struck a pitch above mere vanity he became candid and explanatory sought to take his auditors entirely into his confidence and tell them his inmost conviction about himself between his selfknowledge which was considerable and his vanity which was immense he had created a strange hybrid animal and called it by his own name how he would plume his feathers over virtues which would have gladdened the heart of cæsar or st paul and anon complete his own portrait with one of those touches of pitiless realism which the satirist so often seeks in vain  now theres dick he said hes shrewd he saw through me the first time we met and told me sotold me so to my face which i had the virtue to keep i bear you no malice for it dick you were right i am a humbug  you may fancy how esther quailed at this new feature of the meeting between her two idols  and then again in a parenthesis  that said van tromp was when i had to paint those dirty daubs of mine  and a little further on laughingly said perhaps but yet with an air of truth  i never had the slightest hesitation in sponging upon any human creature  thereupon dick got up  i think perhaps he said we had better all be thinking of going to bed and he smiled with a feeble and deprecatory smile  not at all cried the admiral i know a trick worth two of that puss here indicating his daughter shall go to bed and you and i will keep it up till alls blue  thereupon esther arose in sullen glory she had sat and listened for two mortal hours while her idol defiled himself and sneered away his godhead one by one her illusions had departed and now he wished to order her to bed in her own house now he called her puss now even as he uttered the words toppling on his chair he broke the stem of his tobaccopipe in three never did the sheep turn upon her shearer with a more commanding front her voice was calm her enunciation a little slow but perfectly distinct and she stood before him as she spoke in the simplest and most maidenly attitude  no she said mr naseby will have the goodness to go home at once and you will go to bed  the broken fragments of pipe fell from the admirals fingers he seemed by his countenance to have lived too long in a world unworthy of him but it is an odd circumstance he attempted no reply and sat thunderstruck with open mouth  dick she motioned sharply towards the door and he could only obey her in the porch finding she was close behind him he ventured to pause and whisper you have done right  i have done as i pleased she said can he paint  many people like his paintings returned dick in stifled tones i never did i never said i did he added fiercely defending himself before he was attacked  i ask you if he can paint i will not be put off can he paint she repeated  no said dick  does he even like it  not now i believe  and he is drunkshe leaned upon the word with hatred  he has been drinking  go she said and was turning to reenter the house when another thought arrested her meet me tomorrow morning at the stile she said  i will replied dick  and then the door closed behind her and dick was alone in the darkness there was still a chink of light above the sill a warm mild glow behind the window the roof of the cottage and some of the banks and hazels were defined in denser darkness against the sky but all else was formless breathless and noiseless like the pit dick remained as she had left him standing squarely on one foot and resting only on the toe of the other and as he stood he listened with his soul the sound of a chair pushed sharply over the floor startled his heart into his mouth but the silence which had thus been disturbed settled back again at once upon the cottage and its vicinity what took place during this interval is a secret from the world of men but when it was over the voice of esther spoke evenly and without interruption for perhaps half a minute and as soon as that ceased heavy and uncertain footfalls crossed the parlour and mounted lurching up the stairs the girl had tamed her father van tromp had gone obediently to bed so much was obvious to the watcher in the road and yet he still waited straining his ears and with terror and sickness at his heart for if esther had followed her father if she had even made one movement in this great conspiracy of men and nature to be still dick must have had instant knowledge of it from his station before the door and if she had not moved must she not have fainted or might she not be dead  he could hear the cottage clock deliberately measure out the seconds time stood still with him an almost superstitious terror took command of his faculties at last he could bear no more and springing through the little garden in two bounds he put his face against the window the blind which had not been drawn fully down left an open chink about an inch in height along the bottom of the glass and the whole parlour was thus exposed to dicks investigation esther sat upright at the table her head resting on her hand her eyes fixed upon the candle her brows were slightly bent her mouth slightly open her whole attitude so still and settled that dick could hardly fancy that she breathed she had not stirred at the sound of dicks arrival soon after making a considerable disturbance amid the vast silence of the night the clock lifted up its voice whined for a while like a partridge and then eleven times hooted like a cuckoo still esther continued immovable and gazed upon the candle midnight followed and then one of the morning and still she had not stirred nor had richard naseby dared to quit the window and then about halfpast one the candle she had been thus intently watching flared up into a last blaze of paper and she leaped to her feet with an ejaculation looked about her once blew out the light turned round and was heard rapidly mounting the staircase in the dark  dick was left once more alone to darkness and to that dulled and dogged state of mind when a man thinks that misery must have done her worst and is almost glad to think so he turned and walked slowly towards the stile she had told him no hour and he was determined whenever she came that she should find him waiting as he got there the day began to dawn and he leaned over a hurdle and beheld the shadows flee away up went the sun at last out of a bank of clouds that were already disbanding in the east a herald wind had already sprung up to sweep the leafy earth and scatter the congregated dewdrops alas thought dick naseby how can any other day come so distastefully to me he still wanted his experience of the morrow     chapter vii  the elopement   it was probably on the stroke of ten and dick had been half asleep for some time against the bank when esther came up the road carrying a bundle some kind of instinct or perhaps the distant light footfalls recalled him while she was still a good way off to the possession of his faculties and he half raised himself and blinked upon the world it took him some time to recollect his thoughts he had awakened with a certain blank and childish sense of pleasure like a man who had received a legacy overnight but this feeling gradually died away and was then suddenly and stunningly succeeded by a conviction of the truth the whole story of the past night sprang into his mind with every detail as by an exercise of the direct and speedy sense of sight and he arose from the ditch and with rueful courage went to meet his love  she came up to him walking steady and fast her face still pale but to all appearance perfectly composed and she showed neither surprise relief nor pleasure at finding her lover on the spot nor did she offer him her hand  here i am said he  yes she replied and then without a pause or any change of voice i want you to take me away she added  away he repeated how where  today she said i do not care where it is but i want you to take me away  for how long i do not understand gasped dick  i shall never come back here any more was all she answered  wild words uttered as these were with perfect quiet of manner exercise a double influence on the hearers mind dick was confounded he recovered from astonishment only to fall into doubt and alarm he looked upon her frozen attitude so discouraging for a lover to behold and recoiled from the thoughts which it suggested  to me he asked are you coming to me esther  i want you to take me away she repeated with weary impatience take me awaytake me away from here  the situation was not sufficiently defined dick asked himself with concern whether she were altogether in her right wits to take her away to marry her to work off his hands for her support dick was content to do all this yet he required some show of love upon her part he was not one of those toughhided and smallhearted males who would marry their love at the point of the bayonet rather than not marry her at all he desired that a woman should come to his arms with an attractive willingness if not with ardour and esthers bearing was more that of despair than that of love it chilled him and taught him wisdom  dearest he urged tell me what you wish and you shall have it tell me your thoughts and then i can advise you but to go from here without a plan without forethought in the heat of a moment is madder than madness and can help nothing i am not speaking like a man but i speak the truth and i tell you again the things absurd and wrong and hurtful  she looked at him with a lowering languid look of wrath  so you will not take me she said well i will go alone  and she began to step forward on her way but he threw himself before her  esther esther he cried  let me godont touch mewhat right have you to interfere who are you to touch me she flashed out shrill with anger  then being made bold by her violence he took her firmly almost roughly by the arm and held her while he spoke  you know well who i am and what i am and that i love you you say i will not help you but your heart knows the contrary it is you who will not help me for you will not tell me what you want you seeor you could see if you took the pains to lookhow i have waited here all night to be ready at your service i only asked information i only urged you to consider and i still urge you to think better of your fancies but if your mind is made up so be it i will beg no longer i will give you my orders and i will not allownot allow you to go hence alone  she looked at him for a while with cold unkind scrutiny like one who tries the temper of a tool  well take me away then she said with a sigh  good said dick come with me to the stables there we shall get the ponytrap and drive to the junction tonight you shall be in london i am yours so wholly that no words can make me more so and besides you know it and the words are needless may god help me to be good to you esthermay god help me for i see that you will not  so without more speech they set out together and were already got some distance from the spot ere he observed that she was still carrying the handbag she gave it up to him passively but when he offered her his arm merely shook her head and pursed up her lips the sun shone clearly and pleasantly the wind was fresh and brisk upon their faces and smelt racily of woods and meadows as they went down into the valley of the thyme the babble of the stream rose into the air like a perennial laughter on the faraway hills sunburst and shadow raced along the slopes and leaped from peak to peak earth air and water each seemed in better health and had more of the shrewd salt of life in them than upon ordinary mornings and from east to west from the lowest glen to the height of heaven from every look and touch and scent a human creature could gather the most encouraging intelligence as to the durability and spirit of the universe  through all this walked esther picking her small steps like a bird but silent and with a cloud under her thick eyebrows she seemed insensible not only of nature but of the presence of her companion she was altogether engrossed in herself and looked neither to right nor to left but straight before her on the road when they came to the bridge however she halted leaned on the parapet and stared for a moment at the clear brown pool and swift transient snowdrift of the rapids  i am going to drink she said and descended the winding footpath to the margin  there she drank greedily in her hands and washed her temples with water the coolness seemed to break for an instant the spell that lay upon her for instead of hastening forward again in her dull indefatigable tramp she stood still where she was for near a minute looking straight before her and dick from above on the bridge where he stood to watch her saw a strange equivocal smile dawn slowly on her face and pass away again at once and suddenly leaving her as grave as ever and the sense of distance which it is so cruel for a lover to endure pressed with every moment more heavily on her companion her thoughts were all secret her heart was locked and bolted and he stood without vainly wooing her with his eyes  do you feel better asked dick as she at last rejoined him and after the constraint of so long a silence his voice sounded foreign to his own ears  she looked at him for an appreciable fraction of a minute ere she answered and when she did it was in the monosyllableyes  dicks solicitude was nipped and frosted his words died away on his tongue even his eyes despairing of encouragement ceased to attend on hers and they went on in silence through kirton hamlet where an old man followed them with his eyes and perhaps envied them their youth and love and across the ivy beck where the mill was splashing and grumbling low thunder to itself in the chequered shadow of the dell and the miller before the door was beating flour from his hands as he whistled a modulation and up by the high spinney whence they saw the mountains upon either hand and down the hill again to the back courts and offices of naseby house esther had kept ahead all the way and dick plodded obediently in her wake but as they neared the stables he pushed on and took the lead he would have preferred her to await him in the road while he went on and brought the carriage back but after so many repulses and rebuffs he lacked courage to offer the suggestion perhaps too he felt it wiser to keep his convoy within sight so they entered the yard in indian file like a tramp and his wife  the grooms eyebrows rose as he received the order for the ponyphaeton and kept rising during all his preparations esther stood bolt upright and looked steadily at some chickens in the corner of the yard master richard himself thought the groom was not in his ordinary for in truth he carried the handbag like a talisman and either stood listless or set off suddenly walking in one direction after another with brisk decisive footsteps moreover he had apparently neglected to wash his hands and bore the air of one returning from a prolonged nutting ramble upon the grooms countenance there began to grow up an expression as of one about to whistle and hardly had the carriage turned the corner and rattled into the high road with this inexplicable pair than the whistle broke forthprolonged and low and tremulous and the groom already so far relieved vented the rest of his surprise in one simple english word friendly to the mouth of jacktar and the sooty pitman and hurried to spread the news round the servants hall of naseby house luncheon would be on the table in little beyond an hour and the squire on sitting down would hardly fail to ask for master richard hence as the intelligent reader can foresee this groom has a part to play in the imbroglio  meantime dick had been thinking deeply and bitterly it seemed to him as if his love had gone from him indeed yet gone but a little way as if he needed but to find the right touch or intonation and her heart would recognise him and be melted yet he durst not open his mouth and drove in silence till they had passed the main parkgates and turned into the crosscut lane along the wall then it seemed to him as if it must be now or never  cant you see you are killing me he cried speak to me look at me treat me like a human man  she turned slowly and looked him in the face with eyes that seemed kinder he dropped the reins and caught her hand and she made no resistance although her touch was unresponsive but when throwing one arm round her waist he sought to kiss her lips not like a lover indeed not because he wanted to do so but as a desperate man who puts his fortunes to the touch she drew away from him with a knot in her forehead backed and shied about fiercely with her head and pushed him from her with her hand then there was no room left for doubt and dick saw as clear as sunlight that she had a distaste or nourished a grudge against him  then you dont love me he said drawing back from her he also as though her touch had burnt him and then as she made no answer he repeated with another intonation imperious and yet still pathetic you dont love me do you do you  i dont know she replied why do you ask me oh how should i know it has all been lies togetherlies and lies and lies  he cried her name sharply like a man who has taken a physical hurt and that was the last word that either of them spoke until they reached thymebury junction  this was a station isolated in the midst of moorlands yet lying on the great upline to london the nearest town thymebury itself was seven miles distant along the branch they call the vale of thyme railway it was now nearly half an hour past noon the down train had just gone by and there would be no more traffic at the junction until halfpast three when the local train comes in to meet the up express at a quarter before four the stationmaster had already gone off to his garden which was half a mile away in a hollow of the moor a porter who was just leaving took charge of the phaeton and promised to return it before night to naseby house only a deaf snuffy and stern old man remained to play propriety for dick and esther  before the phaeton had driven off the girl had entered the station and seated herself upon a bench the endless empty moorlands stretched before her entirely unenclosed and with no boundary but the horizon two lines of rails a waggon shed and a few telegraph posts alone diversified the outlook as for sounds the silence was unbroken save by the chant of the telegraph wires and the crying of the plovers on the waste with the approach of midday the wind had more and more fallen it was now sweltering hot and the air trembled in the sunshine  dick paused for an instant on the threshold of the platform then in two steps he was by her side and speaking almost with a sob  esther he said have pity on me what have i done can you not forgive me esther you loved me oncecan you not love me still  how can i tell you how am i to know she answered you are all a lie to meall a lie from first to last you were laughing at my folly playing with me like a child at the very time when you declared you loved me which was true was any of it true or was it all all a mockery i am weary trying to find out and you say i loved you i loved my fathers friend i never loved i never heard of you until that man came home and i began to find myself deceived give me back my father be what you were before and you may talk of love indeed  then you cannot forgive mecannot he asked  i have nothing to forgive she answered you do not understand  is that your last word esther said he very white and biting his lip to keep it still  yes that is my last word replied she  then we are here on false pretences and we stay here no longer he said had you still loved me right or wrong i should have taken you away because then i could have made you happy but as it isi must speak plainlywhat you propose is degrading to you and an insult to me and a rank unkindness to your father your father may be this or that but you should use him like a fellowcreature  what do you mean she flashed i leave him my house and all my money it is more than he deserves i wonder you dare speak to me about that man and besides it is all he cares for let him take it and let me never hear from him again  i thought you romantic about fathers he said  is that a taunt she demanded  no he replied it is an argument no one can make you like him but dont disgrace him in his own eyes he is old esther old and broken down even i am sorry for him and he has been the loss of all i cared for write to your aunt when i see her answer you can leave quietly and naturally and i will take you to your aunts door but in the meantime you must go home you have no money and so you are helpless and must do as i tell you and believe me esther i do all for your good and your good only so god help me  she had put her hand into her pocket and withdrawn it empty  i counted upon you she wailed  you counted rightly then he retorted i will not to please you for a moment make both of us unhappy for our lives and since i cannot marry you we have only been too long away and must go home at once  dick she cried suddenly perhaps i mightperhaps in timeperhaps  there is no perhaps about the matter interrupted dick i must go and bring the phaeton  and with that he strode from the station all in a glow of passion and virtue esther whose eyes had come alive and her cheeks flushed during these last words relapsed in a second into a state of petrifaction she remained without motion during his absence and when he returned suffered herself to be put back into the phaeton and driven off on the return journey like an idiot or a tired child compared with what she was now her condition of the morning seemed positively natural she sat cold and white and silent and there was no speculation in her eyes poor dick flailed and flailed at the pony and once tried to whistle but his courage was going down huge clouds of despair gathered together in his soul and from time to time their darkness was divided by a piercing flash of longing and regret he had lost his lovehe had lost his love for good  the pony was tired and the hills very long and steep and the air sultrier than ever for now the breeze began to fail entirely it seemed as if this miserable drive would never be done as if poor dick would never be able to go away and be comfortably wretched by himself for all his desire was to escape from her presence and the reproach of her averted looks he had lost his love he thoughthe had lost his love for good  they were already not far from the cottage when his heart again faltered and he appealed to her once more speaking low and eagerly in broken phrases  i cannot live without your love he concluded  i do not understand what you mean she replied and i believe with perfect truth  then said he wounded to the quick your aunt might come and fetch you herself of course you can command me as you please but i think it would be better so  oh yes she said wearily better so  this was the only exchange of words between them till about four oclock the phaeton mounting the lane opened out the cottage between the leafy banks thin smoke went straight up from the chimney the flowers in the garden the hawthorn in the lane hung down their heads in the heat the stillness was broken only by the sound of hoofs for right before the gate a livery servant rode slowly up and down leading a saddle horse and in this last dick shuddered to identify his fathers chestnut  alas poor richard what should this portend  the servant as in duty bound dismounted and took the phaeton into his keeping yet dick thought he touched his hat to him with something of a grin esther passive as ever was helped out and crossed the garden with a slow and mechanical gait and dick following close behind her heard from within the cottage his fathers voice upraised in an anathema and the shriller tones of the admiral responding in the key of war     chapter viii  battle royal   squire naseby on sitting down to lunch had inquired for dick whom he had not seen since the day before at dinner and the servant answering awkwardly that master richard had come back but had gone out again with the ponyphaeton his suspicions became aroused and he crossquestioned the man until the whole was out it appeared from this report that dick had been going about for nearly a month with a girl in the valea miss van tromp that she lived near lord trevanions upper wood that recently miss van tromps papa had returned home from foreign parts after a prolonged absence that this papa was an old gentleman very chatty and free with his money in the publichousewhereupon mr nasebys face became encrimsoned that the papa furthermore was said to be an admiralwhereupon mr naseby spat out a whistle brief and fierce as an oath that master dick seemed very friendly with the papagod help him said mr naseby that last night master dick had not come in and today he had driven away in the phaeton with the young lady  young woman corrected mr naseby  yes sir said the man who had been unwilling enough to gossip from the first and was now cowed by the effect of his communications on the master young woman sir  had they luggage demanded the squire  yes sir  mr naseby was silent for a moment struggling to keep down his emotion and he mastered it so far as to mount into the sarcastic vein when he was in the nearest danger of melting into the sorrowful  and was thisthis van dunk with them he asked dwelling scornfully on the name  the servant believed not and being eager to shift the responsibility to other shoulders suggested that perhaps the master had better inquire further from george the stableman in person  tell him to saddle the chestnut and come with me and then you can take away this trash added mr naseby pointing to the luncheon and he arose lordly in his anger and marched forth upon the terrace to await his horse  there dicks old nurse shrunk up to him for the news went like wildfire over naseby house and timidly expressed a hope that there was nothing much amiss with the young master  ill pull him through the squire said grimly as though he meant to pull him through a threshingmill ill save him from this gang god help him with the next he has a taste for low company and no natural affections to steady him his father was no society for him he must go fuddling with a dutchman nance and now hes caught let us pray hell take the lesson he added more gravely but youth is here to make troubles and age to pull them out again  nance whimpered and recalled several episodes of dicks childhood which moved mr naseby to blow his nose and shake her hard by the hand and then the horse having arrived opportunely to get himself without delay into the saddle and canter off  he rode straight hot spur to thymebury where as was to be expected he could glean no tidings of the runaways they had not been seen at the george they had not been seen at the station the shadow darkened on mr nasebys face the junction did not occur to him his last hope was for van tromps cottage thither he bade george guide him and thither he followed nursing grief anxiety and indignation in his heart  here it is sir said george stopping  what on my own land he cried hows this i let this place to somebodymwhirter or mglashan  miss mglashan was the young ladys aunt sir i believe returned george  aydummies said the squire i shall whistle for my rent too here take my horse  the admiral this hot afternoon was sitting by the window with a long glass he already knew the squire by sight and now seeing him dismount before the cottage and come striding through the garden concluded without doubt he was there to ask for esthers hand  this is why the girl is not yet home he thought a very suitable delicacy on young nasebys part  and he composed himself with some pomp answered the loud rattle of the ridingwhip upon the door with a dulcet invitation to enter and coming forward with a bow and a smile mr naseby i believe said he  the squire came armed for battle took in his man from top to toe in one rapid and scornful glance and decided on a course at once he must let the fellow see that he understood him  you are mr van tromp he returned roughly and without taking any notice of the proffered hand  the same sir replied the admiral pray be seated  no sir said the squire pointblank i will not be seated i am told that you are an admiral he added  no sir i am not an admiral returned van tromp who now began to grow nettled and enter into the spirit of the interview  then why do you call yourself one sir  i have to ask your pardon i do not says van tromp as grand as the pope  but nothing was of avail against the squire  you sail under false colours from beginning to end he said your very house was taken under a sham name  it is not my house i am my daughters guest replied the admiral if it were my house  well said the squire what then hey  the admiral looked at him nobly but was silent  look here said mr naseby this intimidation is a waste of time it is thrown away on me sir it will not succeed with me i will not permit you even to gain time by your fencing now sir i presume you understand what brings me here  i am entirely at a loss to account for your intrusion bows and waves van tromp  i will try to tell you then i come here as a fatherdown came the ridingwhip upon the tablei have right and justice upon my side i understand your calculations but you calculated without me i am a man of the world and i see through you and your manoeuvres i am dealing now with a conspiracyi stigmatise it as such and i will expose it and crush it and now i order you to tell me how far things have gone and whither you have smuggled my unhappy son  my god sir van tromp broke out i have had about enough of this your son god knows where he is for me what the devil have i to do with your son my daughter is out for the matter of that i might ask you where she is and what would you say to that but this is all midsummer madness name your business distinctly and be off  how often am i to tell you cried the squire where did your daughter take my son today in that cursed pony carriage  in a pony carriage repeated van tromp  yes sirwith luggage  luggagevan tromp had turned a little pale  luggage i saidluggage shouted naseby you may spare me this dissimulation wheres my son you are speaking to a father sir a father  but sir if this be true out came van tromp in a new key it is i who have an explanation to demand  precisely there is the conspiracy retorted naseby oh he added i am a man of the world i can see through and through you  van tromp began to understand  you speak a great deal about being a father mr naseby said he i believe you forget that the appellation is common to both of us i am at a loss to figure to myself however dimly how any mani have not said any gentlemancould so brazenly insult another as you have been insulting me since you entered this house for the first time i appreciate your base insinuations and i despise them and you you were i am told a manufacturer i am an artist i have seen better days i have moved in societies where you would not be received and dined where you would be glad to pay a pound to see me dining the socalled aristocracy of wealth sir i despise i refuse to help you i refuse to be helped by you there lies the door  and the admiral stood forth in a halo  it was then that dick entered he had been waiting in the porch for some time back and esther had been listlessly standing by his side he had put out his hand to bar her entrance and she had submitted without surprise and though she seemed to listen she scarcely appeared to comprehend dick on his part was as white as a sheet his eyes burned and his lips trembled with anger as he thrust the door suddenly open introduced esther with ceremonious gallantry and stood forward and knocked his hat firmer on his head like a man about to leap  what is all this he demanded  is this your father mr naseby inquired the admiral  it is said the young man  i make you my compliments returned van tromp  dick cried his father suddenly breaking forth it is not too late is it i have come here in time to save you come come away with mecome away from this place  and he fawned upon dick with his hands  keep your hands off me cried dick not meaning unkindness but because his nerves were shattered by so many successive miseries  no no said the old man dont repulse your father dick when he has come here to save you dont repulse me my boy perhaps i have not been kind to you not quite considerate too harsh my boy it was not for want of love think of old times i was kind to you then was i not when you were a child and your mother was with us mr naseby was interrupted by a sort of sob dick stood looking at him in a maze come away pursued the father in a whisper you need not be afraid of any consequences i am a man of the world dick and she can have no claim on youno claim i tell you and well be handsome too dickwell give them a good round figure father and daughter and theres an end  he had been trying to get dick towards the door but the latter stood off  you had better take care sir how you insult that lady said the son as black as night  you would not choose between your father and your mistress said the father  what do you call her sir cried dick high and clear  forbearance and patience were not among mr nasebys qualities  i called her your mistress he shouted and i might have called her a   that is an unmanly lie replied dick slowly  dick cried the father dick  i do not care said the son strengthening himself against his own heart ii have said it and its the truth  there was a pause  dick said the old man at last in a voice that was shaken as by a gale of wind i am going i leave you with your friends sirwith your friends i came to serve you and now i go away a broken man for years i have seen this coming and now it has come you never loved me now you have been the death of me you may boast of that now i leave you god pardon you  with that he was gone and the three who remained together heard his horses hoofs descend the lane esther had not made a sign throughout the interview and still kept silence now that it was over but the admiral who had once or twice moved forward and drawn back again now advanced for good  you are a man of spirit sir said he to dick but though i am no friend to parental interference i will say that you were heavy on the governor then he added with a chuckle you began richard with a silver spoon and here you are in the water like the rest work work nothing like work you have parts you have manners why with application you may die a millionaire  dick shook himself he took esther by the hand looking at her mournfully  then this is farewell he said  yes she answered there was no tone in her voice and she did not return his gaze  for ever added dick  for ever she repeated mechanically  i have had hard measure he continued in time i believe i could have shown you i was worthy and there was no time long enough to show how much i loved you but it was not to be i have lost all  he relinquished her hand still looking at her and she turned to leave the room  why what in fortunes name is the meaning of all this cried van tromp esther come back  let her go said dick and he watched her disappear with strangely mingled feelings for he had fallen into that stage when men have the vertigo of misfortune court the strokes of destiny and rush towards anything decisive that it may free them from suspense though at the cost of ruin it is one of the many minor forms of suicide  she did not love me he said turning to her father  i feared as much said he when i sounded her poor dick poor dick and yet i believe i am as much cut up as you are i was born to see others happy  you forget returned dick with something like a sneer that i am now a pauper  van tromp snapped his fingers  tut said he esther has plenty for us all  dick looked at him with some wonder it had never dawned upon him that this shiftless thriftless worthless sponging parasite was yet after all and in spite of all not mercenary in the issue of his thoughts yet so it was  now said dick i must go  go cried van tromp where not one foot mr richard naseby here you shall stay in the meantime andwell and do something practicaladvertise for a situation as private secretaryand when you have it go and welcome but in the meantime sir no false pride we must stay with our friends we must sponge a while on papa van tromp who has sponged so often upon us  by god cried dick i believe you are the best of the lot  dick my boy replied the admiral winking you mark me i am not the worst  then why began dick and then paused but esther he began again once more to interrupt himself the fact is admiral he came out with it roundly now your daughter wished to run away from you today and i only brought her back with difficulty  in the pony carriage asked the admiral with the silliness of extreme surprise  yes dick answered  why what the devil was she running away from  dick found the question unusually hard to answer  why said he you know youre a bit of a rip  i behave to that girl sir like an archdeacon replied van tromp warmly  wellexcuse mebut you know you drink insisted dick  i know that i was a sheet in the winds eye sir onceonce only since i reached this place retorted the admiral and even then i was fit for any drawingroom i should like you to tell me how many fathers lay and clerical go upstairs every day with a face like a lobster and cods eyesand are dull upon the back of itnot even mirth for the money no if thats what she runs for all i say is let her run  you see dick tried it again she has fancies  confound her fancies cried van tromp i used her kindly she had her own way i was her father besides i had taken quite a liking to the girl and meant to stay with her for good but i tell you what it is dick since she has trifled with youoh yes she did thoughand since her old papas not good enough for herthe devil take her say i  you will be kind to her at least said dick  i never was unkind to a living soul replied the admiral firm i can be but not unkind  well said dick offering his hand god bless you and farewell  the admiral swore by all his gods he should not go dick he said you are a selfish dog you forget your old admiral you wouldnt leave him alone would you  it was useless to remind him that the house was not his to dispose of that being a class of considerations to which his intelligence was closed so dick tore himself off by force and shouting a goodbye made off along the lane to thymebury     chapter ix  in which the liberal editor appears as deus ex machinÂ   it was perhaps a week later as old mr naseby sat brooding in his study that there was shown in upon him on urgent business a little hectic gentleman shabbily attired  i have to ask pardon for this intrusion mr naseby he said but i come here to perform a duty my card has been sent in but perhaps you may not know what it does not tell you that i am the editor of the thymebury star  mr naseby looked up indignant  i cannot fancy he said that we have much in common to discuss  i have only a word to sayone piece of information to communicate some months ago we hadyou will pardon my referring to it it is absolutely necessarybut we had an unfortunate difference as to facts  have you come to apologise asked the squire sternly  no sir to mention a circumstance on the morning in question your son mr richard naseby  i do not permit his name to be mentioned  you will however permit me replied the editor  you are cruel said the squire he was right he was a broken man  then the editor described dicks warning visit and how he had seen in the lads eye that there was a thrashing in the wind and had escaped through pity onlyso the editor put itthrough pity only sir and oh sir he went on if you had seen him speaking up for you i am sure you would have been proud of your son i know i admired the lad myself and indeed thats what brings me here  i have misjudged him said the squire do you know where he is  yes sir he lies sick at thymebury  you can take me to him  i can  i pray god he may forgive me said the father  and he and the editor made posthaste for the country town  next day the report went abroad that mr richard was reconciled to his father and had been taken home to naseby house he was still ailing it was said and the squire nursed him like the proverbial woman rumour in this instance did no more than justice to the truth and over the sickbed many confidences were exchanged and clouds that had been growing for years passed away in a few hours and as fond mankind loves to hope for ever many long talks had been fruitless in external action though fruitful for the understanding of the pair but at last one showery tuesday the squire might have been observed upon his way to the cottage in the lane  the old gentleman had arranged his features with a view to selfcommand rather than external cheerfulness and he entered the cottage on his visit of conciliation with the bearing of a clergyman come to announce a death  the admiral and his daughter were both within and both looked upon their visitor with more surprise than favour  sir said he to van tromp i am told i have done you much injustice  there came a little sound in esthers throat and she put her hand suddenly to her heart  you have sir and the acknowledgment suffices replied the admiral i am prepared sir to be easy with you since i hear you have made it up with my friend dick but let me remind you that you owe some apologies to this young lady also  i shall have the temerity to ask for more than her forgiveness said the squire miss van tromp he continued once i was in great distress and knew nothing of you or your character but i believe you will pardon a few rough words to an old man who asks forgiveness from his heart i have heard much of you since then for you have a fervent advocate in my house i believe you will understand that i speak of my son he is i regret to say very far from well he does not pick up as the doctors had expected he has a great deal upon his mind and to tell you the truth my girl if you wont help us i am afraid i shall lose him come now forgive him i was angry with him once myself and i found i was in the wrong this is only a misunderstanding like the other believe me and with one kind movement you may give happiness to him and to me and to yourself  esther made a movement towards the door but long before she reached it she had broken forth sobbing  it is all right said the admiral i understand the sex let me make you my compliments mr naseby  the squire was too much relieved to be angry  my dear said he to esther you must not agitate yourself  she had better go up and see him right away suggested van tromp  i had not ventured to propose it replied the squire les convenances i believe  je men fiche cried the admiral snapping his fingers she shall go and see my friend dick run and get ready esther  esther obeyed  she has nothas not run away again inquired mr naseby as soon as she was gone  no said van tromp not again she is a devilish odd girl though mind you that  but i cannot stomach the man with the carbuncles thought the squire  and this is why there is a new household and a brandnew baby in naseby dower house and why the great van tromp lives in pleasant style upon the shores of england and why twentysix individual copies of the thymebury star are received daily at the door of naseby

bournemouth     the merry men     chapter i  eilean aros   it was a beautiful morning in the late july when i set forth on foot for the last time for aros a boat had put me ashore the night before at grisapol i had such breakfast as the little inn afforded and leaving all my baggage till i had an occasion to come round for it by sea struck right across the promontory with a cheerful heart  i was far from being a native of these parts springing as i did from an unmixed lowland stock but an uncle of mine gordon darnaway after a poor rough youth and some years at sea had married a young wife in the islands mary maclean she was called the last of her family and when she died in giving birth to a daughter aros the seagirt farm had remained in his possession it brought him in nothing but the means of life as i was well aware but he was a man whom illfortune had pursued he feared cumbered as he was with the young child to make a fresh adventure upon life and remained in aros biting his nails at destiny years passed over his head in that isolation and brought neither help nor contentment meantime our family was dying out in the lowlands there is little luck for any of that race and perhaps my father was the luckiest of all for not only was he one of the last to die but he left a son to his name and a little money to support it i was a student of edinburgh university living well enough at my own charges but without kith or kin when some news of me found its way to uncle gordon on the ross of grisapol and he as he was a man who held blood thicker than water wrote to me the day he heard of my existence and taught me to count aros as my home thus it was that i came to spend my vacations in that part of the country so far from all society and comfort between the codfish and the moorcocks and thus it was that now when i had done with my classes i was returning thither with so light a heart that july day  the ross as we call it is a promontory neither wide nor high but as rough as god made it to this day the deep sea on either hand of it full of rugged isles and reefs most perilous to seamenall overlooked from the eastward by some very high cliffs and the great peak of ben kyaw the mountain of the mist they say the words signify in the gaelic tongue and it is well named for that hilltop which is more than three thousand feet in height catches all the clouds that come blowing from the seaward and indeed i used often to think that it must make them for itself since when all heaven was clear to the sea level there would ever be a streamer on ben kyaw it brought water too and was mossy2 to the top in consequence i have seen us sitting in broad sunshine on the ross and the rain falling black like crape upon the mountain but the wetness of it made it often appear more beautiful to my eyes for when the sun struck upon the hillsides there were many wet rocks and watercourses that shone like jewels even as far as aros fifteen miles away  the road that i followed was a cattletrack it twisted so as nearly to double the length of my journey it went over rough boulders so that a man had to leap from one to another and through soft bottoms where the moss came nearly to the knee there was no cultivation anywhere and not one house in the ten miles from grisapol to aros houses of course there werethree at least but they lay so far on the one side or the other that no stranger could have found them from the track a large part of the ross is covered with big granite rocks some of them larger than a tworoomed house one beside another with fern and deep heather in between them where the vipers breed any way the wind was it was always sea air as salt as on a ship the gulls were as free as moorfowl over all the ross and whenever the way rose a little your eye would kindle with the brightness of the sea from the very midst of the land on a day of wind and a high spring i have heard the roost roaring like a battle where it runs by aros and the great and fearful voices of the breakers that we call the merry men  aros itselfaros jay i have heard the natives call it and they say it means the house of godaros itself was not properly a piece of the ross nor was it quite an islet it formed the southwest corner of the land fitted close to it and was in one place only separated from the coast by a little gut of the sea not forty feet across the narrowest when the tide was full this was clear and still like a pool on a land river only there was a difference in the weeds and fishes and the water itself was green instead of brown but when the tide went out in the bottom of the ebb there was a day or two in every month when you could pass dryshod from aros to the mainland there was some good pasture where my uncle fed the sheep he lived on perhaps the feed was better because the ground rose higher on the islet than the main level of the ross but this i am not skilled enough to settle the house was a good one for that country two stories high it looked westward over a bay with a pier hard by for a boat and from the door you could watch the vapours blowing on ben kyaw  on all this part of the coast and especially near aros these great granite rocks that i have spoken of go down together in troops into the sea like cattle on a summers day there they stand for all the world like their neighbours ashore only the salt water sobbing between them instead of the quiet earth and clots of seapink blooming on their sides instead of heather and the great seaconger to wreathe about the base of them instead of the poisonous viper of the land on calm days you can go wandering between them in a boat for hours echoes following you about the labyrinth but when the sea is up heaven help the man that hears that caldron boiling  off the southwest end of aros these blocks are very many and much greater in size indeed they must grow monstrously bigger out to sea for there must be ten sea miles of open water sown with them as thick as a country place with houses some standing thirty feet above the tides some covered but all perilous to ships so that on a clear westerly blowing day i have counted from the top of aros the great rollers breaking white and heavy over as many as sixandforty buried reefs but it is nearer in shore that the danger is worst for the tide here running like a millrace makes a long belt of broken watera roost we call itat the tail of the land i have often been out there in a dead calm at the slack of the tide and a strange place it is with the sea swirling and combing up and boiling like the caldrons of a linn and now and again a little dancing mutter of sound as though the roost were talking to itself but when the tide begins to run again and above all in heavy weather there is no man could take a boat within half a mile of it nor a ship afloat that could either steer or live in such a place you can hear the roaring of it six miles away at the seaward end there comes the strongest of the bubble and its here that these big breakers dance togetherthe dance of death it may be calledthat have got the name in these parts of the merry men i have heard it said that they run fifty feet high but that must be the green water only for the spray runs twice as high as that whether they got the name from their movements which are swift and antic or from the shouting they make about the turn of the tide so that all aros shakes with it is more than i can tell  the truth is that in a southwesterly wind that part of our archipelago is no better than a trap if a ship got through the reefs and weathered the merry men it would be to come ashore on the south coast of aros in sandag bay where so many dismal things befell our family as i propose to tell the thought of all these dangers in the place i knew so long makes me particularly welcome the works now going forward to set lights upon the headlands and buoys along the channels of our ironbound inhospitable islands  the country people had many a story about aros as i used to hear from my uncles man rorie an old servant of the macleans who had transferred his services without afterthought on the occasion of the marriage there was some tale of an unlucky creature a seakelpie that dwelt and did business in some fearful manner of his own among the boiling breakers of the roost a mermaid had once met a piper on sandag beach and there sang to him a long bright midsummers night so that in the morning he was found stricken crazy and from thenceforward till the day he died said only one form of words what they were in the original gaelic i cannot tell but they were thus translated ah the sweet singing out of the sea seals that haunted on that coast have been known to speak to man in his own tongue presaging great disasters it was here that a certain saint first landed on his voyage out of ireland to convert the hebrideans and indeed i think he had some claim to be called saint for with the boats of that past age to make so rough a passage and land on such a ticklish coast was surely not far short of the miraculous it was to him or to some of his monkish underlings who had a cell there that the islet owes its holy and beautiful name the house of god  among these old wives stories there was one which i was inclined to hear with more credulity as i was told in that tempest which scattered the ships of the invincible armada over all the north and west of scotland one great vessel came ashore on aros and before the eyes of some solitary people on a hilltop went down in a moment with all hands her colours flying even as she sank there was some likelihood in this tale for another of that fleet lay sunk on the north side twenty miles from grisapol it was told i thought with more detail and gravity than its companion stories and there was one particularity which went far to convince me of its truth the name that is of the ship was still remembered and sounded in my ears spanishly the espirito santo they called it a great ship of many decks of guns laden with treasure and grandees of spain and fierce soldadoes that now lay fathom deep to all eternity done with her wars and voyages in sandag bay upon the west of aros no more salvos of ordnance for that tall ship the holy spirit no more fair winds or happy ventures only to rot there deep in the seatangle and hear the shoutings of the merry men as the tide ran high about the island it was a strange thought to me first and last and only grew stranger as i learned the more of spain from which she had set sail with so proud a company and king philip the wealthy king that sent her on that voyage  and now i must tell you as i walked from grisapol that day the espirito santo was very much in my reflections i had been favourably remarked by our then principal in edinburgh college that famous writer dr robertson and by him had been set to work on some papers of an ancient date to rearrange and sift of what was worthless and in one of these to my great wonder i found a note of this very ship the espirito santo with her captains name and how she carried a great part of the spaniards treasure and had been lost upon the ross of grisapol but in what particular spot the wild tribes of that place and period would give no information to the kings inquiries putting one thing with another and taking our island tradition together with this note of old king jamies perquisitions after wealth it had come strongly on my mind that the spot for which he sought in vain could be no other than the small bay of sandag on my uncles land and being a fellow of a mechanical turn i had ever since been plotting how to weigh that good ship up again with all her ingots ounces and doubloons and bring back our house of darnaway to its longforgotten dignity and wealth  this was a design of which i soon had reason to repent my mind was sharply turned on different reflections and since i became the witness of a strange judgment of gods the thought of dead mens treasures has been intolerable to my conscience but even at that time i must acquit myself of sordid greed for if i desired riches it was not for their own sake but for the sake of a person who was dear to my heartmy uncles daughter mary ellen she had been educated well and had been a time to school upon the mainland which poor girl she would have been happier without for aros was no place for her with old rorie the servant and her father who was one of the unhappiest men in scotland plainly bred up in a country place among cameronians long a skipper sailing out of the clyde about the islands and now with infinite discontent managing his sheep and a little long shore fishing for the necessary bread if it was sometimes weariful to me who was there but a month or two you may fancy what it was to her who dwelt in that same desert all the year round with the sheep and flying seagulls and the merry men singing and dancing in the roost     chapter ii  what the wreck had brought to aros   it was halfflood when i got the length of aros and there was nothing for it but to stand on the far shore and whistle for rorie with the boat i had no need to repeat the signal at the first sound mary was at the door flying a handkerchief by way of answer and the old longlegged servingman was shambling down the gravel to the pier for all his hurry it took him a long while to pull across the bay and i observed him several times to pause go into the stern and look over curiously into the wake as he came nearer he seemed to me aged and haggard and i thought he avoided my eye the coble had been repaired with two new thwarts and several patches of some rare and beautiful foreign wood the name of it unknown to me  why rorie said i as we began the return voyage this is fine wood how came you by that  it will be hard to cheesel rorie opined reluctantly and just then dropping the oars he made another of those dives into the stern which i had remarked as he came across to fetch me and leaning his hand on my shoulder stared with an awful look into the waters of the bay  what is wrong i asked a good deal startled  it will be a great feesh said the old man returning to his oars and nothing more could i get out of him but strange glances and an ominous nodding of the head in spite of myself i was infected with a measure of uneasiness i turned also and studied the wake the water was still and transparent but out here in the middle of the bay exceeding deep for some time i could see naught but at last it did seem to me as if something darka great fish or perhaps only a shadowfollowed studiously in the track of the moving coble and then i remembered one of rories superstitions how in a ferry in morven in some great exterminating feud among the clans a fish the like of it unknown in all our waters followed for some years the passage of the ferryboat until no man dared to make the crossing  he will be waiting for the right man said rorie  mary met me on the beach and led me up the brae and into the house of aros outside and inside there were many changes the garden was fenced with the same wood that i had noted in the boat there were chairs in the kitchen covered with strange brocade curtains of brocade hung from the window a clock stood silent on the dresser a lamp of brass was swinging from the roof the table was set for dinner with the finest of linen and silver and all these new riches were displayed in the plain old kitchen that i knew so well with the highbacked settle and the stools and the closet bed for rorie with the wide chimney the sun shone into and the clearsmouldering peats with the pipes on the mantelshelf and the threecornered spittoons filled with seashells instead of sand on the floor with the bare stone walls and the bare wooden floor and the three patchwork rugs that were of yore its sole adornmentpoor mans patchwork the like of it unknown in cities woven with homespun and sunday black and seacloth polished on the bench of rowing the room like the house had been a sort of wonder in that countryside it was so neat and habitable and to see it now shamed by these incongruous additions filled me with indignation and a kind of anger in view of the errand i had come upon to aros the feeling was baseless and unjust but it burned high at the first moment in my heart  mary girl said i this is the place i had learned to call my home and i do not know it  it is my home by nature not by the learning she replied the place i was born and the place im like to die in and i neither like these changes nor the way they came nor that which came with them i would have liked better under gods pleasure they had gone down into the sea and the merry men were dancing on them now  mary was always serious it was perhaps the only trait that she shared with her father but the tone with which she uttered these words was even graver than of custom  ay said i i feared it came by wreck and thats by death yet when my father died i took his goods without remorse  your father died a cleanstrae death as the folk say said mary  true i returned and a wreck is like a judgment what was she called  they cad her the christanna said a voice behind me and turning round i saw my uncle standing in the doorway  he was a sour small bilious man with a long face and very dark eyes fiftysix years old sound and active in body and with an air somewhat between that of a shepherd and that of a man following the sea he never laughed that i heard read long at the bible prayed much like the cameronians he had been brought up among and indeed in many ways used to remind me of one of the hillpreachers in the killing times before the revolution but he never got much comfort nor even as i used to think much guidance by his piety he had his black fits when he was afraid of hell but he had led a rough life to which he would look back with envy and was still a rough cold gloomy man  as he came in at the door out of the sunlight with his bonnet on his head and a pipe hanging in his buttonhole he seemed like rorie to have grown older and paler the lines were deeplier ploughed upon his face and the whites of his eyes were yellow like old stained ivory or the bones of the dead  ay he repeated dwelling upon the first part of the word the christanna its an awfu name  i made him my salutations and complimented him upon his look of health for i feared he had perhaps been ill  im in the body he replied ungraciously enough aye in the body and the sins of the body like yoursel denner he said abruptly to mary and then ran on to me theyre grand braws thir that we hae gotten are they no yons a bonny knock3 but itll no gang and the naperys by ordnar bonny bairnly braws its for the like o them folk sells the peace of god that passeth understanding its for the like o them an maybe no even sae muckle worth folk daunton god to his face and burn in muckle hell and its for that reason the scripture cas them as i read the passage the accursed thingmary ye girzie he interrupted himself to cry with some asperity what for hae ye no put out the twa candlesticks  why should we need them at high noon she asked  but my uncle was not to be turned from his idea well bruik4 them while we may he said and so two massive candlesticks of wrought silver were added to the table equipage already so unsuited to that rough seaside farm  she cam ashore februar 10 about ten at nicht he went on to me there was nae wind and a sair run o sea and she was in the sook o the roost as i jaloose we had seen her a day rorie and me beating to the wind she wasna a handy craft im thinking that christanna for she would neither steer nor stey wi them a sair day they had of it their hands was never aff the sheets and it perishin cauldower cauld to snaw and aye they would get a bit nip o wind and awa again to pit the empy hope into them eh man but they had a sair day for the last ot he would have had a prood prood heart that won ashore upon the back o that  and were all lost i cried god help them  wheesht he said sternly nane shall pray for the deid on my hearthstane  i disclaimed a popish sense for my ejaculation and he seemed to accept my disclaimer with unusual facility and ran on once more upon what had evidently become a favourite subject  we fand her in sandag bay rorie an me and a thae braws in the inside of her theres a kittle bit ye see about sandag whiles the sook rins strong for the merry men an whiles again when the tides makin hard an ye can hear the roost blawin at the farend of aros there comes a backspang of current straucht into sandag bay weel theres the thing that got the grip on the christanna she büt to have come in ramstam an stern forrit for the bows of her are aften under and the backside of her is clear at hiewater o neaps but man the dunt that she cam doon wi when she struck lord save us al but its an unco life to be a sailora cauld wanchancy life monys the gliff i got mysel in the great deep and why the lord should hae made yon unco water is mair than ever i could win to understand he made the vales and the pastures the bonny green yaird the halesome canty land    and now they shout and sing to thee     for thou hast made them glad  as the psalms say in the metrical version no that i would preen my faith to that clink neither but its bonny and easier to mind who go to sea in ships they haet again                         and in     great waters trading be   within the deep these men gods works     and his great wonders see  weel its easy sayin sae maybe dauvit wasna very weel acquaint wi the sea but troth if it wasna prentit in the bible i wad whiles be tempit to think it wasna the lord but the muckle black deil that made the sea theres naething good comes oot ot but the fish an the spentacle o god riding on the tempest to be shüre whilk would be what dauvit was likely ettling at but man they were sair wonders that god showed to the christannawonders do i ca them judgments rather judgments in the mirk nicht among the draygons o the deep and their soulsto think o thattheir souls man maybe no prepared the seaa muckle yett to hell  i observed as my uncle spoke that his voice was unnaturally moved and his manner unwontedly demonstrative he leaned forward at these last words for example and touched me on the knee with his spread fingers looking up into my face with a certain pallor and i could see that his eyes shone with a deepseated fire and that the lines about his mouth were drawn and tremulous  even the entrance of rorie and the beginning of our meal did not detach him from his train of thought beyond a moment he condescended indeed to ask me some questions as to my success at college but i thought it was with half his mind and even in his extempore grace which was as usual long and wandering i could find the trace of his preoccupation praying as he did that god would remember in mercy fower puir feckless fiddling sinful creatures here by their leelane beside the great and dowie waters  soon there came an interchange of speeches between him and rorie  was it there asked my uncle  ou ay said rorie  i observed that they both spoke in a manner of aside and with some show of embarrassment and that mary herself appeared to colour and looked down on her plate partly to show my knowledge and so relieve the party from an awkward strain partly because i was curious i pursued the subject  you mean the fish i asked  whatten fish cried my uncle fish quo he fish your een are fu o fatness man your heid dozened wi carnal leir fish its a bogle  he spoke with great vehemence as though angry and perhaps i was not very willing to be put down so shortly for young men are disputatious at least i remember i retorted hotly crying out upon childish superstitions  and ye come frae the college sneered uncle gordon gude kens what they learn folk there its no muckle service onyway do ye think man that theres naething in a yon saut wilderness o a world oot wast there wi the seagrasses growin an the seabeasts fechtin an the sun glintin down into it day by day na the seas like the land but fearsomer if theres folk ashore theres folk in the seadeid they may be but theyre folk whatever and as for deils theres nane thats like the seadeils theres no sae muckle harm in the landdeils when as said and done lang syne when i was a callant in the south country i mind there was an auld bald bogle in the peewic moss i got a glisk o him mysel sittin on his hunkers in a hag as greys a tombstane an troth he was a fearsomelike taed but he steered naebody nae doobt if ane that was a reprobate ane the lord hated had gane by there wi his sin still upon his stamach nae doobt the creature would hae lowped upo the likes o him but theres deils in the deep sea would yoke on a communicant eh sirs if ye had gane doon wi the puir lads in the christanna ye would ken by now the mercy o the seas if ye had sailed it for as lang as me ye would hate the thocht of it as i do if ye had but used the een god gave ye ye would hae learned the wickedness o that fause saut cauld bullering creature and of a thats in it by the lords permission labsters an partans an siclike howking in the deid muckle gutsy blawing whales an fishthe hale clan o themcauldwamed blindeed uncanny ferlies oh sirs he cried the horrorthe horror o the sea  we were all somewhat staggered by this outburst and the speaker himself after that last hoarse apostrophe appeared to sink gloomily into his own thoughts but rorie who was greedy of superstitious lore recalled him to the subject by a question  you will not ever have seen a teevil of the sea he asked  no clearly replied the other i misdoobt if a mere man could see ane clearly and conteenue in the body i hae sailed wi a ladthey cad him sandy gabart he saw ane shüre eneuch an shüre eneuch it was the end of him we were seeven days oot frae the clydea sair wark we had hadgaun north wi seeds an

the lords angeran a that nicht we focht like men dementit and the neist that we kenned we were ashore in loch uskevagh an the cocks were crawin in benbecula  it will have been a merman rorie said  a merman screamed my uncle with immeasurable scorn auld wives clavers theres nae sic things as mermen  but what was the creature like i asked  what like was it gude forbid that we suld ken what like it was it had a kind of a heid upon itman could say nae mair  then rorie smarting under the affront told several tales of mermen mermaids and seahorses that had come ashore upon the islands and attacked the crews of boats upon the sea and my uncle in spite of his incredulity listened with uneasy interest  aweel aweel he said it may be sae i may be wrang but i find nae word o mermen in the scriptures  and you will find nae word of aros roost maybe objected rorie and his argument appeared to carry weight  when dinner was over my uncle carried me forth with him to a bank behind the house it was a very hot and quiet afternoon scarce a ripple anywhere upon the sea nor any voice but the familiar voice of sheep and gulls and perhaps in consequence of this repose in nature my kinsman showed himself more rational and tranquil than before he spoke evenly and almost cheerfully of my career with every now and then a reference to the lost ship or the treasures it had brought to aros for my part i listened to him in a sort of trance gazing with all my heart on that remembered scene and drinking gladly the seaair and the smoke of peats that had been lit by mary  perhaps an hour had passed when my uncle who had all the while been covertly gazing on the surface of the little bay rose to his feet and bade me follow his example now i should say that the great run of tide at the southwest end of aros exercises a perturbing influence round all the coast in sandag bay to the south a strong current runs at certain points of the flood and ebb respectively but in this northern bayaros bay as it is calledwhere the house stands and on which my uncle was now gazing the only sign of disturbance is towards the end of the ebb and even then it is too slight to be remarkable when there is any swell nothing can be seen at all but when it is calm as it often is there appear certain strange undecipherable markssearunes as we may name themon the glassy surface of the bay the like is common in a thousand places on the coast and many a boy must have amused himself as i did seeking to read in them some reference to himself or those he loved it was to these marks that my uncle now directed my attention struggling as he did so with an evident reluctance  do you see yon scart upo the water he inquired yon ane wast the grey stane ay weel itll no be like a letter wull it  certainly it is i replied i have often remarked it it is like a c  he heaved a sigh as if heavily disappointed with my answer and then added below his breath ay for the christanna  i used to suppose sir it was for myself said i for my name is charles  and so ye sawt afore he ran on not heeding my remark weel weel but thats unco strange maybe its been there waitin as a man wad say through a the weary ages man but thats awfu and then breaking off yell no see anither will ye he asked  yes said i i see another very plainly near the ross side where the road comes downan m  an m he repeated very low and then again after another pause an what wad ye make o that he inquired  i had always thought it to mean mary sir i answered growing somewhat red convinced as i was in my own mind that i was on the threshold of a decisive explanation  but we were each following his own train of thought to the exclusion of the others my uncle once more paid no attention to my words only hung his head and held his peace and i might have been led to fancy that he had not heard me if his next speech had not contained a kind of echo from my own  i would say naething o thae clavers to mary he observed and began to walk forward  there is a belt of turf along the side of aros bay where walking is easy and it was along this that i silently followed my silent kinsman i was perhaps a little disappointed at having lost so good an opportunity to declare my love but i was at the same time far more deeply exercised at the change that had befallen my uncle he was never an ordinary never in the strict sense an amiable man but there was nothing in even the worst that i had known of him before to prepare me for so strange a transformation it was impossible to close the eyes against one fact that he had as the saying goes something on his mind and as i mentally ran over the different words which might be represented by the letter mmisery mercy marriage money and the likei was arrested with a sort of start by the word murder i was still considering the ugly sound and fatal meaning of the word when the direction of our walk brought us to a point from which a view was to be had to either side back towards aros bay and homestead and forward on the ocean dotted to the north with isles and lying to the southward blue and open to the sky there my guide came to a halt and stood staring for awhile on that expanse then he turned to me and laid a hand on my arm  ye think theres naething there he said pointing with his pipe and then cried out aloud with a kind of exultation ill tell ye man the deid are down therethick like rattons  he turned at once and without another word we retraced our steps to the house of aros  i was eager to be alone with mary yet it was not till after supper and then but for a short while that i could have a word with her i lost no time beating about the bush but spoke out plainly what was on my mind  mary i said i have not come to aros without a hope if that should prove well founded we may all leave and go somewhere else secure of daily bread and comfort secure perhaps of something far beyond that which it would seem extravagant in me to promise but theres a hope that lies nearer to my heart than money and at that i paused you can guess fine what that is mary i said she looked away from me in silence and that was small encouragement but i was not to be put off all my days i have thought the world of you i continued the time goes on and i think always the more of you i could not think to be happy or hearty in my life without you you are the apple of my eye still she looked away and said never a word but i thought i saw that her hands shook mary i cried in fear do ye no like me  oh charlie man she said is this a time to speak of it let me be a while let me be the way i am itll not be you that loses by the waiting  i made out by her voice that she was nearly weeping and this put me out of any thought but to compose her mary ellen i said say no more i did not come to trouble you your way shall be mine and your time too and you have told me all i wanted only just this one thing more what ails you  she owned it was her father but would enter into no particulars only shook her head and said he was not well and not like himself and it was a great pity she knew nothing of the wreck i havena been near it said she what for would i go near it charlie lad the poor souls are gone to their account long syne and i would just have wished they had taen their gear with thempoor souls  this was scarcely any great encouragement for me to tell her of the espirito santo yet i did so and at the very first word she cried out in surprise there was a man at grisapol she said in the month of maya little yellow blackavised body they tell me with gold rings upon his fingers and a beard and he was speiring high and low for that same ship  it was towards the end of april that i had been given these papers to sort out by dr robertson and it came suddenly back upon my mind that they were thus prepared for a spanish historian or a man calling himself such who had come with high recommendations to the principal on a mission of inquiry as to the dispersion of the great armada putting one thing with another i fancied that the visitor with the gold rings upon his fingers might be the same with dr robertsons historian from madrid if that were so he would be more likely after treasure for himself than information for a learned society i made up my mind i should lose no time over my undertaking and if the ship lay sunk in sandag bay as perhaps both he and i supposed it should not be for the advantage of this ringed adventurer but for mary and myself and for the good old honest kindly family of the darnaways     chapter iii  land and sea in sandag bay   i was early afoot next morning and as soon as i had a bite to eat set forth upon a tour of exploration something in my heart distinctly told me that i should find the ship of the armada and although i did not give way entirely to such hopeful thoughts i was still very light in spirits and walked upon air aros is a very rough islet its surface strewn with great rocks and shaggy with fern and heather and my way lay almost north and south across the highest knoll and though the whole distance was inside of two miles it took more time and exertion than four upon a level road upon the summit i paused although not very highnot three hundred feet as i thinkit yet outtops all the neighbouring lowlands of the ross and commands a great view of sea and islands the sun which had been up some time was already hot upon my neck the air was listless and thundery although purely clear away over the northwest where the isles lie thickliest congregated some half a dozen small and ragged clouds hung together in a covey and the head of ben kyaw wore not merely a few streamers but a solid hood of vapour there was a threat in the weather the sea it is true was smooth like glass even the roost was but a seam on that wide mirror and the merry men no more than caps of foam but to my eye and ear so long familiar with these places the sea also seemed to lie uneasily a sound of it like a long sigh mounted to me where i stood and quiet as it was the roost itself appeared to be revolving mischief for i ought to say that all we dwellers in these parts attributed if not prescience at least a quality of warning to that strange and dangerous creature of the tides  i hurried on then with the greater speed and had soon descended the slope of aros to the part that we call sandag bay it is a pretty large piece of water compared with the size of the isle well sheltered from all but the prevailing wind sandy and shoal and bounded by low sandhills to the west but to the eastward lying several fathoms deep along a ledge of rocks it is upon that side that at a certain time each flood the current mentioned by my uncle sets so strong into the bay a little later when the roost begins to work higher an undertow runs still more strongly in the reverse direction and it is the action of this last as i suppose that has scoured that part so deep nothing is to be seen out of sandag bay but one small segment of the horizon and in heavy weather the breakers flying high over a deepsea reef  from halfway down the hill i had perceived the wreck of february last a brig of considerable tonnage lying with her back broken high and dry on the east corner of the sands and i was making directly towards it and already almost on the margin of the turf when my eyes were suddenly arrested by a spot cleared of fern and heather and marked by one of those long low and almost humanlooking mounds that we see so commonly in graveyards i stopped like a man shot nothing had been said to me of any dead man or interment on the island rorie mary and my uncle had all equally held their peace of her at least i was certain that she must be ignorant and yet here before my eyes was proof indubitable of the fact here was a grave and i had to ask myself with a chill what manner of man lay there in his last sleep awaiting the signal of the lord in that solitary seabeat restingplace my mind supplied no answer but what i feared to entertain shipwrecked at least he must have been perhaps like the old armada mariners from some far and rich land oversea or perhaps one of my own race perishing within eyesight of the smoke of home i stood awhile uncovered by his side and i could have desired that it had lain in our religion to put up some prayer for that unhappy stranger or in the old classic way outwardly to honour his misfortune i knew although his bones lay there a part of aros till the trumpet sounded his imperishable soul was forth and far away among the raptures of the everlasting sabbath or the pangs of hell and yet my mind misgave me even with a fear that perhaps he was near me where i stood guarding his sepulchre and lingering on the scene of his unhappy fate  certainly it was with a spirit somewhat overshadowed that i turned away from the grave to the hardly less melancholy spectacle of the wreck her stem was above the first arc of the flood she was broken in two a little abaft the foremastthough indeed she had none both masts having broken short in her disaster and as the pitch of the beach was very sharp and sudden and the bows lay many feet below the stern the fracture gaped widely open and you could see right through her poor hull upon the farther side her name was much defaced and i could not make out clearly whether she was called christiania after the norwegian city or christiana after the good woman christians wife in that old book the pilgrims progress by her build she was a foreign ship but i was not certain of her nationality she had been painted green but the colour was faded and weathered and the paint peeling off in strips the wreck of the mainmast lay alongside halfburied in sand she was a forlorn sight indeed and i could not look without emotion at the bits of rope that still hung about her so often handled of yore by shouting seamen or the little scuttle where they had passed up and down to their affairs or that poor noseless angel of a figurehead that had dipped into so many running billows  i do not know whether it came most from the ship or from the grave but i fell into some melancholy scruples as i stood there leaning with one hand against the battered timbers the homelessness of men and even of inanimate vessels cast away upon strange shores came strongly in upon my mind to make a profit of such pitiful misadventures seemed an unmanly and a sordid act and i began to think of my then quest as of something sacrilegious in its nature but when i remembered mary i took heart again my uncle would never consent to an imprudent marriage nor would she as i was persuaded wed without his full approval it behoved me then to be up and doing for my wife and i thought with a laugh how long it was since that great seacastle the espirito santo had left her bones in sandag bay and how weak it would be to consider rights so long extinguished and misfortunes so long forgotten in the process of time  i had my theory of where to seek for her remains the set of the current and the soundings both pointed to the east side of the bay under the ledge of rocks if she had been lost in sandag bay and if after these centuries any portion of her held together it was there that i should find it the water deepens as i have said with great rapidity and even close alongside the rocks several fathoms may be found as i walked upon the edge i could see far and wide over the sandy bottom of the bay the sun shone clear and green and steady in the deeps the bay seemed rather like a great transparent crystal as one sees them in a lapidarys shop there was naught to show that it was water but an internal trembling a hovering within of sunglints and netted shadows and now and then a faint lap and a dying bubble round the edge the shadows of the rocks lay out for some distance at their feet so that my own shadow moving pausing and stooping on the top of that reached sometimes half across the bay it was above all in this belt of shadows that i hunted for the espirito santo since it was there the undertow ran strongest whether in or out cool as the whole water seemed this broiling day it looked in that part yet cooler and had a mysterious invitation for the eyes peer as i pleased however i could see nothing but a few fishes or a bush of seatangle and here and there a lump of rock that had fallen from above and now lay separate on the sandy floor twice did i pass from one end to the other of the rocks and in the whole distance i could see nothing of the wreck nor any place but one where it was possible for it to be this was a large terrace in five fathoms of water raised off the surface of the sand to a considerable height and looking from above like a mere outgrowth of the rocks on which i walked it was one mass of great seatangles like a grove which prevented me judging of its nature but in shape and size it bore some likeness to a vessels hull at least it was my best chance if the espirito santo lay not there under the tangles it lay nowhere at all in sandag bay and i prepared to put the question to the proof once and for all and either go back to aros a rich man or cured for ever of my dreams of wealth  i stripped to the skin and stood on the extreme margin with my hands clasped irresolute the bay at that time was utterly quiet there was no sound but from a school of porpoises somewhere out of sight behind the point yet a certain fear withheld me on the threshold of my venture sad seafeelings scraps of my uncles superstitions thoughts of the dead of the grave of the old broken ships drifted through my mind but the strong sun upon my shoulders warmed me to the heart and i stooped forward and plunged into the sea  it was all that i could do to catch a trail of the seatangle that grew so thickly on the terrace but once so far anchored i secured myself by grasping a whole armful of these thick and slimy stalks and planting my feet against the edge i looked around me on all sides the clear sand stretched forth unbroken it came to the foot of the rocks scoured into the likeness of an alley in a garden by the action of the tides and before me for as far as i could see nothing was visible but the same manyfolded sand upon the sunbright bottom of the bay yet the terrace to which i was then holding was as thick with strong seagrowths as a tuft of heather and the cliff from which it bulged hung draped below the waterline with brown lianas in this complexity of forms all swaying together in the current things were hard to be distinguished and i was still uncertain whether my feet were pressed upon the natural rock or upon the timbers of the armada treasureship when the whole tuft of tangle came away in my hand and in an instant i was on the surface and the shores of the bay and the bright water swam before my eyes in a glory of crimson  i clambered back upon the rocks and threw the plant of tangle at my feet something at the same moment rang sharply like a falling coin i stooped and there sure enough crusted with the red rust there lay an iron shoebuckle the sight of this poor human relic thrilled me to the heart but not with hope nor fear only with a desolate melancholy i held it in my hand and the thought of its owner appeared before me like the presence of an actual man his weatherbeaten face his sailors hands his seavoice hoarse with singing at the capstan the very foot that had once worn that buckle and trod so much along the swerving decksthe whole human fact of him as a creature like myself with hair and blood and seeing eyes haunted me in that sunny solitary place not like a spectre but like some friend whom i had basely injured was the great treasureship indeed below there with her guns and chain and treasure as she had sailed from spain her decks a garden for the seaweed her cabin a breedingplace for fish soundless but for the dredging water motionless but for the waving of the tangle upon her battlementsthat old populous seariding castle now a reef in sandag bay or as i thought it likelier was this a waif from the disaster of the foreign brigwas this shoebuckle bought but the other day and worn by a man of my own period in the worlds history hearing the same news from day to day thinking the same thoughts praying perhaps in the same temple with myself however it was i was assailed with dreary thoughts my uncles words the dead are down there echoed in my ears and though i determined to dive once more it was with a strong repugnance that i stepped forward to the margin of the rocks  a great change passed at that moment over the appearance of the bay it was no more that clear visible interior like a house roofed with glass where the green submarine sunshine slept so stilly a breeze i suppose had flawed the surface and a sort of trouble and blackness filled its bosom where flashes of light and clouds of shadow tossed confusedly together even the terrace below obscurely rocked and quivered it seemed a graver thing to venture on this place of ambushes and when i leaped into the sea a second time it was with a quaking in my soul  i secured myself as at first and groped among the waving tangle all that met my touch was cold and soft and gluey the thicket was alive with crabs and lobsters trundling to and fro lopsidedly and i had to harden my heart against the horror of their carrion neighbourhood on all sides i could feel the grain and the clefts of hard living stone no planks no iron not a sign of any wreck the espirito santo was not there i remember i had almost a sense of relief in my disappointment and i was about ready to leave go when something happened that sent me to the surface with my heart in my mouth i had already stayed somewhat late over my explorations the current was freshening with the change of the tide and sandag bay was no longer a safe place for a single swimmer well just at the last moment there came a sudden flush of current dredging through the tangles like a wave i lost one hold was flung sprawling on my side and instinctively grasping for a fresh support my fingers closed on something hard and cold i think i knew at that moment what it was at least i instantly left hold of the tangle leaped for the surface and clambered out next moment on the friendly rocks with the bone of a mans leg in my grasp  mankind is a material creature slow to think and dull to perceive connections the grave the wreck of the brig and the rusty shoebuckle were surely plain advertisements a child might have read their dismal story and yet it was not until i touched that actual piece of mankind that the full horror of the charnel ocean burst upon my spirit i laid the bone beside the buckle picked up my clothes and ran as i was along the rocks towards the human shore i could not be far enough from the spot no fortune was vast enough to tempt me back again the bones of the drowned dead should henceforth roll undisturbed by me whether on tangle or minted gold but as soon as i trod the good earth again and had covered my nakedness against the sun i knelt down over against the ruins of the brig and out of the fulness of my heart prayed long and passionately for all poor souls upon the sea a generous prayer is never presented in vain the petition may be refused but the petitioner is always i believe rewarded by some gracious visitation the horror at least was lifted from my mind i could look with calm of spirit on that great bright creature gods ocean and as i set off homeward up the rough sides of aros nothing remained of my concern beyond a deep determination to meddle no more with the spoils of wrecked vessels or the treasures of the dead  i was already some way up the hill before i paused to breathe and look behind me the sight that met my eyes was doubly strange  for first the storm that i had foreseen was now advancing with almost tropical rapidity the whole surface of the sea had been dulled from its conspicuous brightness to an ugly hue of corrugated lead already in the distance the white waves the skippers daughters had begun to flee before a breeze that was still insensible on aros and already along the curve of sandag bay there was a splashing run of sea that i could hear from where i stood the change upon the sky was even more remarkable there had begun to arise out of the southwest a huge and solid continent of scowling cloud here and there through rents in its contexture the sun still poured a sheaf of spreading rays and here and there from all its edges vast inky streamers lay forth along the yet unclouded sky the menace was express and imminent even as i gazed the sun was blotted out at any moment the tempest might fall upon aros in its might  the suddenness of this change of weather so fixed my eyes on heaven that it was some seconds before they alighted on the bay mapped out below my feet and robbed a moment later of the sun the knoll which i had just surmounted overflanked a little amphitheatre of lower hillocks sloping towards the sea and beyond that the yellow arc of beach and the whole extent of sandag bay it was a scene on which i had often looked down but where i had never before beheld a human figure i had but just turned my back upon it and left it empty and my wonder may be fancied when i saw a boat and several men in that deserted spot the boat was lying by the rocks a pair of fellows bareheaded with their sleeves rolled up and one with a boathook kept her with difficulty to her moorings for the current was growing brisker every moment a little way off upon the ledge two men in black clothes whom i judged to be superior in rank laid their heads together over some task which at first i did not understand but a second after i had made it outthey were taking bearings with the compass and just then i saw one of them unroll a sheet of paper and lay his finger down as though identifying features in a map meanwhile a third was walking to and fro poking among the rocks and peering over the edge into the water while i was still watching them with the stupefaction of surprise my mind hardly yet able to work on what my eyes reported this third person suddenly stooped and summoned his companions with a cry so loud that it reached my ears upon the hill the others ran to him even dropping the compass in their hurry and i could see the bone and the shoebuckle going from hand to hand causing the most unusual gesticulations of surprise and interest just then i could hear the seamen crying from the boat and saw them point westward to that cloud continent which was ever the more rapidly unfurling its blackness over heaven the others seemed to consult but the danger was too pressing to be braved and they bundled into the boat carrying my relics with them and set forth out of the bay with all speed of oars  i made no more ado about the matter but turned and ran for the house whoever these men were it was fit my uncle should be instantly informed it was not then altogether too late in the day for a descent of the jacobites and maybe prince charlie whom i knew my uncle to detest was one of the three superiors whom i had seen upon the rock yet as i ran leaping from rock to rock and turned the matter loosely in my mind this theory grew ever the longer the less welcome to my reason the compass the map the interest awakened by the buckle and the conduct of that one among the strangers who had looked so often below him in the water all seemed to point to a different explanation of their presence on that outlying obscure islet of the western sea the madrid historian the search instituted by dr robertson the bearded stranger with the rings my own fruitless search that very morning in the deep water of sandag bay ran together piece by piece in my memory and i made sure that these strangers must be spaniards in quest of ancient treasure and the lost ship of the armada but the people living in outlying islands such as aros are answerable for their own security there is none near by to protect or even to help them and the presence in such a spot of a crew of foreign adventurerspoor greedy and most likely lawlessfilled me with apprehensions for my uncles money and even for the safety of his daughter i was still wondering how we were to get rid of them when i came all breathless to the top of aros the whole world was shadowed over only in the extreme east on a hill of the mainland one last gleam of sunshine lingered like a jewel rain had begun to fall not heavily but in great drops the sea was rising with each moment and already a band of white encircled aros and the nearer coasts of grisapol the boat was still pulling seaward but i now became aware of what had been hidden from me lower downa large heavily sparred handsome schooner lyingto at the south end of aros since i had not seen her in the morning when i had looked around so closely at the signs of the weather and upon these lone waters where a sail was rarely visible it was clear she must have lain last night behind the uninhabited eilean gour and this proved conclusively that she was manned by strangers to our coast for that anchorage though good enough to look at is little better than a trap for ships with such ignorant sailors upon so wild a coast the coming gale was not unlikely to bring death upon its wings     chapter iv  the gale   i found my uncle at the gableend watching the signs of the weather with a pipe in his fingers  uncle said i there were men ashore at sandag bay  i had no time to go further indeed i not only forgot my words but even my weariness so strange was the effect on uncle gordon he dropped his pipe and fell back against the end of the house with his jaw fallen his eyes staring and his long face as white as paper we must have looked at one another silently for a quarter of a minute before he made answer in this extraordinary fashion had he a hair kep on  i knew as well as if i had been there that the man who now lay buried at sandag had worn a hairy cap and that he had come shore alive for the first and only time i lost toleration for the man who was my benefactor and the father of the woman i hoped to call my wife  these were living men said i perhaps jacobites perhaps the french perhaps pirates perhaps adventurers come here to seek the spanish treasureship but whatever they may be dangerous at least to your daughter and my cousin as for your own guilty terrors man the dead sleeps well where you have laid him i stood this morning by his grave he will not wake before the trump of doom  my kinsman looked upon me blinking while i spoke then he fixed his eyes for a little on the ground and pulled his fingers foolishly but it was plain that he was past the power of speech  come said i you must think for others you must come up the hill with me and see this ship  he obeyed without a word or a look following slowly after my impatient strides the spring seemed to have gone out of his body and he scrambled heavily up and down the rocks instead of leaping as he was wont from one to another nor could i for all my cries induce him to make better haste only once he replied to me complainingly and like one in bodily pain ay ay man im coming long before we had reached the top i had no other thought for him but pity if the crime had been monstrous the punishment was in proportion  at last we emerged above the skyline of the hill and could see around us all was black and stormy to the eye the last gleam of sun had vanished a wind had sprung up not yet high but gusty and unsteady to the point the rain on the other hand had ceased short as was the interval the sea already ran vastly higher than when i had stood there last already it had begun to break over some of the outward reefs and already it moaned aloud in the seacaves of aros i looked at first in vain for the schooner  there she is i said at last but her new position and the course she was now lying puzzled me they cannot mean to beat to sea i cried  thats what they mean said my uncle with something like joy and just then the schooner went about and stood upon another tack which put the question beyond the reach of doubt these strangers seeing a gale on hand had thought first of searoom with the wind that threatened in these reefsown waters and contending against so violent a stream of tide their course was certain death  good god said i they are all lost  ay returned my uncle aa lost they hadna a chance but to rin for kyle dona the gate theyre gaun the noo they couldna win through an the muckle deil were there to pilot them eh man he continued touching me on the sleeve its a braw nicht for a shipwreck twa in ae twalmonth eh but the merry menll dance bonny  i looked at him and it was then that i began to fancy him no longer in his right mind he was peering up to me as if for sympathy a timid joy in his eyes all that had passed between us was already forgotten in the prospect of this fresh disaster  if it were not too late i cried with indignation i would take the coble and go out to warn them  na na he protested ye maunna interfere ye maunna meddle wi the like o that its hisdoffing his bonnethis wull and eh man but its a braw nicht fort  something like fear began to creep into my soul and reminding him that i had not yet dined i proposed we should return to the house but no nothing would tear him from his place of outlook  i maun see the hail thing man charlie he explained and then as the schooner went about a second time eh but they hanle her bonny he cried the christanna was naething to this  already the men on board the schooner must have begun to realise some part but not yet the twentieth of the dangers that environed their doomed ship at every lull of the capricious wind they must have seen how fast the current swept them back each tack was made shorter as they saw how little it prevailed every moment the rising swell began to boom and foam upon another sunken reef and ever and again a breaker would fall in sounding ruin under the very bows of her and the brown reef and streaming tangle appear in the hollow of the wave i tell you they had to stand to their tackle there was no idle man aboard that ship god knows it was upon the progress of a scene so horrible to any humanhearted man that my misguided uncle now pored and gloated like a connoisseur as i turned to go down the hill he was lying on his belly on the summit with his hands stretched forth and clutching in the heather he seemed rejuvenated mind and body  when i got back to the house already dismally affected i was still more sadly downcast at the sight of mary she had her sleeves rolled up over her strong arms and was quietly making bread i got a bannock from the dresser and sat down to eat it in silence  are ye wearied lad she asked after a while  i am not so much wearied mary i replied getting on my feet as i am weary of delay and perhaps of aros too you know me well enough to judge me fairly say what i like well mary you may be sure of this you had better be anywhere but here  ill be sure of one thing she returned ill be where my duty is  you forget you have a duty to yourself i said  ay man she replied pounding at the dough will you have found that in the bible now  mary i said solemnly you must not laugh at me just now god knows i am in no heart for laughing if we could get your father with us it would be best but with him or without him i want you far away from here my girl for your own sake and for mine ay and for your fathers too i want you farfar away from here i came with other thoughts i came here as a man comes home now it is all changed and i have no desire nor hope but to fleefor thats the wordflee like a bird out of the fowlers snare from this accursed island  she had stopped her work by this time  and do you think now said she do you think now i have neither eyes nor ears do ye think i havena broken my heart to have these braws as he calls them god forgive him thrown into the sea do ye think i have lived with him day in day out and not seen what you saw in an hour or two no she said i know theres wrong in it what wrong i neither know nor want to know there was never an ill thing made better by meddling that i could hear of but my lad you must never ask me to leave my father while the breath is in his body ill be with him and hes not long for here either that i can tell you charliehes not long for here the mark is on his brow and better somaybe better so  i was a while silent not knowing what to say and when i roused my head at last to speak she got before me  charlie she said whats right for me needna be right for you theres sin upon this house and trouble you are a stranger take your things upon your back and go your ways to better places and to better folk and if you were ever minded to come back though it were twenty years syne you would find me aye waiting  mary ellen i said i asked you to be my wife and you said as good as yes thats done for good wherever you are i am as i shall answer to my god  as i said the words the wind suddenly burst out raving and then seemed to stand still and shudder round the house of aros it was the first squall or prologue of the coming tempest and as we started and looked about us we found that a gloom like the approach of evening had settled round the house  god pity all poor folks at sea she said well see no more of my father till the morrows morning  and then she told me as we sat by the fire and hearkened to the rising gusts of how this change had fallen upon my uncle all last winter he had been dark and fitful in his mind whenever the roost ran high or as mary said whenever the merry men were dancing he would lie out for hours together on the head if it were night or on the top of aros by day watching the tumult of the sea and sweeping the horizon for a sail after february the 10th when the wealthbringing wreck was cast ashore at sandag he had been at first unnaturally gay and his excitement had never fallen in degree but only changed in kind from dark to darker he neglected his work and kept rorie idle they two would speak together by the hour at the gableend in guarded tones and with an air of secrecy and almost of guilt and if she questioned either as at first she sometimes did her inquiries were put aside with confusion since rorie had first remarked the fish that hung about the ferry his master had never set foot but once upon the mainland of the ross that onceit was in the height of the springshe had passed dryshod while the tide was out but having lingered overlong on the far side found himself cut off from aros by the returning waters it was with a shriek of agony that he had leaped across the gut and he had reached home thereafter in a feverfit of fear a fear of the sea a constant haunting thought of the sea appeared in his talk and devotions and even in his looks when he was silent  rorie alone came in to supper but a little later my uncle appeared took a bottle under his arm put some bread in his pocket and set forth again to his outlook followed this time by rorie i heard that the schooner was losing ground but the crew was still fighting every inch with hopeless ingenuity and courage and the news filled my mind with blackness  a little after sundown the full fury of the gale broke forth such a gale as i have never seen in summer nor seeing how swiftly it had come even in winter mary and i sat in silence the house quaking overhead the tempest howling without the fire between us sputtering with raindrops our thoughts were far away with the poor fellows on the schooner or my not less unhappy uncle houseless on the promontory and yet ever and again we were startled back to ourselves when the wind would rise and strike the gable like a solid body or suddenly fall and draw away so that the fire leaped into flame and our hearts bounded in our sides now the storm in its might would seize and shake the four corners of the roof roaring like leviathan in anger anon in a lull cold eddies of tempest moved shudderingly in the room lifting the hair upon our heads and passing between us as we sat and again the wind would break forth in a chorus of melancholy sounds hooting low in the chimney wailing with flutelike softness round the house  it was perhaps eight oclock when rorie came in and pulled me mysteriously to the door my uncle it appeared had frightened even his constant comrade and rorie uneasy at his extravagance prayed me to come out and share the watch i hastened to do as i was asked the more readily as what with fear and horror and the electrical tension of the night i was myself restless and disposed for action i told mary to be under no alarm for i should be a safeguard on her father and wrapping myself warmly in a plaid i followed rorie into the open air  the night though we were so little past midsummer was as dark as january intervals of a groping twilight alternated with spells of utter blackness and it was impossible to trace the reason of these changes in the flying horror of the sky the wind blew the breath out of a mans nostrils all heaven seemed to thunder overhead like one huge sail and when there fell a momentary lull on aros we could hear the gusts dismally sweeping in the distance over all the lowlands of the ross the wind must have blown as fierce as on the open sea and god only knows the uproar that was raging around the head of ben kyaw sheets of mingled spray and rain were driven in our faces all round the isle of aros the surf with an incessant hammering thunder beat upon the reefs and beaches now louder in one place now lower in another like the combinations of orchestral music the constant mass of sound was hardly varied for a moment and loud above all this hurlyburly i could hear the changeful voices of the roost and the intermittent roaring of the merry men at that hour there flashed into my mind the reason of the name that they were called for the noise of them seemed almost mirthful as it outtopped the other noises of the night or if not mirthful yet instinct with a portentous joviality nay and it seemed even human as when savage men have drunk away their reason and discarding speech bawl together in their madness by the hour so to my ears these deadly breakers shouted by aros in the night  arm in arm and staggering against the wind rorie and i won every yard of ground with conscious effort we slipped on the wet sod we fell together sprawling on the rocks bruised drenched beaten and breathless it must have taken us near half an hour to get from the house down to the head that overlooks the roost there it seemed was my uncles favourite observatory right in the face of it where the cliff is highest and most sheer a hump of earth like a parapet makes a place of shelter from the common winds where a man may sit in quiet and see the tide and the mad billows contending at his feet as he might look down from the window of a house upon some street disturbance so from this post he looks down upon the tumbling of the merry men on such a night of course he peers upon a world of blackness where the waters wheel and boil where the waves joust together with the noise of an explosion and the foam towers and vanishes in the twinkling of an eye never before had i seen the merry men thus violent the fury height and transiency of their spoutings was a thing to be seen and not recounted high over our heads on the cliff rose their white columns in the darkness and the same instant like phantoms they were gone sometimes three at a time would thus aspire and vanish sometimes a gust took them and the spray would fall about us heavy as a wave and yet the spectacle was rather maddening in its levity than impressive by its force thought was beaten down by the confounding uproar a gleeful vacancy possessed the brains of men a state akin to madness and i found myself at times following the dance of the merry men as it were a tune upon a jigging instrument  i first caught sight of my uncle when we were still some yards away in one of the flying glimpses of twilight that chequered the pitch darkness of the night he was standing up behind the parapet his head thrown back and the bottle to his mouth as he put it down he saw and recognised us with a toss of one hand fleeringly above his head  has he been drinking shouted i to rorie  he will aye be drunk when the wind blaws returned rorie in the same high key and it was all that i could do to hear him  thenwas he soin february i inquired  rories ay was a cause of joy to me the murder then had not sprung in cold blood from calculation it was an act of madness no more to be condemned than to be pardoned my uncle was a dangerous madman if you will but he was not cruel and base as i had feared yet what a scene for a carouse what an incredible vice was this that the poor man had chosen i have always thought drunkenness a wild and almost fearful pleasure rather demoniacal than human but drunkenness out here in the roaring blackness on the edge of a cliff above that hell of waters the mans head spinning like the roost his foot tottering on the edge of death his ear watching for the signs of shipwreck surely that if it were credible in any one was morally impossible in a man like my uncle whose mind was set upon a damnatory creed and haunted by the darkest superstitions yet so it was and as we reached the bight of shelter and could breathe again i saw the mans eyes shining in the night with an unholy glimmer  eh charlie man its grand he cried see to them he continued dragging me to the edge of the abyss from whence arose that deafening clamour and those clouds of spray see to them dancin man is that no wicked  he pronounced the word with gusto and i thought it suited with the scene  theyre yowlin for thon schooner he went on his thin insane voice clearly audible in the shelter of the bank an shes comin aye nearer aye nearer aye nearer an nearer an nearer an they kent the folk kens it they ken weel its by wi them charlie lad theyre a drunk in yon schooner a dozened

droon without it hae holding out the bottle tak a sowp  i was about to refuse but rorie touched me as if in warning and indeed i had already thought better of the movement i took the bottle therefore and not only drank freely myself but contrived to spill even more as i was doing so it was pure spirit and almost strangled me to swallow my kinsman did not observe the loss but once more throwing back his head drained the remainder to the dregs then with a loud laugh he cast the bottle forth among the merry men who seemed to leap up shouting to receive it  hae bairns he cried theres your hansel yell get bonnier nor that or morning  suddenly out in the black night before us and not two hundred yards away we heard at a moment when the wind was silent the clear note of a human voice instantly the wind swept howling down upon the head and the roost bellowed and churned and danced with a new fury but we had heard the sound and we knew with agony that this was the doomed ship now close on ruin and that what we had heard was the voice of her master issuing his last command crouching together on the edge we waited straining every sense for the inevitable end it was long however and to us it seemed like ages ere the schooner suddenly appeared for one brief instant relieved against a tower of glimmering foam i still see her reefed mainsail flapping loose as the boom fell heavily across the deck i still see the black outline of the hull and still think i can distinguish the figure of a man stretched upon the tiller yet the whole sight we had of her passed swifter than lightning the very wave that disclosed her fell burying her for ever the mingled cry of many voices at the point of death rose and was quenched in the roaring of the merry men and with that the tragedy was at an end the strong ship with all her gear and the lamp perhaps still burning in the cabin the lives of so many men precious surely to others dear at least as heaven to themselves had all in that one moment gone down into the surging waters they were gone like a dream and the wind still ran and shouted and the senseless waters in the roost still leaped and tumbled as before  how long we lay there together we three speechless and motionless is more than i can tell but it must have been for long at length one by one and almost mechanically we crawled back into the shelter of the bank as i lay against the parapet wholly wretched and not entirely master of my mind i could hear my kinsman maundering to himself in an altered and melancholy mood now he would repeat to himself with maudlin iteration sic a fecht as they hadsic a sair fecht as they had puir lads puir lads and anon he would bewail that a the gear was as gudes tint because the ship had gone down among the merry men instead of stranding on the shore and throughout the namethe christannawould come and go in his divagations pronounced with shuddering awe the storm all this time was rapidly abating in half an hour the wind had fallen to a breeze and the change was accompanied or caused by a heavy cold and plumping rain i must then have fallen asleep and when i came to myself drenched stiff and unrefreshed day had already broken grey wet discomfortable day the wind blew in faint and shifting capfuls the tide was out the roost was at its lowest and only the strong beating surf round all the coasts of aros remained to witness of the furies of the night     chapter v  a man out of the sea   rorie set out for the house in search of warmth and breakfast but my uncle was bent upon examining the shores of aros and i felt it a part of duty to accompany him throughout he was now docile and quiet but tremulous and weak in mind and body and it was with the eagerness of a child that he pursued his exploration he climbed far down upon the rocks on the beaches he pursued the retreating breakers the merest broken plank or rag of cordage was a treasure in his eyes to be secured at the peril of his life to see him with weak and stumbling footsteps expose himself to the pursuit of the surf or the snares and pitfalls of the weedy rock kept me in a perpetual terror my arm was ready to support him my hand clutched him by the skirt i helped him to draw his pitiful discoveries beyond the reach of the returning wave a nurse accompanying a child of seven would have had no different experience  yet weakened as he was by the reaction from his madness of the night before the passions that smouldered in his nature were those of a strong man his terror of the sea although conquered for the moment was still undiminished had the sea been a lake of living flames he could not have shrunk more panically from its touch and once when his foot slipped and he plunged to the midleg into a pool of water the shriek that came up out of his soul was like the cry of death he sat still for a while panting like a dog after that but his desire for the spoils of shipwreck triumphed once more over his fears once more he tottered among the curded foam once more he crawled upon the rocks among the bursting bubbles once more his whole heart seemed to be set on driftwood fit if it was fit for anything to throw upon the fire pleased as he was with what he found he still incessantly grumbled at his illfortune  aros he said is no a place for wrecks avano ava a the years ive dwalt here this ane maks the second and the best o the gear clean tint  uncle said i for we were now on a stretch of open sand where there was nothing to divert his mind i saw you last night as i never thought to see youyou were drunk  na na he said no as bad as that i had been drinking though and to tell ye the gods truth its a thing i canna mend theres nae soberer man than me in my ordnar but when i hear the wind blaw in my lug its my belief that i gang gyte  you are a religious man i replied and this is sin  ou he returned if it wasna sin i dinna ken that i would care fort ye see man its defiance theres a sair spang o the auld sin o the world in yon sea its an unchristian business at the best ot an whiles when it gets up an the wind skreighsthe wind an her are a kind of sib im thinkinan thae merry men the daft callants blawin and lauchin and puir souls in the deidthraws warstlin the leelang nicht wi their bit shipsweel it comes ower me like a glamour im a deil i kent but i think naething o the puir sailor lads im wi the sea im just like ane o her ain merry men  i thought i should touch him in a joint of his harness i turned me towards the sea the surf was running gaily wave after wave with their manes blowing behind them riding one after another up the beach towering curving falling one upon another on the trampled sand without the salt air the scared gulls the widespread army of the seachargers neighing to each other as they gathered together to the assault of aros and close before us that line on the flat sands that with all their number and their fury they might never pass  thus far shalt thou go said i and no farther and then i quoted as solemnly as i was able a verse that i had often before fitted to the chorus of the breakers    but yet the lord that is on high     is more of might by far   than noise of many waters is     or great seabillows are  ay said my kinsman at the hinder end the lord will triumph i dinna misdoobt that but here on earth even silly menfolk daur him to his face it is no wise i am no sayin that its wise but its the pride of the eye and its the lust o life an its the wale o pleesures  i said no more for we had now begun to cross a neck of land that lay between us and sandag and i withheld my last appeal to the mans better reason till we should stand upon the spot associated with his crime nor did he pursue the subject but he walked beside me with a firmer step the call that i had made upon his mind acted like a stimulant and i could see that he had forgotten his search for worthless jetsam in a profound gloomy and yet stirring train of thought in three or four minutes we had topped the brae and began to go down upon sandag the wreck had been roughly handled by the sea the stem had been spun round and dragged a little lower down and perhaps the stern had been forced a little higher for the two parts now lay entirely separate on the beach when we came to the grave i stopped uncovered my head in the thick rain and looking my kinsman in the face addressed him  a man said i was in gods providence suffered to escape from mortal dangers he was poor he was naked he was wet he was weary he was a stranger he had every claim upon the bowels of your compassion it may be that he was the salt of the earth holy helpful and kind it may be he was a man laden with iniquities to whom death was the beginning of torment i ask you in the sight of heaven gordon darnaway where is the man for whom christ died  he started visibly at the last words but there came no answer and his face expressed no feeling but a vague alarm  you were my fathers brother i continued you have taught me to count your house as if it were my fathers house and we are both sinful men walking before the lord among the sins and dangers of this life it is by our evil that god leads us into good we sin i dare not say by his temptation but i must say with his consent and to any but the brutish man his sins are the beginning of wisdom god has warned you by this crime he warns you still by the bloody grave between our feet and if there shall follow no repentance no improvement no return to him what can we look for but the following of some memorable judgment  even as i spoke the words the eyes of my uncle wandered from my face a change fell upon his looks that cannot be described his features seemed to dwindle in size the colour faded from his cheeks one hand rose waveringly and pointed over my shoulder into the distance and the oftrepeated name fell once more from his lips the christanna  i turned and if i was not appalled to the same degree as i return thanks to heaven that i had not the cause i was still startled by the sight that met my eyes the form of a man stood upright on the cabinhutch of the wrecked ship his back was towards us he appeared to be scanning the offing with shaded eyes and his figure was relieved to its full height which was plainly very great against the sea and sky i have said a thousand times that i am not superstitious but at that moment with my mind running upon death and sin the unexplained appearance of a stranger on that seagirt solitary island filled me with a surprise that bordered close on terror it seemed scarce possible that any human soul should have come ashore alive in such a sea as had raged last night along the coast of aros and the only vessel within miles had gone down before our eyes among the merry men i was assailed with doubts that made suspense unbearable and to put the matter to the touch at once stepped forward and hailed the figure like a ship  he turned about and i thought he started to behold us at this my courage instantly revived and i called and signed to him to draw near and he on his part dropped immediately to the sands and began slowly to approach with many stops and hesitations at each repeated mark of the mans uneasiness i grew the more confident myself and i advanced another step encouraging him as i did so with my head and hand it was plain the castaway had heard indifferent accounts of our island hospitality and indeed about this time the people farther north had a sorry reputation  why i said the man is black  and just at that moment in a voice that i could scarce have recognised my kinsman began swearing and praying in a mingled stream i looked at him he had fallen on his knees his face was agonised at each step of the castaways the pitch of his voice rose the volubility of his utterance and the fervour of his language redoubled i call it prayer for it was addressed to god but surely no such ranting incongruities were ever before addressed to the creator by a creature surely if prayer can be a sin this mad harangue was sinful i ran to my kinsman i seized him by the shoulders i dragged him to his feet  silence man said i respect your god in words if not in action here on the very scene of your transgressions he sends you an occasion of atonement forward and embrace it welcome like a father yon creature who comes trembling to your mercy  with that i tried to force him towards the black but he felled me to the ground burst from my grasp leaving the shoulder of his jacket and fled up the hillside towards the top of aros like a deer i staggered to my feet again bruised and somewhat stunned the negro had paused in surprise perhaps in terror some halfway between me and the wreck my uncle was already far away bounding from rock to rock and i thus found myself torn for a time between two duties but i judged and i pray heaven that i judged rightly in favour of the poor wretch upon the sands his misfortune was at least not plainly of his own creation it was one besides that i could certainly relieve and i had begun by that time to regard my uncle as an incurable and dismal lunatic i advanced accordingly towards the black who now awaited my approach with folded arms like one prepared for either destiny as i came nearer he reached forth his hand with a great gesture such as i had seen from the pulpit and spoke to me in something of a pulpit voice but not a word was comprehensible i tried him first in english then in gaelic both in vain so that it was clear we must rely upon the tongue of looks and gestures thereupon i signed to him to follow me which he did readily and with a grave obeisance like a fallen king all the while there had come no shade of alteration in his face neither of anxiety while he was still waiting nor of relief now that he was reassured if he were a slave as i supposed i could not but judge he must have fallen from some high place in his own country and fallen as he was i could not but admire his bearing as we passed the grave i paused and raised my hands and eyes to heaven in token of respect and sorrow for the dead and he as if in answer bowed low and spread his hands abroad it was a strange motion but done like a thing of common custom and i supposed it was ceremonial in the land from which he came at the same time he pointed to my uncle whom we could just see perched upon a knoll and touched his head to indicate that he was mad  we took the long way round the shore for i feared to excite my uncle if we struck across the island and as we walked i had time enough to mature the little dramatic exhibition by which i hoped to satisfy my doubts accordingly pausing on a rock i proceeded to imitate before the negro the action of the man whom i had seen the day before taking bearings with the compass at sandag he understood me at once and taking the imitation out of my hands showed me where the boat was pointed out seaward as if to indicate the position of the schooner and then down along the edge of the rock with the words espirito santo strangely pronounced but clear enough for recognition i had thus been right in my conjecture the pretended historical inquiry had been but a cloak for treasurehunting the man who had played on dr robertson was the same as the foreigner who visited grisapol in spring and now with many others lay dead under the roost of aros there had their greed brought them there should their bones be tossed for evermore in the meantime the black continued his imitation of the scene now looking up skyward as though watching the approach of the storm now in the character of a seaman waving the rest to come aboard now as an officer running along the rock and entering the boat and anon bending over imaginary oars with the air of a hurried boatman but all with the same solemnity of manner so that i was never even moved to smile lastly he indicated to me by a pantomime not to be described in words how he himself had gone up to examine the stranded wreck and to his grief and indignation had been deserted by his comrades and thereupon folded his arms once more and stooped his head like one accepting fate  the mystery of his presence being thus solved for me i explained to him by means of a sketch the fate of the vessel and of all aboard her he showed no surprise nor sorrow and with a sudden lifting of his open hand seemed to dismiss his former friends or masters whichever they had been into gods pleasure respect came upon me and grew stronger the more i observed him i saw he had a powerful mind and a sober and severe character such as i loved to commune with and before we reached the house of aros i had almost forgotten and wholly forgiven him his uncanny colour  to mary i told all that had passed without suppression though i own my heart failed me but i did wrong to doubt her sense of justice  you did the right she said gods will be done and she set out meat for us at once  as soon as i was satisfied i bade rorie keep an eye upon the castaway who was still eating and set forth again myself to find my uncle i had not gone far before i saw him sitting in the same place upon the very topmost knoll and seemingly in the same attitude as when i had last observed him from that point as i have said the most of aros and the neighbouring ross would be spread below him like a map and it was plain that he kept a bright lookout in all directions for my head had scarcely risen above the summit of the first ascent before he had leaped to his feet and turned as if to face me i hailed him at once as well as i was able in the same tones and words as i had often used before when i had come to summon him to dinner he made not so much as a movement in reply i passed on a little farther and again tried parley with the same result but when i began a second time to advance his insane fears blazed up again and still in dead silence but with incredible speed he began to flee from before me along the rocky summit of the hill an hour before he had been dead weary and i had been comparatively active but now his strength was recruited by the fervour of insanity and it would have been vain for me to dream of pursuit nay the very attempt i thought might have inflamed his terrors and thus increased the miseries of our position and i had nothing left but to turn homeward and make my sad report to mary  she heard it as she had heard the first with a concerned composure and bidding me lie down and take that rest of which i stood so much in need set forth herself in quest of her misguided father at that age it would have been a strange thing that put me from either meat or sleep i slept long and deep and it was already long past noon before i awoke and came downstairs into the kitchen mary rorie and the black castaway were seated about the fire in silence and i could see that mary had been weeping there was cause enough as i soon learned for tears first she and then rorie had been forth to seek my uncle each in turn had found him perched upon the hilltop and from each in turn he had silently and swiftly fled rorie had tried to chase him but in vain madness lent a new vigour to his bounds he sprang from rock to rock over the widest gullies he scoured like the wind along the hilltops he doubled and twisted like a hare before the dogs and rorie at length gave in and the last that he saw my uncle was seated as before upon the crest of aros even during the hottest excitement of the chase even when the fleetfooted servant had come for a moment very near to capture him the poor lunatic had uttered not a sound he fled and he was silent like a beast and this silence had terrified his pursuer  there was something heartbreaking in the situation how to capture the madman how to feed him in the meanwhile and what to do with him when he was captured were the three difficulties that we had to solve  the black said i is the cause of this attack it may even be his presence in the house that keeps my uncle on the hill we have done the fair thing he has been fed and warmed under this roof now i propose that rorie put him across the bay in the coble and take him through the ross as far as grisapol  in this proposal mary heartily concurred and bidding the black follow us we all three descended to the pier certainly heavens will was declared against gordon darnaway a thing had happened never paralleled before in aros during the storm the coble had broken loose and striking on the rough splinters of the pier now lay in four feet of water with one side stove in three days of work at least would be required to make her float but i was not to be beaten i led the whole party round to where the gut was narrowest swam to the other side and called to the black to follow me he signed with the same clearness and quiet as before that he knew not the art and there was truth apparent in his signals it would have occurred to none of us to doubt his truth and that hope being over we must all go back even as we came to the house of aros the negro walking in our midst without embarrassment  all we could do that day was to make one more attempt to communicate with the unhappy madman again he was visible on his perch again he fled in silence but food and a great cloak were at least left for his comfort the rain besides had cleared away and the night promised to be even warm we might compose ourselves we thought until the morrow rest was the chief requisite that we might be strengthened for unusual exertions and as none cared to talk we separated at an early hour  i lay long awake planning a campaign for the morrow i was to place the black on the side of sandag whence he should head my uncle towards the house rorie in the west i on the east were to complete the cordon as best we might it seemed to me the more i recalled the configuration of the island that it should be possible though hard to force him down upon the low ground along aros bay and once there even with the strength of his madness ultimate escape was hardly to be feared it was on his terror of the black that i relied for i made sure however he might run it would not be in the direction of the man whom he supposed to have returned from the dead and thus one point of the compass at least would be secure  when at length i fell asleep it was to be awakened shortly after by a dream of wrecks black men and submarine adventure and i found myself so shaken and fevered that i arose descended the stair and stepped out before the house within rorie and the black were asleep together in the kitchen outside was a wonderful clear night of stars with here and there a cloud still hanging last stragglers of the tempest it was near the top of the flood and the merry men were roaring in the windless quiet of the night never not even in the height of the tempest had i heard their song with greater awe now when the winds were gathered home when the deep was dandling itself back into its summer slumber and when the stars rained their gentle light over land and sea the voice of these tidebreakers was still raised for havoc they seemed indeed to be a part of the worlds evil and the tragic side of life nor were their meaningless vociferations the only sounds that broke the silence of the night for i could hear now shrill and thrilling and now almost drowned the note of a human voice that accompanied the uproar of the roost i knew it for my kinsmans and a great fear fell upon me of gods judgments and the evil in the world i went back again into the darkness of the house as into a place of shelter and lay long upon my bed pondering these mysteries  it was late when i again woke and i leaped into my clothes and hurried to the kitchen no one was there rorie and the black had both stealthily departed long before and my heart stood still at the discovery i could rely on rories heart but i placed no trust in his discretion if he had thus set out without a word he was plainly bent upon some service to my uncle but what service could he hope to render even alone far less in the company of the man in whom my uncle found his fears incarnated even if i were not already too late to prevent some deadly mischief it was plain i must delay no longer with the thought i was out of the house and often as i have run on the rough sides of aros i never ran as i did that fatal morning i do not believe i put twelve minutes to the whole ascent  my uncle was gone from his perch the basket had indeed been torn open and the meat scattered on the turf but as we found afterwards no mouthful had been tasted and there was not another trace of human existence in that wide field of view day had already filled the clear heavens the sun already lighted in a rosy bloom upon the crest of ben kyaw but all below me the rude knolls of aros and the shield of sea lay steeped in the clear darkling twilight of the dawn  rorie i cried and again rorie my voice died in the silence but there came no answer back if there were indeed an enterprise afoot to catch my uncle it was plainly not in fleetness of foot but in dexterity of stalking that the hunters placed their trust i ran on farther keeping the higher spurs and looking right and left nor did i pause again till i was on the mount above sandag i could see the wreck the uncovered belt of sand the waves idly beating the long ledge of rocks and on either hand the tumbled knolls boulders and gullies of the island but still no human thing  at a stride the sunshine fell on aros and the shadows and colours leaped into being not half a moment later below me to the west sheep began to scatter as in a panic there came a cry i saw my uncle running i saw the black jump up in hot pursuit and before i had time to understand rorie also had appeared calling directions in gaelic as to a dog herding sheep  i took to my heels to interfere and perhaps i had done better to have waited where i was for i was the means of cutting off the madmans last escape there was nothing before him from that moment but the grave the wreck and the sea in sandag bay and yet heaven knows that what i did was for the best  my uncle gordon saw in what direction horrible to him the chase was driving him he doubled darting to the right and left but high as the fever ran in his veins the black was still the swifter turn where he would he was still forestalled still driven toward the scene of his crime suddenly he began to shriek aloud so that the coast reechoed and now both i and rorie were calling on the black to stop but all was vain for it was written otherwise the pursuer still ran the chase still sped before him screaming they avoided the grave and skimmed close past the timbers of the wreck in a breath they had cleared the sand and still my kinsman did not pause but dashed straight into the surf and the black now almost within reach still followed swiftly behind him rorie and i both stopped for the thing was now beyond the hands of men and these were the decrees of god that came to pass before our eyes there was never a sharper ending on that steep beach they were beyond their depth at a bound neither could swim the black rose once for a moment with a throttling cry but the current had them racing seaward and if ever they came up again which god alone can tell it would be ten minutes after at the far end of aros roost where the seabirds hover fishing   footnotes    1 ie the six stories which were in 1887 published in a volume     entitled the merry men and other tales and fables of this volume     the merry men and olalla formed part    2 boggy    3 clock    4 enjoy     olalla     olalla   now said the doctor my part is done and i may say with some vanity well done it remains only to get you out of this cold and poisonous city and to give you two months of a pure air and an easy conscience the last is your affair to the first i think i can help you it falls indeed rather oddly it was but the other day the padre came in from the country and as he and i are old friends although of contrary professions he applied to me in a matter of distress among some of his parishioners this was a familybut you are ignorant of spain and even the names of our grandees are hardly known to you suffice it then that they were once great people and are now fallen to the brink of destitution nothing now belongs to them but the residencia and certain leagues of desert mountain in the greater part of which not even a goat could support life but the house is a fine old place and stands at a great height among the hills and most salubriously and i had no sooner heard my friends tale than i remembered you i told him i had a wounded officer wounded in the good cause who was now able to make a change and i proposed that his friends should take you for a lodger instantly the padres face grew dark as i had maliciously foreseen it would it was out of the question he said then let them starve said i for i have no sympathy with tatterdemalion pride thereupon we separated not very content with one another but yesterday to my wonder the padre returned and made a submission the difficulty he said he had found upon inquiry to be less than he had feared or in other words these proud people had put their pride in their pocket i closed with the offer and subject to your approval i have taken rooms for you in the residencia the air of these mountains will renew your blood and the quiet in which you will there live is worth all the medicines in the world  doctor said i you have been throughout my good angel and your advice is a command but tell me if you please something of the family with which i am to reside  i am coming to that replied my friend and indeed there is a difficulty in the way these beggars are as i have said of very high descent and swollen with the most baseless vanity they have lived for some generations in a growing isolation drawing away on either hand from the rich who had now become too high for them and from the poor whom they still regarded as too low and even today when poverty forces them to unfasten their door to a guest they cannot do so without a most ungracious stipulation you are to remain they say a stranger they will give you attendance but they refuse from the first the idea of the smallest intimacy  i will not deny that i was piqued and perhaps the feeling strengthened my desire to go for i was confident that i could break down that barrier if i desired there is nothing offensive in such a stipulation said i and i even sympathise with the feeling that inspired it  it is true they have never seen you returned the doctor politely and if they knew you were the handsomest and the most pleasant man that ever came from england where i am told that handsome men are common but pleasant ones not so much so they would doubtless make you welcome with a better grace but since you take the thing so well it matters not to me indeed it seems discourteous but you will find yourself the gainer the family will not much tempt you a mother a son and a daughter an old woman said to be halfwitted a country lout and a country girl who stands very high with her confessor and is therefore chuckled the physician most likely plain there is not much in that to attract the fancy of a dashing officer  and yet you say they are highborn i objected  well as to that i should distinguish returned the doctor the mother is not so the children the mother was the last representative of a princely stock degenerate both in parts and fortune her father was not only poor he was mad and the girl ran wild about the residencia till his death then much of the fortune having died with him and the family being quite extinct the girl ran wilder than ever until at last she married heaven knows whom a muleteer some say others a smuggler while there are some who uphold there was no marriage at all and that felipe and olalla are bastards the union such as it was was tragically dissolved some years ago but they live in such seclusion and the country at that time was in so much disorder that the precise manner of the mans end is known only to the priestif even to him  i begin to think i shall have strange experiences said i  i would not romance if i were you replied the doctor you will find i fear a very grovelling and commonplace reality felipe for instance i have seen and what am i to say he is very rustic very cunning very loutish and i should say an innocent the others are probably to match no no señor commandante you must seek congenial society among the great sights of our mountains and in these at least if you are at all a lover of the works of nature i promise you will not be disappointed  the next day felipe came for me in a rough country cart drawn by a mule and a little before the stroke of noon after i had said farewell to the doctor the innkeeper and different good souls who had befriended me during my sickness we set forth out of the city by the eastern gate and began to ascend into the sierra i had been so long a prisoner since i was left behind for dying after the loss of the convoy that the mere smell of the earth set me smiling the country through which we went was wild and rocky partially covered with rough woods now of the corktree and now of the great spanish chestnut and frequently intersected by the beds of mountain torrents the sun shone the wind rustled joyously and we had advanced some miles and the city had already shrunk into an inconsiderable knoll upon the plain behind us before my attention began to be diverted to the companion of my drive to the eye he seemed but a diminutive loutish wellmade country lad such as the doctor had described mighty quick and active but devoid of any culture and this first impression was with most observers final what began to strike me was his familiar chattering talk so strangely inconsistent with the terms on which i was to be received and partly from his imperfect enunciation partly from the sprightly incoherence of the matter so very difficult to follow clearly without an effort of the mind it is true i had before talked with persons of a similar mental constitution persons who seemed to live as he did by the senses taken and possessed by the visual object of the moment and unable to discharge their minds of that impression his seemed to me as i sat distantly giving ear a kind of conversation proper to drivers who pass much of their time in a great vacancy of the intellect and threading the sights of a familiar country but this was not the case of felipe by his own account he was a homekeeper i wish i was there now he said and then spying a tree by the wayside he broke off to tell me that he had once seen a crow among its branches  a crow i repeated struck by the ineptitude of the remark and thinking i had heard imperfectly  but by this time he was already filled with a new idea hearkening with a rapt intentness his head on one side his face puckered and he struck me rudely to make me hold my peace then he smiled and shook his head  what did you hear i asked  oh it is all right he said and began encouraging his mule with cries that echoed unhumanly up the mountain walls  i looked at him more closely he was superlatively wellbuilt light and lithe and strong he was wellfeatured his yellow eyes were very large though perhaps not very expressive take him altogether he was a pleasantlooking lad and i had no fault to find with him beyond that he was of a dusky hue and inclined to hairiness two characteristics that i disliked it was his mind that puzzled and yet attracted me the doctors phrasean innocentcame back to me and i was wondering if that were after all the true description when the road began to go down into the narrow and naked chasm of a torrent the waters thundered tumultuously in the bottom and the ravine was filled full of the sound the thin spray and the claps of wind that accompanied their descent the scene was certainly impressive but the road was in that part very securely walled in the mule went steadily forward and i was astonished to perceive the paleness of terror in the face of my companion the voice of that wild river was inconstant now sinking lower as if in weariness now doubling its hoarse tones momentary freshets seemed to swell its volume sweeping down the gorge raving and booming against the barrier walls and i observed it was at each of these accessions to the clamour that my driver more particularly winced and blanched some thoughts of scottish superstition and the riverkelpie passed across my mind i wondered if perchance the like were prevalent in that part of spain and turning to felipe sought to draw him out  what is the matter i asked  oh i am afraid he replied  of what are you afraid i returned this seems one of the safest places on this very dangerous road  it makes a noise he said with a simplicity of awe that set my doubts at rest  the lad was but a child in intellect his mind was like his body active and swift but stunted in development and i began from that time forth to regard him with a measure of pity and to listen at first with indulgence and at last even with pleasure to his disjointed babble  by about four in the afternoon we had crossed the summit of the mountain line said farewell to the western sunshine and began to go down upon the other side skirting the edge of many ravines and moving through the shadow of dusky woods there rose upon all sides the voice of falling water not condensed and formidable as in the gorge of the river but scattered and sounding gaily and musically from glen to glen here too the spirits of my driver mended and he began to sing aloud in a falsetto voice and with a singular bluntness of musical perception never true either to melody or key but wandering at will and yet somehow with an effect that was natural and pleasing like that of the song of birds as the dusk increased i fell more and more under the spell of this artless warbling listening and waiting for some articulate air and still disappointed and when at last i asked him what it was he sangoh cried he i am just singing above all i was taken with a trick he had of unweariedly repeating the same note at little intervals it was not so monotonous as you would think or at least not disagreeable and it seemed to breathe a wonderful contentment with what is such as we love to fancy in the attitude of trees or the quiescence of a pool  night had fallen dark before we came out upon a plateau and drew up a little after before a certain lump of superior blackness which i could only conjecture to be the residencia here my guide getting down from the cart hooted and whistled for a long time in vain until at last an old peasant man came towards us from somewhere in the surrounding dark carrying a candle in his hand by the light of this i was able to perceive a great arched doorway of a moorish character it was closed by ironstudded gates in one of the leaves of which felipe opened a wicket the peasant carried off the cart to some outbuilding but my guide and i passed through the wicket which was closed again behind us and by the glimmer of the candle passed through a court up a stone stair along a section of an open gallery and up more stairs again until we came at last to the door of a great and somewhat bare apartment this room which i understood was to be mine was pierced by three windows lined with some lustrous wood disposed in panels and carpeted with the skins of many savage animals a bright fire burned in the chimney and shed abroad a changeful flicker close up to the blaze there was drawn a table laid for supper and in the far end a bed stood ready i was pleased by these preparations and said so to felipe and he with the same simplicity of disposition that i had already remarked in him warmly reechoed my praises a fine room he said a very fine room and fire too fire is good it melts out the pleasure in your bones and the bed he continued carrying over the candle in that directionsee what fine sheetshow soft how smooth smooth and he passed his hand again and again over their texture and then laid down his head and rubbed his cheeks among them with a grossness of content that somehow offended me i took the candle from his hand for i feared he would set the bed on fire and walked back to the suppertable where perceiving a measure of wine i poured out a cup and called to him to come and drink of it he started to his feet at once and ran to me with a strong expression of hope but when he saw the wine he visibly shuddered  oh no he said not that that is for you i hate it  very well señor said i then i will drink to your good health and to the prosperity of your house and family speaking of which i added after i had drunk shall i not have the pleasure of laying my salutations in person at the feet of the señora your mother  but at these words all the childishness passed out of his face and was succeeded by a look of indescribable cunning and secrecy he backed away from me at the same time as though i were an animal about to leap or some dangerous fellow with a weapon and when he had got near the door glowered at me sullenly with contracted pupils no he said at last and the next moment was gone noiselessly out of the room and i heard his footing die away downstairs as light as rainfall and silence closed over the house  after i had supped i drew up the table nearer to the bed and began to prepare for rest but in the new position of the light i was struck by a picture on the wall it represented a woman still young to judge by her costume and the mellow unity which reigned over the canvas she had long been dead to judge by the vivacity of the attitude the eyes and the features i might have been beholding in a mirror the image of life her figure was very slim and strong and of a just proportion red tresses lay like a crown over her brow her eyes of a very golden brown held mine with a look and her face which was perfectly shaped was yet marred by a cruel sullen and sensual expression something in both face and figure something exquisitely intangible like the echo of an echo suggested the features and bearing of my guide and i stood a while unpleasantly attracted and wondering at the oddity of the resemblance the common carnal stock of that race which had been originally designed for such high dames as the one now looking on me from the canvas had fallen to baser uses wearing country clothes sitting on the shaft and holding the reins of a mule cart to bring home a lodger perhaps an actual link subsisted perhaps some scruple of the delicate flesh that was once clothed upon with the satin and brocade of the dead lady now winced at the rude contact of felipes frieze  the first light of the morning shone full upon the portrait and as i lay awake my eyes continued to dwell upon it with growing complacency its beauty crept about my heart insidiously silencing my scruples one after another and while i knew that to love such a woman were to sign and seal ones own sentence of degeneration i still knew that if she were alive i should love her day after day the double knowledge of her wickedness and of my weakness grew clearer she came to be the heroine of many daydreams in which her eyes led on to and sufficiently rewarded crimes she cast a dark shadow on my fancy and when i was out in the free air of heaven taking vigorous exercise and healthily renewing the current of my blood it was often a glad thought to me that my enchantress was safe in the grave her wand of beauty broken her lips closed in silence her philtre spilt and yet i had a halflingering terror that she might not be dead after all but rearisen in the body of some descendant  felipe served my meals in my own apartment and his resemblance to the portrait haunted me at times it was not at times upon some change of attitude or flash of expression it would leap out upon me like a ghost it was above all in his ill tempers that the likeness triumphed he certainly liked me he was proud of my notice which he sought to engage by many simple and childlike devices he loved to sit close before my fire talking his broken talk or singing his odd endless wordless songs and sometimes drawing his hand over my clothes with an affectionate manner of caressing that never failed to cause in me an embarrassment of which i was ashamed but for all that he was capable of flashes of causeless anger and fits of sturdy sullenness at a word of reproof i have seen him upset the dish of which i was about to eat and this not surreptitiously but with defiance and similarly at a hint of inquisition i was not unnaturally curious being in a strange place and surrounded by strange people but at the shadow of a question he shrank back lowering and dangerous then it was that for a fraction of a second this rough lad might have been the brother of the lady in the frame but these humours were swift to pass and the resemblance died along with them  in these first days i saw nothing of any one but felipe unless the portrait is to be counted and since the lad was plainly of weak mind and had moments of passion it may be wondered that i bore his dangerous neighbourhood with equanimity as a matter of fact it was for some time irksome but it happened before long that i obtained over him so complete a mastery as set my disquietude at rest  it fell in this way he was by nature slothful and much of a vagabond and yet he kept by the house and not only waited upon my wants but laboured every day in the garden or small farm to the south of the residencia here he would be joined by the peasant whom i had seen on the night of my arrival and who dwelt at the far end of the enclosure about half a mile away in a rude outhouse but it was plain to me that of these two it was felipe who did most and though i would sometimes see him throw down his spade and go to sleep among the very plants he had been digging his constancy and energy were admirable in themselves and still more so since i was well assured they were foreign to his disposition and the fruit of an ungrateful effort but while i admired i wondered what had called forth in a lad so shuttlewitted this enduring sense of duty how was it sustained i asked myself and to what length did it prevail over his instincts the priest was possibly his inspirer but the priest came one day to the residencia i saw him both come and go after an interval of close upon an hour from a knoll where i was sketching and all that time felipe continued to labour undisturbed in the garden  at last in a very unworthy spirit i determined to debauch the lad from his good resolutions and waylaying him at the gate easily persuaded him to join me in a ramble it was a fine day and the woods to which i led him were green and pleasant and sweetsmelling and alive with the hum of insects here he discovered himself in a fresh character mounting up to heights of gaiety that abashed me and displaying an energy and grace of movement that delighted the eye he leaped he ran round me in mere glee he would stop and look and listen and seem to drink in the world like a cordial and then he would suddenly spring into a tree with one bound and hang and gambol there like one at home little as he said to me and that of not much import i have rarely enjoyed more stirring company the sight of his delight was a continual feast the speed and accuracy of his movements pleased me to the heart and i might have been so thoughtlessly unkind as to make a habit of these walks had not chance prepared a very rude conclusion to my pleasure by some swiftness or dexterity the lad captured a squirrel in a tree top he was then some way ahead of me but i saw him drop to the ground and crouch there crying aloud for pleasure like a child the sound stirred my sympathies it was so fresh and innocent but as i bettered my pace to draw near the cry of the squirrel knocked upon my heart i have heard and seen much of the cruelty of lads and above all of peasants but what i now beheld struck me into a passion of anger i thrust the fellow aside plucked the poor brute out of his hands and with swift mercy killed it then i turned upon the torturer spoke to him long out of the heat of my indignation calling him names at which he seemed to wither and at length pointing towards the residencia bade him begone and leave me for i chose to walk with men not with vermin he fell upon his knees and the words coming to him with more clearness than usual poured out a stream of the most touching supplications begging me in mercy to forgive him to forget what he had done to look to the future oh i try so hard he said oh commandante bear with felipe this once he will never be a brute again thereupon much more affected than i cared to show i suffered myself to be persuaded and at last shook hands with him and made it up but the squirrel by way of penance i made him bury speaking of the poor things beauty telling him what pains it had suffered and how base a thing was the abuse of strength see felipe said i you are strong indeed but in my hands you are as helpless as that poor thing of the trees give me your hand in mine you cannot remove it now suppose that i were cruel like you and took a pleasure in pain i only tighten my hold and see how you suffer he screamed aloud his face stricken ashy and dotted with needlepoints of sweat and when i set him free he fell to the earth and nursed his hand and moaned over it like a baby but he took the lesson in good part and whether from that or from what i had said to him or the higher notion he now had of my bodily strength his original affection was changed into a doglike adoring fidelity  meanwhile i gained rapidly in health the residencia stood on the crown of a stony plateau on every side the mountains hemmed it about only from the roof where was a bartizan there might be seen between two peaks a small segment of plain blue with extreme distance the air in these altitudes moved freely and largely great clouds congregated there and were broken up by the wind and left in tatters on the hilltops a hoarse and yet faint rumbling of torrents rose from all round and one could there study all the ruder and more ancient characters of nature in something of their pristine force i delighted from the first in the vigorous scenery and changeful weather nor less in the antique and dilapidated mansion where i dwelt this was a large oblong flanked at two opposite corners by bastionlike projections one of which commanded the door while both were loopholed for musketry the lower story was besides naked of windows so that the building if garrisoned could not be carried without artillery it enclosed an open court planted with pomegranate trees from this a broad flight of marble stairs ascended to an open gallery running all round and resting towards the court on slender pillars thence again several enclosed stairs led to the upper stories of the house which were thus broken up into distinct divisions the windows both within and without were closely shuttered some of the stonework in the upper parts had fallen the roof in one place had been wrecked in one of the flurries of wind which were common in these mountains and the whole house in the strong beating sunlight and standing out above a grove of stunted corktrees thickly laden and discoloured with dust looked like the sleeping palace of the legend the court in particular seemed the very home of slumber a hoarse cooing of doves haunted about the eaves the winds were excluded but when they blew outside the mountain dust fell here as thick as rain and veiled the red bloom of the pomegranates shuttered windows and the closed doors of numerous cellars and the vacant arches of the gallery enclosed it and all day long the sun made broken profiles on the four sides and paraded the shadow of the pillars on the gallery floor at the ground level there was however a certain pillared recess which bore the marks of human habitation though it was open in front upon the court it was yet provided with a chimney where a wood fire would be always prettily blazing and the tile floor was littered with the skins of animals  it was in this place that i first saw my hostess she had drawn one of the skins forward and sat in the sun leaning against a pillar it was her dress that struck me first of all for it was rich and brightly coloured and shone out in that dusty courtyard with something of the same relief as the flowers of the pomegranates at a second look it was her beauty of person that took hold of me as she sat backwatching me i thought though with invisible eyesand wearing at the same time an expression of almost imbecile goodhumour and contentment she showed a perfectness of feature and a quiet nobility of attitude that were beyond a statues i took off my hat to her in passing and her face puckered with suspicion as swiftly and lightly as a pool ruffles in the breeze but she paid no heed to my courtesy i went forth on my customary walk a trifle daunted her idollike impassivity haunting me and when i returned although she was still in much the same posture i was half surprised to see that she had moved as far as the next pillar following the sunshine this time however she addressed me with some trivial salutation civilly enough conceived and uttered in the same deepchested and yet indistinct and lisping tones that had already baffled the utmost niceness of my hearing from her son i answered rather at a venture for not only did i fail to take her meaning with precision but the sudden disclosure of her eyes disturbed me they were unusually large the iris golden like felipes but the pupil at that moment so distended that they seemed almost black and what affected me was not so much their size as what was perhaps its consequence the singular insignificance of their regard a look more blankly stupid i have never met my eyes dropped before it even as i spoke and i went on my way upstairs to my own room at once baffled and embarrassed yet when i came there and saw the face of the portrait i was again reminded of the miracle of family descent my hostess was indeed both older and fuller in person her eyes were of a different colour her face besides was not only free from the illsignificance that offended and attracted me in the painting it was devoid of either good or bada moral blank expressing literally naught and yet there was a likeness not so much speaking as immanent not so much in any particular feature as upon the whole it should seem i thought as if when the master set his signature to that grave canvas he had not only caught the image of one smiling and falseeyed woman but stamped the essential quality of a race  from that day forth whether i came or went i was sure to find the señora seated in the sun against a pillar or stretched on a rug before the fire only at times she would shift her station to the top round of the stone staircase where she lay with the same nonchalance right across my path in all these days i never knew her to display the least spark of energy beyond what she expended in brushing and rebrushing her copious coppercoloured hair or in lisping out in the rich and broken hoarseness of her voice her customary idle salutations to myself these i think were her two chief pleasures beyond that of mere quiescence she seemed always proud of her remarks as though they had been witticisms and indeed though they were empty enough like the conversation of many respectable persons and turned on a very narrow range of subjects they were never meaningless or incoherent nay they had a certain beauty of their own breathing as they did of her entire contentment now she would speak of the warmth in which like her son she greatly delighted now of the flowers of the pomegranate trees and now of the white doves and longwinged swallows that fanned the air of the court the birds excited her as they raked the eaves in their swift flight or skimmed sidelong past her with a rush of wind she would sometimes stir and sit a little up and seem to awaken from her doze of satisfaction but for the rest of her days she lay luxuriously folded on herself and sunk in sloth and pleasure her invincible content at first annoyed me but i came gradually to find repose in the spectacle until at last it grew to be my habit to sit down beside her four times in the day both coming and going and to talk with her sleepily i scarce knew of what i had come to like her dull almost animal neighbourhood her beauty and her stupidity soothed and amused me i began to find a kind of transcendental good sense in her remarks and her unfathomable goodnature moved me to admiration and envy the liking was returned she enjoyed my presence halfunconsciously as a man in deep meditation may enjoy the babbling of a brook i can scarce say she brightened when i came for satisfaction was written on her face eternally as on some foolish statues but i was made conscious of her pleasure by some more intimate communication than the sight and one day as i sat within reach of her on the marble step she suddenly shot forth one of her hands and patted mine the thing was done and she was back in her accustomed attitude before my mind had received intelligence of the caress and when i turned to look her in the face i could perceive no answerable sentiment it was plain she attached no moment to the act and i blamed myself for my own more uneasy consciousness  the sight and if i may so call it the acquaintance of the mother confirmed the view i had already taken of the son the family blood had been impoverished perhaps by long inbreeding which i knew to be a common error among the proud and the exclusive no decline indeed was to be traced in the body which had been handed down unimpaired in shapeliness and strength and the faces of today were struck as sharply from the mint as the face of two centuries ago that smiled upon me from the portrait but the intelligence that more precious heirloom was degenerate the treasure of ancestral memory ran low and it had required the potent plebeian crossing of a muleteer or mountain contrabandista to raise what approached hebetude in the mother into the active oddity of the son yet of the two it was the mother i preferred of felipe vengeful and placable full of starts and shyings inconstant as a hare i could even conceive as a creature possibly noxious of the mother i had no thoughts but those of kindness and indeed as spectators are apt ignorantly to take sides i grew something of a partisan in the enmity which i perceived to smoulder between them true it seemed mostly on the mothers part she would sometimes draw in her breath as he came near and the pupils of her vacant eyes would contract as if with horror or fear her emotions such as they were were much upon the surface and readily shared and this latent repulsion occupied my mind and kept me wondering on what grounds it rested and whether the son was certainly in fault  i had been about ten days in the residencia when there sprang up a high and harsh wind carrying clouds of dust it came out of malarious lowlands and over several snowy sierras the nerves of those on whom it blew were strung and jangled their eyes smarted with the dust their legs ached under the burthen of their body and the touch of one hand upon another grew to be odious the wind besides came down the gullies of the hills and stormed about the house with a great hollow buzzing and whistling that was wearisome to the ear and dismally depressing to the mind it did not so much blow in gusts as with the steady sweep of a waterfall so that there was no remission of discomfort while it blew but higher up on the mountain it was probably of a more variable strength with accesses of fury for there came down at times a faroff wailing infinitely grievous to hear and at times on one of the high shelves or terraces there would start up and then disperse a tower of dust like the smoke of an explosion  i no sooner awoke in bed than i was conscious of the nervous tension and depression of the weather and the effect grew stronger as the day proceeded it was in vain that i resisted in vain that i set forth upon my customary mornings walk the irrational unchanging fury of the storm had soon beat down my strength and wrecked my temper and i returned to the residencia glowing with dry heat and foul and gritty with dust the court had a forlorn appearance now and then a glimmer of sun fled over it now and then the wind swooped down upon the pomegranates and scattered the blossoms and set the window shutter clapping on the wall in the recess the señora was pacing to and fro with a flushed countenance and bright eyes i thought too she was speaking to herself like one in anger but when i addressed her with my customary salutation she only replied by a sharp gesture and continued her walk the weather had distempered even this impassive creature and as i went on upstairs i was the less ashamed of my own discomposure  all day the wind continued and i sat in my room and made a feint of reading or walked up and down and listened to the riot overhead night fell and i had not so much as a candle i began to long for some society and stole down to the court it was now plunged in the blue of the first darkness but the recess was redly lighted by the fire the wood had been piled high and was crowned by a shock of flames which the draught of the chimney brandished to and fro in this strong and shaken brightness the señora continued pacing from wall to wall with disconnected gestures clasping her hands stretching forth her arms throwing back her head as in appeal to heaven in these disordered movements the beauty and grace of the woman showed more clearly but there was a light in her eye that struck on me unpleasantly and when i had looked on a while in silence and seemingly unobserved i turned tail as i had come and groped my way back again to my own chamber  by the time felipe brought my supper and lights my nerve was utterly gone and had the lad been such as i was used to seeing him i should have kept him even by force had that been necessary to take off the edge from my distasteful solitude but on felipe also the wind had exercised its influence he had been feverish all day now that the night had come he was fallen into a low and tremulous humour that reacted on my own the sight of his scared face his starts and pallors and sudden hearkenings unstrung me and when he dropped and broke a dish i fairly leaped out of my seat  i think we are all mad today said i affecting to laugh  it is the black wind he replied dolefully you feel as if you must do something and you dont know what it is  i noted the aptness of the description but indeed felipe had sometimes a strange felicity in rendering into words the sensations of the body and your mother too said i she seems to feel this weather much do you not fear she may be unwell  he stared at me a little and then said no almost defiantly and the next moment carrying his hand to his brow cried out lamentably on the wind and the noise that made his head go round like a millwheel who can be well he cried and indeed i could only echo his question for i was disturbed enough myself  i went to bed early wearied with daylong restlessness but the poisonous nature of the wind and its ungodly and unintermittent uproar would not suffer me to sleep i lay there and tossed my nerves and senses on the stretch at times i would doze dream horribly and wake again and these snatches of oblivion confused me as to time but it must have been late on in the night when i was suddenly startled by an outbreak of pitiable and hateful cries i leaped from my bed supposing i had dreamed but the cries still continued to fill the house cries of pain i thought but certainly of rage also and so savage and discordant that they shocked the heart it was no illusion some living thing some lunatic or some wild animal was being foully tortured the thought of felipe and the squirrel flashed into my mind and i ran to the door but it had been locked from the outside and i might shake it as i pleased i was a fast prisoner still the cries continued now they would dwindle down into a moaning that seemed to be articulate and at these times i made sure they must be human and again they would break forth and fill the house with ravings worthy of hell i stood at the door and gave ear to them till at last they died away long after that i still lingered and still continued to hear them mingle in fancy with the storming of the wind and when at last i crept to my bed it was with a deadly sickness and a blackness of horror on my heart  it was little wonder if i slept no more why had i been locked in what had passed who was the author of these indescribable and shocking cries a human being it was inconceivable a beast the cries were scarce quite bestial and what animal short of a lion or a tiger could thus shake the solid walls of the residencia and while i was thus turning over the elements of the mystery it came into my mind that i had not yet set eyes upon the daughter of the house what was more probable than that the daughter of the señora and the sister of felipe should be herself insane or what more likely than that these ignorant and halfwitted people should seek to manage an afflicted kinswoman by violence here was a solution and yet when i called to mind the cries which i never did without a shuddering chill it seemed altogether insufficient not even cruelty could wring such cries from madness but of one thing i was sure i could not live in a house where such a thing was half conceivable and not probe the matter home and if necessary interfere  the next day came the wind had blown itself out and there was nothing to remind me of the business of the night felipe came to my bedside with obvious cheerfulness as i passed through the court the señora was sunning herself with her accustomed immobility and when i issued from the gateway i found the whole face of nature austerely smiling the heavens of a cold blue and sown with great cloud islands and the mountainsides mapped forth into provinces of light and shadow a short walk restored me to myself and renewed within me the resolve to plumb this mystery and when from the vantage of my knoll i had seen felipe pass forth to his labours in the garden i returned at once to the residencia to put my design in practice the señora appeared plunged in slumber i stood a while and marked her but she did not stir even if my design were indiscreet i had little to fear from such a guardian and turning away i mounted to the gallery and began my exploration of the house  all morning i went from one door to another and entered spacious and faded chambers some rudely shuttered some receiving their full charge of daylight all empty and unhomely it was a rich house on which time had breathed its tarnish and dust had scattered disillusion the spider swung there the bloated tarantula scampered on the cornices ants had their crowded highways on the floor of halls of audience the big and foul fly that lives on carrion and is often the messenger of death had set up his nest in the rotten woodwork and buzzed heavily about the rooms here and there a stool or two a couch a bed or a great carved chair remained behind like islets on the bare floors to testify of mans bygone habitation and everywhere the walls were set with the portraits of the dead i could judge by these decaying effigies in the house of what a great and what a handsome race i was then wandering many of the men wore orders on their breasts and had the port of noble offices the women were all richly attired the canvases most of them by famous hands but it was not so much these evidences of greatness that took hold upon my mind even contrasted as they were with the present depopulation and decay of that great house it was rather the parable of family life that i read in this succession of fair faces and shapely bodies never before had i so realised the miracle of the continued race the creation and recreation the weaving and changing and handing down of fleshly elements that a child should be born of its mother that it should grow and clothe itself we know not how with humanity and put on inherited looks and turn its head with the manner of one ascendant and offer its hand with the gesture of another are wonders dulled for us by repetition but in the singular unity of look in the common features and common bearing of all these painted generations on the walls of the residencia the miracle started out and looked me in the face and an ancient mirror falling opportunely in my way i stood and read my own features a long while tracing out on either hand the filaments of descent and the bonds that knit me with my family  at last in the course of these investigations i opened the door of a chamber that bore the marks of habitation it was of large proportions and faced to the north where the mountains were most wildly figured the embers of a fire smouldered and smoked upon the hearth to which a chair had been drawn close and yet the aspect of the chamber was ascetic to the degree of sternness the chair was uncushioned the floor and walls were naked and beyond the books which lay here and there in some confusion there was no instrument of either work or pleasure the sight of books in the house of such a family exceedingly amazed me and i began with a great hurry and in momentary fear of interruption to go from one to another and hastily inspect their character they were of all sorts devotional historical and scientific but mostly of a great age and in the latin tongue some i could see to bear the marks of constant study others had been torn across and tossed aside as if in petulance or disapproval lastly as i cruised about that empty chamber i espied some papers written upon with pencil on a table near the window an unthinking curiosity led me to take one up it bore a copy of verses very roughly metred in the original spanish and which i may render somewhat thus    pleasure approached with pain and shame   grief with a wreath of lilies came   pleasure showed the lovely sun   jesu dear how sweet it shone   grief with her worn hand pointed on                jesu dear to thee  shame and confusion at once fell on me and laying down the paper i beat an immediate retreat from the apartment neither felipe nor his mother could have read the books nor written these rough but feeling verses it was plain i had stumbled with sacrilegious feet into the room of the daughter of the house god knows my own heart most sharply punished me for my indiscretion the thought that i had thus secretly pushed my way into the confidence of a girl so strangely situated and the fear that she might somehow come to hear of it oppressed me like guilt i blamed myself besides for my suspicions of the night before wondered that i should ever have attributed those shocking cries to one of whom i now conceived as of a saint spectral of mien wasted with maceration bound up in the practices of a mechanical devotion and dwelling in a great isolation of soul with her incongruous relatives and as i leaned on the balustrade of the gallery and looked down into the bright close of pomegranates and at the gaily dressed and somnolent woman who just then stretched herself and delicately licked her lips as in the very sensuality of sloth my mind swiftly compared the scene with the cold chamber looking northward on the mountains where the daughter dwelt  that same afternoon as i sat upon my knoll i saw the padre enter the gates of the residencia the revelation of the daughters character had struck home to my fancy and almost blotted out the horrors of the night before but at sight of this worthy man the memory revived i descended then from the knoll and making a circuit among the woods posted myself by the wayside to await his passage as soon as he appeared i stepped forth and introduced myself as the lodger of the residencia he had a very strong honest countenance on which it was easy to read the mingled emotions with which he regarded me as a foreigner a heretic and yet one who had been wounded for the good cause of the family at the residencia he spoke with reserve and yet with respect i mentioned that i had not yet seen the daughter whereupon he remarked that that was as it should be and looked at me a little askance lastly i plucked up courage to refer to the cries that had disturbed me in the night he heard me out in silence and then stopped and partly turned about as though to mark beyond doubt that he was dismissing me  do you take tobaccopowder said he offering his snuffbox and then when i had refused i am an old man he added and i may be allowed to remind you that you are a guest  i have then your authority i returned firmly enough although i flushed at the implied reproof to let things take their course and not to interfere  he said yes and with a somewhat uneasy salute turned and left me where i was but he had done two things he had set my conscience at rest and he had awakened my delicacy i made a great effort once more dismissed the recollections of the night and fell once more to brooding on my saintly poetess at the same time i could not quite forget that i had been locked in and that night when felipe brought me my supper i attacked him warily on both points of interest  i never see your sister said i casually  oh no said he she is a good good girl and his mind instantly veered to something else  your sister is pious i suppose i asked in the next pause  oh he cried joining his hands with extreme fervour a saint it is she that keeps me up  you are very fortunate said i for the most of us i am afraid and myself among the number are better at going down  señor said felipe earnestly i would not say that you should not tempt your angel if one goes down where is he to stop  why felipe said i i had no guess you were a preacher and i may say a good one but i suppose that is your sisters doing  he nodded at me with round eyes  well then i continued she has doubtless reproved you for your sin of cruelty  twelve times he cried for this was the phrase by which the odd creature expressed the sense of frequency and i told her you had done soi remembered that he added proudlyand she was pleased  then felipe said i what were those cries that i heard last night for surely they were cries of some creature in suffering  the wind returned felipe looking in the fire  i took his hand in mine at which thinking it to be a caress he smiled with a brightness of pleasure that came near disarming my resolve but i trod the weakness down the wind i repeated and yet i think it was this hand holding it up that had first locked me in the lad shook visibly but answered never a word well said i i am a stranger and a guest it is not my part either to meddle or to judge in your affairs in these you shall take your sisters counsel which i cannot doubt to be excellent but in so far as concerns my own i will be no mans prisoner and i demand that key half an hour later my door was suddenly thrown open and the key tossed ringing on the floor  a day or two after i came in from a walk a little before the point of noon the senõra was lying lapped in slumber on the threshold of the recess the pigeons dozed below the eaves like snowdrifts the house was under a deep spell of noontide quiet and only a wandering and gentle wind from the mountain stole round the galleries rustled among the pomegranates and pleasantly stirred the shadows something in the stillness moved me to imitation and i went very lightly across the court and up the marble staircase my foot was on the topmost round when a door opened and i found myself face to face with olalla surprise transfixed me her loveliness struck to my heart she glowed in the deep shadow of the gallery a gem of colour her eyes took hold upon mine and clung there and bound us together like the joining of hands and the moments we thus stood face to face drinking each other in were sacramental and the wedding of souls i know not how long it was before i awoke out of a deep trance and hastily bowing passed on into the upper stair she did not move but followed me with her great thirsting eyes and as i passed out of sight it seemed to me as if she paled and faded  in my own room i opened the window and looked out and could not think what change had come upon that austere field of mountains that it should thus sing and shine under the lofty heaven i had seen herolalla and the stone crags answered olalla and the dumb unfathomable azure answered olalla the pale saint of my dreams had vanished for ever and in her place i beheld this maiden on whom god had lavished the richest colours and the most exuberant energies of life whom he had made active as a deer slender as a reed and in whose great eyes he had lighted the torches of the soul the thrill of her young life strung like a wild animals had entered into me the force of soul that had looked out from her eyes and conquered mine mantled about my heart and sprang to my lips in singing she passed through my veins she was one with me  i will not say that this enthusiasm declined rather my soul held out in its ecstasy as in a strong castle and was there besieged by cold and sorrowful considerations i could not doubt but that i loved her at first sight and already with a quivering ardour that was strange to my experience what then was to follow she was the child of an afflicted house the señoras daughter the sister of felipe she bore it even in her beauty she had the lightness and swiftness of the one swift as an arrow light as dew like the other she shone on the pale background of the world with the brilliancy of flowers i could not call by the name of brother that halfwitted lad nor by the name of mother that immovable and lovely thing of flesh whose silly eyes and perpetual simper now recurred to my mind like something hateful and if i could not marry what then she was helplessly unprotected her eyes in that single and long glance which had been all our intercourse had confessed a weakness equal to my own but in my heart i knew her for the student of the cold northern chamber and the writer of the sorrowful lines and this was a knowledge to disarm a brute to flee was more than i could find courage for but i registered a vow of unsleeping circumspection  as i turned from the window my eyes alighted on the portrait it had fallen dead like a candle after sunrise it followed me with eyes of paint i knew it to be like and marvelled at the tenacity of type in that declining race but the likeness was swallowed up in difference i remembered how it had seemed to me a thing unapproachable in the life a creature rather of the painters craft than of the modesty of nature and i marvelled at the thought and exulted in the image of olalla beauty i had seen before and not been charmed and i had been often drawn to women who were not beautiful except to me but in olalla all that i desired and had not dared to imagine was united  i did not see her the next day and my heart ached and my eyes longed for her as men long for morning but the day after when i returned about my usual hour she was once more on the gallery and our looks once more met and embraced i would have spoken i would have drawn near to her but strongly as she plucked at my heart drawing me like a magnet something yet more imperious withheld me and i could only bow and pass by and she leaving my salutation unanswered only followed me with her noble eyes  i had now her image by rote and as i conned the traits in memory it seemed as if i read her very heart she was dressed with something of her mothers coquetry and love of positive colour her robe which i knew she must have made with her own hands clung about her with a cunning grace after the fashion of that country besides her bodice stood open in the middle in a long slit and here in spite of the poverty of the house a gold coin hanging by a ribbon lay on her brown bosom these were proofs had any been needed of her inborn delight in life and her own loveliness on the other hand in her eyes that hung upon mine i could read depth beyond depth of passion and sadness lights of poetry and hope blacknesses of despair and thoughts that were above the earth it was a lovely body but the inmate the soul was more than worthy of that lodging should i leave this incomparable flower to wither unseen on these rough mountains should i despise the great gift offered me in the eloquent silence of her eyes here was a soul immured should i not burst its prison all side considerations fell off from me were she the child of herod i swore i should make her mine and that very evening i set myself with a mingled sense of treachery and disgrace to captivate the brother perhaps i read him with more favourable eyes perhaps the thought of his sister always summoned up the better qualities of that imperfect soul but he had never seemed to me so amiable and his very likeness to olalla while it annoyed yet softened me  a third day passed in vainan empty desert of hours i would not lose a chance and loitered all afternoon in the court where to give myself a countenance i spoke more than usual with the señora god knows it was with a most tender and sincere interest that i now studied her and even as for felipe so now for the mother i was conscious of a growing warmth of toleration and yet i wondered even while i spoke with her she would doze off into a little sleep and presently awake again without embarrassment and this composure staggered me and again as i marked her make infinitesimal changes in her posture savouring and lingering on the bodily pleasure of the movement i was driven to wonder at this depth of passive sensuality she lived in her body and her consciousness was all sunk into and disseminated through her members where it luxuriously dwelt lastly i could not grow accustomed to her eyes each time she turned on me those great beautiful and meaningless orbs wide open to the day but closed against human inquiryeach time i had occasion to observe the lively changes of her pupils which expanded and contracted in a breathi know not what it was came over me i can find no name for the mingled feeling of disappointment annoyance and distaste that jarred along my nerves i tried her on a variety of subjects equally in vain and at last led the talk to her daughter but even there she proved indifferent said she was pretty which as with children was her highest word of commendation but was plainly incapable of any higher thought and when i remarked that olalla seemed silent merely yawned in my face and replied that speech was of no great use when you had nothing to say people speak much very much she added looking at me with expanded pupils and then again yawned and again showed me a mouth that was as dainty as a toy this time i took the hint and leaving her to her repose went up into my own chamber to sit by the open window looking on the hills and not beholding them sunk in lustrous and deep dreams and hearkening in fancy to the note of a voice that i had never heard  i awoke on the fifth morning with a brightness of anticipation that seemed to challenge fate i was sure of myself light of heart and foot and resolved to put my love incontinently to the touch of knowledge it should lie no longer under the bonds of silence a dumb thing living by the eye only like the love of beasts but should now put on the spirit and enter upon the joys of the complete human intimacy i thought of it with wild hopes like a voyager to el dorado into that unknown and lovely country of her soul i no longer trembled to adventure yet when i did indeed encounter her the same force of passion descended on me and at once submerged my mind speech seemed to drop away from me like a childish habit and i but drew near to her as the giddy man draws near to the margin of a gulf she drew back from me a little as i came but her eyes did not waver from mine and these lured me forward at last when i was already within reach of her i stopped words were denied me if i advanced i could but clasp her to my heart in silence and all that was sane in me all that was still unconquered revolted against the thought of such an accost so we stood for a second all our life in our eyes exchanging salvos of attraction and yet each resisting and then with a great effort of the will and conscious at the same time of a sudden bitterness of disappointment i turned and went away in the same silence  what power lay upon me that i could not speak and she why was she also silent why did she draw away before me dumbly with fascinated eyes was this love or was it a mere brute attraction mindless and inevitable like that of the magnet for the steel we had never spoken we were wholly strangers and yet an influence strong as the grasp of a giant swept us silently together on my side it filled me with impatience and yet i was sure that she was worthy i had seen her books read her verses and thus in a sense divined the soul of my mistress but on her side it struck me almost cold of me she knew nothing but my bodily favour she was drawn to me as stones fall to the earth the laws that rule the earth conducted her unconsenting to my arms and i drew back at the thought of such a bridal and began to be jealous for myself it was not thus that i desired to be loved and then i began to fall into a great pity for the girl herself i thought how sharp must be her mortification that she the student the recluse felipes saintly monitress should have thus confessed an overweening weakness for a man with whom she had never exchanged a word and at the coming of pity all other thoughts were swallowed up and i longed only to find and console and reassure her to tell her how wholly her love was returned on my side and how her choice even if blindly made was not unworthy  the next day it was glorious weather depth upon depth of blue overcanopied the mountains the sun shone wide and the wind in the trees and the many fallen torrents in the mountains filled the air with delicate and haunting music yet i was prostrated with sadness my heart wept for the sight of olalla as a child weeps for its mother i sat down on a boulder on the verge of the low cliffs that bound the plateau to the north thence i looked down into the wooded valley of a stream where no foot came in the mood i was in it was even touching to behold the place untenanted it lacked olalla and i thought of the delight and glory of a life passed wholly with her in that strong air and among these rugged and lovely surroundings at first with a whimpering sentiment and then again with such a fiery joy that i seemed to grow in strength and stature like a samson  and then suddenly i was aware of olalla drawing near she appeared out of a grove of corktrees and came straight towards me and i stood up and waited she seemed in her walking a creature of such life and fire and lightness as amazed me yet she came quietly and slowly her energy was in the slowness but for inimitable strength i felt she would have run she would have flown to me still as she approached she kept her eyes lowered to the ground and when she had drawn quite near it was without one glance that she addressed me at the first note of her voice i started it was for this i had been waiting this was the last test of my love and lo her enunciation was precise and clear not lisping and incomplete like that of her family and the voice though deeper than usual with women was still both youthful and womanly she spoke in a rich chord golden contralto strains mingled with hoarseness as the red threads were mingled with the brown among her tresses it was not only a voice that spoke to my heart directly but it spoke to me of her and yet her words immediately plunged me back upon despair  you will go away she said today  her example broke the bonds of my speech i felt as lightened of a weight or as if a spell had been dissolved i know not in what words i answered but standing before her on the cliffs i poured out the whole ardour of my love telling her that i lived upon the thought of her slept only to dream of her loveliness and would gladly forswear my country my language and my friends to live for ever by her side and then strongly commanding myself i changed the note i reassured i comforted her i told her i had divined in her a pious and heroic spirit with which i was worthy to sympathise and which i longed to share and lighten nature i told her was the voice of god which men disobey at peril and if we were thus dumbly drawn together ay even as by a miracle of love it must imply a divine fitness in our souls we must be made i saidmade for one another we should be mad rebels i cried outmad rebels against god not to obey this instinct  she shook her head you will go today she repeated and then with a gesture and in a sudden sharp noteno not today she cried tomorrow  but at this sign of relenting power came in upon me in a tide i stretched out my arms and called upon her name and she leaped to me and clung to me the hills rocked about us the earth quailed a shock as of a blow went through me and left me blind and dizzy and the next moment she had thrust me back broken rudely from my arms and fled with the speed of a deer among the corktrees  i stood and shouted to the mountains i turned and went back towards the residencia walking upon air she sent me away and yet i had but to call upon her name and she came to me these were but the weaknesses of girls from which even she the strangest of her sex was not exempted go not i olallaoh not i olalla my olalla a bird sang near by and in that season birds were rare it bade me be of good cheer and once more the whole countenance of nature from the ponderous and stable mountains down to the lightest leaf and the smallest darting fly in the shadow of the groves began to stir before me and to put on the lineaments of life and wear a face of awful joy the sunshine struck upon the hills strong as a hammer on the anvil and the hills shook the earth under that vigorous insolation yielded up heady scents the woods smouldered in the blaze i felt the thrill of travail and delight run through the earth something elemental something rude violent and savage in the love that sang in my heart was like a key to natures secrets and the very stones that rattled under my feet appeared alive and friendly olalla her touch had quickened and renewed and strung me up to the old pitch of concert with the rugged earth to a swelling of the soul that men learn to forget in their polite assemblies love burned in me like rage tenderness waxed fierce i hated i adored i pitied i revered her with ecstasy she seemed the link that bound me in with dead things on the one hand and with our pure and pitying god upon the other a thing brutal and divine and akin at once to the innocence and to the unbridled forces of the earth  my head thus reeling i came into the courtyard of the residencia and the sight of the mother struck me like a revelation she sat there all sloth and contentment blinking under the strong sunshine branded with a passive enjoyment a creature set quite apart before whom my ardour fell away like a thing ashamed i stopped a moment and commanding such shaken tones as i was able said a word or two she looked at me with her unfathomable kindness her voice in reply sounded vaguely out of the realm of peace in which she slumbered and there fell on my mind for the first time a sense of respect for one so uniformly innocent and happy and i passed on in a kind of wonder at myself that i should be so much disquieted  on my table there lay a piece of the same yellow paper i had seen in the north room it was written on with pencil in the same hand olallas hand and i picked it up with a sudden sinking of alarm and read if you have any kindness for olalla if you have any chivalry for a creature sorely wrought go from here today in pity in honour for the sake of him who died i supplicate that you shall go i looked at this a while in mere stupidity then i began to awaken to a weariness and horror of life the sunshine darkened outside on the bare hills and i began to shake like a man in terror the vacancy thus suddenly opened in my life unmanned me like a physical void it was not my heart it was not my happiness it was life itself that was involved i could not lose her i said so and stood repeating it and then like one in a dream i moved to the window put forth my hand to open the casement and thrust it through the pane the blood spurted from my wrist and with an instantaneous quietude and command of myself i pressed my thumb on the little leaping fountain and reflected what to do in that empty room there was nothing to my purpose i felt besides that i required assistance there shot into my mind a hope that olalla herself might be my helper and i turned and went downstairs still keeping my thumb upon the wound  there was no sign of either olalla or felipe and i addressed myself to the recess whither the señora had now drawn quite back and sat dozing close before the fire for no degree of heat appeared too much for her  pardon me said i if i disturb you but i must apply to you for help  she looked up sleepily and asked me what it was and with the very words i thought she drew in her breath with a widening of the nostrils and seemed to come suddenly and fully alive  i have cut myself i said and rather badly see and i held out my two hands from which the blood was oozing and dripping  her great eyes opened wide the pupils shrank into points a veil seemed to fall from her face and leave it sharply expressive and yet inscrutable and as i still stood marvelling a little at her disturbance she came swiftly up to me and stooped and caught me by the hand and the next moment my hand was at her mouth and she had bitten me to the bone the pang of the bite the sudden spurting of blood and the monstrous horror of the act flashed through me all in one and i beat her back and she sprang at me again and again with bestial cries cries that i recognised such cries as had awakened me on the night of the high wind her strength was like that of madness mine was rapidly ebbing with the loss of blood my mind besides was whirling with the abhorrent strangeness of the onslaught and i was already forced against the wall when olalla ran betwixt us and felipe following at a bound pinned down his mother on the floor  a trancelike weakness fell upon me i saw heard and felt but i was incapable of movement i heard the struggle roll to and fro upon the floor the yells of the catamount ringing up to heaven as she strove to reach me i felt olalla clasp me in her arms her hair falling on my face and with the strength of a man raise and half drag half carry me upstairs into my own room where she cast me down upon the bed then i saw her hasten to the door and lock it and stand an instant listening to the savage cries that shook the residencia and then swift and light as a thought she was again beside me binding up my hand laying it in her bosom moaning and mourning over it with dovelike sounds they were not words that came to her they were sounds more beautiful than speech infinitely touching infinitely tender and yet as i lay there a thought stung to my heart a thought wounded me like a sword a thought like a worm in a flower profaned the holiness of my love yes they were beautiful sounds and they were inspired by human tenderness but was their beauty human  all day i lay there for a long time the cries of that nameless female thing as she struggled with her halfwitted whelp resounded through the house and pierced me with despairing sorrow and disgust they were the deathcry of my love my love was murdered it was not only dead but an offence to me and yet think as i pleased feel as i must it still swelled within me like a storm of sweetness and my heart melted at her looks and touch this horror that had sprung out this doubt upon olalla this savage and bestial strain that ran not only through the whole behaviour of her family but found a place in the very foundations and story of our lovethough it appalled though it shocked and sickened me was yet not of power to break the knot of my infatuation  when the cries had ceased there came a scraping at the door by which i knew felipe was without and olalla went and spoke to himi know not what with that exception she stayed close beside me now kneeling by my bed and fervently praying now sitting with her eyes upon mine so then for these six hours i drank in her beauty and silently perused the story in her face i saw the golden coin hover on her breaths i saw her eyes darken and brighten and still speak no language but that of an unfathomable kindness i saw the faultless face and through the robe the lines of the faultless body night came at last and in the growing darkness of the chamber the sight of her slowly melted but even then the touch of her smooth hand lingered in mine and talked with me to lie thus in deadly weakness and drink in the traits of the beloved is to reawake to love from whatever shock of disillusion i reasoned with myself and i shut my eyes on horrors and again i was very bold to accept the worst what mattered it if that imperious sentiment survived if her eyes still beckoned and attached me if now even as before every fibre of my dull body yearned and turned to her late on in the night some strength revived in me and i spoke  olalla i said nothing matters i ask nothing i am content i love you  she knelt down a while and prayed and i devoutly respected her devotions the moon had begun to shine in upon one side of each of the three windows and make a misty clearness in the room by which i saw her indistinctly when she rearose she made the sign of the cross  it is for me to speak she said and for you to listen i know you can but guess i prayed how i prayed for you to leave this place i begged it of you and i know you would have granted me even this or if not oh let me think so  i love you i said  and yet you have lived in the world she said after a pause you are a man and wise and i am but a child forgive me if i seem to teach who am as ignorant as the trees of the mountain but those who learn much do but skim the face of knowledge they seize the laws they conceive the dignity of the designthe horror of the living fact fades from their memory it is we who sit at home with evil who remember i think and are warned and pity go rather go now and keep me in mind so i shall have a life in the cherished places of your memory a life as much my own as that which i lead in this body  i love you i said once more and reaching out my weak hand took hers and carried it to my lips and kissed it nor did she resist but winced a little and i could see her look upon me with a frown that was not unkindly only sad and baffled and then it seemed she made a call upon her resolution plucked my hand towards her herself at the same time leaning somewhat forward and laid it on the beating of her heart there she cried you feel the very footfall of my life it only moves for you it is yours but is it even mine it is mine indeed to offer you as i might take the coin from my neck as i might break a live branch from a tree and give it you and yet not mine i dwell or i think i dwell if i exist at all somewhere apart an impotent prisoner and carried about and deafened by a mob that i disown this capsule such as throbs against the sides of animals knows you at a touch for its master ay it loves you but my soul does my soul i think not i know not fearing to ask yet when you spoke to me your words were of the soul it is of the soul that you askit is only from the soul that you would take me  olalla i said the soul and the body are one and mostly so in love what the body chooses the soul loves where the body clings the soul cleaves body for body soul to soul they come together at gods signal and the lower part if we can call aught low is only the footstool and foundation of the highest  have you she said seen the portraits in the house of my fathers have you looked at my mother or at felipe have your eyes never rested on that picture that hangs by your bed she who sat for it died ages ago and she did evil in her life but look again there is my hand to the least line there are my eyes and my hair what is mine then and what am i if not a curve in this poor body of mine which you love and for the sake of which you dotingly dream that you love me not a gesture that i can frame not a tone of my voice not any look from my eyes no not even now when i speak to him i love but has belonged to others others ages dead have wooed other men with my eyes other men have heard the pleading of the same voice that now sounds in your ears the hands of the dead are in my bosom they move me they pluck me they guide me i am a puppet at their command and i but reinform features and attributes that have long been laid aside from evil in the quiet of the grave is it me you love friend or the race that made me the girl who does not know and cannot answer for the least portion of herself or the stream of which she is a transitory eddy the tree of which she is the passing fruit the race exists it is old it is ever young it carries its eternal destiny in its bosom upon it like waves upon the sea individual succeeds to individual mocked with a semblance of selfcontrol but they are nothing we speak of the soul but the soul is in the race  you fret against the common law i said you rebel against the voice of god which he has made so winning to convince so imperious to command hear it and how it speaks between us your hand clings to mine your heart leaps at my touch the unknown elements of which we are compounded awake and run together at a look the clay of the earth remembers its independent life and yearns to join us we are drawn together as the stars are turned about in space or as the tides ebb and flow by things older and greater than we ourselves  alas she said what can i say to you my fathers eight hundred years ago ruled all this province they were wise great cunning and cruel they were a picked race of the spanish their flags led in war the king called them his cousin the people when the rope was slung for them or when they returned and found their hovels smoking blasphemed their name presently a change began man has risen if he has sprung from the brutes he can descend again to the same level the breath of weariness blew on their humanity and the cords relaxed they began to go down their minds fell on sleep their passions awoke in gusts heady and senseless like the wind in the gutters of the mountains beauty was still handed down but no longer the guiding wit nor the human heart the seed passed on it was wrapped in flesh the flesh covered the bones but they were the bones and the flesh of brutes and their mind was as the mind of flies i speak to you as i dare but you have seen for yourself how the wheel has gone backward with my doomed race i stand as it were upon a little rising ground in this desperate descent and see both before and behind both what we have lost and to what we are condemned to go farther downward and shall ii that dwell apart in the house of the dead my body loathing its waysshall i repeat the spell shall i bind another spirit reluctant as my own into this bewitched and tempestbroken tenement that i now suffer in shall i hand down this cursed vessel of humanity charge it with fresh life as with fresh poison and dash it like a fire in the faces of posterity but my vow has been given the race shall cease from off the earth at this hour my brother is making ready his foot will soon be on the stair and you will go with him and pass out of my sight for ever think of me sometimes as one to whom the lesson of life was very harshly told but who heard it with courage as one who loved you indeed but who hated herself so deeply that her love was hateful to her as one who sent you away and yet would have longed to keep you for ever who had no dearer hope than to forget you and no greater fear than to be forgotten  she had drawn towards the door as she spoke her rich voice sounding softer and farther away and with the last word she was gone and i lay alone in the moonlit chamber what i might have done had not i lain bound by my extreme weakness i know not but as it was there fell upon me a great and blank despair it was not long before there shone in at the door the ruddy glimmer of a lantern and felipe coming charged me without a word upon his shoulders and carried me down to the great gate where the cart was waiting in the moonlight the hills stood out sharply as if they were of cardboard on the glimmering surface of the plateau and from among the low trees which swung together and sparkled in the wind the great black cube of the residencia stood out bulkily its mass only broken by three dimly lighted windows in the northern front above the gate they were olallas windows and as the cart jolted onwards i kept my eyes fixed upon them till where the road dipped into a valley they were lost to my view for ever felipe walked in silence beside the shafts but from time to time he would check the mule and seem to look back upon me and at length drew quite near and laid his hand upon my head there was such kindness in the touch and such a simplicity as of the brutes that tears broke from me like the bursting of an artery  felipe i said take me where they will ask no questions  he said never a word but he turned his mule about end for end retraced some part of the way we had gone and striking into another path led me to the mountain village which was as we say in scotland the kirktown of that thinly peopled district some broken memories dwell in my mind of the day breaking over the plain of the cart stopping of arms that helped me down of a bare room into which i was carried and of a swoon that fell upon me like sleep  the next day and the days following the old priest was often at my side with his snuffbox and prayerbook and after a while when i began to pick up strength he told me that i was now on a fair way to recovery and must as soon as possible hurry my departure whereupon without naming any reason he took snuff and looked at me sideways i did not affect ignorance i knew he must have seen olalla sir said i you know that i do not ask in wantonness what of that family  he said they were very unfortunate that it seemed a declining race and that they were very poor and had been much neglected  but she has not i said thanks doubtless to yourself she is instructed and wise beyond the use of women  yes he said the señorita is wellinformed but the family has been neglected  the mother i queried  yes the mother too said the padre taking snuff but felipe is a wellintentioned lad  the mother is odd i asked  very odd replied the priest  i think sir we beat about the bush said i you must know more of my affairs than you allow you must know my curiosity to be justified on many grounds will you not be frank with me  my son said the old gentleman i will be very frank with you on matters within my competence on those of which i know nothing it does not require much discretion to be silent i will not fence with you i take your meaning perfectly and what can i say but that we are all in gods hands and that his ways are not our ways i have even advised with my superiors in the church but they too were dumb it is a great mystery  is she mad i asked  i will answer you according to my belief she is not returned the padre or she was not when she was younggod help me i fear i neglected that wild lambshe was surely sane and yet although it did not run to such heights the same strain was already notable it had been so before her in her father ay and before him and this inclined me perhaps to think too lightly of it but these things go on growing not only in the individual but in the race  when she was young i began and my voice failed me for a moment and it was only with a great effort that i was able to add was she like olalla  now god forbid exclaimed the padre god forbid that any man should think so slightingly of my favourite penitent no no the señorita but for her beauty which i wish most honestly she had less of has not a hairs resemblance to what her mother was at the same age i could not bear to have you think so though heaven knows it were perhaps better that you should  at this i raised myself in bed and opened my heart to the old man telling him of our love and of her decision owning my own horrors my own passing fancies but telling him that these were at an end and with something more than a purely formal submission appealing to his judgment  he heard me very patiently and without surprise and when i had done he sat for some time silent then he began the church and instantly broke off again to apologise i had forgotten my child that you were not a christian said he and indeed upon a point so highly unusual even the church can scarce be said to have decided but would you have my opinion the señorita is in a matter of this kind the best judge i would accept her judgment  on the back of that he went away nor was he thenceforward so assiduous in his visits indeed even when i began to get about again he plainly feared and deprecated my society not as in distaste but much as a man might be disposed to flee from the riddling sphinx the villagers too avoided me they were unwilling to be my guides upon the mountain i thought they looked at me askance and i made sure that the more superstitious crossed themselves on my approach at first i set this down to my heretical opinions but it began at length to dawn upon me that if i was thus redoubted it was because i had stayed at the residencia all men despise the savage notions of such peasantry and yet i was conscious of a chill shadow that seemed to fall and dwell upon my love it did not conquer but i may not deny that it restrained my ardour  some miles westward of the village there was a gap in the sierra from which the eye plunged direct upon the residencia and thither it became my daily habit to repair a wood crowned the summit and just where the pathway issued from its fringes it was overhung by a considerable shelf of rock and that in its turn was surmounted by a crucifix of the size of life and more than usually painful in design this was my perch thence day after day i looked down upon the plateau and the great old house and could see felipe no bigger than a fly going to and fro about the garden sometimes mists would draw across the view and be broken up again by mountain winds sometimes the plain slumbered below me in unbroken sunshine it would sometimes be all blotted out by rain this distant post these interrupted sights of the place where my life had been so strangely changed suited the indecision of my humour i passed whole days there debating with myself the various elements of our position now leaning to the suggestions of love now giving an ear to prudence and in the end halting irresolute between the two  one day as i was sitting on my rock there came by that way a somewhat gaunt peasant wrapped in a mantle he was a stranger and plainly did not know me even by repute for instead of keeping the other side he drew near and sat down beside me and we had soon fallen in talk among other things he told me he had been a muleteer and in former years had much frequented these mountains later on he had followed the army with his mules had realised a competence and was now living retired with his family  do you know that house i inquired at last pointing to the residencia for i readily wearied of any talk that kept me from the thought of olalla  he looked at me darkly and crossed himself  too well he said it was there that one of my comrades sold himself to satan the virgin shield us from temptations he has paid the price he is now burning in the reddest place in hell  a fear came upon me i could answer nothing and presently the man resumed as if to himself yes he said o yes i know it i have passed its doors there was snow upon the pass the wind was driving it sure enough there was death that night upon the mountains but there was worse beside the hearth i took him by the arm señor and dragged him to the gate i conjured him by all he loved and respected to go forth with me i went on my knees before him in the snow and i could see he was moved by my entreaty and just then she came out on the gallery and called him by his name and he turned and there was she standing with a lamp in her hand and smiling on him to come back i cried out aloud to god and threw my arms about him but he put me by and left me alone he had made his choice god help us i would pray for him but to what end there are sins that not even the pope can loose  and your friend i asked what became of him  nay god knows said the muleteer if all be true that we hear his end was like his sin a thing to raise the hair  do you mean that he was killed i asked  sure enough he was killed returned the man but how ah how but these are things that it is sin to speak of  the people of that house  i began  but he interrupted me with a savage outburst the people he cried what people there are neither men nor women in that house of satans what have you lived here so long and never heard and here he put his mouth to my ear and whispered as if even the fowls of the mountain might have overheard and been stricken with horror  what he told me was not true nor was it even original being indeed but a new edition vamped up again by village ignorance and superstition of stories nearly as ancient as the race of man it was rather the application that appalled me in the old days he said the church would have burned out that nest of basilisks but the arm of the church was now shortened his friend miguel had been unpunished by the hands of men and left to the more awful judgment of an offended god this was wrong but it should be so no more the padre was sunk in age he was even bewitched himself but the eyes of his flock were now awake to their own danger and some dayay and before longthe smoke of that house should go up to heaven  he left me filled with horror and fear which way to turn i knew not whether first to warn the padre or to carry my ill news direct to the threatened inhabitants of the residencia fate was to decide for me for while i was still hesitating i beheld the veiled figure of a woman drawing near to me up the pathway no veil could deceive my penetration by every line and every movement i recognised olalla and keeping hidden behind a corner of the rock i suffered her to gain the summit then i came forward she knew me and paused but did not speak i too remained silent and we continued for some time to gaze upon each other with a passionate sadness  i thought you had gone she said at length it is all that you can do for meto go it is all i ever asked of you and you still stay but do you know that every day heaps up the peril of death not only on your head but on ours a report has gone about the mountain it is thought you love me and the people will not suffer it  i saw she was already informed of her danger and i rejoiced at it olalla i said i am ready to go this day this very hour but not alone  she stepped aside and knelt down before the crucifix to pray and i stood by and looked now at her and now at the object of her adoration now at the living figure of the penitent and now at the ghastly daubed countenance the painted wounds and the projected ribs of the image the silence was only broken by the wailing of some large birds that circled sidelong as if in surprise or alarm about the summit of the hills presently olalla rose again turned towards me raised her veil and still leaning with one hand on the shaft of the crucifix looked upon me with a pale and sorrowful countenance  i have laid my hand upon the cross she said the padre says you are no christian but look up for a moment with my eyes and behold the face of the man of sorrows we are all such as he wasthe inheritors of sin we must all bear and expiate a past which was not ours there is in all of usay even in mea sparkle of the divine like him we must endure for a little while until morning returns bringing peace suffer me to pass on upon my way alone it is thus that i shall be least lonely counting for my friend him who is the friend of all the distressed it is thus that i shall be the most happy having taken my farewell of earthly happiness and willingly accepted sorrow for my portion  i looked at the face of the crucifix and though i was no friend to images and despised that imitative and grimacing art of which it was a rude example some sense of what the thing implied was carried home to my intelligence the face looked down upon me with a painful and deadly contraction but the rays of a glory encircled it and reminded me that the sacrifice was voluntary it stood there crowning the rock as it still stands on so many highway sides vainly preaching to passersby an emblem of sad and noble truths that pleasure is not an end but an accident that pain is the choice of the magnanimous that it is best to suffer all things and do well i turned and went down the mountain in silence and when i looked back for the last time before the wood closed about my path i saw olalla still leaning on the crucifix     heathercat  a fragment     heathercat     chapter i  traquairs of montroymont   the period of this tale is in the heat of the killingtime the scene laid for the most part in solitary hills and morasses haunted only by the socalled mountain wanderers the dragoons that came in chase of them the women that wept on their dead bodies and the wild birds of the moorland that have cried there since the beginning it is a land of many rainclouds a land of much mute history written there in prehistoric symbols strange green raths are to be seen commonly in the country above all by the kirkyards barrows of the dead standing stones beside these the faint durable footprints and handmarks of the roman and an antiquity older perhaps than any and still living and activea complete celtic nomenclature and a scarcemingled celtic population these rugged and grey hills were once included in the boundaries of the caledonian forest merlin sat here below his appletree and lamented gwendolen here spoke with kentigern here fell into his enchanted trance and the legend of his slumber seems to body forth the story of that celtic race deprived for so many centuries of their authentic speech surviving with their ancestral inheritance of melancholy perversity and patient unfortunate courage  the traquairs of montroymont mons romanus as the erudite expound it had long held their seat about the headwaters of the dule and in the back parts of the moorland parish of balweary for two hundred years they had enjoyed in these upland quarters a certain decency almost to be named distinction of repute and the annals of their house or what is remembered of them were obscure and bloody ninian traquair was cruallie slochtered by the crozers at the kirkdoor of balweary anno 1482 francis killed simon ruthven of drumshoreland anno 1540 bought letters of slayers at the widow and heir and by a barbarous form of compounding married without tocher simons daughter grizzel which is the way the traquairs and ruthvens came first to an intermarriage about the last traquair and ruthven marriage it is the business of this book among many other things to tell  the traquairs were always strong for the covenant for the king also but the covenant first and it began to be ill days for montroymont when the bishops came in and the dragoons at the heels of them ninian then laird was an anxious husband of himself and the property as the times required and it may be said of him that he lost both he was heavily suspected of the pentland hills rebellion when it came the length of bothwell brig he stood his trial before the secret council and was convicted of talking with some insurgents by the wayside the subject of the conversation not very clearly appearing and of the reset and maintenance of one gale a gardener man who seen before bothwell with a musket and afterwards for a continuance of months delved the garden at montroymont matters went very ill with ninian at the council some of the lords were clear for treason and even the boot was talked of but he was spared that torture and at last having pretty good friendship among great men he came off with a fine of seven thousand marks that caused the estate to groan in this case as in so many others it was the wife that made the trouble she was a great keeper of conventicles would ride ten miles to one and when she was fined rejoiced greatly to suffer for the kirk but it was rather her husband that suffered she had their only son francis baptized privately by the hands of mr kidd there was that much the more to pay for she could neither be driven nor wiled into the parish kirk as for taking the sacrament at the hands of any episcopalian curate and tenfold more at those of curate haddo there was nothing further from her purposes and montroymont had to put his hand in his pocket month by month and year by year once indeed the little lady was cast in prison and the laird worthy heavy uninterested man had to ride up and take her place from which he was not discharged under nine months and a sharp fine it scarce seemed she had any gratitude to him she came out of gaol herself and plunged immediately deeper in conventicles resetting recusants and all her old expensive folly only with greater vigour and openness because montroymont was safe in the tolbooth and she had no witness to consider when he was liberated and came back with his fingers singed in december 1680 and late in the black night my lady was from home he came into the house at his alighting with a ridingrod yet in his hand and on the servantmaid telling him caught her by the scruff of the neck beat her violently flung her down in the passageway and went upstairs to his bed fasting and without a light it was three in the morning when my lady returned from that conventicle and hearing of the assault because the maid had sat up for her weeping went to their common chamber with a lantern in hand and stamping with her shoes so as to wake the dead it was supposed by those that heard her from a design to have it out with the good man at once the houseservants gathered on the stair because it was a main interest with them to know which of these two was the better horse and for the space of two hours they were heard to go at the matter hammer and tongs montroymont alleged he was at the end of possibilities it was no longer within his power to pay the annual rents she had served him basely by keeping conventicles while he lay in prison for her sake his friends were weary and there was nothing else before him but the entire loss of the family lands and to begin life again by the wayside as a common beggar she took him up very sharp and high called upon him if he were a christian and which he most considered the loss of a few dirty miry glebes or of his soul presently he was heard to weep and my ladys voice to go on continually like a running burn only the words indistinguishable whereupon it was supposed a victory for her ladyship and the domestics took themselves to bed the next day traquair appeared like a man who had gone under the harrows and his lady wife thenceforward continued in her old course without the least deflection  thenceforward ninian went on his way without complaint and suffered his wife to go on hers without remonstrance he still minded his estate of which it might be said he took daily a fresh farewell and counted it already lost looking ruefully on the acres and the graves of his fathers on the moorlands where the wildfowl consorted the low gurgling pool of the trout and the high windy place of the calling curlewsthings that were yet his for the day and would be anothers tomorrow coming back again and sitting ciphering till the dusk at his approaching ruin which no device of arithmetic could postpone beyond a year or two he was essentially the simple ancient man the farmer and landholder he would have been content to watch the seasons come and go and his cattle increase until the limit of age he would have been content at any time to die if he could have left the estates undiminished to an heirmale of his ancestors that duty standing first in his instinctive calendar and now he saw everywhere the image of the new proprietor come to meet him and go sowing and reaping or fowling for his pleasure on the red moors or eating the very gooseberries in the place garden and saw always on the other hand the figure of francis go forth a beggar into the broad world  it was in vain the poor gentleman sought to moderate took every test and took advantage of every indulgence went and drank with the dragoons in balweary attended the communion and came regularly to the church to curate haddo with his son beside him the mad raging presbyterian zealot of a wife at home made all of no avail and indeed the house must have fallen years before if it had not been for the secret indulgence of the curate who had a great sympathy with the laird and winked hard at the doings in montroymont this curate was a man very ill reputed in the countryside and indeed in all scotland infamous haddo is shields expression but patrick walker is more copious curate hall haddo says he sub voce peden or hell haddo as he was more justly to be called a pokeful of old condemned errors and the filthy vile lusts of the flesh a published whoremonger a common gross drunkard continually and godlessly scraping and skirling on a fiddle continually breathing flames against the remnant of israel but the lord put an end to his piping and all these offences were composed into one bloody grave no doubt this was written to excuse his slaughter and i have never heard it claimed for walker that he was either a just witness or an indulgent judge at least in a merely human character haddo comes off not wholly amiss in the matter of these traquairs not that he showed any graces of the christian but had a sort of pagan decency which might almost tempt one to be concerned about his sudden violent and unprepared fate     chapter ii  francie   francie was eleven years old shy secret and rather childish of his age though not backward in schooling which had been pushed on far by a private governor one mbrair a forfeited minister harboured in that capacity at montroymont the boy already much employed in secret by his mother was the most apt hand conceivable to run upon a message to carry food to lurking fugitives or to stand sentry on the skyline above a conventicle it seemed no place on the moorlands was so naked but what he would find cover there and as he knew every hag boulder and heatherbush in a circuit of seven miles about montroymont there was scarce any spot but what he could leave or approach it unseen this dexterity had won him a reputation in that part of the country and among the many children employed in these dangerous affairs he passed under the byname of heathercat  how much his father knew of this employment might be doubted he took much forethought for the boys future seeing he was like to be left so poorly and would sometimes assist at his lessons sighing heavily yawning deep and now and again patting francie on the shoulder if he seemed to be doing ill by way of a private kind encouragement but a great part of the day was passed in aimless wanderings with his eyes sealed or in his cabinet sitting bemused over the particulars of the coming bankruptcy and the boy would be absent a dozen times for once that his father would observe it  on 2nd of july 1682 the boy had an errand from his mother which must be kept private from all the father included in the first of them crossing the braes he hears the clatter of a horses shoes and claps down incontinent in a hag by the wayside and presently he spied his father come riding from one direction and curate haddo walking from another and montroymont leaning down from the saddle and haddo getting on his toes for he was a little ruddy baldpated man more like a dwarf they greeted kindly and came to a halt within two fathoms of the child  montroymont the curate said the deils in t but ill have to denunciate your leddy again  deils in t indeed says the laird  man can ye no induce her to come to the kirk pursues haddo or to a communion at the least of it for the conventicles let be and the same for yon solemn fule mbrair i can blink at them but shes got to come to the kirk montroymont  dinna speak of it says the laird i can do nothing with her  couldnt ye try the stick to her it works wonders whiles suggested haddo no im wae to hear it and i suppose ye ken where youre going  fine said montroymont fine do i ken where bankrupcy and the bass rock  praise to my bones that i never married cried the curate well its a grievous thing to me to see an auld house dung down that was here before flodden field but naebody can say it was with my wish  no more they can haddo says the laird a good friend yeve been to me first and last i can give you that character with a clear conscience  whereupon they separated and montroymont rode briskly down into the dule valley but of the curate francis was not to be quit so easily he went on with his little brisk steps to the corner of a dyke and stopped and whistled and waved upon a lassie that was herding cattle there this janet mclour was a big lass being taller than the curate and what made her look the more so she was kilted very high it seemed for a while she would not come and francie heard her calling haddo a daft auld fule and saw her running and dodging him among the whins and hags till he was fairly blown but at the last he gets a bottle from his plaidneuk and holds it up to her whereupon she came at once into a composition and the pair sat drinking of the bottle and daffing and laughing together on a mound of heather the boy had scarce heard of these vanities or he might have been minded of a nymph and satyr if anybody could have taken longleggit janet for a nymph but they seemed to be huge friends he thought and was the more surprised when the curate had taken his leave to see the lassie fling stones after him with screeches of laughter and haddo turn about and caper and shake his staff at her and laugh louder than herself a wonderful merry pair they seemed and when francie had crawled out of the hag he had a great deal to consider in his mind it was possible they were all fallen in error about mr haddo he reflectedhaving seen him so tender with montroymont and so kind and playful with the lass janet and he had a temptation to go out of his road and question her herself upon the matter but he had a strong spirit of duty on him and plodded on instead over the braes till he came near the house of cairngorm there in a hollow place by the burnside that was shaded by some birks he was aware of a barefoot boy perhaps a matter of three years older than himself the two approached with the precautions of a pair of strange dogs looking at each other queerly  its ill weather on the hills said the stranger giving the watchword  for a season said francie but the lord will appear  richt said the barefoot boy whare ye frae  the leddy montroymont says francie  hae then says the stranger and handed him a folded paper and they stood and looked at each other again its unco het said the boy  dooms het says francie  what do they ca ye says the other  francie says he im young montroymont they ca me heathercat  im jock crozer said the boy and there was another pause while each rolled a stone under his foot  cast your jaiket and ill fecht ye for a bawbee cried the elder boy with sudden violence and dramatically throwing back his jacket  na i have nae time the now said francie with a sharp thrill of alarm because crozer was much the heavier boy  yere feared heathercat indeed said crozer for among this infantile army of spies and messengers the fame of crozer had gone forth and was resented by his rivals and with that they separated  on his way home francie was a good deal occupied with the recollection of this untoward incident the challenge had been fairly offered and basely refused the tale would be carried all over the country and the lustre of the name of heathercat be dimmed but the scene between curate haddo and janet mclour had also given him much to think of and he was still puzzling over the case of the curate and why such ill words were said of him and why if he were so merryspirited he should yet preach so dry when coming over a knowe whom should he see but janet sitting with her back to him minding her cattle he was always a great child for secret stealthy ways having been employed by his mother on errands when the same was necessary and he came behind the lass without her hearing  jennet says he  keep me cries janet springing up o its you maister francie save us what a fricht ye gied me  ay its me said francie ive been thinking jennet i saw you and the curate a while back  brat cried janet and coloured up crimson and the one moment made as if she would have stricken him with a ragged stick she had to chase her bestial with and the next was begging and praying that he would mention it to none it was naebodys business whatever she said it would just start a clash in the country and there would be nothing left for her but to drown herself in dule water  why says francie  the girl looked at him and grew scarlet again  and it isna that anyway continued francie it was just that he seemed so good to yelike our father in heaven i thought and i thought that mebbe perhaps we had all been wrong about him from the first but ill have to tell mr mbrair im under a kind of a bargain to him to tell him all  tell it to the divil if ye like for me cried the lass ive naething to be ashamed of tell mbrair to mind his ain affairs she cried again theyll be hot eneugh for him if haddie likes and so strode off shoving her beasts before her and ever and again looking back and crying angry words to the boy where he stood mystified  by the time he had got home his mind was made up that he would say nothing to his mother my lady montroymont was in the keepingroom reading a godly book she was a wonderful frail little wife to make so much noise in the world and be able to steer about that patient sheep her husband her eyes were like sloes the fingers of her hands were like tobaccopipe shanks her mouth shut tight like a trap and even when she was the most serious and still more when she was angry there hung about her face the terrifying semblance of a smile  have ye gotten the billet francie said she and when he had handed it over and she had read and burned it did you see anybody she asked  i saw the laird said francie  he didna see you though asked his mother  deil a fear from francie  francie she cried whats that i hear an aith the lord forgive me have i broughten forth a brand for the burning a fagot for hellfire  im very sorry maam said francie i humbly beg the lords pardon and yours for my wickedness  hm grunted the lady did ye see nobody else  no maam said francie with the face of an angel except jock crozer that gied me the billet  jock crozer cried the lady ill crozer them crozers indeed what next are we to repose the lives of a suffering remnant in crozers the whole clan of them wants hanging and if i had my way of it they wouldna want it long are you aware sir that these crozers killed your forebear at the kirkdoor  you see he was bigger n me said francie  jock crozer continued the lady thatll be clements son the biggest thief and reiver in the countryside to trust a note to him but ill give the benefit of my opinions to lady whitecross when we two forgather let her look to herself i have no patience with halfhearted carlines that complies on the lords day morning with the kirk and comes taigling the same night to the conventicle the one or the other is what i say hell or heavenhaddies abominations or the pure word of god dreeping from the lips of mr arnot    like honey from the honeycomb       that dreepeth sweeter far  my lady was now fairly launched and that upon two congenial subjects the deficiencies of the lady whitecross and the turpitudes of the whole crozer racewhich indeed had never been conspicuous for respectability she pursued the pair of them for twenty minutes on the clock with wonderful animation and detail something of the pulpit manner and the spirit of one possessed o hellish compliance she exclaimed i would not suffer a complier to break bread with christian folk of all the sins of this day there is not one so goddefying so christhumiliating as damnable compliance the boy standing before her meanwhile and brokenly pursuing other thoughts mainly of haddo and janet and jock crozer stripping off his jacket and yet with all his distraction it might be argued that he heard too much his father and himself being compliersthat is to say attending the church of the parish as the law required  presently the ladys passion beginning to decline or her flux of ill words to be exhausted she dismissed her audience francie bowed low left the room closed the door behind him and then turned him about in the passageway and with a low voice but a prodigious deal of sentiment repeated the name of the evil one twenty times over to the end of which for the greater efficacy he tacked on damnable and hellish fas est ab hoste doceridisrespect is made more pungent by quotation and there is no doubt but he felt relieved and went upstairs into his tutors chamber with a quiet mind mbrair sat by the cheek of the peatfire and shivered for he had a quartan ague and this was his day the great nightcap and plaid the dark unshaven cheeks of the man and the white thin hands that held the plaid about his chittering body made a sorrowful picture but francie knew and loved him came straight in nestled close to the refugee and told his story mbrair had been at the college with haddo the presbytery had licensed both on the same day and at this tale told with so much innocency by the boy the heart of the tutor was commoved  woe upon him woe upon that man he cried o the unfaithful shepherd o the hireling and apostate minister make my matters hot for me quo she the shameless limmer and true it is that he could repose me in that nasty stinking hole the canongate tolbooth from which your mother drew me outthe lord reward her for itor to that cold unbieldy marine place of the bass rock which with my delicate kist would be fair ruin to me but i will be valiant in my masters service i have a duty here a duty to my god to myself and to haddo in his strength i will perform it  then he straitly discharged francie to repeat the tale and bade him in the future to avert his very eyes from the doings of the curate you must go to his place of idolatry look upon him there says he but nowhere else avert your eyes close your ears pass him by like a three days corp he is like that damnable monster basiliscus which defilesyea poisonsby the sightall which was hardly claratory to the boys mind  presently montroymont came home and called up the stairs to francie traquair was a good shot and swordsman and it was his pleasure to walk with his son over the braes of the moorfowl or to teach him arms in the back court when they made a mighty comely pair the child being so lean and light and active and the laird himself a man of a manly pretty stature his hair the periwig being laid aside showing already white with many anxieties and his face of an even flaccid red but this day francies heart was not in the fencing  sir says he suddenly lowering his point will ye tell me a thing if i was to ask it  ask away says the father  well its this said francie why do you and me comply if its so wicked  ay ye have the cant of it too cried montroymont but ill tell ye for all that its to try and see if we can keep the rigging on this house francie if she had her way we would be beggarfolk and hold our hands out by the wayside when ye hear herwhen ye hear folk he corrected himself briskly call me a coward and one that betrayed the lord and i kenna what else just mind it was to keep a bed to ye to sleep in and a bite for ye to eaton guard he cried and the lesson proceeded again till they were called to supper  theres another thing yet said francie stopping his father theres another thing that i am not sure that i am very caring for sheshe sends me errands  obey her then as is your bounden duty said traquair  ay but wait till i tell ye says the boy if i was to see you i was to hide  montroymont sighed well and thats good of her too said he the less that i ken of thir doings the better for me and the best thing you can do is just to obey her and see and be a good son to her the same as ye are to me francie  at the tenderness of this expression the heart of francie swelled within his bosom and his remorse was poured out faither he cried i said deil today manys the time i said it and damnable too and hellish i ken theyre all right theyre beeblical but i didna say them beeblically i said them for sweir wordsthats the truth of it  hout ye silly bairn said the father dinna do it nae mair and come in by to your supper and he took the boy and drew him close to him a moment as they went through the door with something very fond and secret like a caress between a pair of lovers  the next day mbrair was abroad in the afternoon and had a long advising with janet on the braes where she herded cattle what passed was never wholly known but the lass wept bitterly and fell on her knees to him among the whins the same night as soon as it was dark he took the road again for balweary in the kirkton where the dragoons quartered he saw many lights and heard the noise of a ranting song and people laughing grossly which was highly offensive to his mind he gave it the wider berth keeping among fields and came down at last by the waterside where the manse stands solitary between the river and the road he tapped at the back door and the old woman called upon him to come in and guided him through the house to the study as they still called it though there was little enough study there in haddos days and more songbooks than theology  heres yin to speak wi ye mr haddie cries the old wife  and mbrair opening the door and entering found the little round red man seated in one chair and his feet upon another a clear fire and a tallow dip lighted him barely he was taking tobacco in a pipe and smiling to himself and a brandybottle and glass and his fiddle and bow were beside him on the table  hech patey mbrair is this you said he a trifle tipsily step in by man and have a drop brandy for the stomachs sake even the deil can quote scriptureeh patey  i will neither eat nor drink with you replied mbrair i am come upon my masters errand woe be upon me if i should anyways mince the same hall haddo i summon you to quit this kirk which you encumber  muckle obleeged says haddo winking  you and me have been to kirk and market together pursued mbrair we have had blessed seasons in the kirk we have sat in the same teachingrooms and read in the same book and i know you still retain for me some carnal kindness it would be my shame if i denied it i live here at your mercy and by your favour and glory to acknowledge it you have pity on my wretched body which is but grass and must soon be trodden under but o haddo how much greater is the yearning with which i yearn after and pity your immortal soul come now let us reason together i drop all points of controversy weighty though these be i take your defaced and damnified kirk on your own terms and i ask you are you a worthy minister the communion season approaches how can you pronounce thir solemn words the elders will now bring forrit the elements and not quail a parishioner may be summoned tonight you may have to rise from your miserable orgies and i ask you haddo what does your conscience tell you are you fit are you fit to smooth the pillow of a parting christian and if the summons should be for yourself how then  haddo was startled out of all composure and the better part of his temper whats this of it he cried im no waur than my neebours i never set up to be speeritual i never did im a plain canty creature godliness is cheerfulness says i give me my fiddle and a dram and i wouldna hairm a flee  and i repeat my question said mbrair are you fitfit for this great charge fit to carry and save souls  fit blethers as fit s yoursel cried haddo  are you so great a selfdeceiver said mbrair wretched man trampler upon gods covenants crucifier of your lord afresh i will ding you to the earth with one word how about the young woman janet mclour  weel what about her what do i ken cries haddo mbrair ye daft auld wife i tell ye as true s truth i never meddled her it was just daffing i tell ye daffing and nae mair a piece of fun like im no denying but what im fond of fun sma blame to me but for onything sarioushout man it might come to a deposeetion ill sweir it to ye wheres a bible till you hear me sweir  there is nae bible in your study said mbrair severely  and haddo after a few distracted turns was constrained to accept the fact  weel and suppose there isna he cried stamping what mair can ye say of us but just that im fond of my joke and so s she i declare to god by what i ken she might be the virgin maryif she would just keep clear of the dragoons but me na deil haet o me  she is penitent at least said mbrair  do you mean to actually up and tell me to my face that she accused me cried the curate  i canna just say that replied mbrair but i rebuked her in the name of god and she repented before me on her bended knees  weel i daursay shes been ower far wi the dragoons said haddo i never denied that i ken naething by it  man you but show your nakedness the more plainly said mbrair poor blind besotted creatureand i see you stoytering on the brink of dissolution your light out and your hours numbered awake man he shouted with a formidable voice awake or it be ower late  be damned if i stand this exclaimed haddo casting his tobaccopipe violently on the table where it was smashed in pieces out of my house with ye or ill call for the dragoons  the speerit of the lord is upon me said mbrair with solemn ecstasy i sist you to compear before the great white throne and i warn you the summons shall be bloody and sudden  and at this with more agility than could have been expected he got clear of the room and slammed the door behind him in the face of the pursuing curate the next lords day the curate was ill and the kirk closed but for all his ill words mr mbrair abode unmolested in the house of montroymont     chapter iii  the hillend of drumlowe   this was a bit of a steep broken hill that overlooked upon the west a moorish valley full of inkblack pools these presently drained into a burn that made off with little noise and no celerity of pace about the corner of the hill on the far side the ground swelled into a bare heath black with junipers and spotted with the presence of the standing stones for which the place was famous they were many in that part shapeless white with lichenyou would have said with age and had made their abode there for untold centuries since first the heathens shouted for their installation the ancients had hallowed them to some ill religion and their neighbourhood had long been avoided by the prudent before the fall of day but of late on the upspringing of new requirements these lonely stones on the moor had again become a place of assembly a watchful picket on the hillend commanded all the northern and eastern approaches and such was the disposition of the ground that by certain cunningly posted sentries the west also could be made secure against surprise there was no place in the country where a conventicle could meet with more quiet of mind or a more certain retreat open in the case of interference from the dragoons the minister spoke from a knowe close to the edge of the ring and poured out the words god gave him on the very threshold of the devils of yore when they pitched a tent which was often in wet weather upon a communion occasion it was rigged over the huge isolated pillar that had the name of aneserrand none knew why and the congregation sat partly clustered on the slope below and partly among the idolatrous monoliths and on the turfy soil of the ring itself in truth the situation was well qualified to give a zest to christian doctrines had there been any wanted but these congregations assembled under conditions at once so formidable and romantic as made a zealot of the most cold they were the last of the faithful god who had averted his face from all other countries of the world still leaned from heaven to observe with swelling sympathy the doings of his moorland remnant christ was by them with his eternal wounds with dropping tears the holy ghost never perfectly realised nor firmly adopted by protestant imaginations was dimly supposed to be in the heart of each and on the lips of the minister and over against them was the army of the hierarchies from the men charles and james stuart on to king lewie and the emperor and the scarlet pope and the muckle black devil himself peering out the red mouth of hell in an ecstasy of hate and hope one pull more he seemed to cry one pull more and its done theres only clydesdale and the stewartry and the three bailiaries of ayr left for god and with such an august assistance of powers and principalities looking on at the last conflict of good and evil it was scarce possible to spare a thought to those old infirm debile ab agendo devils whose holy place they were now violating  there might have been three hundred to four hundred present at least there were three hundred horses tethered for the most part in the ring though some of the hearers on the outskirts of the crowd stood with their bridles in their hand ready to mount at the first signal the circle of faces was strangely characteristic long serious strongly marked the tackle standing out in the lean brown cheeks the mouth set and the eyes shining with a fierce enthusiasm the shepherd the labouring man and the rarer laird stood there in their broad blue bonnets or laced hats and presenting an essential identity of type from time to time a longdrawn groan of adhesion rose in this audience and was propagated like a wave to the outskirts and died away among the keepers of the horses it had a name it was called a holy groan  a squall came up a great volley of flying mist went out before it and whelmed the scene the wind stormed with a sudden fierceness that carried away the ministers voice and twitched his tails and made him stagger and turned the congregation for a moment into a mere pother of blowing plaidends and prancing horses and the rain followed and was dashed straight into their faces men and women panted aloud in the shock of that violent showerbath the teeth were bared along all the line in an involuntary grimace plaids mantles and ridingcoats were proved vain and the worshippers felt the water stream on their naked flesh the minister reinforcing his great and shrill voice continued to contend against and triumph over the rising of the squall and the dashing of the rain  in that day ye may go thirty mile and not hear a crawing cock he said and fifty mile and not get a light to your pipe and an hundred mile and not see a smoking house for therell be naething in all scotland but deid mens banes and blackness and the living anger of the lord o where to find a bieldo sirs where to find a bield from the wind of the lords anger do ye call this a wind bethankit sirs this is but a temporary dispensation this is but a puff of wind this is but a spit of rain and by with it already theres a blue bow in the west and the sun will take the crown of the causeway again and your thingsll be dried upon ye and your flesh will be warm upon your bones but o sirs sirs for the day of the lords anger  his rhetoric was set forth with an earpiercing elocution and a voice that sometimes crashed like cannon such as it was it was the gift of all hillpreachers to a singular degree of likeness or identity their images scarce ranged beyond the red horizon of the moor and the rainy hilltop the shepherd and his sheep a fowlingpiece a spade a pipe a dunghill a crowing cock the shining and the withdrawal of the sun an occasional pathos of simple humanity and frequent patches of big biblical words relieved the homely tissue it was a poetry apart bleak austere but genuine and redolent of the soil  a little before the coming of the squall there was a different scene enacting at the outposts for the most part the sentinels were faithful to their important duty the hillend of drumlowe was known to be a safe meetingplace and the outpickets on this particular day had been somewhat lax from the beginning and grew laxer during the inordinate length of the discourse francie lay there in his appointed hidinghole looking abroad between two whinbushes his view was across the course of the burn then over a piece of plain moorland to a gap between two hills nothing moved but grouse and some cattle who slowly traversed his field of view heading northward he heard the psalms and sang words of his own to the savage and melancholy music for he had his own design in hand and terror and cowardice prevailed in his bosom alternately like the hot and the cold fit of an ague courage was uppermost during the singing which he accompanied through all its length with this impromptu strain    and i will ding jock crozer down     no later than the day  presently the voice of the preacher came to him in wafts at the winds will as by the opening and shutting of a door wild spasms of screaming as of some undiscerned gigantic hillbird stirred with inordinate passion succeeded to intervals of silence and francie heard them with a critical ear ay he thought at last hell do he has the bit in his mou fairly  he had observed that his friend or rather his enemy jock crozer had been established at a very critical part of the line of outposts namely where the burn issues by an abrupt gorge from the semicircle of high moors if anything was calculated to nerve him to battle it was this the post was important next to the hillend itself it might be called the key to the position and it was where the cover was bad and in which it was most natural to place a child it should have been heathercats why had it been given to crozer an exquisite fear of what should be the answer passed through his marrow every time he faced the question was it possible that crozer could have boasted that there were rumours abroad to hisheathercatsdiscredit that his honour was publicly sullied all the world went dark about him at the thought he sank without a struggle into the midnight pool of despair and every time he so sank he brought back with himnot drowned heroism indeed but halfdrowned courage by the locks his heart beat very slowly as he deserted his station and began to crawl towards that of crozer something pulled him back and it was not the sense of duty but a remembrance of crozers build and hateful readiness of fist duty as he conceived it pointed him forward on the rueful path that he was travelling duty bade him redeem his name if he were able at the risk of broken bones and his bones and every tooth in his head ached by anticipation an awful subsidiary fear whispered him that if he were hurt he should disgrace himself by weeping he consoled himself boylike with the consideration that he was not yet committed he could easily steal over unseen to crozers post and he had a continuous private idea that he would very probably steal back again his course took him so near the minister that he could hear some of his words what news minister of claverse hes going round like a roaring rampaging lion     the great north road  a fragment     the great north road     chapter i  nance at the green dragon   nance holdaway was on her knees before the fire blowing the green wood that voluminously smoked upon the dogs and only now and then shot forth a smothered flame her knees already ached and her eyes smarted for she had been some while at this ungrateful task but her mind was gone far away to meet the coming stranger now she met him in the wood now at the castle gate now in the kitchen by candlelight each fresh presentment eclipsed the one before a form so elegant manners so sedate a countenance so brave and comely a voice so winning and resolutesure such a man was never seen the thickcoming fancies poured and brightened in her head like the smoke and flames upon the hearth  presently the heavy foot of her uncle jonathan was heard upon the stair and as he entered the room she bent the closer to her work he glanced at the green fagots with a sneer and looked askance at the bed and the white sheets at the strip of carpet laid like an island on the great expanse of the stone floor and at the broken glazing of the casement clumsily repaired with paper  leave that fire abe he cried what have i toiled all my life to turn innkeeper at the hind end leave it abe i say  la uncle it doesnt burn a bit it only smokes said nance looking up from her position  you are come of decent people of both sides returned the old man who are you to blow the coals for any robinrunagate get up get on your hood make yourself useful and be off to the green dragon  i thought you was to go yourself nance faltered  so did i quoth jonathan but it appears i was mistook  the very excess of her eagerness alarmed her and she began to hang back i think i would rather not dear uncle she said night is at hand and i think dear i would rather not  now you look here replied jonathan i have my lords orders have i not little he gives me but its all my livelihood and do you fancy if i disobey my lord im likely to turn round for a lass like you no ive that hellfire of pain in my old knee i wouldnt walk a mile not for king george upon his bended knees and he walked to the window and looked down the steep scarp to where the river foamed in the bottom of the dell  nance stayed for no more bidding in her own room by the glimmer of the twilight she washed her hands and pulled on her sunday mittens adjusted her black hood and tied a dozen times its cherry ribbons and in less than ten minutes with a fluttering heart and excellently bright eyes she passed forth under the arch and over the bridge into the thickening shadows of the groves a wellmarked wheeltrack conducted her the wood which upon both sides of the river dell was a mere scrambling thicket of hazel hawthorn and holly boasted on the level of more considerable timber beeches came to a good growth with here and there an oak and the track now passed under a high arcade of branches and now ran under the open sky in glades as the girl proceeded these glades became more frequent the trees began again to decline in size and the wood to degenerate into furzy coverts last of all there was a fringe of elders and beyond that the track came forth upon an open rolling moorland dotted with windbowed and scanty bushes and all golden brown with the winter like a grouse right over against the girl the last red embers of the sunset burned under horizontal clouds the night fell clear and still and frosty and the track in low and marshy passages began to crackle under foot with ice  some half a mile beyond the borders of the wood the lights of the green dragon hove in sight and running close beside them very faint in the dying dusk the pale ribbon of the great north road it was the back of the posthouse that was presented to nance holdaway and as she continued to draw near and the night to fall more completely she became aware of an unusual brightness and bustle a postchaise stood in the yard its lamps already lighted light shone hospitably in the windows and from the open door moving lights and shadows testified to the activity of servants bearing lanterns the clank of pails the stamping of hoofs on the firm causeway the jingle of harness and last of all the energetic hissing of a groom began to fall upon her ear by the stir you would have thought the mail was at the door but it was still too early in the night the down mail was not due at the green dragon for hard upon an hour the up mail from scotland not before two in the black morning  nance entered the yard somewhat dazzled sam the tall ostler was polishing a curbchain with sand the lantern at his feet letting up spouts of candlelight through the holes with which its conical roof was peppered  hey miss said he jocularly you wont look at me any more now you have gentry at the castle  her cheeks burned with anger  thats my lords chay the man continued nodding at the chaise lord windermoors came all in a flusterdinner bowl of punch and put the horses to for all the world like a runaway match my dearbar the bride he brought mr archer in the chay with him  is that holdaway cried the landlord from the lighted entry where he stood shading his eyes  only me sir answered nance  o you miss nance he said well come in quick my pretty my lord is waiting for your uncle  and he ushered nance into a room cased with yellow wainscot and lighted by tall candles where two gentlemen sat at a table finishing a bowl of punch one of these was stout elderly and irascible with a face like a full moon well dyed with liquor thick tremulous lips a short purple hand in which he brandished a long pipe and an abrupt and gobbling utterance this was my lord windermoor in his companion nance beheld a younger man tall quiet grave demurely dressed and wearing his own hair her glance but lighted on him and she flushed for in that second she made sure that she had twice betrayed herselfbetrayed by the involuntary flash of her black eyes her secret impatience to behold this new companion and what was far worse betrayed her disappointment in the realisation of her dreams he meanwhile as if unconscious continued to regard her with unmoved decorum  o a man of wood thought nance  whatwhat said his lordship who is this  if you please my lord i am holdaways niece replied nance with a curtsey  should have been here himself observed his lordship well you tell holdaway that im aground not a stivernot a stiver im running from the beaglesgoing abroad tell holdaway and he need look for no more wages glad of em myself if i could get em he can live in the castle if he likes or go to the devil o and here is mr archer and i recommend him to take him ina friend of mineand mr archer will pay as i wrote and i regard that in the light of a precious good thing for holdaway let me tell you and a setoff against the wages  but o my lord cried nance we live upon the wages and what are we to do without  what am i to dowhat am i to do replied lord windermoor with some exasperation i have no wages and there is mr archer and if holdaway doesnt like it he can go to the devil and you with himand you with him  and yet my lord said mr archer these good people will have as keen a sense of loss as you or i keener perhaps since they have done nothing to deserve it  deserve it cried the peer what what if a rascally highwayman comes up to me with a confounded pistol do you say that ive deserved it how often am i to tell you sir that i was cheatedthat i was cheated  you are happy in the belief returned mr archer gravely  archer you would be the death of me exclaimed his lordship you know youre drunk you know it sir and yet you cant get up a spark of animation  i have drunk fair my lord replied the younger man but i own i am conscious of no exhilaration  if you had as black a lookout as me sir cried the peer you would be very glad of a little innocent exhilaration let me tell you i am glad of itglad of it and i only wish i was drunker for let me tell you its a cruel hard thing upon a man of my time of life and my position to be brought down to beggary because the world is full of thieves and rascalsthieves and rascals what for all i know you may be a thief and a rascal yourself and i would fight you for a pinch of snuffa pinch of snuff exclaimed his lordship  here mr archer turned to nance holdaway with a pleasant smile so full of sweetness kindness and composure that at one bound her dreams returned to her my good miss holdaway said he if you are willing to show me the road i am even eager to be gone as for his lordship and myself compose yourself there is no fear this is his lordships way  what what cried his lordship my way ish no such a thing my way  come my lord cried archer you and i very thoroughly understand each other and let me suggest it is time that both of us were gone the mail will soon be due here then my lord i take my leave of you with the most earnest assurance of my gratitude for the past and a sincere offer of any services i may be able to render in the future  archer exclaimed lord windermoor i love you like a son le s have another bowl  my lord for both our sakes you will excuse me replied mr archer we both require caution we must both for some while at least avoid the chance of a pursuit  archer quoth his lordship this is a rank ingratishood what im to go firing away in the dark in the cold pochaise and not so much as a game of écarté possible unless i stop and play with the postillion the postillion and the whole country swarming with thieves and rascals and highwaymen  i beg your lordships pardon put in the landlord who now appeared in the doorway to announce the chaise but this part of the north road is known for safety there has not been a robbery to call a robbery this five years time further south of course its nearer london and another story he added  well then if thats so concluded my lord le s have t other bowl and a pack of cards  my lord you forget said archer i might still gain but it is hardly possible for me to lose  think im a sharper inquired the peer genlemans paroles all i ask  but mr archer was proof against these blandishments and said farewell gravely enough to lord windermoor shaking his hand and at the same time bowing very low you will never know says he the service you have done me and with that and before my lord had finally taken up his meaning he had slipped about the table touched nance lightly but imperiously on the arm and left the room in face of the outbreak of his lordships lamentations she made haste to follow the truant     chapter ii  in which mr archer is installed   the chaise had been driven round to the front door the courtyard lay all deserted and only lit by a lantern set upon a windowsill through this nance rapidly led the way and began to ascend the swellings of the moor with a heart that somewhat fluttered in her bosom she was not afraid but in the course of these last passages with lord windermoor mr archer had ascended to that pedestal on which her fancy waited to instal him the reality she felt excelled her dreams and this cold night walk was the first romantic incident in her experience  it was the rule in these days to see gentlemen unsteady after dinner yet nance was both surprised and amused when her companion who had spoken so soberly began to stumble and waver by her side with the most airy divagations sometimes he would get so close to her that she must edge away and at others lurch clear out of the track and plough among deep heather his courtesy and gravity meanwhile remained unaltered he asked her how far they had to go whether the way lay all upon the moorland and when he learned they had to pass a wood expressed his pleasure for said he i am passionately fond of trees trees and fair lawns if you consider of it rightly are the ornaments of nature as palaces and fine approaches and here he stumbled into a patch of slough and nearly fell the girl had hard work not to laugh but at heart she was lost in admiration for one who talked so elegantly  they had got to about a quarter of a mile from the  green dragon and were near the summit of the rise when a sudden rush of wheels arrested them turning and looking back they saw the posthouse now much declined in brightness and speeding away northward the two tremulous bright dots of my lord windermoors chaiselamps mr archer followed these yellow and unsteady stars until they dwindled into points and disappeared  there goes my only friend he said death has cut off those that loved me and change of fortune estranged my flatterers and but for you poor bankrupt my life is as lonely as this moor  the tone of his voice affected both of them they stood there on the side of the moor and became thrillingly conscious of the void waste of the night without a feature for the eye and except for the fainting whisper of the carriagewheels without a murmur for the ear and instantly like a mockery there broke out very far away but clear and jolly the note of the mailguards horn over the hills was his air it rose to the two watchers on the moor with the most cheerful sentiment of human company and travel and at the same time in and around the green dragon it woke up a great bustle of lights running to and fro and clattering hoofs presently after out of the darkness to southward the mail grew near with a growing rumble its lamps were very large and bright and threw their radiance forward in overlapping cones the four cantering horses swarmed and steamed the body of the coach followed like a great shadow and this lit picture slid with a sort of ineffectual swiftness over the black field of night and was eclipsed by the buildings of the green dragon  mr archer turned abruptly and resumed his former walk only that he was now more steady kept better alongside his young conductor and had fallen into a silence broken by sighs nance waxed very pitiful over his fate contrasting an imaginary past of courts and great society and perhaps the king himself with the tumbledown ruin in a wood to which she was now conducting him  you must try sir to keep your spirits up said she to be sure this is a great change for one like you but who knows the future  mr archer turned towards her in the darkness and she could clearly perceive that he smiled upon her very kindly there spoke a sweet nature said he and i must thank you for these words but i would not have you fancy that i regret the past for any happiness found in it or that i fear the simplicity and hardship of the country i am a man that has been much tossed about in life now up now down and do you think that i shall not be able to support what you supportyou who are kind and therefore know how to feel pain who are beautiful and therefore hope who are young and therefore or am i the more mistaken discontented  nay sir not that at least said nance not discontented if i were to be discontented how should i look those that have real sorrows in the face i have faults enough but not that fault and i have my merits too for i have a good opinion of myself but for beauty i am not so simple but that i can tell a banter from a compliment  nay nay said mr archer i had half forgotten grief is selfish and i was thinking of myself and not of you or i had never blurted out so bold a piece of praise tis the best proof of my sincerity but come now i would lay a wager you are no coward  indeed sir i am not more afraid than another said nance none of my blood are given to fear  and you are honest he returned  i will answer for that said she  well then to be brave to be honest to be kind and to be contented since you say you are sois not that to fill up a great part of virtue  i fear you are but a flatterer said nance but she did not say it clearly for what with bewilderment and satisfaction her heart was quite oppressed  there could be no harm certainly in these grave compliments but yet they charmed and frightened her and to find favour for reasons however obscure in the eyes of this elegant serious and most unfortunate young gentleman was a giddy elevation was almost an apotheosis for a country maid  but she was to be no more exercised for mr archer disclaiming any thought of flattery turned off to other subjects and held her all through the wood in conversation addressing her with an air of perfect sincerity and listening to her answers with every mark of interest had open flattery continued nance would have soon found refuge in good sense but the more subtle lure she could not suspect much less avoid it was the first time she had ever taken part in a conversation illuminated by any ideas all was then true that she had heard and dreamed of gentlemen they were a race apart like deities knowing good and evil and then there burst upon her soul a divine thought hopes glorious sunrise since she could understand since it seemed that she too even she could interest this sorrowful apollo might she not learn or was she not learning would not her soul awake and put forth wings was she not in fact an enchanted princess waiting but a touch to become royal she saw herself transformed radiantly attired but in the most exquisite taste her face grown longer and more refined her tint etherealised and she heard herself with delighted wonder talking like a book  meanwhile they had arrived at where the track comes out above the river dell and saw in front of them the castle faintly shadowed on the night covering with its broken battlements a bold projection of the bank and showing at the extreme end where were the habitable tower and wing some crevices of candlelight hence she called loudly upon her uncle and he was seen to issue lantern in hand from the tower door and where the ruins did not intervene to pick his way over the swarded courtyard avoiding treacherous cellars and winding among blocks of fallen masonry the arch of the great gate was still entire flanked by two tottering bastions and it was here that jonathan met them standing at the edge of the bridge bent somewhat forward and blinking at them through the glow of his own lantern mr archer greeted him with civility but the old man was in no humour of compliance he guided the newcomer across the courtyard looking sharply and quickly in his face and grumbling all the time about the cold and the discomfort and dilapidation of the castle he was sure he hoped that mr archer would like it but in truth he could not think what brought him there doubtless he had a good reasonthis with a look of cunning scrutinybut indeed the place was quite unfit for any person of repute he himself was eaten up with the rheumatics it was the most rheumaticky place in england and some fine day the whole habitable part to call it habitable would fetch away bodily and go down the slope into the river he had seen the cracks widening there was a plaguy issue in the bank below he thought a spring was mining it it might be tomorrow it might be next day but they were all sure of a comedown sooner or later and that is a poor death said he for any one let alone a gentleman to have a whole old ruin dumped upon his belly have a care to your left there these cellar vaults have all broke down and the grass and hemlock hide em well sir here is welcome to you such as it is and wishing you well away  and with that jonathan ushered his guest through the tower door and down three steps on the left hand into the kitchen or common room of the castle it was a huge low room as large as a meadow occupying the whole width of the habitable wing with six barred windows looking on the court and two into the river valley a dresser a table and a few chairs stood dotted here and there upon the uneven flags under the great chimney a good fire burned in an iron firebasket a high old settee rudely carved with figures and gothic lettering flanked it on either side there was a hinge table and a stone bench in the chimney corner and above the arch hung guns axes lanterns and great sheaves of rusty keys  jonathan looked about him holding up the lantern and shrugged his shoulders with a pitying grimace here it is he said see the damp on the floor look at the moss where theres moss you may be sure that its rheumaticky try and get near that fire for to warm yourself itll blow the coat off your back and with a young gentleman with a face like yours as pale as a tallowcandle id be afeard of a churchyard cough and a galloping decline says jonathan naming the maladies with gloomy gusto or the cold might strike and turn your blood he added  mr archer fairly laughed my good mr holdaway said he i was born with that same tallowcandle face and the only fear that you inspire me with is the fear that i intrude unwelcomely upon your private hours but i think i can promise you that i am very little troublesome and i am inclined to hope that the terms which i can offer may still pay you the derangement  yes the terms said jonathan i was thinking of that as you say they are very small and he shook his head  unhappily i can afford no more said mr archer but this we have arranged already he added with a certain stiffness and as i am aware that miss holdaway has matter to communicate i will if you permit retire at once tonight i must bivouac tomorrow my trunk is to follow from the dragon so if you will show me to my room i shall wish you a good slumber and a better awakening  jonathan silently gave the lantern to nance and she turning and curtseying in the doorway proceeded to conduct their guest up the broad winding staircase of the tower he followed with a very brooding face  alas cried nance as she entered the room your fire black out and setting down the lantern she clapped upon her knees before the chimney and began to rearrange the charred and still smouldering remains mr archer looked about the gaunt apartment with a sort of shudder the great height the bare stone the shattered windows the aspect of the uncurtained bed with one of its four fluted columns broken short all struck a chill upon his fancy from this dismal survey his eyes returned to nance crouching before the fire the candle in one hand and artfully puffing at the embers the flames as they broke forth played upon the soft outline of her cheekshe was alive and young coloured with the bright hues of life and a woman he looked upon her softening and then sat down and continued to admire the picture  there sir said she getting upon her feet your fire is doing bravely now goodnight  he rose and held out his hand come said he you are my only friend in these parts and you must shake hands  she brushed her hand upon her skirt and offered it blushing  god bless you my dear said he  and then when he was alone he opened one of the windows and stared down into the dark valley a gentle wimpling of the river among stones ascended to his ear the trees upon the other bank stood very black against the sky farther away an owl was hooting it was dreary and cold and as he turned back to the hearth and the fine glow of fire heavens said he to himself what an unfortunate destiny is mine  he went to bed but sleep only visited his pillow in uneasy snatches outbreaks of loud speech came up the staircase he heard the old stones of the castle crack in the frosty night with sharp reverberations and the bed complained under his tossings lastly far on into the morning he awakened from a doze to hear very far off in the extreme and breathless quiet a wailing flourish on the horn the down mail was drawing near to the green dragon he sat up in bed the sound was tragical by distance and the modulation appealed to his ear like human speech it seemed to call upon him with a dreary insistenceto call him far away to address him personally and to have a meaning that he failed to seize it was thus at least in this nodding castle in a cold miry woodland and so far from men and society that the traffic on the great north road spoke to him in the intervals of slumber     chapter iii  jonathan holdaway   nance descended the tower stair pausing at every step she was in no hurry to confront her uncle with bad news and she must dwell a little longer on the rich note of mr archers voice the charm of his kind words and the beauty of his manner and person but once at the stairfoot she threw aside the spell and recovered her sensible and workaday self  jonathan was seated in the middle of the settle a mug of ale beside him in the attitude of one prepared for trouble but he did not speak and suffered her to fetch her supper and eat of it with a very excellent appetite in silence when she had done she too drew a tankard of homebrewed and came and planted herself in front of him upon the settle  well said jonathan  my lord has run away said nance  what cried the old man  abroad she continued run away from creditors he said he had not a stiver but he was drunk enough he said you might live on in the castle and mr archer would pay you but you was to look for no more wages since he would be glad of them himself  jonathans face contracted the flush of a black bilious anger mounted to the roots of his hair he gave an inarticulate cry leapt upon his feet and began rapidly pacing the stone floor at first he kept his hands behind his back in a tight knot then he began to gesticulate as he turned  this manthis lord he shouted who is he he was born with a gold spoon in his mouth and i with a dirty straw he rolled in his coach when he was a baby i have dug and toiled and laboured since i was that highthat high and he shouted again im bent and broke and full of pains dye think i dont know the taste of sweat manys the gallon ive drunk of itay in the midwinter toiling like a slave all through what has my life been bend bend bend my old creaking back till it would ache like breaking wade about in the foul mire never a dry stitch empty belly sore hands hat off to my lord redface kicks and hapence and now here at the hind end when im worn to my poor bones a kick and done with it he walked a little while in silence and then extending his hand now you nance holdaway says he you come of my blood and youre a good girl when that man was a boy i used to carry his gun for him i carried the gun all day on my two feet and many a stitch i had and chewed a bullet for he rode upon a horse with feathers in his hat but it was him that had the shots and took the game home did i complain not i i knew my station what did i ask but just the chance to live and die honest nance holdaway dont let them deny it to medont let them do it ive been as poor as job and as honest as the day but now my girl you mark these words of mine im getting tired of it  i wouldnt say such words at least said nance  you wouldnt said the old man grimly well and did i when i was your age wait till your backs broke and your hands tremble and your eyes fail and youre weary of the battle and ask no more but to lie down in your bed and give the ghost up like an honest man and then let there up and come some insolent ungodly fellowah if i had him in these hands wheres my money that you gambled i should say wheres my money that you drank and diced thief is what i would say thief he roared thief  mr archer will hear you if you dont take care said nance and i would be ashamed for one that he should hear a brave old honest hardworking man like jonathan holdaway talk nonsense like a boy  dye think i mind for mr archer he cried shrilly with a clack of laughter and then he came close up to her stooped down with his two palms upon his knees and looked her in the eyes with a strange hard expression something like a smile do i mind for god my girl he said thats what its come to be now do i mind for god  uncle jonathan she said getting up and taking him by the arm you sit down again where you were sitting there sit still ill have no more of this youll do yourself a mischief come take a drink of this good ale and ill warm a tankard for you la well pull through youll see im young as you say and its my turn to carry the bundle and dont you worry your bile or well have sickness too as well as sorrow  dye think that id forgotten you said jonathan with something like a groan and thereupon his teeth clicked to and he sat silent with the tankard in his hand and staring straight before him  why says nance setting on the ale to mull men are always children they say however old and if ever i heard a thing like this to set to and make yourself sick just when the moneys failing keep a good heart up you havent kept a good heart these seventy years nigh hand to break down about a pound or two heres this mr archer come to lodge that you disliked so much well now you see it was a clear providence come lets think upon our mercies and here is the ale mulling lovely smell of it ill take a drop myself it smells so sweet and uncle jonathan you let me say one word youve lost more than money before now you lost my aunt and bore it like a man bear this  his face once more contracted his fist doubled and shot forth into the air and trembled let them look out he shouted here i warn all men ive done with this foul kennel of knaves let them look out  hush hush for pitys sake cried nance  and then all of a sudden he dropped his face into his hands and broke out with a great hiccoughing dry sob that was horrible to hear o he cried my god if my son hadnt left me if my dick was here and the sobs shook him nance sitting still and watching him with distress o if he were here to help his father he went on again if i had a son like other fathers he would save me now when all is breaking down o he would save me ay but where is he raking taverns a thief perhaps my curse be on him he added rising again into wrath  hush cried nance springing to her feet your boy your dead wifes boyaunt susans baby that she lovedwould you curse him o god forbid  the energy of her address surprised him from his mood he looked upon her tearless and confused let me go to my bed he said at last and he rose and shaking as with ague but quite silent lighted his candle and left the kitchen  poor nance the pleasant current of her dreams was all diverted she beheld a golden city where she aspired to dwell she had spoken with a deity and had told herself that she might rise to be his equal and now the earthly ligaments that bound her down had been tightened she was like a tree looking skyward her roots were in the ground it seemed to her a thing so coarse so rustic to be thus concerned about a loss in money when mr archer fallen from the skylevel of counts and nobles faced his changed destiny with so immovable a courage to weary of honesty that at least no one could do but even to name it was already a disgrace and she beheld in fancy her uncle and the young lad all laced and feathered hand upon hip bestriding his small horse the opposition seemed to perpetuate itself from generation to generation one side still doomed to the clumsy and the servile the other born to beauty  she thought of the golden zones in which gentlemen were bred and figured with so excellent a grace zones in which wisdom and smooth words white linen and slim hands were the mark of the desired inhabitants where low temptations were unknown and honesty no virtue but a thing as natural as breathing     chapter iv  mingling threads   it was nearly seven before mr archer left his apartment on the landing he found another door beside his own opening on a roofless corridor and presently he was walking on the top of the ruins on one hand he could look down a good depth into the green courtyard on the other his eye roved along the downward course of the river the wet woods all smoking the shadows long and blue the mists golden and rosy in the sun here and there the water flashing across an obstacle his heart expanded and softened to a grateful melancholy and with his eye fixed upon the distance and no thought of present danger he continued to stroll along the elevated and treacherous promenade  a terrorstricken cry rose to him from the courtyard he looked down and saw in a glimpse nance standing below with hands clasped in horror and his own foot trembling on the margin of a gulf he recoiled and leant against a pillar quaking from head to foot and covering his face with his hands and nance had time to run round by the stair and rejoin him where he stood before he had changed a line of his position  ah he cried and clutched her wrist dont leave me the place rocks i have no head for altitudes  sit down against that pillar said nance dont you be afraid i wont leave you and dont look up or down look straight at me how white you are  the gulf he said and closed his eyes again and shuddered  why said nance what a poor climber you must be that was where my cousin dick used to get out of the castle after uncle jonathan had shut the gate ive been down there myself with him helping me i wouldnt try with you she said and laughed merrily  the sound of her laughter was sincere and musical and perhaps its beauty barbed the offence to mr archer the blood came into his face with a quick jet and then left it paler than before it is a physical weakness he said harshly and very droll no doubt but one that i can conquer on necessity see i am still shaking well i advance to the battlements and look down show me your cousins path  he would go surefoot along that little ledge said nance pointing as she spoke then out through the breach and down by yonder buttress it is easier coming back of course because you see where you are going from the buttress foot a sheepwalk goes along the scarpsee you can follow it from here in the dry grass and now sir she added with a touch of womanly pity i would come away from here if i were you for indeed you are not fit  sure enough mr archers pallor and agitation had continued to increase his cheeks were deathly his clenched fingers trembled pitifully the weakness is physical he sighed and had nearly fallen nance led him from the spot and he was no sooner back in the towerstair than he fell heavily against the wall and put his arm across his eyes a cup of brandy had to be brought him before he could descend to breakfast and the perfection of nances dream was for the first time troubled  jonathan was waiting for them at table with yellow bloodshot eyes and a peculiar dusky complexion he hardly waited till they found their seats before raising one hand and stooping with his mouth above his plate he put up a prayer for a blessing on the food and a spirit of gratitude in the eaters and thereupon and without more civility fell to but it was notable that he was no less speedily satisfied than he had been greedy to begin he pushed his plate away and drummed upon the table  these are silly prayers said he that they teach us eat and be thankful thats no such wonder speak to me of starvingtheres the touch youre a man they tell me mr archer that has met with some reverses  i have met with many replied mr archer  ha said jonathan none reckons but the last now see i tried to make this girl here understand me  uncle said nance what should mr archer care for your concerns he hath troubles of his own and came to be at peace i think  i tried to make her understand me repeated jonathan doggedly and now ill try you do you think this world is fair  fair and false quoth mr archer  the old man laughed immoderately good said he very good but what i mean is this do you know what it is to get up early and go to bed late and never take so much as a holiday but four and one of these your own marriage day and the other three the funerals of folk you loved and all that to have a quiet old age in shelter and bread for your old belly and a bed to lay your crazy bones upon with a clear conscience  sir said mr archer with an inclination of his head you portray a very brave existence  well continued jonathan and in the end thieves deceive you thieves rob and rook you thieves turn you out in your old age and send you begging what have you got for all your honesty a fine return you that might have stole scores of pounds there you are out in the rain with your rheumatics  mr archer had forgotten to eat with his hand upon his chin he was studying the old mans countenance and you conclude he asked  conclude cried jonathan i conclude ill be upsides with them  ay said the other we are all tempted to revenge  you have lost money asked jonathan  a great estate said archer quietly  see now says jonathan and where is it  nay i sometimes think that every one has had his share of it but me was the reply all england hath paid his taxes with my patrimony i was a sheep that left my wool on every briar  and you sit down under that cried the old man come now mr archer you and me belong to different stations and i know mineno man betterbut since we have both been rooked and are both sore with it why heres my hand with a very good heart and i ask for yours and no offence i hope  there is surely no offence my friend returned mr archer as they shook hands across the table for believe me my sympathies are quite acquired to you this life is an arena where we fight with beasts and indeed he added sighing i sometimes marvel why we go down to it unarmed  in the meanwhile a creaking of ungreased axles had been heard descending through the wood and presently after the door opened and the tall ostler entered the kitchen carrying one end of mr archers trunk the other was carried by an aged beggar man of that district known and welcome for some twenty miles about under the name of old cumberland each was soon perched upon a settle with a cup of ale and the ostler who valued himself upon his affability began to entertain the company still with half an eye on nance to whom in gallant terms he expressly dedicated every sip of ale first he told of the trouble they had to get his lordship started in the chaise and how he had dropped a rouleau of gold on the threshold and the passage and doorstep had been strewn with guineapieces at this old jonathan looked at mr archer next the visitor turned to news of a more thrilling character how the down mail had been stopped again near grantham by three men on horsebacka white and two bays how they had handkerchiefs on their faces how tom the guards blunderbuss missed fire but he swore he had winged one of them with a pistol and how they had got clean away with seventy pounds in money some valuable papers and a watch or two  brave brave cried jonathan in ecstasy seventy pounds o its brave  well i dont see the great bravery observed the ostler misapprehending him three men and you may call that three to one ill call it brave when some one stops the mail singlehanded thats a risk  and why should they hesitate inquired mr archer the poor souls who are fallen to such a way of life pray what have they to lose if they get the money well but if a ball should put them from their troubles why so better  well sir said the ostler i believe youll find they wont agree with you they count on a good fling you see or who would risk itand heres my best respects to you miss nance  and i forgot the part of cowardice resumed mr archer all men fear  o surely not cried nance  all men reiterated mr archer  ay thats a true word observed old cumberland and a thief anyway for its a cowards trade  but these fellows now said jonathan with a curious appealing mannerthese fellows with their seventy pounds perhaps mr archer they were no true thieves after all but just people who had been robbed and tried to get their own again what was that you said about all england and the taxes one takes another gives why thats almost fair if ive been rooked and robbed and the coat taken off my back i call it almost fair to take anothers  ask old cumberland observed the ostler you ask old cumberland miss nance and he bestowed a wink upon his favoured fair one  why that asked jonathan  he had his coat takenay and his shirt too returned the ostler  is that so cried jonathan eagerly was you robbed too  that was i replied cumberland with a warrant i was a welltodo man when i was young  ay see that says jonathan and you dont long for a revenge  eh not me answered the beggar its too long ago but if youll give me another mug of your good ale my pretty lady i wont say no to that  and shalt have and shalt have cried jonathan or brandy even if you like it better  and as cumberland did like it better and the ostler chimed in the party pledged each other in a dram of brandy before separating  as for nance she slipped forth into the ruins partly to avoid the ostlers gallantries partly to lament over the defects of mr archer plainly he was no hero she pitied him she began to feel a protecting interest mingle with and almost supersede her admiration and was at the same time disappointed and yet drawn to him she was indeed conscious of such unshaken fortitude in her own heart that she was almost tempted by an occasion to be bold for two she saw herself in a brave attitude shielding her imperfect hero from the world and she saw like a piece of heaven his gratitude for her protection     chapter v  life in the castle   from that day forth the life of these three persons in the ruin ran very smoothly mr archer now sat by the fire with a book and now passed whole days abroad returning late dead weary his manner was a mask but it was half transparent through the even tenor of his gravity and courtesy profound revolutions of feeling were betrayed seasons of numb despair of restlessness of aching temper for days he would say nothing beyond his usual courtesies and solemn compliments and then all of a sudden some fine evening beside the kitchen fire he would fall into a vein of elegant gossip tell of strange and interesting events the secrets of families brave deeds of war the miraculous discovery of crime the visitations of the dead nance and her uncle would sit till the small hours with eyes wide open jonathan applauding the unexpected incidents with many a slap of his big hand nance perhaps more pleased with the narrators eloquence and wise reflections and then again days would follow of abstraction of listless humming of frequent apologies and long hours of silence once only and then after a week of unrelieved melancholy he went over to the green dragon spent the afternoon with the landlord and a bowl of punch and returned as on the first night devious in step but courteous and unperturbed of speech  if he seemed more natural and more at his ease it was when he found nance alone and laying by some of his reserve talked before her rather than to her of his destiny character and hopes to nance these interviews were but a doubtful privilege at times he would seem to take a pleasure in her presence to consult her gravely to hear and to discuss her counsels at times even but these were rare and brief he would talk of herself praise the qualities that she possessed touch indulgently on her defects and lend her books to read and even examine her upon her reading but far more often he would fall into a half unconsciousness put her a question and then answer it himself drop into the veiled tone of voice of one soliloquising and leave her at last as though he had forgotten her existence it was odd too that in all this random converse not a fact of his past life and scarce a name should ever cross his lips a profound reserve kept watch upon his most unguarded moments he spoke continually of himself indeed but still in enigmas a veiled prophet of egoism  the base of nances feelings for mr archer was admiration as for a superior being and with this his treatment consciously or not accorded happily when he forgot her she took the blame upon herself his formal politeness was so exquisite that this essential brutality stood excused his compliments besides were always grave and rational he would offer reason for his praise convict her of merit and thus disarm suspicion nay and the very hours when he forgot and remembered her alternately could by the ardent fallacies of youth be read in the light of an attention she might be far from his confidence but still she was nearer it than any one he might ignore her presence but yet he sought it  moreover she upon her side was conscious of one point of superiority beside this rather dismal rather effeminate man who recoiled from a worm who grew giddy on the castle wall who bore so helplessly the weight of his misfortunes she felt herself a head and shoulders taller in cheerful and sterling courage she could walk head in air along the most precarious rafter her hand feared neither the grossness nor the harshness of lifes web but was thrust cheerfully if need were into the briar bush and could take hold of any crawling horror ruin was mining the walls of her cottage as already it had mined and subverted mr archers palace well she faced it with a bright countenance and a busy hand she had got some washing some rough seamstress work from the green dragon and from another neighbour ten miles away across the moor at this she cheerfully laboured and from that height she could afford to pity the useless talents and poor attitude of mr archer it did not change her admiration but it made it bearable he was above her in all ways but she was above him in one she kept it to herself and hugged it when like all young creatures she made long stories to justify to nourish and to forecast the course of her affection it was this private superiority that made all rosy that cut the knot and that at last in some great situation fetched to her knees the dazzling but imperfect hero with this pretty exercise she beguiled the hours of labour and consoled herself for mr archers bearing pity was her weapon and her weakness to accept the loved ones faults although it has an air of freedom is to kiss the chain and this pity it was which lying nearer to her heart lent the one element of true emotion to a fanciful and merely brainsick love  thus it fell out one day that she had gone to the green dragon and brought back thence a letter to mr archer he upon seeing it winced like a man under the knife pain shame sorrow and the most trenchant edge of mortification cut into his heart and wrung the steady composure of his face  dear heart have you bad news she cried  but he only replied by a gesture and fled to his room and when later on she ventured to refer to it he stopped her on the threshold as if with words prepared beforehand there are some pains said he too acute for consolation or i would bring them to my kind consoler let the memory of that letter if you please be buried and then as she continued to gaze at him being in spite of herself pained by his elaborate phrase doubtfully sincere in word and manner let it be enough he added haughtily that if this matter wring my heart it doth not touch my conscience i am a man i would have you to know who suffers undeservedly  he had never spoken so directly never with so convincing an emotion and her heart thrilled for him she could have taken his pains and died of them with joy  meanwhile she was left without support jonathan now swore by his lodger and lived for him he was a fine talker he knew the finest sight of stories he was a man and a gentleman take him for all in all and a perfect credit to old england such were the old mans declared sentiments and sure enough he clung to mr archers side hung upon his utterance when he spoke and watched him with unwearying interest when he was silent and yet his feeling was not clear in the partial wreck of his mind which was leaning to decay some afterthought was strongly present as he gazed in mr archers face a sudden brightness would kindle in his rheumy eyes his eyebrows would lift as with a sudden thought his mouth would open as though to speak and close again on silence once or twice he even called mr archer mysteriously forth into the dark courtyard took him by the button and laid a demonstrative finger on his chest but there his ideas or his courage failed him he would shufflingly excuse himself and return to his position by the fire without a word of explanation the good man was growing old said mr archer with a suspicion of a shrug but the good man had his idea and even when he was alone the name of mr archer fell from his lips continually in the course of mumbled and gesticulative conversation     chapter vi  the bad halfcrown   however early nance arose and she was no sluggard the old man who had begun to outlive the earthly habit of slumber would usually have been up long before the fire would be burning brightly and she would see him wandering among the ruins lantern in hand and talking assiduously to himself one day however after he had returned late from the market town she found that she had stolen a march upon that indefatigable early riser the kitchen was all blackness she crossed the castleyard to the woodcellar her steps printing the thick hoarfrost a scathing breeze blew out of the northeast and slowly carried a regiment of black and tattered clouds over the face of heaven which was already kindled with the wild light of morning but where she walked in shelter of the ruins the flame of her candle burned steady the extreme cold smote upon her conscience she could not bear to think this bitter business fell usually to the lot of one so old as jonathan and made desperate resolutions to be earlier in the future  the fire was a good blaze before he entered limping dismally into the kitchen nance said he i be all knotted up with the rheumatics will you rub me a bit she came and rubbed him where and how he bade her this is a cruel thing that old age should be rheumaticky said he when i was young i stood my turn of the teethache like a man for why because it couldnt last for ever but these rheumatics come to live and die with you your aunt was took before the time came never had an ache to mention now i lie all night in my single bed and the blood never warms in me this knee of mine it seems like lighted up with rheumatics it seems as though you could see to sew by it and all the strings of my old body ache as if devils was pulling em thank you kindly thats someways easier now but an old man my dear has little to look for its pain pain pain to the end of the business and ill never be rightly warm again till i get under the sod he said and looked down at her with a face so aged and weary that she had nearly wept  i lay awake all night he continued i do so mostly and a long walk kills me eh deary me to think that life should run to such a puddle and i remember long syne when i was strong and the blood all hot and good about me and i loved to run toodeary me to run well thats all by youd better pray to be took early nance and not live on till you get to be like me and are robbed in your grey old age your cold shivering dark old age thats like a winters morning and he bitterly shuddered spreading his hands before the fire  come now said nance the more you say the less youll like it uncle jonathan but if i were you i would be proud for to have lived all your days honest and beloved and come near the end with your good name isnt that a fine thing to be proud of mr archer was telling me in some strange land they used to run races each with a lighted candle and the art was to keep the candle burning well now i thought that was like life a mans good conscience is the flame he gets to carry and if he comes to the winningpost with that still burning why take it how you will the mans a heroeven if he was lowborn like you and me  did mr archer tell you that asked jonathan  no dear said she thats my own thought about it he told me of the race but see now she continued putting on the porridge you say old age is a hard season but so is youth youre half out of the battle i would say you loved my aunt and got her and buried her and some of these days soon youll go to meet her and take her my love and tell her i tried to take good care of you for so i do uncle jonathan  jonathan struck with his fist upon the settle dye think i want to die ye vixen he shouted i want to live ten hundred years  this was a mystery beyond nances penetration and she stared in wonder as she made the porridge  i want to live he continued i want to live and to grow rich i want to drive my carriage and to dice in hells and see the ring i do is this a life that i lived i want to be a rake dye understand i want to know what things are like i dont want to die like a blind kitten and me seventysix  o fie said nance  the old man thrust out his jaw at her with the grimace of an irreverent schoolboy upon that aged face it seemed a blasphemy then he took out of his bosom a long leather purse and emptying its contents on the settle began to count and recount the pieces ringing and examining each and suddenly he leapt like a young man what he screamed bad o lord im robbed again and falling on his knees before the settle he began to pour forth the most dreadful curses on the head of his deceiver his eyes were shut for to him this vile solemnity was prayer he held up the bad halfcrown in his right hand as though he were displaying it to heaven and what increased the horror of the scene the curses he invoked were those whose efficacy he had tastedold age and poverty rheumatism and an ungrateful son nance listened appalled then she sprang forward and dragged down his arm and laid her hand upon his mouth  whist she cried whist ye for gods sake o my man whist ye if heaven were to hear if poor aunt susan were to hear think she may be listening and with the histrionism of strong emotion she pointed to a corner of the kitchen  his eyes followed her finger he looked there for a little thinking blinking then he got stiffly to his feet and resumed his place upon the settle the bad piece still in his hand so he sat for some time looking upon the halfcrown and now wondering to himself on the injustice and partiality of the law now computing again and again the nature of his loss so he was still sitting when mr archer entered the kitchen at this a light came into his face and after some seconds of rumination he despatched nance upon an errand  mr archer said he as soon as they were alone together would you give me a guineapiece for silver  why sir i believe i can said mr archer  and the exchange was just effected when nance reentered the apartment the blood shot into her face  whats to do here she asked rudely  nothing my dearie said old jonathan with a touch of whine  whats to do she said again  your uncle was but changing me a piece of gold returned mr archer  let me see what he hath given you mr archer replied the girl i had a bad piece and i fear it is mixed up among the good  well well replied mr archer smiling i must take the merchants risk of it the money is now mixed  i know my piece quoth nance come let me see your silver mr archer if i have to get it by a theft ill see that money she cried  nay child if you put as much passion to be honest as the world to steal i must give way though i betray myself said mr archer there it is as i received it  nance quickly found the bad halfcrown  give him another she said looking jonathan in the face and when that had been done she walked over to the chimney and flung the guilty piece into the reddest of the fire its base constituents began immediately to run even as she watched it the disc crumbled and the lineaments of the king became confused jonathan who had followed close behind beheld these changes from over her shoulder and his face darkened sorely  now said she come back to table and today it is i that shall say grace as i used to do in the old times day about with dick and covering her eyes with one hand o lord said she with deep emotion make us thankful and o lord deliver us from evil for the love of the poor souls that watch for us in heaven o deliver us from evil     chapter vii  the bleachinggreen   the year moved on to march and march though it blew bitter keen from the north sea yet blinked kindly between whiles on the river dell the mire dried up in the closest covert life ran in the bare branches and the air of the afternoon would be suddenly sweet with the fragrance of new grass  above and below the castle the river crooked like the letter s the lower loop was to the left and embraced the high and steep projection which was crowned by the ruins the upper loop enclosed a lawny promontory fringed by thorn and willow it was easy to reach it from the castle side for the river ran in this part very quietly among innumerable boulders and over damlike walls of rock the place was all enclosed the wind a stranger the turf smooth and solid so it was chosen by nance to be her bleachinggreen  one day she brought a bucketful of linen and had but begun to wring and lay them out when mr archer stepped from the thicket on the far side drew very deliberately near and sat down in silence on the grass nance looked up to greet him with a smile but finding her smile was not returned she fell into embarrassment and stuck the more busily to her employment man or woman the whole world looks well at any work to which they are accustomed but the girl was ashamed of what she did she was ashamed besides of the sunbonnet that so well became her and ashamed of her bare arms which were her greatest beauty  nausicaa said mr archer at last i find you like nausicaa  and who was she asked nance and laughed in spite of herself an empty and embarrassed laugh that sounded in mr archers ears indeed like music but to her own like the last grossness of rusticity  she was a princess of the grecian islands he replied a king being shipwrecked found her washing by the shore certainly i too was shipwrecked he continued plucking at the grass there was never a more desperate castawayto fall from polite life fortune a shrine of honour a grateful conscience duties willingly taken up and faithfully discharged and to fall to thisidleness poverty inutility remorse he seemed to have forgotten her presence but here he remembered her again nance said he would you have a man sit down and suffer or rise up and strive  nay she said i would always rather see him doing  ha said mr archer but yet you speak from an imperfect knowledge conceive a man damned to a choice of only evilmisconduct upon either side not a fault behind him and yet naught before him but this choice of sins how would you say then  i would say that he was much deceived mr archer returned nance i would say there was a third choice and that the right one  i tell you said mr archer the man i have in view hath two ways open and no more one to wait like a poor mewling baby till fate save or ruin him the other to take his troubles in his hand and to perish or be saved at once it is no point of morals both are wrong either way this stepchild of providence must fall which shall he choose by doing or not doing  fall then is what i would say replied nance fall where you will but do it for o mr archer she continued stooping to her work you that are good and kind and so wise it doth sometimes go against my heart to see you live on here like a sheep in a turnipfield if you were braver and here she paused consciencesmitten  do i indeed lack courage inquired mr archer of himself courage the footstool of the virtues upon which they stand courage that a poor private carrying a musket has to spare of that does not fail a weasel or a rat that is a brutish faculty i to fail there i wonder but what is courage then the constancy to endure oneself or to see others suffer the itch of illadvised activity mere shuttlewittedness or to be still and patient to inquire of the significance of words is to rob ourselves of what we seem to know and yet of all things certainly to stand still is the least heroic nance he said did you ever hear of hamlet  never said nance  tis an old play returned mr archer and frequently enacted this while i have been talking hamlet you must know this hamlet was a prince among the danes and he told her the play in a very good style here and there quoting a verse or two with solemn emphasis  it is strange said nance he was then a very poor creature  that was what he could not tell said mr archer look at me am i as poor a creature  she looked and what she saw was the familiar thought of all her hours the tall figure very plainly habited in black the spotless ruffles the slim hands the long wellshapen serious shaven face the wide and somewhat thinlipped mouth the dark eyes that were so full of depth and change and colour he was gazing at her with his brows a little knit his chin upon one hand and that elbow resting on his knee  ye look a man she cried ay and should be a great one the more shame to you to lie here idle like a dog before the fire  my fair holdaway quoth mr archer you are much set on action i cannot dig to beg i am ashamed he continued looking at her with a halfabsent fixity tis a strange thing certainly that in my years of fortune i should never taste happiness and now when i am broke enjoy so much of it for was i ever happier than today was the grass softer the stream pleasanter in sound the air milder the heart more at peace why should i not sink to digwhy after all it should be easy to take a mate too love is of all grades since jupiter love fails to none and childrenbut here he passed his hand suddenly over his eyes o fool and coward fool and coward he said bitterly can you forget your fetters you did not know that i was fettered nance he asked again addressing her  but nance was somewhat sore i know you keep talking she said and turning half away from him began to wring out a sheet across her shoulder i wonder you are not wearied of your voice when the hands lie abed the tongue takes a walk  mr archer laughed unpleasantly rose and moved to the waters edge in this part the body of the river poured across a little narrow fell ran some ten feet very smoothly over a bed of pebbles then getting wind as it were of another shelf of rock which barred the channel began by imperceptible degrees to separate towards either shore in dancing currents and to leave the middle clear and stagnant the set towards either side was nearly equal about one half of the whole water plunged on the side of the castle through a narrow gullet about one half ran lipping past the margin of the green and slipped across a babbling rapid  here said mr archer after he had looked for some time at the fine and shifting demarcation of these currents come here and see me try my fortune  i am not like a man said nance i have no time to waste  come here he said again i ask you seriously nance we are not always childish when we seem so  she drew a little nearer  now said he you see these two channelschoose one  ill choose the nearest to save time said nance  well that shall be for action returned mr archer and since i wish to have the odds against me not only the other channel but yon stagnant water in the midst shall be for lying still you see this he continued pulling up a withered rush i break it in three i shall put each separately at the top of the upper fall and according as they go by your way or by the other i shall guide my life  this is very silly said nance with a movement of her shoulders  i do not think it so said mr archer  and then she resumed if you are to try your fortune why not evenly  nay returned mr archer with a smile no man can put complete reliance in blind fate he must still cog the dice  by this time he had got upon the rock beside the upper fall and bidding her look out dropped a piece of rush into the middle of the intake the rusty fragment was sucked at once over the fall came up again far on the right hand leaned ever more and more in the same direction and disappeared under the hanging grasses on the castle side  one said mr archer one for standing still  but the next launch had a different fate and after hanging for a while about the edge of the stagnant water steadily approached the bleachinggreen and danced down the rapid under nances eyes  one for me she cried with some exultation and then she observed that mr archer had grown pale and was kneeling on the rock with his hand raised like a person petrified why said she you do not mind it do you  does a man not mind a throw of dice by which a fortune hangs said mr archer rather hoarsely and this is more than fortune nance if you have any kindness for my fate put up a prayer before i launch the next one  a prayer she cried about a game like this i would not be so heathen  well said he then without and he closed his eyes and dropped the piece of rush this time there was no doubt it went for the rapid as straight as any arrow  action then said mr archer getting to his feet and then god forgive us he added almost to himself  god forgive us indeed cried nance for wasting the good daylight but come mr archer if i see you look so serious i shall begin to think you was in earnest  nay he said turning upon her suddenly with a full smile but is not this good advice i have consulted god and demigod the nymph of the river and what i far more admire and trust my blueeyed minerva both have said the same my own heart was telling it already action then be mine and into the deep sea with all this paralysing casuistry i am happy today for the first time     chapter viii  the mail guard   somewhere about two in the morning a squall had burst upon the castle a clap of screaming wind that made the towers rock and a copious drift of rain that streamed from the windows the wind soon blew itself out but the day broke cloudy and dripping and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather nance had been brooding on the scene at the riverside applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations and the result which was hardly to her mind had taken the colour out of her cheeks mr archer too was somewhat absent his thoughts were of a mingled strain and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears but jonathan was the most altered he was strangely silent hardly passing a word and watched mr archer with an eager and furtive eye it seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape and while it still attracted somewhat alarmed his imagination  at this rate conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor it was the ostler from the green dragon bringing a letter for mr archer nance saw her heros face contract and then relax again at sight of it and she thought that she knew why for the sprawling gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him he opened it and began to read while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion  fine doings down our way miss nance said he i havent been abed this blessed night  nance expressed a polite interest but her eye was on mr archer who was reading his letter with a face of such extreme indifference that she was tempted to suspect him of assumption  yes continued the ostler not been the like of it this fifteen years the north mail stopped at the three stones  jonathans cup was at his lip but at this moment he choked with a great splutter and mr archer as if startled by the noise made so sudden a movement that one corner of the sheet tore off and stayed between his finger and thumb it was some little time before the old man was sufficiently recovered to beg the ostler to go on and he still kept coughing and crying and rubbing his eyes mr archer on his side laid the letter down and putting his hands in his pocket listened gravely to the tale  yes resumed sam the north mail was stopped by a single horseman dash my wig but i admire him there were four insides and two out and poor tom oglethorpe the guard tom showed himself a man let fly his blunderbuss at him had him covered too and could swear to that but the captain never let on up with a pistol and fetched poor tom a bullet through the body tom he squelched upon the seat all over blood up comes the captain to the window oblige me says he with what you have would you believe it not a man says cheepnot them thy hands over thy head four watches rings snuffboxes sevenandforty pounds overhead in gold one dicksee a grazier tries it on gives him a guinea beg your pardon says the captain i think too highly of you to take it at your hand i will not take less than ten from such a gentleman this dicksee had his money in his stocking but there was the pistol at his eye down he goes offs with his stocking and there was thirty golden guineas now says the captain youve tried it on with me but i scorns the advantage ten i said he says and ten i take so dash my buttons i call that man a man cried sam in cordial admiration  well and then says mr archer  then resumed sam that old fat fagot engleton him as held the ribbons and drew up like a lamb when he was told to picks up his cattle and drives off again down they came to the dragon all singing like as if they was scalded and poor tom saying nothing you would a thought they had all lost the kings crown to hear them down gets this dicksee postmaster he says taking him by the arm this is a most abominable thing he says down gets a major clayton and gets the old man by the other arm weve been robbed he cries robbed down gets the others and all around the old man telling their story and what they had lost and how they was all as good as ruined till at last old engleton says says he how about oglethorpe says he ay says the others how about the guard well with that we bousted him down as white as a rag and all blooded like a sop i thought he was dead well he aint dead but hes dying i fancy  did you say four watches said jonathan  four i think i wish it had been forty cried sam such a party of soused herrings i never did seenot a man among them bar poor tom but us that are the servants on the road have all the risk and none of the profit  and this brave fellow asked mr archer very quietly this oglethorpehow is he now  well sir with my respects i take it he has a hole bang through him said sam the doctor hasnt been yet hed a been bright and early if it had been a passenger but doctor or no ill make a good guess that tom wont see tomorrow hell die on a sunday will poor tom and they do say thats fortunate  did tom see him that did it asked jonathan  well he saw him replied sam but not to swear by said he was a very tall man and very big and had a ankerchief about his face and a very quick shot and sat his horse like a thorough gentleman as he is  a gentleman cried nance the dirty knave  well i calls a man like that a gentleman returned the ostler thats what i mean by a gentleman  you dont know much of them then said nance a gentleman would scorn to stoop to such a thing i call my uncle a better gentleman than any thief  and you would be right said mr archer  how many snuffboxes did he get asked jonathan  o dang me if i know said sam i didnt take an inventory  i will go back with you if you please said mr archer i should like to see poor oglethorpe he has behaved well  at your service sir said sam jumping to his feet i dare to say a gentleman like you would not forget a poor fellow like tomno nor a plain man like me sir that went without his sleep to nurse him and excuse me sir added sam you wont forget about the letter neither  surely not said mr archer  oglethorpe lay in a low bed one of several in a long garret of the inn the rain soaked in places through the roof and fell in minute drops there was but one small window the beds were occupied by servants the air of the garret was both close and chilly mr archers heart sank at the threshold to see a man lying perhaps mortally hurt in so poor a sickroom and as he drew near the low bed he took his hat off the guard was a big blowsy innocentlooking soul with a thick lip and a broad nose comically turned up his cheeks were crimson and when mr archer laid a finger on his brow he found him burning with fever  i fear you suffer much he said with a catch in his voice as he sat down on the bedside  i suppose i do sir returned oglethorpe it is main sore  i am used to wounds and wounded men returned the visitor i have been in the wars and nursed brave fellows before now and if you will suffer me i propose to stay beside you till the doctor comes  it is very good of you sir i am sure said oglethorpe the trouble is they wont none of them let me drink  if you will not tell the doctor said mr archer i will give you some water they say it is bad for a green wound but in the low countries we all drank water when we found the chance and i could never perceive we were the worse for it  been wounded yourself sir perhaps called oglethorpe  twice said mr archer and was as proud of these hurts as any lady of her bracelets tis a fine thing to smart for ones duty even in the pangs of it there is contentment  ah well replied the guard if youve been shot yourself that explains but as for contentment why sir you see it smarts as you say and then i have a good wife you see and a bit of a brata little thing so high  dont move said mr archer  no sir i will not and thank you kindly said oglethorpe at york they are a very good lass is my wifefar too good for me and the little rascalwell i dont know how to say it but he sort of comes round you if i were to go sir it would be hard on my poor girlmain hard on her  ay you must feel bitter hardly to the rogue that laid you here said archer  why no sir more against engleton and the passengers replied the guard he played his hand if you come to look at it and i wish he had shot worse or me better and yet ill go to my grave but what i covered him he cried it looks like witchcraft ill go to my grave but what he was drove full of slugs like a pepperbox  quietly said mr archer you must not excite yourself these deceptions are very usual in war the eye in the moment of alert is hardly to be trusted and when the smoke blows away you see the man you fired at taking aim it may be at yourself you should observe too that you were in the dark night and somewhat dazzled by the lamps and that the sudden stopping of the mail had jolted you in such circumstances a man may miss ay even with a blunderbuss and no blame attach to his marksmanship      the young chevalier  a fragment     the young chevalier     prologue  the winesellers wife   there was a winesellers shop as you went down to the river in the city of the antipopes there a man was served with good wine of the country and plain country fare and the place being clean and quiet with a prospect on the river certain gentlemen who dwelt in that city in attendance on a great personage made it a practice when they had any silver in their purses to come and eat there and be private  they called the wineseller paradou he was built more like a bullock than a man huge in bone and brawn high in colour and with a hand like a baby for size mariemadeleine was the name of his wife she was of marseilles a city of entrancing women nor was any fairer than herself she was tall being almost of a height with paradou fullgirdled pointdevice in every form with an exquisite delicacy in the face her nose and nostrils a delight to look at from the fineness of the sculpture her eyes inclined a hairsbreadth inward her colour between dark and fair and laid on even like a flowers a faint rose dwelt in it as though she had been found unawares bathing and had blushed from head to foot she was of a grave countenance rarely smiling yet it seemed to be written upon every part of her that she rejoiced in life her husband loved the heels of her feet and the knuckles of her fingers he loved her like a glutton and a brute his love hung about her like an atmosphere one that came by chance into the wineshop was aware of that passion and it might be said that by the strength of it the woman had been drugged or spellbound she knew not if she loved or loathed him he was always in her eyes like something monstrousmonstrous in his love monstrous in his person horrific but imposing in his violence and her sentiment swung back and forward from desire to sickness but the mean where it dwelt chiefly was an apathetic fascination partly of horror as of europa in mid ocean with her bull  on the 10th november 1749 there sat two of the foreign gentlemen in the winesellers shop they were both handsome men of a good presence richly dressed the first was swarthy and long and lean with an alert black look and a mole upon his cheek the other was more fair he seemed very easy and sedate and a little melancholy for so young a man but his smile was charming in his grey eyes there was much abstraction as of one recalling fondly that which was past and lost yet there was strength and swiftness in his limbs and his mouth set straight across his face the under lip a thought upon side like that of a man accustomed to resolve these two talked together in a rude outlandish speech that no frequenter of that wineshop understood the swarthy man answered to the name of ballantrae he of the dreamy eyes was sometimes called balmile and sometimes my lord or my lord gladsmuir but when the title was given him he seemed to put it by as if in jesting not without bitterness  the mistral blew in the city the first day of that wind they say in the countries where its voice is heard it blows away all the dust the second all the stones and the third it blows back others from the mountains it was now come to the third day outside the pebbles flew like hail and the face of the river was puckered and the very buildingstones in the walls of houses seemed to be curdled with the savage cold and fury of that continuous blast it could be heard to hoot in all the chimneys of the city it swept about the wineshop filling the room with eddies the chill and gritty touch of it passed between the nearest clothes and the bare flesh and the two gentlemen at the far table kept their mantles loose about their shoulders the roughness of these outer hulls for they were plain travellers cloaks that had seen service set the greater mark of richness on what showed below of their laced clothes for the one was in scarlet and the other in violet and white like men come from a scene of ceremony as indeed they were  it chanced that these fine clothes were not without their influence on the scene which followed and which makes the prologue of our tale for a long time balmile was in the habit to come to the wineshop and eat a meal or drink a measure of wine sometimes with a comrade more often alone when he would sit and dream and drum upon the table and the thoughts would show in the mans face in little glooms and lightenings like the sun and the clouds upon a water for a long time mariemadeleine had observed him apart his sadness the beauty of his smile when by any chance he remembered her existence and addressed her the changes of his mind signalled forth by an abstruse play of feature the mere fact that he was foreign and a thing detached from the local and the accustomed insensibly attracted and affected her kindness was ready in her mind it but lacked the touch of an occasion to effervesce and crystallise now balmile had come hitherto in a very poor plain habit and this day of the mistral when his mantle was just open and she saw beneath it the glancing of the violet and the velvet and the silver and the clustering fineness of the lace it seemed to set the man in a new light with which he shone resplendent to her fancy  the high inhuman note of the wind the violence and continuity of its outpouring and the fierce touch of it upon mans whole periphery accelerated the functions of the mind it set thoughts whirling as it whirled the trees of the forest it stirred them up in flights as it stirred up the dust in chambers as brief as sparks the fancies glittered and succeeded each other in the mind of mariemadeleine and the grave man with the smile and the bright clothes under the plain mantle haunted her with incongruous explanations she considered him the unknown the speaker of an unknown tongue the hero as she placed him of an unknown romance the dweller upon unknown memories she recalled him sitting there alone so immersed so stupefied yet she was sure he was not stupid she recalled one day when he had remained a long time motionless with parted lips like one in the act of starting up his eyes fixed on vacancy any one else must have looked foolish but not he she tried to conceive what manner of memory had thus entranced him she forged for him a past she showed him to herself in every light of heroism and greatness and misfortune she brooded with petulant intensity on all she knew and guessed of him yet though she was already gone so deep she was still unashamed still unalarmed her thoughts were still disinterested she had still to reach the stage at whichbeside the image of that other whom we love to contemplate and to adornwe place the image of ourself and behold them together with delight  she stood within the counter her hands clasped behind her back her shoulders pressed against the wall her feet braced out her face was bright with the wind and her own thoughts as a fire in a similar day of tempest glows and brightens on a hearth so she seemed to glow standing there and to breathe out energy it was the first time ballantrae had visited that winesellers the first time he had seen the wife and his eyes were true to her  i perceive your reason for carrying me to this very draughty tavern he said at last  i believe it is propinquity returned balmile  you play dark said ballantrae but have a care be more frank with me or i will cut you out i go through no form of qualifying my threat which would be commonplace and not conscientious there is only one point in these campaigns that is the degree of admiration offered by the man and to our hostess i am in a posture to make victorious love  if you think you have the time or the game worth the candle replied the other with a shrug  one would suppose you were never at the pains to observe her said ballantrae  i am not very observant said balmile she seems comely  you very dear and dull dog cried ballantrae chastity is the most besotting of the virtues why she has a look in her face beyond singing i believe if you was to push me hard i might trace it home to a trifle of a squint what matters the height of beauty is in the touch thats wrong thats the modulation in a tune tis the devil we all love i owe many a conquest to my molehe touched it as he spoke with a smile and his eyes glitteredwe are all hunchbacks and beauty is only that kind of deformity that i happen to admire but come because you are chaste for which i am sure i pay you my respects that is no reason why you should be blind look at her look at the delicious nose of her look at her cheek look at her ear look at her hand and wristlook at the whole baggage from heels to crown and tell me if she wouldnt melt on a mans tongue  as ballantrae spoke half jesting half enthusiastic balmile was constrained to do as he was bidden he looked at the woman admired her excellences and was at the same time ashamed for himself and his companion so it befell that when mariemadeleine raised her eyes she met those of the subject of her contemplations fixed directly on herself with a look that is unmistakable the look of a person measuring and valuing anotherand to clench the false impression that his glance was instantly and guiltily withdrawn the blood beat back upon her heart and leaped again her obscure thoughts flashed clear before her she flew in fancy straight to his arms like a wanton and fled again on the instant like a nymph and at that moment there chanced an interruption which not only spared her embarrassment but set the last consecration on her now articulate love  into the wineshop there came a french gentleman arrayed in the last refinement of the fashion though a little tumbled by his passage in the wind it was to be judged he had come from the same formal gathering at which the others had preceded him and perhaps that he had gone there in the hope to meet with them for he came up to ballantrae with unceremonious eagerness  at last here you are he cried in french i thought i was to miss you altogether  the scotsmen rose and ballantrae after the first greetings laid his hand on his companions shoulder  my lord said he allow me to present to you one of my best friends and one of our best soldiers the lord viscount gladsmuir  the two bowed with the elaborate elegance of the period  monseigneur said balmile je nai pas la prétention de maffubler dun titre que la mauvaise fortune de mon roi ne me permet pas de porter comme il sied je mappelle pour vous servir blair de balmile tout court my lord i have not the effrontery to cumber myself with a title which the ill fortunes of my king will not suffer me to bear the way it should be i call myself at your service plain blair of balmile  monsieur le vicomte ou monsieur blèr de balmaïl replied the newcomer le nom ny fait rien et lon connaît vos beaux faits the name matters nothing your gallant actions are known  a few more ceremonies and these three sitting down together to the table called for wine it was the happiness of mariemadeleine to wait unobserved upon the prince of her desires she poured the wine he drank of it and that link between them seemed to her for the moment close as a caress though they lowered their tones she surprised great names passing in their conversation names of kings the names of de gesvre and belleisle and the man who dealt in these high matters and she who was now coupled with him in her own thoughts seemed to swim in mid air in a transfiguration love is a crude core but it has singular and farreaching fringes in that passionate attraction for the stranger that now swayed and mastered her his harsh incomprehensible language and these names of grandees in his talk were each an element  the frenchman stayed not long but it was plain he left behind him matter of much interest to his companions they spoke together earnestly their heads down the woman of the wineshop totally forgotten and they were still so occupied when paradou returned  this mans love was unsleeping the even bluster of the mistral with which he had been combating some hours had not suspended though it had embittered that predominant passion his first look was for his wife a look of hope and suspicion menace and humility and love that made the overblooming brute appear for the moment almost beautiful she returned his glance at first as though she knew him not then with a swiftly waxing coldness of intent and at last without changing their direction she had closed her eyes  there passed across her mind during that period much that paradou could not have understood had it been told to him in words chiefly the sense of an enlightening contrast betwixt the man who talked of kings and the man who kept a wineshop betwixt the love she yearned for and that to which she had been long exposed like a victim bound upon the altar there swelled upon her swifter than the rhone a tide of abhorrence and disgust she had succumbed to the monster humbling herself below animals and now she loved a hero aspiring to the semidivine it was in the pang of that humiliating thought that she had closed her eyes  paradouquick as beasts are quick to translate silencefelt the insult through his blood his inarticulate soul bellowed within him for revenge he glanced about the shop he saw the two indifferent gentlemen deep in talk and passed them over his fancy flying not so high there was but one other present a country lout who stood swallowing his wine equally unobserved by all and unobserving to him he dealt a glance of murderous suspicion and turned direct upon his wife the wineshop had lain hitherto a space of shelter the scene of a few ceremonial passages and some whispered conversation in the howling river of the wind the clock had not yet ticked a score of times since paradous appearance and now as he suddenly gave tongue it seemed as though the mistral had entered at his heels  what ails you woman he cried smiting on the counter  nothing ails me she replied it was strange but she spoke and stood at that moment like a lady of degree drawn upward by her aspirations  you speak to me by god as though you scorned me cried the husband  the mans passion was always formidable she had often looked on upon its violence with a thrill it had been one ingredient in her fascination and she was now surprised to behold him as from afar off gesticulating but impotent his fury might be dangerous like a torrent or a gust of wind but it was inhuman it might be feared or braved it should never be respected and with that there came in her a sudden glow of courage and that readiness to die which attends so closely upon all strong passions  i do scorn you she said  what is that he cried  i scorn you she repeated smiling  you love another man said he  with all my soul was her reply  the wineseller roared aloud so that the house rang and shook with it  is this the  he cried using a foul word common in the south and he seized the young countryman and dashed him to the ground there he lay for the least interval of time insensible thence fled from the house the most terrified person in the county the heavy measure had escaped from his hands splashing the wine high upon the wall paradou caught it and you he roared to his wife giving her the same name in the feminine and he aimed at her the deadly missile she expected it motionless with radiant eyes  but before it sped paradou was met by another adversary and the unconscious rivals stood confronted it was hard to say at that moment which appeared the more formidable in paradou the whole muddy and truculent depths of the halfman were stirred to frenzy the lust of destruction raged in him there was not a feature in his face but it talked murder balmile had dropped his cloak he shone out at once in his finery and stood to his full stature girt in mind and body all his resources all his temper perfectly in command in his face the light of battle neither spoke there was no blow nor threat of one it was war reduced to its last element the spiritual and the huge wineseller slowly lowered his weapon balmile was a noble he a commoner balmile exulted in an honourable cause paradou already perhaps began to be ashamed of his violence of a sudden at least the tortured brute turned and fled from the shop in the footsteps of his former victim to whose continued flight his reappearance added wings  so soon as balmile appeared between her husband and herself mariemadeleine transferred to him her eyes it might be her last moment and she fed upon that face reading there inimitable courage and illimitable valour to protect and when the momentary peril was gone by and the champion turned a little awkwardly towards her whom he had rescued it was to meet and quail before a gaze of admiration more distinct than words he bowed he stammered his words failed him he who had crossed the floor a moment ago like a young god to smite returned like one discomfited got somehow to his place by the table muffled himself again in his discarded cloak and for a last touch of the ridiculous seeking for anything to restore his countenance drank of the wine before him deep as a porter after a heavy lift it was little wonder if ballantrae reading the scene with malevolent eyes laughed out loud and brief and drank with raised glass to the champion of the fair  mariemadeleine stood in her old place within the counter she disdained the mocking laughter it fell on her ears but it did not reach her spirit for her the world of living persons was all resumed again into one pair as in the days of eden there was but the one end in life the one hope before her the one thing needful the one thing possibleto be his     chapter i  the prince   that same night there was in the city of avignon a young man in distress of mind now he sat now walked in a high apartment full of draughts and shadows a single candle made the darkness visible and the light scarce sufficed to show upon the wall where they had been recently and rudely nailed a few miniatures and a copper medal of the young mans head the same was being sold that year in london to admiring thousands the original was fair he had beautiful brown eyes a beautiful bright open face a little feminine a little hard a little weak still full of the light of youth but already beginning to be vulgarised a sordid bloom come upon it the lines coarsened with a touch of puffiness he was dressed as for a gala in peachcolour and silver his breast sparkled with stars and was bright with ribbons for he had held a levee in the afternoon and received a distinguished personage incognito now he sat with a bowed head now walked precipitately to and fro now went and gazed from the uncurtained window where the wind was still blowing and the lights winked in the darkness  the bells of avignon rose into song as he was gazing and the high notes and the deep tossed and drowned boomed suddenly near or were suddenly swallowed up in the current of the mistral tears sprang in the pale blue eyes the expression of his face was changed to that of a more active misery it seemed as if the voices of the bells reached and touched and pained him in a waste of vacancy where even pain was welcome outside in the night they continued to sound on swelling and fainting and the listener heard in his memory as it were their harmonies joybells clashing in a northern city and the acclamations of a multitude the cries of battle the gross voices of cannon the stridor of an animated life and then all died away and he stood face to face with himself in the waste of vacancy and a horror came upon his mind and a faintness on his brain such as seizes men upon the brink of cliffs  on the table by the side of the candle stood a tray of glasses a bottle and a silver bell he went thither swiftly then his hand lowered first above the bell then settled on the bottle slowly he filled a glass slowly drank it out and as a tide of animal warmth recomforted the recesses of his nature stood there smiling at himself he remembered he was young the funeral curtains rose and he saw his life shine and broaden and flow out majestically like a river sunward the smile still on his lips he lit a second candle and a third a fire stood ready built in a chimney he lit that also and the fircones and the gnarled olive billets were swift to break in flame and to crackle on the hearth and the room brightened and enlarged about him like his hopes to and fro to and fro he went his hands lightly clasped his breath deeply and pleasurably taken victory walked with him he marched to crowns and empires among shouting followers glory was his dress and presently again the shadows closed upon the solitary under the gilt of flame and candlelight the stone walls of the apartment showed down bare and cold behind the depicted triumph loomed up the actual failure defeat the long distress of the flight exile despair broken followers mourning faces empty pockets friends estranged the memory of his father rose in his mind he too estranged and defied despair sharpened into wrath there was one who had led armies in the field who had staked his life upon the family enterprise a man of action and experience of the open air the camp the court the councilroom and he was to accept direction from an old pompous gentleman in a home in italy and buzzed about by priests a pretty king if he had not a martial son to lean upon a king at all  there was a weaver of all people joined me at st ninians he was more of a man than my papa he thought i saw him lie doubled in his blood and a grenadier below himand he died for my papa all died for him or risked the dying and i lay for him all those months in the rain and skulked in heather like a fox and now he writes me his advice calls me carlucciome the man of the house the only king in that kings race he ground his teeth the only king in europe who else who has done and suffered except me who has lain and run and hidden with his faithful subjects like a second bruce not my accursed cousin louis of france at least the lewd effeminate traitor and filling the glass to the brim he drank a kings damnation ah if he had the power of louis what a king were here  the minutes followed each other into the past and still he persevered in this debilitating cycle of emotions still fed the fire of his excitement with driblets of rhine wine a boy at odds with life a boy with a spark of the heroic which he was now burning out and drowning down in futile reverie and solitary excess  from two rooms beyond the sudden sound of a raised voice attracted him  by     fables     fables     i  the persons of the tale   after the 32nd chapter of treasure island two of the puppets strolled out to have a pipe before business should begin again and met in an open place not far from the story  goodmorning capn said the first with a manowar salute and a beaming countenance  ah silver grunted the other youre in a bad way silver  now capn smollett remonstrated silver dooty is dooty as i knows and none better but were off dooty now and i cant see no call to keep up the morality business  youre a damned rogue my man said the captain  come come capn be just returned the other theres no call to be angry with me in earnest im ony a charater in a sea story i dont really exist  well i dont really exist either says the captain which seems to meet that  i wouldnt set no limits to what a virtuous charater might consider argument responded silver but im the villain of this tale i am and speaking as one seafaring man to another what i want to know is whats the odds  were you never taught your catechism said the captain dont you know theres such a thing as an author  such a thing as a author returned john derisively and who bettern me and the pint is if the author made you he made long john and he made hands and pew and george merrynot that george is up to much for hes little moren a name and he made flint what there is of him and he made this here mutiny you keep such a work about and he had tom redruth shot andwell if thats a author give me pew  dont you believe in a future state said smollett do you think theres nothing but the present storypaper  i dont rightly know for that said silver and i dont see what its got to do with it anyway what i know is this if there is sich a thing as a author im his favourite charater he does me fathoms bettern he does youfathoms he does and he likes doing me he keeps me on deck mostly all the time crutch and all and he leaves you measling in the hold where nobody cant see you nor wants to and you may lay to that if there is a author by thunder but hes on my side and you may lay to it  i see hes giving you a long rope said the captain but that cant change a mans convictions i know the author respects me i feel it in my bones when you and i had that talk at the blockhouse door who do you think he was for my man  and dont he respect me cried silver ah you should a heard me putting down my mutiny george merry and morgan and that lot no longer agon last chapter youd a heard something then youd a seen what the author thinks o me but come now do you consider yourself a virtuous charater clean through  god forbid said captain smollett solemnly i am a man that tries to do his duty and makes a mess of it as often as not im not a very popular man at home silver im afraid and the captain sighed  ah says silver then how about this sequel of yours are you to be capn smollett just the same as ever and not very popular at home says you and if so why its treasure island over again by thunder and ill be long john and pewll be pew and well have another mutiny as like as not or are you to be somebody else and if so why what the better are you and what the worse am i  why look here my man returned the captain i cant understand how this story comes about at all can i i cant see how you and i who dont exist should get to speaking here and smoke our pipes for all the world like reality very well then who am i to pipe up with my opinions i know the authors on the side of good he tells me so it runs out of his pen as he writes well thats all i need to know ill take my chance upon the rest  its a fact he seemed to be against george merry silver admitted musingly but george is little moren a name at the best of it he added brightening and to get into soundings for once what is this good i made a mutiny and i been a gentleman o fortune well but by all stories you aint no such saint im a man that keeps company very easy even by your own account you aint and to my certain knowledge youre a devil to haze which is which which is good and which bad ah you tell me that here we are in stays and you may lay to it  were none of us perfect replied the captain thats a fact of religion my man all i can say is i try to do my duty and if you try to do yours i cant compliment you on your success  and so you was the judge was you said silver derisively  i would be both judge and hangman for you my man and never turn a hair returned the captain but i get beyond that it maynt be sound theology but its common sense that what is good is useful tooor there and thereabout for i dont set up to be a thinker now where would a story go to if there were no virtuous characters  if you go to that replied silver where would a story begin if there wasnt no villains  well thats pretty much my thought said captain smollett the author has to get a story thats what he wants and to get a story and to have a man like the doctor say given a proper chance he has to put in men like you and hands but hes on the right side and you mind your eye youre not through this story yet theres trouble coming for you  whatll you bet asked john  much i care if there aint returned the captain im glad enough to be alexander smollett bad as he is and i thank my stars upon my knees that im not silver but theres the inkbottle opening to quarters  and indeed the author was just then beginning to write the words      chapter xxxiii     ii  the sinking ship   sir said the first lieutenant bursting into the captains cabin the ship is going down  very well mr spoker said the captain but that is no reason for going about halfshaved exercise your mind a moment mr spoker and you will see that to the philosophic eye there is nothing new in our position the ship if she is to go down at all may be said to have been going down since she was launched  she is settling fast said the first lieutenant as he returned from shaving  fast mr spoker asked the captain the expression is a strange one for time if you will think of it is only relative  sir said the lieutenant i think it is scarcely worth while to embark in such a discussion when we shall all be in davy joness locker in ten minutes  by parity of reasoning returned the captain gently it would never be worth while to begin any inquiry of importance the odds are always overwhelming that we must die before we shall have brought it to an end you have not considered mr spoker the situation of man said the captain smiling and shaking his head  i am much more engaged in considering the position of the ship said mr spoker  spoken like a good officer replied the captain laying his hand on the lieutenants shoulder  on deck they found the men had broken into the spiritroom and were fast getting drunk  my men said the captain there is no sense in this the ship is going down you will tell me in ten minutes well and what then to the philosophic eye there is nothing new in our position all our lives long we may have been about to break a bloodvessel or to be struck by lightning not merely in ten minutes but in ten seconds and that has not prevented us from eating dinner no nor from putting money in the savings bank i assure you with my hand on my heart i fail to comprehend your attitude  the men were already too far gone to pay much heed  this is a very painful sight mr spoker said the captain  and yet to the philosophic eye or whatever it is replied the first lieutenant they may be said to have been getting drunk since they came aboard  i do not know if you always follow my thought mr spoker returned the captain gently but let us proceed  in the powder magazine they found an old salt smoking his pipe  good god cried the captain what are you about  well sir said the old salt apologetically they told me as she were going down  and suppose she were said the captain to the philosophic eye there would be nothing new in our position life my old shipmate life at any moment and in any view is as dangerous as a sinking ship and yet it is mans handsome fashion to carry umbrellas to wear indiarubber overshoes to begin vast works and to conduct himself in every way as if he might hope to be eternal and for my own poor part i should despise the man who even on board a sinking ship should omit to take a pill or to wind up his watch that my friend would not be the human attitude  i beg pardon sir said mr spoker but what is precisely the difference between shaving in a sinking ship and smoking in a powder magazine  or doing anything at all in any conceivable circumstances cried the captain perfectly conclusive give me a cigar  two minutes afterwards the ship blew up with a glorious detonation     iii  the two matches   one day there was a traveller in the woods in california in the dry season when the trades were blowing strong he had ridden a long way and he was tired and hungry and dismounted from his horse to smoke a pipe but when he felt in his pocket he found but two matches he struck the first and it would not light  here is a pretty state of things said the traveller dying for a smoke only one match left and that certain to miss fire was there ever a creature so unfortunate and yet thought the traveller suppose i light this match and smoke my pipe and shake out the dottle here in the grassthe grass might catch fire for it is dry like tinder and while i snatch out the flames in front they might evade and run behind me and seize upon yon bush of poison oak before i could reach it that would have blazed up over the bush i see a pinetree hung with moss that too would fly in fire upon the instant to its topmost bough and the flame of that long torchhow would the tradewind take and brandish that through the inflammable forest i hear this dell roar in a moment with the joint voice of wind and fire i see myself gallop for my soul and the flying conflagration chase and outflank me through the hills i see this pleasant forest burn for days and the cattle roasted and the springs dried up and the farmer ruined and his children cast upon the world what a world hangs upon this moment  with that he struck the match and it missed fire  thank god said the traveller and put his pipe in his pocket     iv  the sick man and the fireman   there was once a sick man in a burning house to whom there entered a fireman  do not save me said the sick man save those who are strong  will you kindly tell me why inquired the fireman for he was a civil fellow  nothing could possibly be fairer said the sick man the strong should be preferred in all cases because they are of more service in the world  the fireman pondered a while for he was a man of some philosophy granted said he at last as a part of the roof fell in but for the sake of conversation what would you lay down as the proper service of the strong  nothing can possibly be easier returned the sick man the proper service of the strong is to help the weak  again the fireman reflected for there was nothing hasty about this excellent creature i could forgive you being sick he said at last as a portion of the wall fell out but i cannot bear your being such a fool and with that he heaved up his firemans axe for he was eminently just and clove the sick man to the bed     v  the devil and the innkeeper   once upon a time the devil stayed at an inn where no one knew him for they were people whose education had been neglected he was bent on mischief and for a time kept everybody by the ears but at last the innkeeper set a watch upon the devil and took him in the fact  the innkeeper got a ropes end  now im going to thrash you said the innkeeper  you have no right to be angry with me said the devil i am only the devil and it is my nature to do wrong  is that so asked the innkeeper  fact i assure you said the devil  you really cant help doing ill asked the innkeeper  not in the smallest said the devil it would be useless cruelty to thrash a thing like me  it would indeed said the innkeeper  and he made a noose and hanged the devil  there said the innkeeper     vi  the penitent   a man met a lad weeping what do you weep for he asked  i am weeping for my sins said the lad  you must have little to do said the man  the next day they met again once more the lad was weeping why do you weep now asked the man  i am weeping because i have nothing to eat said the lad  i thought it would come to that said the man     vii  the yellow paint   in a certain city there lived a physician who sold yellow paint this was of so singular a virtue that whoso was bedaubed with it from head to heel was set free from the dangers of life and the bondage of sin and the fear of death for ever so the physician said in his prospectus and so said all the citizens in the city and there was nothing more urgent in mens hearts than to be properly painted themselves and nothing they took more delight in than to see others painted there was in the same city a young man of a very good family but of a somewhat reckless life who had reached the age of manhood and would have nothing to say to the paint tomorrow was soon enough said he and when the morrow came he would still put it off so he might have continued to do until his death only he had a friend of about his own age and much of his own manners and this youth taking a walk in the public street with not one fleck of paint upon his body was suddenly run down by a watercart and cut off in the heyday of his nakedness this shook the other to the soul so that i never beheld a man more earnest to be painted and on the very same evening in the presence of all his family to appropriate music and himself weeping aloud he received three complete coats and a touch of varnish on the top the physician who was himself affected even to tears protested he had never done a job so thorough  some two months afterwards the young man was carried on a stretcher to the physicians house  what is the meaning of this he cried as soon as the door was opened i was to be set free from all the dangers of life and here have i been run down by that selfsame watercart and my leg is broken  dear me said the physician this is very sad but i perceive i must explain to you the action of my paint a broken bone is a mighty small affair at the worst of it and it belongs to a class of accident to which my paint is quite inapplicable sin my dear young friend sin is the sole calamity that a wise man should apprehend it is against sin that i have fitted you out and when you come to be tempted you will give me news of my paint  o said the young man i did not understand that and it seems rather disappointing but i have no doubt all is for the best and in the meanwhile i shall be obliged to you if you will set my leg  that is none of my business said the physician but if your bearers will carry you round the corner to the surgeons i feel sure he will afford relief  some three years later the young man came running to the physicians house in a great perturbation what is the meaning of this he cried here was i to be set free from the bondage of sin and i have just committed forgery arson and murder  dear me said the physician this is very serious off with your clothes at once and as soon as the young man had stripped he examined him from head to foot no he cried with great relief there is not a flake broken cheer up my young friend your paint is as good as new  good god cried the young man and what then can be the use of it  why said the physician i perceive i must explain to you the nature of the action of my paint it does not exactly prevent sin it extenuates instead the painful consequences it is not so much for this world as for the next it is not against life in short it is against death that i have fitted you out and when you come to die you will give me news of my paint  o cried the young man i had not understood that and it seems a little disappointing but there is no doubt all is for the best and in the meanwhile i shall be obliged if you will help me to undo the evil i have brought on innocent persons  that is none of my business said the physician but if you will go round the corner to the police office i feel sure it will afford you relief to give yourself up  six weeks later the physician was called to the town gaol  what is the meaning of this cried the young man here am i literally crusted with your paint and i have broken my leg and committed all the crimes in the calendar and must be hanged tomorrow and am in the meanwhile in a fear so extreme that i lack words to picture it  dear me said the physician this is really amazing well well perhaps if you had not been painted you would have been more frightened still     viii  the house of eld   so soon as the child began to speak the gyve was riveted and the boys and girls limped about their play like convicts doubtless it was more pitiable to see and more painful to bear in youth but even the grown folk besides being very unhandy on their feet were often sick with ulcers  about the time when jack was ten years old many strangers began to journey through that country these he beheld going lightly by on the long roads and the thing amazed him i wonder how it comes he asked that all these strangers are so quick afoot and we must drag about our fetter  my dear boy said his uncle the catechist do not complain about your fetter for it is the only thing that makes life worth living none are happy none are good none are respectable that are not gyved like us and i must tell you besides it is very dangerous talk if you grumble of your iron you will have no luck if you ever take it off you will be instantly smitten by a thunderbolt  are there no thunderbolts for these strangers asked jack  jupiter is longsuffering to the benighted returned the catechist  upon my word i could wish i had been less fortunate said jack for if i had been born benighted i might now be going free and it cannot be denied the iron is inconvenient and the ulcer hurts  ah cried his uncle do not envy the heathen theirs is a sad lot ah poor souls if they but knew the joys of being fettered poor souls my heart yearns for them but the truth is they are vile odious insolent illconditioned stinking brutes not truly humanfor what is a man without a fetterand you cannot be too particular not to touch or speak with them  after this talk the child would never pass one of the unfettered on the road but what he spat at him and called him names which was the practice of the children in that part  it chanced one day when he was fifteen he went into the woods and the ulcer pained him it was a fair day with a blue sky all the birds were singing but jack nursed his foot presently another song began it sounded like the singing of a person only far more gay at the same time there was a beating on the earth jack put aside the leaves and there was a lad of his own village leaping and dancing and singing to himself in a green dell and on the grass beside him lay the dancers iron  o cried jack you have your fetter off  for gods sake dont tell your uncle cried the lad  if you fear my uncle returned jack why do you not fear the thunderbolt  that is only an old wives tale said the other it is only told to children scores of us come here among the woods and dance for nights together and are none the worse  this put jack in a thousand new thoughts he was a grave lad he had no mind to dance himself he wore his fetter manfully and tended his ulcer without complaint but he loved the less to be deceived or to see others cheated he began to lie in wait for heathen travellers at covert parts of the road and in the dusk of the day so that he might speak with them unseen and these were greatly taken with their wayside questioner and told him things of weight the wearing of gyves they said was no command of jupiters it was the contrivance of a whitefaced thing a sorcerer that dwelt in that country in the wood of eld he was one like glaucus that could change his shape yet he could be always told for when he was crossed he gobbled like a turkey he had three lives but the third smiting would make an end of him indeed and with that his house of sorcery would vanish the gyves fall and the villagers take hands and dance like children  and in your country jack would ask  but at this the travellers with one accord would put him off until jack began to suppose there was no land entirely happy or if there were it must be one that kept its folk at home which was natural enough  but the case of the gyves weighed upon him the sight of the children limping stuck in his eyes the groans of such as dressed their ulcers haunted him and it came at last in his mind that he was born to free them  there was in that village a sword of heavenly forgery beaten upon vulcans anvil it was never used but in the temple and then the flat of it only and it hung on a nail by the catechists chimney early one night jack rose and took the sword and was gone out of the house and the village in the darkness  all night he walked at a venture and when day came he met strangers going to the fields then he asked after the wood of eld and the house of sorcery and one said north and one south until jack saw that they deceived him so then when he asked his way of any man he showed the bright sword naked and at that the gyve on the mans ankle rang and answered in his stead and the word was still straight on but the man when his gyve spoke spat and struck at jack and threw stones at him as he went away so that his head was broken  so he came to that wood and entered in and he was aware of a house in a low place where funguses grew and the trees met and the steaming of the marsh arose about it like a smoke it was a fine house and a very rambling some parts of it were ancient like the hills and some but of yesterday and none finished and all the ends of it were open so that you could go in from every side yet it was in good repair and all the chimneys smoked  jack went in through the gable and there was one room after another all bare but all furnished in part so that a man could dwell there and in each there was a fire burning where a man could warm himself and a table spread where he might eat but jack saw nowhere any living creature only the bodies of some stuffed  this is a hospitable house said jack but the ground must be quaggy underneath for at every step the building quakes  he had gone some time in the house when he began to be hungry then he looked at the food and at first he was afraid but he bared the sword and by the shining of the sword it seemed the food was honest so he took the courage to sit down and eat and he was refreshed in mind and body  this is strange thought he that in the house of sorcery there should be food so wholesome  as he was yet eating there came into that room the appearance of his uncle and jack was afraid because he had taken the sword but his uncle was never more kind and sat down to meat with him and praised him because he had taken the sword never had these two been more pleasantly together and jack was full of love to the man  it was very well done said his uncle to take the sword and come yourself into the house of eld a good thought and a brave deed but now you are satisfied and we may go home to dinner arm in arm  o dear no said jack i am not satisfied yet  how cried his uncle are you not warmed by the fire does not this food sustain you  i see the food to be wholesome said jack and still it is no proof that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg  now at this the appearance of his uncle gobbled like a turkey  jupiter cried jack is this the sorcerer  his hand held back and his heart failed him for the love he bore his uncle but he heaved up the sword and smote the appearance on the head and it cried out aloud with the voice of his uncle and fell to the ground and a little bloodless white thing fled from the room  the cry rang in jacks ears and his knees smote together and conscience cried upon him and yet he was strengthened and there woke in his bones the lust of that enchanters blood if the gyves are to fall said he i must go through with this and when i get home i shall find my uncle dancing  so he went on after the bloodless thing in the way he met the appearance of his father and his father was incensed and railed upon him and called to him upon his duty and bade him be home while there was yet time for you can still said he be home by sunset and then all will be forgiven  god knows said jack i fear your anger but yet your anger does not prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg  and at that the appearance of his father gobbled like a turkey  ah heaven cried jack the sorcerer again  the blood ran backward in his body and his joints rebelled against him for the love he bore his father but he heaved up the sword and plunged it in the heart of the appearance and the appearance cried out aloud with the voice of his father and fell to the ground and a little bloodless white thing fled from the room  the cry rang in jacks ears and his soul was darkened but now rage came to him i have done what i dare not think upon said he i will go to an end with it or perish and when i get home i pray god this may be a dream and i may find my father dancing  so he went on after the bloodless thing that had escaped and in the way he met the appearance of his mother and she wept what have you done she cried what is this that you have done o come home where you may be by bedtime ere you do more ill to me and mine for it is enough to smite my brother and your father  dear mother it is not these that i have smitten said jack it was but the enchanter in their shape and even if i had it would not prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg  and at this the appearance gobbled like a turkey  he never knew how he did that but he swung the sword on the one side and clove the appearance through the midst and it cried out aloud with the voice of his mother and fell to the ground and with the fall of it the house was gone from over jacks head and he stood alone in the woods and the gyve was loosened from his leg  well said he the enchanter is now dead and the fetter gone but the cries rang in his soul and the day was like night to him this has been a sore business said he let me get forth out of the wood and see the good that i have done to others  he thought to leave the fetter where it lay but when he turned to go his mind was otherwise so he stooped and put the gyve in his bosom and the rough iron galled him as he went and his bosom bled  now when he was forth of the wood upon the highway he met folk returning from the field and those he met had no fetter on the right leg but behold they had one upon the left jack asked them what it signified and they said that was the new wear for the old was found to be a superstition then he looked at them nearly and there was a new ulcer on the left ankle and the old one on the right was not yet healed  now may god forgive me cried jack i would i were well home  and when he was home there lay his uncle smitten on the head and his father pierced through the heart and his mother cloven through the midst and he sat in the lone house and wept beside the bodies  moral    old is the tree and the fruit good   very old and thick the wood   woodman is your courage stout   beware the root is wrapped about   your mothers heart your fathers bones   and like the mandrake comes with groans     ix  the four reformers   four reformers met under a bramblebush they were all agreed the world must be changed we must abolish property said one  we must abolish marriage said the second  we must abolish god said the third  i wish we could abolish work said the fourth  do not let us get beyond practical politics said the first the first thing is to reduce men to a common level  the first thing said the second is to give freedom to the sexes  the first thing said the third is to find out how to do it  the first step said the first is to abolish the bible  the first thing said the second is to abolish the laws  the first thing said the third is to abolish mankind     x  the man and his friend   a man quarrelled with his friend  i have been much deceived in you said the man  and the friend made a face at him and went away  a little after they both died and came together before the great white justice of the peace it began to look black for the friend but the man for a while had a clear character and was getting in good spirits  i find here some record of a quarrel said the justice looking in his notes which of you was in the wrong  he was said the man he spoke ill of me behind my back  did he so said the justice and pray how did he speak about your neighbours  o he had always a nasty tongue said the man  and you chose him for your friend cried the justice my good fellow we have no use here for fools  so the man was cast in the pit and the friend laughed out aloud in the dark and remained to be tried on other charges     xi  the reader   i never read such an impious book said the reader throwing it on the floor  you need not hurt me said the book you will only get less for me secondhand and i did not write myself  that is true said the reader my quarrel is with your author  ah well said the book you need not buy his rant  that is true said the reader but i thought him such a cheerful writer  i find him so said the book  you must be differently made from me said the reader  let me tell you a fable said the book there were two men wrecked upon a desert island one of them made believe he was at home the other admitted  o i know your kind of fable said the reader they both died  and so they did said the book no doubt of that and everybody else  that is true said the reader push it a little further for this once and when they were all dead  they were in gods hands the same as before said the book  not much to boast of by your account cried the reader  who is impious now said the book  and the reader put him on the fire    the coward crouches from the rod   and loathes the iron face of god     xii  the citizen and the traveller   look round you said the citizen this is the largest market in the world  o surely not said the traveller  well perhaps not the largest said the citizen but much the best  you are certainly wrong there said the traveller i can tell you  they buried the stranger at the dusk     xiii  the distinguished stranger   once upon a time there came to this earth a visitor from a neighbouring planet and he was met at the place of his descent by a great philosopher who was to show him everything  first of all they came through a wood and the stranger looked upon the trees whom have we here said he  these are only vegetables said the philosopher they are alive but not at all interesting  i dont know about that said the stranger they seem to have very good manners do they never speak  they lack the gift said the philosopher  yet i think i hear them sing said the other  that is only the wind among the leaves said the philosopher i will explain to you the theory of winds it is very interesting  well said the stranger i wish i knew what they are thinking  they cannot think said the philosopher  i dont know about that returned the stranger and then laying his hand upon a trunk i like these people said he  they are not people at all said the philosopher come along  next they came through a meadow where there were cows  these are very dirty people said the stranger  they are not people at all said the philosopher and he explained what a cow is in scientific words which i have forgotten  that is all one to me said the stranger but why do they never look up  because they are graminivorous said the philosopher and to live upon grass which is not highly nutritious requires so close an attention to business that they have no time to think or speak or look at the scenery or keep themselves clean  well said the stranger that is one way to live no doubt but i prefer the people with the green heads  next they came into a city and the streets were full of men and women  these are very odd people said the stranger  they are the people of the greatest nation in the world said the philosopher  are they indeed said the stranger they scarcely look so     xiv  the carthorses and the saddlehorse   two carthorses a gelding and a mare were brought to samoa and put in the same field with a saddlehorse to run free on the island they were rather afraid to go near him for they saw he was a saddlehorse and supposed he would not speak to them now the saddlehorse had never seen creatures so big these must be great chiefs thought he and he approached them civilly lady and gentleman said he i understand you are from the colonies i offer you my affectionate compliments and make you heartily welcome to the islands  the colonials looked at him askance and consulted with each other  who can he be said the gelding  he seems suspiciously civil said the mare  i do not think he can be much account said the gelding  depend upon it he is only a kanaka said the mare  then they turned to him  go to the devil said the gelding  i wonder at your impudence speaking to persons of our quality cried the mare  the saddlehorse went away by himself i was right said he they are great chiefs     xv  the tadpole and the frog   be ashamed of yourself said the frog when i was a tadpole i had no tail  just what i thought said the tadpole you never were a tadpole     xvi  something in it   the natives told him many tales in particular they warned him of the house of yellow reeds tied with black sinnet how any one who touched it became instantly the prey of akaänga and was handed on to him by miru the ruddy and hocussed with the kava of the dead and baked in the ovens and eaten by the eaters of the dead  there is nothing in it said the missionary  there was a bay upon that island a very fair bay to look upon but by the native saying it was death to bathe there there is nothing in that said the missionary and he came to the bay and went swimming presently an eddy took him and bore him towards the reef oho thought the missionary it seems there is something in it after all and he swam the harder but the eddy carried him away i do not care about this eddy said the missionary and even as he said it he was aware of a house raised on piles above the sea it was built of yellow reeds one reed joined with another and the whole bound with black sinnet a ladder led to the door and all about the house hung calabashes he had never seen such a house nor yet such calabashes and the eddy set for the ladder this is singular said the missionary but there can be nothing in it and he laid hold of the ladder and went up it was a fine house but there was no man there and when the missionary looked back he saw no island only the heaving of the sea it is strange about the island said the missionary but whos afraid my stories are the true ones and he laid hold of a calabash for he was one that loved curiosities now he had no sooner laid hand upon the calabash than that which he handled and that which he saw and stood on burst like a bubble and was gone and night closed upon him and the waters and the meshes of the net and he wallowed there like a fish  a body would think there was something in this said the missionary but if these tales are true i wonder what about my tales  now the flaming of akaängas torch drew near in the night and the misshapen hands groped in the meshes of the net and they took the missionary between the finger and the thumb and bore him dripping in the night and silence to the place of the ovens of miru and there was miru ruddy in the glow of the ovens and there sat her four daughters and made the kava of the dead and there sat the comers out of the islands of the living dripping and lamenting  this was a dread place to reach for any of the sons of men but of all who ever came there the missionary was the most concerned and to make things worse the person next him was a convert of his own  aha said the convert so you are here like your neighbours and how about all your stories  it seems said the missionary with bursting tears that there was nothing in them  by this the kava of the dead was ready and the daughters of miru began to intone in the old manner of singing gone are the green islands and the bright sea the sun and the moon and the forty million stars and life and love and hope henceforth is no more only to sit in the night and silence and see your friends devoured for life is a deceit and the bandage is taken from your eyes  now when the singing was done one of the daughters came with the bowl desire of that kava rose in the missionarys bosom he lusted for it like a swimmer for the land or a bridegroom for his bride and he reached out his hand and took the bowl and would have drunk and then he remembered and put it back  drink sang the daughter of miru there is no kava like the kava of the dead and to drink of it once is the reward of living  i thank you it smells excellent said the missionary but i am a blueribbon man myself and though i am aware there is a difference of opinion even in our own confession i have always held kava to be excluded  what cried the convert are you going to respect a taboo at a time like this and you were always so opposed to taboos when you were alive  to other peoples said the missionary never to my own  but yours have all proved wrong said the convert  it looks like it said the missionary and i cant help that no reason why i should break my word  i never heard the like of this cried the daughter of miru pray what do you expect to gain  that is not the point said the missionary i took this pledge for others i am not going to break it for myself  the daughter of miru was puzzled she came and told her mother and miru was vexed and they went and told akaänga  i dont know what to do about this said akaänga and he came and reasoned with the missionary  but there is such a thing as right and wrong said the missionary and your ovens cannot alter that  give the kava to the rest said akaänga to the daughters of miru i must get rid of this sealawyer instantly or worse will come of it  the next moment the missionary came up in the midst of the sea and there before him were the palmtrees of the island he swam to the shore gladly and landed much matter of thought was in that missionarys mind  i seem to have been misinformed upon some points said he perhaps there is not much in it as i supposed but there is something in it after all let me be glad of that  and he rang the bell for service    moral    the sticks break the stones crumble   the eternal altars tilt and tumble   sanctions and tales dislimn like mist   about the amazed evangelist   he stands unshook from age to youth   upon one pinpoint of the truth     xvii  faith halffaith and no faith at all   in the ancient days there went three men upon pilgrimage one was a priest and one was a virtuous person and the third was an old rover with his axe  as they went the priest spoke about the grounds of faith  we find the proofs of our religion in the works of nature said he and beat his breast  that is true said the virtuous person  the peacock has a scrannel voice said the priest as has been laid down always in our books how cheering he cried in a voice like one that wept how comforting  i require no such proofs said the virtuous person  then you have no reasonable faith said the priest  great is the right and shall prevail cried the virtuous person there is loyalty in my soul be sure there is loyalty in the mind of odin  these are but playings upon words returned the priest a sackful of such trash is nothing to the peacock  just then they passed a country farm where there was a peacock seated on a rail and the bird opened its mouth and sang with the voice of a nightingale  where are you now asked the virtuous person and yet this shakes not me great is the truth and shall prevail  the devil fly away with that peacock said the priest and he was downcast for a mile or two  but presently they came to a shrine where a fakeer performed miracles  ah said the priest here are the true grounds of faith the peacock was but an adminicle this is the base of our religion and he beat upon his breast and groaned like one with colic  now to me said the virtuous person all this is as little to the purpose as the peacock i believe because i see the right is great and must prevail and this fakeer might carry on with his conjuring tricks till doomsday and it would not play bluff upon a man like me  now at this the fakeer was so much incensed that his hand trembled and lo in the midst of a miracle the cards fell from up his sleeve  where are you now asked the virtuous person and yet it shakes not me  the devil fly away with the fakeer cried the priest i really do not see the good of going on with this pilgrimage  cheer up cried the virtuous person great is the right and shall prevail  if you are quite sure it will prevail says the priest  i pledge my word for that said the virtuous person  so the other began to go on again with a better heart  at last one came running and told them all was lost that the powers of darkness had besieged the heavenly mansions that odin was to die and evil triumph  i have been grossly deceived cried the virtuous person  all is lost now said the priest  i wonder if it is too late to make it up with the devil said the virtuous person  o i hope not said the priest and at any rate we can but trybut what are you doing with your axe says he to the rover  i am off to die with odin said the rover     xviii  the touchstone   the king was a man that stood well before the world his smile was sweet as clover but his soul withinsides was as little as a pea he had two sons and the younger son was a boy after his heart but the elder was one whom he feared it befell one morning that the drum sounded in the dun before it was yet day and the king rode with his two sons and a brave array behind them they rode two hours and came to the foot of a brown mountain that was very steep  where do we ride said the elder son  across this brown mountain said the king and smiled to himself  my father knows what he is doing said the younger son  and they rode two hours more and came to the sides of a black river that was wondrous deep  and where do we ride asked the elder son  over this black river said the king and smiled to himself  my father knows what he is doing said the younger son  and they rode all that day and about the time of the sunsetting came to the side of a lake where was a great dun  it is here we ride said the king to a kings house and a priests and a house where you will learn much  at the gates of the dun the king who was a priest met them and he was a grave man and beside him stood his daughter and she was as fair as the morn and one that smiled and looked down  these are my two sons said the first king  and here is my daughter said the king who was a priest  she is a wonderful fine maid said the first king and i like her manner of smiling  they are wonderful wellgrown lads said the second and i like their gravity  and then the two kings looked at each other and said the thing may come about  and in the meanwhile the two lads looked upon the maid and the one grew pale and the other red and the maid looked upon the ground smiling  here is the maid that i shall marry said the elder for i think she smiled upon me  but the younger plucked his father by the sleeve father said he a word in your ear if i find favour in your sight might not i wed this maid for i think she smiles upon me  a word in yours said the king his father waiting is good hunting and when the teeth are shut the tongue is at home  now they were come into the dun and feasted and this was a great house so that the lads were astonished and the king that was a priest sat at the end of the board and was silent so that the lads were filled with reverence and the maid served them smiling with downcast eyes so that their hearts were enlarged  before it was day the elder son arose and he found the maid at her weaving for she was a diligent girl maid quoth he i would fain marry you  you must speak with my father said she and she looked upon the ground smiling and became like the rose  her heart is with me said the elder son and he went down to the lake and sang  a little while after came the younger son maid quoth he if our fathers were agreed i would like well to marry you  you can speak to my father said she and looked upon the ground and smiled and grew like the rose  she is a dutiful daughter said the younger son she will make an obedient wife and then he thought what shall i do and he remembered the king her father was a priest so he went into the temple and sacrificed a weasel and a hare  presently the news got about and the two lads and the first king were called into the presence of the king who was a priest where he sat upon the high seat  little i reck of gear said the king who was a priest and little of power for we live here among the shadow of things and the heart is sick of seeing them and we stay here in the wind like raiment drying and the heart is weary of the wind but one thing i love and that is truth and for one thing will i give my daughter and that is the trial stone for in the light of that stone the seeming goes and the being shows and all things besides are worthless therefore lads if ye would wed my daughter out foot and bring me the stone of touch for that is the price of her  a word in your ear said the younger son to his father i think we do very well without this stone  a word in yours said the father i am of your way of thinking but when the teeth are shut the tongue is at home and he smiled to the king that was a priest  but the elder son got to his feet and called the king that was a priest by the name of father for whether i marry the maid or no i will call you by that word for the love of your wisdom and even now i will ride forth and search the world for the stone of touch so he said farewell and rode into the world  i think i will go too said the younger son if i can have your leave for my heart goes out to the maid  you will ride home with me said his father  so they rode home and when they came to the dun the king had his son into his treasury here said he is the touchstone which shows truth for there is no truth but plain truth and if you will look in this you will see yourself as you are  and the younger son looked in it and saw his face as it were the face of a beardless youth and he was well enough pleased for the thing was a piece of a mirror  here is no such great thing to make a work about said he but if it will get me the maid i shall never complain but what a fool is my brother to ride into the world and the thing all the while at home  so they rode back to the other dun and showed the mirror to the king that was a priest and when he had looked in it and seen himself like a king and his house like a kings house and all things like themselves he cried out and blessed god for now i know said he there is no truth but the plain truth and i am a king indeed although my heart misgave me and he pulled down his temple and built a new one and then the younger son was married to the maid  in the meantime the elder son rode into the world to find the touchstone of the trial of truth and whenever he came to a place of habitation he would ask the men if they had heard of it and in every place the men answered not only have we heard of it but we alone of all men possess the thing itself and it hangs in the side of our chimney to this day then would the elder son be glad and beg for a sight of it and sometimes it would be a piece of mirror that showed the seeming of things and then he would say this can never be for there should be more than seeming and sometimes it would be a lump of coal which showed nothing and then he would say this can never be for at least there is the seeming and sometimes it would be a touchstone indeed beautiful in hue adorned with polishing the light inhabiting its sides and when he found this he would beg the thing and the persons of that place would give it him for all men were very generous of that gift so that at the last he had his wallet full of them and they chinked together when he rode and when he halted by the side of the way he would take them out and try them till his head turned like the sails upon a windmill  a murrain upon this business said the elder son for i perceive no end to it here i have the red and here the blue and the green and to me they seem all excellent and yet shame each other a murrain on the trade if it were not for the king that is a priest and whom i have called my father and if it were not for the fair maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart enlarge i would even tumble them all into the salt sea and go home and be a king like other folk  but he was like the hunter that has seen a stag upon a mountain so that the night may fall and the fire be kindled and the lights shine in his house but desire of that stag is single in his bosom  now after many years the elder son came upon the sides of the salt sea and it was night and a savage place and the clamour of the sea was loud there he was aware of a house and a man sat there by the light of a candle for he had no fire now the elder son came in to him and the man gave him water to drink for he had no bread and wagged his head when spoken to for he had no words  have you the touchstone of truth asked the elder son and when the man had wagged his head i might have known that cried the elder son i have here a wallet full of them and with that he laughed although his heart was weary  and with that the man laughed too and with the fuff of his laughter the candle went out  sleep said the man for now i think you have come far enough and your quest is ended and my candle is out  now when the morning came the man gave him a clear pebble in his hand and it had no beauty and no colour and the elder son looked upon it scornfully and shook his head and he went away for it seemed a small affair to him  all that day he rode and his mind was quiet and the desire of the chase allayed how if this poor pebble be the touchstone after all said he and he got down from his horse and emptied forth his wallet by the side of the way now in the light of each other all the touchstones lost their hue and fire and withered like stars at morning but in the light of the pebble their beauty remained only the pebble was the most bright and the elder son smote upon his brow how if this be the truth he cried that all are a little true and he took the pebble and turned its light upon the heavens and they deepened about him like the pit and he turned it on the hills and the hills were cold and rugged but life ran in their sides so that his own life bounded and he turned it on the dust and he beheld the dust with joy and terror and he turned it on himself and knelt down and prayed  now thanks be to god said the elder son i have found the touchstone and now i may turn my reins and ride home to the king and to the maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart enlarge  now when he came to the dun he saw children playing by the gate where the king had met him in the old days and this stayed his pleasure for he thought in his heart it is here my children should be playing and when he came into the hall there was his brother on the high seat and the maid beside him and at that his anger rose for he thought in his heart it is i that should be sitting there and the maid beside me  who are you said his brother and what make you in the dun  i am your elder brother he replied and i am come to marry the maid for i have brought the touchstone of truth  then the younger brother laughed aloud why said he i found the touchstone years ago and married the maid and there are our children playing at the gate  now at this the elder brother grew as grey as the dawn i pray you have dealt justly said he for i perceive my life is lost  justly quoth the younger brother it becomes you ill that are a restless man and a runagate to doubt my justice or the king my fathers that are sedentary folk and known in the land  nay said the elder brother you have all else have patience also and suffer me to say the world is full of touchstones and it appears not easily which is true  i have no shame of mine said the younger brother there it is and look in it  so the elder brother looked in the mirror and he was sore amazed for he was an old man and his hair was white upon his head and he sat down in the hall and wept aloud  now said the younger brother see what a fools part you have played that ran over all the world to seek what was lying in our fathers treasury and came back an old carle for the dogs to bark at and without chick or child and i that was dutiful and wise sit here crowned with virtues and pleasures and happy in the light of my hearth  methinks you have a cruel tongue said the elder brother and he pulled out the clear pebble and turned its light on his brother and behold the man was lying his soul was shrunk into the smallness of a pea and his heart was a bag of little fears like scorpions and love was dead in his bosom and at that the elder brother cried out aloud and turned the light of the pebble on the maid and lo she was but a mask of a woman and withinsides she was quite dead and she smiled as a clock ticks and knew not wherefore  o well said the elder brother i perceive there is both good and bad so fare ye all as well as ye may in the dun but i will go forth into the world with my pebble in my pocket     xix  the poor thing   there was a man in the islands who fished for his bare bellyful and took his life in his hands to go forth upon the sea between four planks but though he had much ado he was merry of heart and the gulls heard him laugh when the spray met him and though he had little lore he was sound of spirit and when the fish came to his hook in the midwaters he blessed god without weighing he was bitter poor in goods and bitter ugly of countenance and he had no wife  it fell in the time of the fishing that the man awoke in his house about the midst of the afternoon the fire burned in the midst and the smoke went up and the sun came down by the chimney and the man was aware of the likeness of one that warmed his hands at the red peats  i greet you said the man in the name of god  i greet you said he that warmed his hands but not in the name of god for i am none of his nor in the name of hell for i am not of hell for i am but a bloodless thing less than wind and lighter than a sound and the wind goes through me like a net and i am broken by a sound and shaken by the cold  be plain with me said the man and tell me your name and of your nature  my name quoth the other is not yet named and my nature not yet sure for i am part of a man and i was a part of your fathers and went out to fish and fight with them in the ancient days but now is my turn not yet come and i wait until you have a wife and then shall i be in your son and a brave part of him rejoicing manfully to launch the boat into the surf skilful to direct the helm and a man of might where the ring closes and the blows are going  this is a marvellous thing to hear said the man and if you are indeed to be my son i fear it will go ill with you for i am bitter poor in goods and bitter ugly in face and i shall never get me a wife if i live to the age of eagles  all this have i come to remedy my father said the poor thing for we must go this night to the little isle of sheep where our fathers lie in the deadcairn and tomorrow to the earls hall and there shall you find a wife by my providing  so the man rose and put forth his boat at the time of the sunsetting and the poor thing sat in the prow and the spray blew through his bones like snow and the wind whistled in his teeth and the boat dipped not with the weight of him  i am fearful to see you my son said the man for methinks you are no thing of god  it is only the wind that whistles in my teeth said the poor thing and there is no life in me to keep it out  so they came to the little isle of sheep where the surf burst all about it in the midst of the sea and it was all green with bracken and all wet with dew and the moon enlightened it they ran the boat into a cove and set foot to land and the man came heavily behind among the rocks in the deepness of the bracken but the poor thing went before him like a smoke in the light of the moon so they came to the deadcairn and they laid their ears to the stones and the dead complained withinsides like a swarm of bees time was that marrow was in our bones and strength in our sinews and the thoughts of our head were clothed upon with acts and the words of men but now are we broken in sunder and the bonds of our bones are loosed and our thoughts lie in the dust  then said the poor thing charge them that they give you the virtue they withheld  and the man said bones of my fathers greeting for i am sprung of your loins and now behold i break open the piled stones of your cairn and i let in the noon between your ribs count it well done for it was to be and give me what i come seeking in the name of blood and in the name of god  and the spirits of the dead stirred in the cairn like ants and they spoke you have broken the roof of our cairn and let in the noon between our ribs and you have the strength of the stillliving but what virtue have we what power or what jewel here in the dust with us that any living man should covet or receive it for we are less than nothing but we tell you one thing speaking with many voices like bees that the way is plain before all like the grooves of launching so forth into life and fear not for so did we all in the ancient ages and their voices passed away like an eddy in a river  now said the poor thing they have told you a lesson but make them give you a gift stoop your hand among the bones without drawback and you shall find their treasure  so the man stooped his hand and the dead laid hold upon it many and faint like ants but he shook them off and behold what he brought up in his hand was the shoe of a horse and it was rusty  it is a thing of no price quoth the man for it is rusty  we shall see that said the poor thing for in my thought it is a good thing to do what our fathers did and to keep what they kept without question and in my thought one thing is as good as another in this world and a shoe of a horse will do  now they got into their boat with the horseshoe and when the dawn was come they were aware of the smoke of the earls town and the bells of the kirk that beat so they set foot to shore and the man went up to the market among the fishers over against the palace and the kirk and he was bitter poor and bitter ugly and he had never a fish to sell but only a shoe of a horse in his creel and it rusty  now said the poor thing do so and so and you shall find a wife and i a mother  it befell that the earls daughter came forth to go into the kirk upon her prayers and when she saw the poor man stand in the market with only the shoe of a horse and it rusty it came in her mind it should be a thing of price  what is that quoth she  it is a shoe of a horse said the man  and what is the use of it quoth the earls daughter  it is for no use said the man  i may not believe that said she else why should you carry it  i do so said he because it was so my fathers did in the ancient ages and i have neither a better reason nor a worse  now the earls daughter could not find it in her mind to believe him come quoth she sell me this for i am sure it is a thing of price  nay said the man the thing is not for sale  what cried the earls daughter then what make you here in the towns market with the thing in your creel and nought beside  i sit here says the man to get me a wife  there is no sense in any of these answers thought the earls daughter and i could find it in my heart to weep  by came the earl upon that and she called him and told him all and when he had heard he was of his daughters mind that this should be a thing of virtue and charged the man to set a price upon the thing or else be hanged upon the gallows and that was near at hand so that the man could see it  the way of life is straight like the grooves of launching quoth the man and if i am to be hanged let me be hanged  why cried the earl will you set your neck against a shoe of a horse and it rusty  in my thought said the man one thing is as good as another in this world and the shoe of a horse will do  this can never be thought the earl and he stood and looked upon the man and bit his beard  and the man looked up at him and smiled it was so my fathers did in the ancient ages quoth he to the earl and i have neither a better reason nor a worse  there is no sense in any of this thought the earl and i must be growing old so he had his daughter on one side and says he many suitors have you denied my child but here is a very strange matter that a man should cling so to a shoe of a horse and it rusty and that he should offer it like a thing on sale and yet not sell it and that he should sit there seeking a wife if i come not to the bottom of this thing i shall have no more pleasure in bread and i can see no way but either i should hang or you should marry him  by my troth but he is bitter ugly said the earls daughter how if the gallows be so near at hand  it was not so said the earl that my fathers did in the ancient ages i am like the man and can give you neither a better reason nor a worse but do you prithee speak with him again  so the earls daughter spoke to the man if you were not so bitter ugly quoth she my father the earl would have us marry  bitter ugly am i said the man and you as fair as may bitter ugly i am and what of that it was so my fathers  in the name of god said the earls daughter let your fathers be  if i had done that said the man you had never been chaffering with me here in the market nor your father the earl watching with the end of his eye  but come quoth the earls daughter this is a very strange thing that you would have me wed for a shoe of a horse and it rusty  in my thought quoth the man one thing is as good  o spare me that said the earls daughter and tell me why i should marry  listen and look said the man  now the wind blew through the poor thing like an infant crying so that her heart was melted and her eyes were unsealed and she was aware of the thing as it were a babe unmothered and she took it to her arms and it melted in her arms like the air  come said the man behold a vision of our children the busy hearth and the white heads and let that suffice for it is all god offers  i have no delight in it said she but with that she sighed  the ways of life are straight like the grooves of launching said the man and he took her by the hand  and what shall we do with the horseshoe quoth she  i will give it to your father said the man and he can make a kirk and a mill of it for me  it came to pass in time that the poor thing was born but memory of these matters slept with him and he knew not that which he had done but he was a part of the eldest son rejoicing manfully to launch the boat into the surf skilful to direct the helm and a man of might where the ring closes and the blows are going     xx  the song of the morrow   the king of duntrine had a daughter when he was old and she was the fairest kings daughter between two seas her hair was like spun gold and her eyes like pools in a river and the king gave her a castle upon the sea beach with a terrace and a court of the hewn stone and four towers at the four corners here she dwelt and grew up and had no care for the morrow and no power upon the hour after the manner of simple men  it befell that she walked one day by the beach of the sea when it was autumn and the wind blew from the place of rains and upon the one hand of her the sea beat and upon the other the dead leaves ran this was the loneliest beach between two seas and strange things had been done there in the ancient ages now the kings daughter was aware of a crone that sat upon the beach the seafoam ran to her feet and the dead leaves swarmed about her back and the rags blew about her face in the blowing of the wind  now said the kings daughter and she named a holy name this is the most unhappy old crone between two seas  daughter of a king said the crone you dwell in a stone house and your hair is like the gold but what is your profit life is not long nor lives strong and you live after the way of simple men and have no thought for the morrow and no power upon the hour  thought for the morrow that i have said the kings daughter but power upon the hour that have i not and she mused with herself  then the crone smote her lean hands one within the other and laughed like a seagull home cried she o daughter of a king home to your stone house for the longing is come upon you now nor can you live any more after the manner of simple men home and toil and suffer till the gift come that will make you bare and till the man come that will bring you care  the kings daughter made no more ado but she turned about and went home to her house in silence and when she was come into her chamber she called for her nurse  nurse said the kings daughter thought is come upon me for the morrow so that i can live no more after the manner of simple men tell me what i must do that i may have power upon the hour  then the nurse moaned like a snow wind alas said she that this thing should be but the thought is gone into your marrow nor is there any cure against the thought be it so then even as you will though power is less than weakness power shall you have and though the thought is colder than winter yet shall you think it to an end  so the kings daughter sat in her vaulted chamber in the masoned house and she thought upon the thought nine years she sat and the sea beat upon the terrace and the gulls cried about the turrets and wind crooned in the chimneys of the house nine years she came not abroad nor tasted the clean air neither saw gods sky nine years she sat and looked neither to the right nor to the left nor heard speech of any one but thought upon the thought of the morrow and her nurse fed her in silence and she took of the food with her left hand and ate it without grace  now when the nine years were out it fell dusk in the autumn and there came a sound in the wind like a sound of piping at that the nurse lifted up her finger in the vaulted house  i hear a sound in the wind said she that is like the sound of piping  it is but a little sound said the kings daughter but yet it is sound enough for me  so they went down in the dusk to the doors of the house and along the beach of the sea and the waves beat upon the one hand and upon the other the dead leaves ran and the clouds raced in the sky and the gulls flew widdershins and when they came to that part of the beach where strange things had been done in the ancient ages lo there was the crone and she was dancing widdershins  what makes you dance widdershins old crone said the kings daughter here upon the bleak beach between the waves and the dead leaves  i hear a sound in the wind that is like a sound of piping quoth she and it is for that that i dance widdershins for the gift comes that will make you bare and the man comes that must bring you care but for me the morrow is come that i have thought upon and the hour of my power  how comes it crone said the kings daughter that you waver like a rag and pale like a dead leaf before my eyes  because the morrow has come that i have thought upon and the hour of my power said the crone and she fell on the beach and lo she was but stalks of the sea tangle and dust of the sea sand and the sandlice hopped upon the place of her  this is the strangest thing that befell between two seas said the kings daughter of duntrine  but the nurse broke out and moaned like an autumn gale i am weary of the wind quoth she and she bewailed her day  the kings daughter was aware of a man upon the beach he went hooded so that none might perceive his face and a pipe was underneath his arm the sound of his pipe was like singing wasps and like the wind that sings in windlestraw and it took hold upon mens ears like the crying of gulls  are you the comer quoth the kings daughter of duntrine  i am the comer said he and these are the pipes that a man may hear and i have power upon the hour and this is the song of the morrow and he piped the song of the morrow and it was as long as years and the nurse wept out aloud at the hearing of it  this is true said the kings daughter that you pipe the song of the morrow but that ye have power upon the hour how may i know that show me a marvel here upon the beach between the waves and the dead leaves  and the man said upon whom  here is my nurse quoth the kings daughter she is weary of the wind show me a good marvel upon her  and lo the nurse fell upon the beach as it were two handfuls of dead leaves and the wind whirled them widdershins and the sandlice hopped between  it is true said the kings daughter of duntrine you are the comer and you have power upon the hour come with me to my stone house  so they went by the sea margin and the man piped the song of the morrow and the leaves followed behind them as they went then they sat down together and the sea beat on the terrace and the gulls cried about the towers and the wind crooned in the chimneys of the house nine years they sat and every year when it fell autumn the man said this is the hour and i have power in it and the daughter of the king said nay but pipe me the song of the morrow and he piped it and it was long like years  now when the nine years were gone the kings daughter of duntrine got her to her feet like one that remembers and she looked about her in the masoned house and all her servants were gone only the man that piped sat upon the terrace with the hood upon his face and as he piped the leaves ran about the terrace and the sea beat along the wall then she cried to him with a great voice this is the hour and let me see the power in it and with that the wind blew off the hood from the mans face and lo there was no man there only the clothes and the hood and the pipes tumbled one upon another in a corner of the terrace and the dead leaves ran over them  and the kings daughter of duntrine got her to that part of the beach where strange things had been done in the ancient ages and there she sat her down the seafoam ran to her feet and the dead leaves swarmed about her back and the veil blew about her face in the blowing of the wind and when she lifted up her eyes there was the daughter of a king come walking on the beach her hair was like the spun gold and her eyes like pools in a river and she had no thought for the morrow and no power upon the hour after the manner of simple men     end of vol
